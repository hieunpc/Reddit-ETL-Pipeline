I’d love to start a casual weekly call where we can talk data engineering, swap stories, and learn from each other.\n\nOver time, if there’s interest, this could turn into things like a textbook or whitepaper club, light presentations, or deeper dives into topics people care about. Totally flexible.\n\n**What you’d get out of it:**\n\n* Hearing how other people think about DE problems\n* Learning stuff that doesn’t always come up in day-to-day work\n* Getting exposure to different career paths and ways of working\n* Practical ideas you can actually use\n\n**Some topics I’m especially interested in:**\n\n* Performance and scaling\n* Systems thinking\n* Data platforms and infrastructure\n* FinOps / cost awareness\n* Reliability, observability, and ops\n* Architecture tradeoffs (build vs buy, etc.)\n* How data stacks evolve as companies grow\n\nThis is mainly for early-to-mid career folks, but anyone curious is welcome. If this sounds interesting, reach out and we’ll see what happens.\n\n  \n",

I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.\n\nUnfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.\n\nI was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources.  \n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\n\n\n",

If a business user came back with a claim that our reports were inaccurate due to comparisons with other sources, we would potentially spend hours trying to track the lineage of the data and compare any transformations/logic applied to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies happen.\n\nI've been building a tool on the side that could help mitigate this by auto-ingesting metadata from different database and BI sources, and tracking lineage and allowing a better way to view everything at a high-level.\n\nBut as I was building it, I realized that it was similar to a lightweight version of a Data Catalog. That got me wondering why more organizations don't use a Data Catalog to keep their data assets organized and tie in the business definitions to those assets in an attempt to create a source of truth. I have actually never worked within a data team that had a formatlized data catalog; we would just do everything including data dictionaries and business glossaries in excel sheets if there was a strong business request, but obviously those would quickly become stale.\n\n**What's been your experience with Data Catalog? If your organization doesn't use one, then why not (apart from the typically high cost)?**\n\nMy guess is the maintenance factor as it could be a nightmare maintaining updated business context to changing metadata especially in orgs without a specialized data governance steward or similar. I also don't see alot of business users using it if the software isn't intuitive, and general tool fatigue.\n",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI was working on a pure C project and I wanted to add lightweight C library for parquet file reading and writing support. Turns out Apache Arrow implementation uses wrappers for C++ and is quite heavy. So I created a minimal-dependency pure C library on my own (assisted with Claude Code).\n\nThe library is quite comprehensive and the performance are actually really good notably thanks to SIMD implementation. Build was tested on linux (amd), macOS (arm) and windows.\n\nI though that maybe some of my fellow data engineering redditors might be interested in the library although it is quite niche project.\n\nSo if anyone is interested check the Gituhub repo : [https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet](https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet)\n\nI look forwarding your feedback for features suggestions, integration questions and code critics 🙂\n\nHave a nice day!

Although I enjoy the field, I've been studying and reflecting a lot about migrating to Data Engineering, mainly because I feel it connects much more with computer science, which is my undergraduate course, and with programming in general.\n\nThe problem is that I'm full of doubts about whether I'm going down the right path. At times, this has generated a lot of anxiety for me—to the point of spending sleepless nights wondering if I'm making the wrong choices or getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe company where I'm interning offers access to Google Cloud Skills Boost, and I'm taking advantage of it to study GCP (BigQuery, pipelines, cloud concepts, etc.). Still, I keep wondering:\nAm I doing the right thing by going straight to the cloud and tools, or should I consolidate more fundamentals first?\nIs it normal for this transition to start out \"confusing\" like this?\n\nI would also really appreciate recommendations for study materials (books, courses, learning paths, practical projects) or even tips from people who already work as Data Engineers. Honestly, I'm a little lost — that's the reality. I identified quite a bit with Data Engineering precisely because it seems to deal much more with programming, architecture, and pipelines, compared to the more analytical side.\n\n\nFor context, today I have contact/knowledge with:\n\n• Python\n\n• SQL\n\n• R\n\n• Databricks (creating views to feed BI)\n\n• A little bit of Spark\n\n• pandas\n\nI would really like to hear the experience of those who have already gone through this migration from Data Analytics to Data Engineering, or those who started directly in the area.\n\nWhat would you do differently looking back?\n\n\nThank you in advance",

        "author": "wei5924",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,\n\nI am building a databricks notebook that joins roughly 6 tables into a main table. Some joins require some of the main table, whilst other joins will use the whole main table. Each join table has a few keys.\n\nMy question is what is the best architecture to perform the join without having an out of memory / stack overflow error?\n\n  \nCurrently I have written a linear script which sequentially goes through each table and does the join. This is slow and confusing to look at. As such other developers cannot make sense of the code (despite me adding comments) and im the main point of contact.\n\n\n\nSolutions tried:\n\n* I had tried to write a function that performs multiple joins using a while loop. However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error. Sometimes i get a driver error and the whole notebook fails to continue to run.\n* I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted. As such we had to roll back to the linear way i wrote before.\n* I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact.\n* Caching after some joins but problem persists.\n\n  \n\n\nOther information:\n\n* Small tables - row count roughly 50-100\n* main table - as of now row count roughly 50k\n* join type - left join on main table \n* All tables are already cleansed and are delta tables \n* Technologies: databricks, pyspark, ADF, ADLS\n\n\n\nSide question: I used to be a software engineer and now moved to being a data engineer. Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without? in terms of time complexity and clean code writing? My assumption is the former but after a few months of writing pyspark code i believe the correct answer is the latter? Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?\n\n",

        "content": "Hi everyone! I was recently fortunate enough to land a Data Engineering internship at Meta this summer and wanted to ask for advice on how best to prepare.\n\nI’m currently a junior in undergrad with a background primarily in software engineering and ML-oriented work. Through research and projects, I’ve worked on automating ML preprocessing pipelines, data cleaning, and generating structured datasets (e.g., CSV outputs), so I have some exposure to data workflows. That said, I know production-scale data engineering is a very different challenge, and I’d like to be intentional about my preparation.\n\nFrom what I’ve read, Meta’s approach to data engineering is fairly unique compared to many other companies (heavy SQL usage, large-scale analytics), and a lot of internal tooling. Right now, I’m working through the dataexpert .io free bootcamp, which has been helpful, but I’m hoping to supplement it with additional resources or projects that more closely resemble the work I’ll be doing on the job.\n\nIdeally, I’d like to build a realistic end-to-end project, something along the lines of:\n\n* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n* Extracting data from multiple sources\n* Building a DAG-based pipeline\n* Surfacing insights through a dashboard\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. For those who’ve done Data Engineering at Meta (or similar companies), what skills mattered most day-to-day?\n2. Are there any tools, paradigms, or core concepts you’d recommend focusing on ahead of time (especially knowing Meta uses a largely internal stack)?\n3. On the analytical side, what’s the best way to build intuition, should I try setting up my own data warehouse, or focus more on analysis and dashboards using public datasets?\n4. Based on what I described, do you have any project ideas or recommendations that would be especially good prep?\n\nFor reference I am not sure which team I am yet and I have roughly 5 months to prep (starts in May)",

Note, I've spoken to my colleagues and they agree our workload definitly exceeds what the norm is in other companies, rather than this being a skill issue. I’ve been offered a six-month contract in a familiar area that is data related but significantly less stress and a role I have done before. I would earn my annual salary in 6 months and definitly get some mental health recovery, but I’m worried that stepping away from data engineering so early, especially given how fast the field and AI tooling are evolving, could make it difficult to re-enter as I would be unfamialir with the new tools / processes. I personally am quite worried about job security in the near to mid future and don't want to further damage my prospects. At my current role we are literally using and upgrading our AI tech stack on a weekly basis and it's hard enough to keep up while I'm in it, let alone if I leave the domain. All to say, with the constant improvements and upgrades in AI and essentially my current role shifting from programming and more to ideation and agent managment, would taking a break to make noticably more money and give me a mental health break be a bad idea due to the struggles of then re-entering the market. \n\nI'd appreciate any opinions, I'm all ears!\n\nThanks all ! \n\n",

The department is a mix of those with stellar academic records, random degrees and people like me who fell into the work - I've found a similar split at most organisations and businesses I've worked with or met at conferences.\n\nI've experience working with a ton of different systems and a variety of stakeholders both within the organisation and externally such as software companies, central government departments etc. to tackle complex operational problems.\n\nI started my career using basic SQL, Excel and VBA. Currently I'm using advanced SQL (including performance tuning, building pipelines and data warehousing), Python (mainly pandas, numpy and matplotlib), Power BI (with a great understanding of DAX and TMDL, plus I do some platform administration). I've a sound(ish) knowledge of stats, though we don't really using anything too advanced. I'm considered mid-senior atm and paid £47k, which is quite typical for the public sector in the UK \\*Americans recoil in horror\\*.\n\nOutside work I mess around with my home server to expand my wider IT knowledge and explore some more modern tooling and cloud platforms.\n\n\n\nMy organisation are moving to Azure next year and I'm lining myself up for a DE role (there's no bump in pay) as that's where my interest lies.\n\nWould it be worth me getting a degree at this point in my career? My employer has offered to put me through a degree apprenticeship (not sure how familiar people are with those outside the UK), with the Open University, a distance-learning university.\n\nRecently, I applied for ten BI/DA jobs in other companies (just to test my marketability) and was invited to eight, so I'm not worried at all about the immediate term in my current area of work, I'm just concerned about whether I'd have a place in DE over the long term?

No Kubernetes, no JVM, no Kafka cluster required. Just write SQL and run.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't meant to replace Flink at massive scale.

One thing that’s consistently been a pain for me is monitoring: Airflow doesn’t give me a great way to track errors across DAGs/runs/environments, and setting up alerts with the included stats+prometheus always turns into a mini-project.\n\nI tried the usual stuff:\n\n* Airflow UI + logs + retries (fine for one-off debugging, rough for patterns)\n* The common open-source Airflow + Grafana dashboards (I spent time wiring it up… then basically never used it)\n* Sentry (I love Sentry as a SWE, and Airflow has integrations), but it still felt awkward because Sentry doesn’t really build around the concepts of  DAGs in the way I wanted, and I’d often end up with noisy/irrelevant errors + not enough context to quickly group recurring failures\n\nSo I built a self-hosted solution for myself (planning to open source it soon) with these features:\n\n* 100% self-hosted: no data leaves your servers\n* Easy install (Docker Compose + a lightweight Python SDK alongside Airflow)\n* Operator-aware metrics: automatically integrate with popular operators to collect useful signals (e.g., row counts for SQL/dbt-ish tasks, file sizes/counts for S3-style tasks, etc.)\n* Custom metrics in-code: a simple syntax to emit your own metrics right inside Airflow tasks when you need it\n* Error tracking across DAGs + environments: aggregate/fingerprint failures so recurring issues are obvious (and you can fix them before they hit prod)\n* Built-in alerting focused on data issues (currently: row count drops, schema changes, unexpected null counts)\n* Notifications via SMTP or Resend (e.g., new errors / alert triggers)\n* A modern and lightweight dashboard (Next.js)\n\nIs this something other people are interested in, or did I just solve a \"me problem\"?  \nAre there any features or integrated alerts that would make this worth your while?\n\nCheers",

Forgetting syntax, confused about how to use a given framework, not knowing why something works even when I'm able to get it working, and constantly needing help just to move forward, it felt like this every step for a long time.\n\n\n\nRecently, something finally clicked. I can sit down, think through a problem, and actually build the solution without feeling like I’m fighting the language or tools the entire time. One of the biggest changes is how I use documentation now. What used to feel unreadable suddenly makes sense, and I almost always prefer reading docs over asking GPT because it’s faster and clearer.\n\n\n\nI’m still very much a beginner at the end of the day, but programming is finally fun.  I can move past small toy programs that are under a thousand lines of code and start building things that feel real and challenging in a good way.

        "content": "Post was longer than I expected, TL;DR: High-school level programming experience in Processing/Scratch/Python/Java and 4 weeks experience with C++ about 13 years ago when I was 14. Want to learn programming for game dev. Don't care that they're not entry level languages. \n\n\nOkay, I know, I know, neither of these are beginner friendly at all but honestly I dont care. Im just wanting to learn game dev and I want something I can use for logic that needs to be quick and efficient, like terrain gen, etc. I have some experience in the really basic shit like Processing, Scratch, and Java by taking comp sci in HS but I was an awful student. I also took a 4 week summer camp between my freshman and sophomore years of HS that was for learning simple game dev through C++ but it was REALLY basic and I just made a short 10-minute text adventure. That being said, I have learned about Rust recently and everyone fuckn loves it and I've seen people making some really interesting things with it using its extension for Godot. \n\nFrom my ignorant perspective, C++ seems like a good option to understand more what's going on under the hood, having to manually manage memory and shit, and also has much faster compile times (which ive already experienced when compiling Rust demos in Godot Jesus christ), as well as possibly better job prosepects and translates easier to other languages as I understand Rust is a fairly unique language. With Rust it seems like it's more annoying because you HAVE to handle your memory errors SOMEHOW because the borrow checker thing just doesn't let you fuck that up, as well as maybe being more difficult to understand because of its owner-borrower system or whatever its called, but the whole thing makes sense to me conceptually, not sure how easily I'll be able to implement it tho. (But it seems like it would at least be easier to debug, no?) I've watched videos on both and I haven't been able to find a great answer as to whether one would be better for a beginner. \n\nAgain, I dont care to learn something more basic, I'm already going to be using plenty of GDScript so I will be learning a simpler language anyway so anything I just simply can't do at my skill level at the moment I'll just fall back on that till I sharpen up with Rust/C++.\n\nAppreciate any advice or insight into this question and sorry for the long ass post.

So, I decided that I wanted to take a break from the hostile environment and work with other stuff (and enjoy some of my life after uni). \n\nThe thing is, job market wasn’t so lucky to me. It was (and it still is) hard to even get an interview. So I ended up doing some freelance and gigs all around. \n\nBut one stuff that was all over my head ever since I finished uni was the famous “imposter syndrome”. And, I got the realisation that I was, in fact, very lucky to land my positions. I always relied on AI to deliver something, didn’t know how to start a project from scratch. \n\nSo, in November I decided to “start again”. Focusing on getting the basics well and enjoying coding again. And it has been a quite fun journey! In fact, I’m liking studying and trying some stuff. I got a membership on Frontend Masters (mostly because of the algorithm course) and gifted myself with some books for Christmas. \n\nI’m relearning (or learning in fact) Javascript, algorithms, some cloud computing (aiming for AWS SAA-CO3) and eager to learn DBs and Golang. \n\nChallenges are getting fun again, struggling is getting fun again and, more importantly, learning is getting fun again. \n\nI’m still doing some gigs (mostly because I really need the money), but I’m planning on diving deep in interviews at June. But, until then, I’ll enjoy the ride :)",

        "content": "I'm the lead author of [Grokking Relational Database Design (Manning Publications, 2025)](https://mng.bz/PRER), and I've turned the book into a full open-access course. Sharing it here since database design is often overlooked in self-taught journeys, but it's crucial for building real applications.\n\n**What it covers:** The course focuses on database design fundamentals:\n\n* ER modeling and relationship design (including many-to-many patterns)\n* Normalization techniques (1NF through BCNF)\n* Data types, keys, and integrity constraints\n* Indexing strategies and query optimization\n* The complete database design lifecycle\n\n**What's included:**\n\n* 28 video lectures organized into 8 weekly modules\n* Quizzes to test your understanding\n* Database design and implementation assignments\n* Everything free and open-access on GitHub\n\nThe first two weeks cover just enough SQL to get you productive, then the focus shifts entirely to database design. If you're building projects and wondering \"am I designing this database correctly?\" - this course is for you.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n* Self-taught developers who skipped formal CS education\n* Bootcamp grads who got minimal database coverage\n* Anyone building backends and realizing they need stronger fundamentals\n* Beginners who want to understand databases beyond basic CRUD\n\nI originally created these videos for my own college students, and decided to make them freely available since there's a real gap in accessible, practical database design education.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Full course: [https://github.com/StructuredCS/grokking-relational-database-design](https://github.com/StructuredCS/grokking-relational-database-design)\n* Video playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fg3zQpW0k4UO9eBDLdroADnB18ZAOgj](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fg3zQpW0k4UO9eBDLdroADnB18ZAOgj)\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

        "content": "Yes, I know, Assembly isn't used much these days outside of a few cases and reverse engineering, probably easier to learn C or Python, etc. But I want to learn ASM because I've always been intrigued and for some of the stuff I want to do, I need to know how to read it.\n\n**Edit:** My goals are to be able to read assembly so I can disassemble, reverse engineer, or edit some games. The Playstation 1 and 2 use MIPS architecture, the Gameboy and GBC use z80, and most modern applications and games use x86-64, which is why I'm torn between the three.\n\nI don't have a computer science background and my career isn't anything close to CS unless you count working in excel. I also don't anticipate switching careers. This is purely something I want to do in mh free tkme. I understand basic computer concepts but don't know how to code or program. I've made a few game mods, I can look at code and change a thing or two, and I can locate some stuff in memory to freeze or edit via emulator or CE, but that's probably as close as I've gotten. \n\nAnyways, I am wondering if there are any great online courses or books I can follow that are good for people with little to no CS background? I'm torn between x86, MIPS, or z80, but leaning towards x86 since it seems more comprehensive and I would think going from CISC to RISC would be easier than the inverse. \n\nI rented the book *Assembly X64 Programming in Easy Steps: Modern Coding for MASM, SSE and AVX* from my library since that was all they had. Not sure how that compares to some of the other resources out there. ",

        "author": "BrosVGK",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "so for context, when i was in first/second year of middle school, i meet some people who were good with pc's / know how to program. I talked to them a bit about it and it managed to get me into programming and learning about pc's and on and off for a few years, i would try and learn C# because i was curious to try and learn how to make a game, and i was into pc's because i wanted to know how pc's work (hardware wise, not software). Fastforward to graduating high school recently (i graduated in june). When it was time for me to pick my future career i decided i wanted to go to computer science (a bit off topic but i was also into music, specifically playing the guitar and wanting to learn about music theory, and i like to learn to draw) and even though i was into those other hobbies, i picked computer science because i thought i could make some decent money from it, however thats when things went down the hill. When i first started, things weren't too hard, i managed to understand some early stuff. I was learning C++ and general computer theory, and when it came to computer theory i was good at it, because in my mind it was easy. Then when November / December came, everything just didnt make sense. I couldnt even pay attention in classes because i just couldnt understand it and when i try and learning it on my own i still couldnt get it. It got pretty bad because i would cry many nights and being constantly stressed at me not understanding the subjects and that i didnt want to fail my classes. Eventually my school finally had christmas holidays and im still having them as im writing this, but yesterday or before yesterday (it was on jan 2) i got an email from two of my professors (one for programming and another for computer theory) where the computer theory would make a test on things that we learnt for a bit before christmas holidays and from my programming teacher where we would get a midterm on stuff we did from november / december. At that point i just started breaking down because i just dont want to go through that awful experience anymore of being constantly worried and stressed, feeling as if i was on the edge, and one screw up would ruin everything for me. So i guess what im asking is should i even continue my course or should i pick a different career for my life (i was thinking of maritime studies because my dad is an expert in maritime since he worked for 40+ years in it) at this point, im lost and i dont know what to do with my future.\n\nthanks for anyone who read the whole essay of a post. But to give a TLDR version:  \n  \nwas into computers since middle school, graduated high school, got into compsci for my career, in the beginning understood the material but later i didnt get it, started having panic attacks and stress, dont know what to do.",

I can tell that my skills are kind of atrophying and it’s stripping me of the confidence needed to prepare for and pass interviews. \n\nFor some extra context, I have only one year of experience working as a Software Developer, but I’ve been programming for 5 years.

        "author": "Existing_Steak",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I am trying to learn programming and have a question about frameworks/programming languages.\n\nI have made a simple HTTP-based API in both python (using fastAPI) and java (using Spring Boot).\n\nIn fastAPI framework, I notice that I mainly write functions which are either passed in as parameters into other functions or called by other functions. To me, this makes sense from my perspective, or at least feels intuitive. I can literally see the programming \"primitives\" I wrote interacting with each other in my source code. \n\nFor example, I build an endpoint like\n\n```python\n@APIRouter().get(\"/blah\")\ndef get_blah():\n  return \"blah\"\n```\n\nthen I must tell my main FastAPI() object about the routes using `.include_router()`. Nice. I can also somewhat imagine whats going on in my head, like the `APIRouter` object has some record of all the routes I defined via the decorator and that object is being passed to my `FastAPI()` object.\n\nSpring Boot, on the other hand, I notice that I create classes, and some of these classes are never instantiated! At least they're certainly never called in my source code. I can run my application with Gradle and the class I created that was never instantiated actually did something. \n\nE.g., I make this class\n\n```java\n@RestController\npublic class TextController {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/texts\")\n    public List<Text> getTexts() {\n        return service.getTexts();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nbut I never wrote \"TextController blah = new TextController()\" anywhere?\n\nLike, I feel more in control of my FastAPI application than I do with my Spring application? Do others feel like this? Do I just chalk up the framework differences to \"thats how the authors who designed each framework intended it to be\"?",

Anyways, my question is why is there a 1.5 second gap? I did some googling and found it to be related to JVM and it's startup time so is there any possible way that I can reduce or get rid of this startup time? Also, why does it even need to warm up?",

        "content": "Just wrapped up a month-long project using C++, SDL2, and ImGui. I set out to make a simple app that has the very basic features of Lightroom, but I quickly realized that architecture is a completely different beast than programming the logic. It only does the bare minimum of what I originally planned, and I’m struggling with the feeling that I should have pushed harder. But at this point, the passion for this specific codebase is gone, and I just want to move on.\n\nI learned a lot about the build process and package management, but the codebase ended up as a bit of a spaghetti mess. I’m at the point where I’ve learned enough to see exactly why my current design is flawed, which makes it feel impossible to keep working on it without a 100% rewrite.\n\nI underestimated how hard it would be to design the software. It took me a while to actually set all the dependencies up. Then came writing the pipeline for it to actually be usable. But with each thing I added, I realized another thing had to be fixed or improved. By the time I had implemented the basic features, I'd gone through countless rewrites. Despite my efforts to keep it as decoupled as I could, the codebase was never as clean as I had wanted it to be.\n\nI don't exactly regret making this project since I learned a lot from it. However, I feel like I'd feel a lot better right now if I put that effort elsewhere, or if I actually completed all the features I'd planned on implementing. But I just can't bring myself to work on it any longer. If I want it to be well made then I would have to rewrite the whole thing. It also sucks because as shallow of a reason as it may be, I was looking forward to having something to show off on my GitHub :(",

I'm trying to understand what's going on line by line.... but it always trips me up. Perhaps it's the \"stacks\" (recursion)?  \n\n\nAllegedly this is the code.\n\n    def divide(arr):\n        if len(arr) <= 1:\n            return arr\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n    \n    \n        left = arr[:mid]\n        right = arr[mid:]\n    \n    \n        left_sorted = divide(left)\n        right_sorted = divide(right)\n        return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)\n\nWhat I understand so far is the obvious.  \nWe are storing the first half (left), and the second half (right) in arrays.\n\nBut apparently, all the magic is happening here:  \n`left_sorted = divide(left)`  \n`right_sorted = divide(right)`  \n`return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)`  \nWhen I print those values, the output is\n\n`[3] [7]`\n\n`[1] [9]`\n\n`None None`\n\n`[2] [5]`\n\n`[8] [6]`\n\n`[4] None`\n\n`None None`\n\n`None None`\n\n  \naaand I'm officially lost here.\n\nMy brain is trying to run this line by line. But I can't\n\nHow is it getting each element? How is it also running the method for each of them?\n\nit's calling divide() twice, back to back.\n\nCan someone help me write my own divide method? Maybe that way I can figure it out. Or at least a better explanation?\n\nAt first I was going to skip it, but the udemy course does things in increasing difficulty. It went:  \nBubble Sort -> Selection Sort -> Insertion Sort -> Merge Sort (current), then after this is Quick Sort, which is also recursion.\n\nSo I need to master this.....\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Does the tech stack and order look good or Do I need to add/remove anything?\n\n2. Regarding certifications, I’m a bit confused as both AWS and Data bricks are offering similar kind of certifications. Should I do both or choose one, if one which would be better.\n\n3. I have chosen AWS rather than GCP and Azure as I read that AWS has the highest market share among these. \n\nI’m open to any suggestions even outside of my questions. \n\nThank you in advance!!",

After some trial and error, I made a collision detection system based on several parts:\n\n\\> under Scenes class, I load textures for obstacles in each scene and create a dictionary to map each scene to the obstacle textures to be drawn. Also created a dictionary to map each texture to its position.\n\n\\> in my Map class, I create a 2d array of zeros to represent terrain; then, a method loops thru the dictionary from Scenes, to place 1's on all array elements corresponding to the texture's width&height on the grid.\n\n\\> In the map class, I create methods like this for each direction, which are called in the main Update() method later when the arrow key is detected: (EDIT: position and tex1 in CanMoveL() refer to the player)\n\n            public bool CanMoveL(Vector2 position, Texture2D tex1)\n            {\n                bool check = true;\n    \n    \n                if (position.X == Xbounds[0]+10)\n                {\n                    return false;\n                }\n    \n    \n                for (int y = 5; y < tex1.Height-1; y++){\n    \n    \n                    if (terrain[(int)position.Y+y, (int)position.X +1]==2)\n                    {\n                        check = false;\n                    }\n                }\n                return check;\n    \n    \n            }\n\nNote: I know there are built-in detection methods in monogame, but I'm not really interested in refactoring in the best way possible, I just had the objective of figuring it out from scratch in a way that makes sense. But, if you have some ideas on how you would have approached it/whether my method is way too inefficient, I'd be happy to hear them!\n\nMainly, I'm concerned about the loop that looks through each \"row\" of my character's height, seeing if it hits the obstacle when projected. I was thinking of Numpy style slicing but I couldn't figure that out in c#?\n\nSecondly, It seems like this method is kinda fragmented, with the scene textures loaded in Scenes, but the actual mapping of them in Maps. Should both those be in Maps?\n\nThanks!",

I enjoy learning them, but none of this directly helps me at work.\n\nAt some point, I want to switch companies. Realistically, it probably doesn’t make sense to switch to a completely different role when my professional experience is in iOS.\n\nSo career-wise, what’s the smarter move early on:\n\n1. Should I focus on mastering iOS development deeply and only learn new things when my role demands it?\n2. Or is it actually beneficial to keep learning multiple languages and frameworks alongside my primary skill?\n\nI’m trying to balance curiosity with long-term career growth, and I’m not sure where that line should be.",

That makes me wonder whether SvelteKit is mainly intended for cases where you don’t already have a backend.\n\nIf I already rely entirely on a separate Go backend for APIs and business logic, would plain Svelte with TypeScript be sufficient, or does SvelteKit still provide benefits in this scenario? I’m trying to understand when it makes sense to use Svelte versus SvelteKit, especially for someone coming from a more traditional frontend-backend separation.

I am trying to avoid ranges or keyless aggregation queries as they will need the scatter-gather approach and does not really add anything towards the purpose of project.\n\nNow I decided to use hash based routing and the logic for that itself is implemetd but I cannot decide how do I choose the sharding key which will be used to decide where the query is to be routed ? I am thinking of maintaining of a registry which maps each key to its respetive table. However as I tried to see how this approach works for some schemas I noticed that many table use same fields which are also unique, which means we can have same sharding key for mutiple tables. We can use this try to groups such tables together in same shard aloowing for more optimised query result. \n\nHowever i am unable to find or think of any algorithm that can help me to find such fields across tables.

The LLMs understood parts of the project we've never seen before and were able to fix the issues with more holistic approaches.\n\nMuch less skill is needed for solving problems that used to involve years of study. I'm worried the main three areas (coding, domain knowledge, system design) that made skilled workers more desirable will no longer matter. Now, workers can simply add the domain knowledge to the context window, use well-established system designs, and generate code adhering to standards with existing prompt templates.\n\nThe knowledge barrier once attracted me to this profession because of the differentation from low skilled labor. I'm considering switching into a different career with more human judgement involved but it feels pointless. Now anyone, including unskilled workers, can automate their tasks well enough without manual coding.\n\nI would like guidance on what paths I should considering switching into, or topics of upskilling, if any, that aren't easily replaceable by unskilled laborers overseeing the work of AI.",

I realize I could take a salary cut if I do that, but I'm curious if I could easily get into a job that's more stable that I'd still enjoy.\n\nAlso, it saddens me to feel this way. I feel like we need software developers & other tech workers, but I also feel like I wouldn't recommend others go into this field anymore due to the lack of job stability.",

        "content": "I'll try to be concise and explain what I mean by \"hiding\" as best I can - bear with me folks.\n\nI remember starting my career in the summer of 2024, with hopes that I'll progress into senior after 2-3 years, and maybe go to a different company that aligned more towards my interests.\n\nI knew AI was a \"threat\" in terms of reducing the number of engineers (do more with less - the mantra of corporate America, etc.), but didn't really take it seriously.\n\nFlash forward 18 months later, and I am taking it much more seriously. I don't think AI will eliminate software engineering, but I do think it'll change the number of people who need to it to achieve very good outcomes. With each iteration and vast amounts of training data, the AI models to get better - and honestly, I'm part of the reason, I have to hold my hands up and say I've used GPT a lot since it came out - it synthesizes anything on Google, SO, documentation, etc. so why not use it to get to the bottom of what I need to know way quicker?\n\nAnd I think this is the general consensus - AI will never do away with software engineering, software will always exist, but it will change who does it, and the number of those people.\n\nMore relevant in 2026 though is offshoring. For better or for worse, I understand the rationale of offshoring labor, particularly junior positions. Companies exist solely to deliver profits to their shareholders, investing a lot of money into an \"unproven\" college graduate is far less appealing than investing that same amount of money into 3-4 new graduates.\n\nSo as offshoring accelerates, and AI becomes better and better, I'm \"hiding\". I do my due diligence at work, and I learn what good software is.\n\nBut no matter how many times I implement a strong observability backbone, no matter how many times I write CDK code and deploy to AWS, no matter how many times I implement authentication middleware, etc. - I have the same feeling that I'm on borrowed time.\n\nI'm \"hiding\" in the sense that there will be a time in the future, how soon, I don't know, but there will be a time when my leadership thinks, \"We don't need him anymore\" because I cost them too much, and my work can be consolidated into an offshore option or a senior engineer that is producing more with AI. It'll be a simple decision for them, and honestly I'll be the first to say that their intention aligns with the purpose of a business in the first place, which is to churn a higher profit.\n\nBut until then, I have no choice but to hide, I can upskill and get as good as I want, and believe me I will try to, but there's going to be an inflection point where I can't hide anymore, and by then who knows what the world will look like.\n\nBut do any other juniors sort of feel this way, this sort of existential dread, but also acknowledgement that that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles? In the meantime, I hope we can both be grateful for having a job at a time so difficult. Take care, my friends :)",

Seattle, SF, NYC) it comes down to:\n\n- more job opportunities\n- ability to grow a larger network\n\nWith the advent of online applications & speaking to recruiters virtually, many roles aren’t relegated to those living in a specific city anymore. There may be some preference from certain companies to choose locally, but that’s about it.\n\nNetworking is a big one, but if you were really dedicated to building a solid network, you could do lots of cold outreach on LinkedIn and attend virtual conferences in the industry. Not saying it would be as effective, but the tradeoff of uprooting your whole life and paying a premium (higher COL) just to network a little more efficiently doesn’t seem to weigh in evenly.\n\nFrom people who have moved for these reasons, curious to hear your opinion.",

        "content": "So I work for a FAANG company as a SWE, 3 YOE, got promoted to mid-level 7 months ago and then switched to a chill team. The work is more boring than I expected coming from a fast-paced, cutting-edge team building brand new services leveraging AI agents to now maintaining legacy services written over a decade ago - very simple services but with high scale (millions of transactions per second).\n\nThe path to senior engineer here is slim, maybe even non-existent because we already have one on the team and there isn't any real scope in terms of next-level projects for promo. My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them. The pace is slow and the work is quite mundane and nothing to do with AI - it feels like I'm missing the AI wave. So there's minimal career growth here.\n\nBut apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)\n\nBut yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.\n\nSo I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that. I'm also interested in maybe going to a startup, but perhaps that's best to do once I have 5 YOE and can apply for senior instead of chasing promo here which is quite difficult irrespective of team. I could also try switching internally to a team with better work and better promo prospects but not sure if it's worth giving up all the good things here for career growth - vs. just rest and vest... what would you do in this situation ?  \n",

This salary is great.\n\nI recently got a job offer for $250k total comp. The position is hybrid (which honestly I prefer) and is in a low cost of living area as well (different city). I have 2 questions really:\n\n1. The likelihood of getting laid off in my current position is very low (never say never though in these times though). Would you all take the almost 100k bump in salary to leave a company like this? It’s worth nothing that my offer is from a company that has done major layoffs (\\\\\\~25-35% of their staff).\n2. I also kind of lied and said I already live in that new city. I live a short plane ride away. Has anybody done this before? I have 3 weeks to accept the offer and a start date of around mid-Feb. I think I can relocate it time…",

I am working on internal developer tools. For example, this team is instrumenting custom dev container solutions to create remote dev environments. This involves writing shell scripts, understanding daemons / processes. I had a few projects so far, but these have been relatively unrelated and disjointed. For example, I implemented a small improvement to some scripts. I also migrated some CI / CD pipelines from 1 vendor to another. These projects are also always consistently out of my experience. I don't know anything currently about working with daemons / processes and usually I don't have a point of contact to talk to. The work I am doing doesn't necessarily compound on previous work I've done for this team because its so random and disjointed, so its hard to build a mental model of specifically what we own, because I simply do not work on it.\n\n  \nI just want to know if this is normal - as a senior SWE should I expect that I am consistently given projects where I have no domain expertise and no point of contact and I should just ramp myself up? \n\nFWIW, I did not lie to my manager about my experience.

        "author": "_lebrons_Hairline",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "To give a little bit of context,\n\nI’ve been working at a small to midsize biotech startup for a few years as essentially the only SWE on my team (although kinda junior). Honestly, I’ve had regrets since joining, since the role didn’t match the job description, and I’ve been operating mostly solo with little direction until more recently.\n\nRight now I’m at my breaking point. I’m leading a large, org wide project that touches one of our core critical processes, and I’m doing everything: requirements gathering, design, implementation, data migration, refactoring other teams’ code, qa, documentation, project management, and coordinating with multiple stakeholders. Requirements constantly change, and feedback comes only after features are done, and I end up redoing a ton of work. I mention this pretty often to stakeholders but it still doesn't prevent them from mentioning something that should've been mentioned when I was doing the requirements gathering.\n\nDespite this, upper management thinks the project is taking too long and questions decisions without being involved, and can be pretty demeaning to the work that I've done so far. I’ve tried looping them into boards and channels, but it seems like they don't care to look at it and they jump straight to accusations. I've been holding weekly meetings to get everyone aligned and to communicate deadlines as well as providing updates in comms. The core team seems pretty aligned and my boss is empathetic and supportive, and they recognize the work that I do but leadership seems to have unrealistic expectations for our team compared to others. I'm not the only one who sees this favoritism; my boss recognizes it as well.\n\nI’m also juggling other requests on top of this and have been working nights and weekends for months now. It was manageable before and I was used to it, until a few months ago I dealt with some personal stuff which fueled the burnout and pushed me towards a mental breakdown and some ideation related thoughts. A week later, I tried to resume everything as normally as I could but I’m still burnt out; panic attacks, nausea, crying before work, the whole shebang. I took a two week break hoping it would help, but I came back dreading everything.\n\nTo make it worse, leadership is tying my promotion to the success of this massive project, even though they’ve admitted it’s complex and high impact. Its a type of project that can affect all processes org wide if not executed well.  I’m exhausted and feel stuck in a repeating pattern of dealing with the upper management talk and possibly gossip/backbiting from teams/management outside the core group. It's getting really frustrating having to deal with the barrage of questions coming in on the last minute by teams who weren't even part of the project group and now have stuff to say. I have a feeling many teams outside view our team negatively. My boss understands and relates to my frustration as well. Reviews of the company have been echoing similar sentiments of it being toxic, having poor/nonexistent management and exhibiting large amounts of favoritism.\n\nI’ve been seriously considering quitting for a while now and taking a break (even before this project). I have a lot in savings/investments, stupidly low expenses, and could get by for a while without being a SWE (maybe go into retail or something) while managing to save, but I’m scared given how bad the tech market is and don’t see it improving in 2026. So far, I've been trying to suck it up and disengage but its becoming increasingly difficult to do so with the snide comments here and there.\n\nIs it worth staying in a situation like this just because of the economy, or am I burning myself out for nothing? Or should I just wait it out and make them fire me, although its unlikely I get severance? I tried to prep for interviews, but I feel so burnt out that I can't even stand to look at code any more or have the energy to prep after working 12 hours. I feel like my mind is in a constant haze.",

To some people being able to banter with your boss is great, to me it just feels like unclear boundaries of what is acceptable to talk about, and so I don't feel comfortable saying anything personal. I feel like an outsider to group of friends. Every time I do pitch in it always feels like the conversation just dies. So I always end up being the quietest one in the group, because I have nothing to say. And so people rarely speak to me or know me. I can tell because people usually talk very straight and professional to me, and then very casually to everyone else. \n\nNow this wouldn't be a problem, except that the people who are more talkative have better rapport with higher ups, or get recommended more, and so I feel like I get passed over for projects. But I really struggle with casual talk in a professional environment. A lot of stuff in my team is based on \"tribal knowledge\". There are several people who were hired around the same time as me and I feel like they're already ahead of me, they seem to know the managers better, they seem to be more involved in what's going on in the company. \n\nMaybe I unintentionally come off as mean or cold. Definitely robotic. But I'm just nervous and never know what to say. If it has nothing to do with the exact specific task at hand my mind just completely blanks. I wouldn't be able to remember what my favorite movie was if asked. I just don't know what to do because this is always a problem for me. I've tried to learn how to \"small talk\" and it just feels really hallow. I've read a lot about it and it seems to line up with autism in the workplace but I've never been officially diagnosed and I wouldn't even know how I would bring that up in jobs.\n\nAnyway, just want to hear some advice or if someone has similar experiences.

Unfortunately, my current part-time job has had struggles with finances, leaving me unable to afford paying bills for myself and my long-distance girlfriend without posting on social media begging for donations, even with both of us having part-time jobs. I've been searching for a job as a programmer for 3 years now, with no luck due to the major crash in both the game development and general software scene.\n\nI don't have a degree, but I've taught myself programming over the last 5 years and have what I'd consider pretty decent knowledge for a junior. I have 5 years of C++ and Python and 4 years of C#. I'm also quite experienced in Unreal Engine, and to a lesser degree, Unity. Additionally, I am versed in x86 and ARM assembly, as I spend a lot of time reverse engineering binaries in IDA Pro/Ghidra/Binary Ninja. \n\nHowever, I'm struggling to find jobs that meet my relatively lower-level language experience while hiring a junior dev in terms of workplace experience. Game development and malware analysis are probably where I'd do best, and I could definitely handle general software engineering, but the game development scene is obviously fucked, malware analysis jobs are extremely hard to come by, and my skillset doesn't include web development yet. I'd be fine with learning on the job, but it seems that these days, job postings require experience in almost every aspect to begin with.\n\nI'm aware that contacts are usually the best way to get a job in this industry, but all of my job-related contacts exist in the game dev sphere, and no one's hiring for roles that I'd meet in that scene at the moment. I don't have much connection to people in general software engineering or malware analysis. I cannot afford to travel even close distance due to lack of funds and physical disability, so I don't have much of a chance going to in-person developer meetups. My parents seem content to keep me stuck inside their house while having me pay rent monthly, so I cannot rely on them for funding or travel.\n\nThis has obviously been taking a severe toll on my mental state, as I'm struggling to find work that pays me enough to allow me and my girlfriend to survive, let alone move in together. I'm pretty desperate for a job that pays half-decently, and due to my disability I don't think I could physically handle a minimum wage job, never mind the fact that it probably wouldn't be able to pay the bills where I live, around the Seattle area. I'm already barely earning more than minimum wage for where I live to begin with.\n\nIf anyone is curious, [here's my GitHub page.](http://github.com/WistfulHopes)",

I recently graduated with a bachelors in CE and am currently working full time as a SWE. I was hoping to use the degree as a lever into a higher paying / more prestigious swe job.  I plan to take 2-3 years to finish the program then apply for new jobs once complete. \n\nI’m having some second thoughts about whether my time would be better spent working on personal projects relevant to my desired position instead of the degree. I have a pretty clear target area that I know I could work on side projects for, but I don’t know if this will be taken less seriously than certified courses. For anyone who has been in a similar position as me, do you think the degree was key for boosting your career? \n\n(I’m not worried about time commitment differences as I would be working the same in either case. The cost of the program is also not a factor.)\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

I generally love my job—I own features from backend to frontend, write my own Terraform, manage GCP resources, the works. It feels fulfilling to ship stuff that people actually see and use.\n\nThe problem I’m experiencing is trying to get an internal promotion. I’ve been acting at a Senior level for a while. My manager pushed for my promotion last year, but the Director blocked it because they haven’t heard enough about me to deserve it and my manager cited \"people outside the team don't know me\" (I'm fully remote and introverted, don’t get a lot of opportunities to network). Now my manager wants me to rotate to another team for a quarter just to \"prove visibility\" before they consider the promo again. It feels like moving goalposts and political hoop-jumping, and hasn't been sitting well with me since.\n\nRecently, a recruiter reached out to me about a job at a late stage health tech startup, I went through the whole interview process not expecting to get it, but I did receive an offer. I negotiated it up and signed, but now I’m having intense buyer's remorse.\n\n* **Positives:** Senior title, good pay bump. Marketable tech stack.\n* **Negatives:** The work sounds like it could be pretty dry, mostly data processing and generating reports. No Greenfield development and I’d be working in a monorepo. I’m worried I’ll lose that spark I get from building new features for the website.\n* **Some weirdness:** I’d be reporting to a “manager” who is also an IC on the team. He’s never managed before and is new to interviewing. I’m worried he won’t have the clout to advocate for me or help me grow.\n\nHas anyone made a jump like this? Is reporting to a fellow IC on my team a massive red flag?\n\nI’m afraid I’m leaving a job I enjoy (mostly) for a place where I’ll be bored and stuck, just for money and to chase a title my current company is gatekeeping.",

Did any of you successfully land a role, or experience a layoff?

Some experience in Android and web dev\n\n• 2-year employment gap (hardship + health recovery). Published 2 personal iOS apps during that time\n\n• NYC-based resume. Currently in SoCal and planning to relocate elsewhere soon\n\n\nConcerns:\n\n• Bay Area: Worried about stiff competition and commute. No CS degree, no FAANG experience, and no car\n\n• NYC: Possibly better for my network and commute, but unsure about demand and growth for Swift/iOS\n\n• Zero preference on city lifestyle offerings. Career re-entry and long-term growth are most important to me\n\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much. :)",

Both things combined took a huge mental toll on my health and I was just out of commission for all of July and August.\n\nStarted applying in the US in September and I've had some interviews (Mainly from people who reached out to me on LinkedIn. Rarely from applications themselves). A lot of phone screens that I never make past. Some technicals.\n\nI got a verbal offer in the beginning of October for a React Native position after 5 interviews but that ended up not working out since they paused hiring due to the economy. That hurt a lot and was a huge blow. Started from the beginning again. Interviewed with FAANG-adjacent for a iOS role and finished the entire interview process but then was rejected which was another blow considering I made it through it all.\n\nGot a interview and then another offer in the end of November for a contracting role for a year. Got my offer letter, and my TN visa and my SSN, just for them to lose funding for the role mid-December while I was waiting for my SSN to come in. I'm now absolutely just done. Mentally exhausted. Two potential jobs. I feel like luck is not on my side at all.\n\nI've always been not great a leetcode. I've been trying to do questions in both Python and Swift. Mainly easy questions, very few medium. 0 hard. It's insanely difficult and I feel like I suck at it.\n\nI feel like I'm also bad at interviews, I'm always stressed and anxious and just seem to forget things. Constantly need to be reviewing things. I think maybe my resume isn't great so I've added that as well. Honestly. I'm just done with life. Nothing seems to be working out and I need advice. I have a decent personality and I work well with others. I do enjoy the things that I do.\n\nAm I doing something wrong or is it really this bad? Is it normal to have offers rescinded like this or are they just changing their mind? Is there any thing I should do or change on my resume?

I have no internships. The only CS-related experience on my resume is a couple semesters of frontend-focused undergrad research and a software position for a satellite lab at my school, where I haven't yet written a single line of code.

I've also not done any Leetcode practice, so I wouldn't feel confident answering hard interview questions yet.\n\nAs a freshman majoring in computer science, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. Even though I was following along with the coursework, I always felt that I was a bit behind my peers in terms of internships, projects, and real-world CS skills. It's taken me too long to recognize how hard it is to find a job as a new grad, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Is it worth grinding for months trying to land a job in this field given how non-competitive my resume looks? Is there even enough time before I graduate? Or should I just switch fields? There's jobs out there that give $55-60k/yr, are much easier to get, and teach you everything you need to know. When I started college, I had dreams of making six figures working from home, but now I really just want to make a livable wage and not hate my job.\n\nSorry for the bit of venting at the end, but any advice is appreciated.

        "content": "Hello all, I'm facing a bit of a dilemma. So a bit of backstory, I struggled to find internships while in college and was only able to find work in my field after graduating. The only offer I ever received was from Wipro which I \"worked for\" for 2 years. What that boiled down to was training for certificates and joining meetings at 2am that just boiled down to \"any questions?\" Again I was desperate because I had never received offers while my peers in the field were already gaining experience in their own internships. So at one point I'm told I need to move out of my state which the job description never mentioned, so I tell them I can't and I leave. Since then it's been 2 years of me searching for entry level positions to try and start over but I rarely get interviews (once every \\~300 apps). \n\nAnyways, I see very negative opinions on Wipro and I'm worried that the reason why I rarely get interviews is because of my association with them. If that's true would it be better if I scrubbed it from my resume and left a 4 year gap? I'm not sure what I should do about this.",

        "content": "Some background: Bachelors in CS, and I was a full-time SWE from 2013-2017, worked at Amazon right out of college then at a trading firm for a few years. Got laid off in 2017, but just as I was starting to look for a new job, my father unexpectedly passed away, and I had to step away from engineering to help support a family real estate business. I was never really passionate about the business, and frankly had to teach myself everything to make it work. I've been able to keep the business afloat, but just barely, and as I'm looking to get married and have a family soon, I know the income from that business just won't be able to support a family. So I've decided to sell the business and try going back to SWE. The problem is, from what I can tell, the job market is horrible, and it's even worse with an 8 year gap in my resume. My background was primarily as a Java developer, but my last couple years at the trading firm I did a fair amount of work in Spark, so I've decided to lean into the data engineering angle and have been teaching myself modern Spark and cloud computing to brush up on my skills in my free time. \n\nI know I will probably have to start back at a level 1 or maybe 2 role given my resume gap, and I've already sent my resume out to a few companies I thought might be a good fit through linkedIn, but have gotten zero calls back. I'm reaching out to the community here to see what everyone's advice is on what I should do to maximize my chances of getting my foot in the door. Should I look for recruiters? Take some sort of certification course? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "**Update: I decided on NYC. Thanks for all the input!\nUpdate2: was able to negotiate for slightly higher base!**\n\nHi all! I recently received a full-time offer at a company where I previously interned, but in a different org. The role is best described as analytics engineering (data pipelines, dashboards, some modeling).\n\nOffer details:\n\n* Base: \\~$105k (about 75% of the band)\n* Bonus: 10%\n* Role is listed as 0–2 YOE\n* No master’s required (I do have one)\n* Same pay regardless of location\n* Office options: West Hollywood (LA) or Midtown Manhattan (NYC)\n\nI need to choose a location fairly quickly and want to make a decision that makes sense for both lifestyle and long-term growth.\n\n# About me / context\n\n* Single, 25F\n* Early-career, no full-time experience yet\n* Strong academic background (T10 undergrad + top specialized MS; more math/data science, lighter formal CS)\n* Exploring whether to pivot further into AI engineering or SWE — I’ve built a couple of agentic systems recently and really enjoyed it, though I also recognize I may have only scratched the surface\n* Very arts-oriented and tend to feed off the energy of my surroundings\n* Concerts, performing arts, and creative scenes matter a lot to me outside of work\n* Love warm weather and the beach (would go multiple times a week)\n\nI’ve lived full-time in LA (\\~1.5 years) and part-time in the NYC metro area (frequent trips into the city). Toward the end of my time in LA, I started making friends and building more of a social life, but it still doesn’t fully feel like “home.” In contrast, I have longer-term roots in NYC (school, family, and other involvements over the past decade), even though I haven’t lived there full-time before.\n\n# How I’m thinking about NYC vs LA\n\nAfter looking closely at housing, one clear difference is space vs density:\n\n* In NYC, I’d ideally want to live in downtown Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn, which is meaningfully more expensive for the space you get. I’d absolutely need a roommate.\n* In LA, I could live very close to work in West Hollywood, with more space for the same money. I’d still want a roommate, but it feels less constrained.\n\nThis doesn’t feel like a good-vs-bad lifestyle decision — more like a tradeoff:\n\n* NYC: less space, more density and stimulation, amazing energy, easier access to arts and ambitious people, diversity in industries\n* LA: more space, easier day-to-day life, amazing weather, and beach access, but sometimes feels slower or understimulating\n\nOne thing I’m genuinely unsure about is whether NYC actually provides more motivation and momentum early in a career, or whether that’s more about finding the right community in either city. I don’t yet have a strong network in either place, so I’m aware my perception may be biased by who I’ve met so far.\n\nFor future context only (not a third option right now): I’ve also spent a lot of time in San Francisco and could see myself there down the line, especially if I pivot further into tech — so future flexibility is something I’m thinking about — but this decision is strictly NYC vs LA.\n\n# Negotiation context\n\nI’m also in the process for two other roles:\n\n* One might pay similarly, the other potentially more\n* Neither is likely to wrap up within the next \\~1.5 weeks, and I may need to sign this offer before then\n\nThis current offer is the best fit in terms of work itself, but I’m unsure how to think about negotiation given:\n\n* I’m already \\~75% into the band\n* I don’t have full-time experience\n* I do have a master’s, which is more than the role formally requires\n\n# My questions\n\n1. Given everything above — my career stage, personality, priorities, and the work itself — which city would you choose for me: NYC or LA? Why?\n2. For people who’ve lived in both, how did each city actually affect your motivation, growth, and day-to-day energy early in your career?\n3. Negotiation:\n   * Would you negotiate at all in this situation, given I can’t risk losing the offer?\n   * If yes, when is the right time: after receiving the written offer, or only if another offer comes in (even after signing)?\n\nThanks so much — really appreciate any insight. And I apologize for writing this with ChatGPT.",

I’m now looking for gigs in tech that’s not entirely coding (junior spots I guess and yes it would be a salary hit but might be better than staying still here), but still open to leveling up in coding positions itself, is all I can do to upgrade there just projects and leetcode?

Got hired at the end of first year for one of side projects of community member. Fell in love with coding and worked really hard through the summer. Afterwards got an offer into well-established YC-backed company and currently working there as Software Engineer.\n\nAnd honestly - I love every bit of it. But I see two very big problems at the horizon which  am not sure how to tackle yet:\n\n\\- Working with AI is too much. Since I started my serious commitment on a very early stage kind of project - I got used to the principle of speed is the key. And because of that I did a lot of coding with AI (cursor). I didn’t cut it off correctly early enough, and now when I am trying to write code on my own - it takes much more time I feel like I am falling out if industry-needed pace. I can’t say that I am vibe-coding, because I am still very responsible for my code, and I know precisely how something is implemented, and I am not doing “Claude pls code feature” as well, but still like I am feeling that I won’t be able to write code if I don’t have access to AI instruments. So there’s my first question. How normal it is? How do you define an edge between AI slob and speed ups that AI can provide?\n\n\\- Vector of further development? I am trying to study the stuff beyond my actual responsibilities, and I feel like my next big choice is choice of supplementary skills: doing distribution (sales, marketing, PMF and all that kind of stuff) VS digging deeper into architecture, devops and deeply engineering kinds of topics.\n\nArgument of first approach for me are the fact that I can be more independent, but that’s not something I particularly like.\n\nArguments for the second approach are the fact that I love it, but again I love it because I am able to move with fast pace because I have AI. Also, I am not sure how relevant those skills are compared to distribution (e.g Technical guy who can sell is much more desirable part of a startup than just deeply technical guy)\n\nYour feedback is very important to me and is truly appropriated",

I know in this day and age nothing is guaranteed but I want the option with the highest chance.\n\nI love both companies and am very blessed to have this decision to make. Here are some things I believe would be important while considering \n- I already accepted the NVIDIA offer a month ago before hearing back from Google. If I were to choose Google and rescind NVIDIA, that might blacklist me\n- Long-term I want to be on the East Coast and the Google internship puts me in Cambridge while NVIDIA is the Bay but no real NVIDIA presence on East Coast\n- TC ceiling seems to be the same for both\n- I heard Google has had more layoffs in recent years while NVIDIA is very good about not having \n\nI would appreciate any feedback and opinions, thank you and happy new year!",

        "content": "I'm a backend developer with about 3 years of experience. I can solve problems and write code that works, but when I look at code written by senior engineers, there's a clear gap. Mine works but feels fragile in comparison.\n\nIn a recent interview, I implemented a simple inventory system. It worked fine for the happy path, but I realized after some chatting with ChatGPT that I hadn't considered concurrent access, didn't validate inputs, returned mixed types from methods, and used raw dictionaries instead of proper data structures.\n\nFor those who've made this transition:\n\n* How did you develop the instinct to think about edge cases, error handling, and API design automatically?\n* Were there specific resources, projects, or experiences that accelerated your growth?\n* How long did it take before writing \"senior-level\" code became natural?\n\nWhat I'm really asking is how to internalize the software engineering mindset so it becomes second nature.\n\nAny advice or resources appreciated.",

I’m not a developer by background, but I have basic scripting knowledge and learned what was needed to get this working.\n\nOn top of that:\n\nI created additional scripts for internal billing\n\nParticipated in multiple meetings with Security teams to evaluate and approve the apps\n\nActed as the single point of contact for vendors, security, group leaders, and end users\n\nI’m essentially handling this entire project alone, from technical implementation to stakeholder management and ongoing support.\n\n\nI am struggling to find a \"name\" for this role in order to update my CV, since I am not a developer, DevOps, or anything related that I can identify with.\n\n(Made a similar post in another subreddit, IAM looks like )",

However if I get a full time job I will change too studying part time.\n\nI'm not gonna lie and say that I am any good at programming or math,I am really not. So far in my biology degree I've only learned/ used R and some python so far in my biology degree, pretty much only for visualising data into graphs etc...and analysing variation (flag outline data) and also basic stats t-tests,\nlinear regression\ncorrelation analysis\n R (built-in stats)\n\nAnd from what I understand the increase of LLM tools is making it harder and harder to get jobs in the space, also I am not great at maths.\n\nSo us there any hope for me ? And with me not actually studying computer science what kind of angal should I come from and how would I approach this.\n\nMy primary goal is too get a job as fast as possible and move out.\n\nI am uk based\n",
