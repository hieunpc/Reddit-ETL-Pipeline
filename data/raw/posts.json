Then I’m digging through old PRs and docs like I never learned it in the first place.\n\n\\- Switching context messes me up hard. One interruption and it takes forever to get my mental picture back.\n\nI’m not posting this to be dramatic, I just want to know if this is common and what people do about it.\n\nIf you’re a data engineer (or similar) with ADHD, what do you struggle with the most? \n\nAny coping systems that actually worked for you?

Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.\n\nWhat is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?\nFivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them \"benefit\" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.\n\nWill Fivetran survive this one? My customer is already thinking about alternatives.. what is your opinion?",

        "author": "kotrfa",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I know this subreddit kinda hates LLM solutions, but I think there is an undeniable and underappreciated fact about this. If you search on various forums like SO, reddit, community forums of various data platforms etc. for terms like (would link them, but can't here):\n\n1. fuzzy matching\n2. string distance\n3. CRM contact matching\n4. software list matching\n5. cross-referencing \\[spreadsheets\\]\n6. ...\n\nand so on, you find hundreds or thousands of posts dealing with seemingly easy issues where you have the classic example of not having your join keys exactly matching, and having to do some preprocessing or softening of the keys on which to match. This problem is usually trivial for humans, but very hard to generically solve. Solutions range from stuff like fuzzy string matching, levenshtein distance, word2vec/embedding to custom ML approaches. I personally have spent hundreds of hours over the course of my career putting together horrendous regexes (with various degrees of success). I do think there is still use for these techniques in some relatively specific cases, such as when we are talking about big data and stuff, but for all those CRMs systems that need to match customers to companies that are under 100k rows of rows and so on, it's IMHO solved for negligible cost (like dollars compared to hundreds or thousands of hours of human labour). \n\nThere are different shades of \"matching\" - I think most of the readers imagine something like a pure \"join\" with matching keys, a pretty rare case in the world of messy spreadsheets or outside of RDBMs. Then there are some trivial cases of transformation like capitalization of strings where you can pretty easily get to a canonical form and match on that. Then there are those cases that you still can get quite far with some kind of \"statistic\" distance. And finally there are scenarios where you need some kind of \"semantic distance\". The latter, IMHO the hardest, is something like matching list of S&P500 companies, where you can't really get the results correct unless you do some kind of (web)search. Example is e.g. a ticker change for Facebook in 2022 from FB to META. I believe today LLMs opened the door to solving all of those.\n\nFor example, a classic issue companies have is matching all the used software by anyone in the company to licenses or whitelisted providers. This can be now done by something like this python-pseudocode:\n\n    software = pd.read_csv(\"software.csv\", columns=[\"name\"])\n    suppliers = set(pd.read_csv(\"suppliers.csv\", columns=[\"company\"]))\n    \n    def find_sw_supplier(software_name: str, suppliers: set[str]) -> str | None:\n        return call_llm_agent(\n            f\"Find the supplier of {software_name}, try to match it to the name of a company from the following list: {suppliers}. If you can't find a match, return None.\",\n            tools=[WebSearch],\n        )\n    \n    for software_name in software[\"name\"]:\n        supplier = find_sw_supplier(software_name, suppliers)\n        df.loc[idx, \"supplier\"] = supplier\n\nIt is a bit tricky to run at scale, and can get pricey, but depending on a task it can be drawn down quite significantly depending on the usecase. For example, for our usecases we were able to trim down the cost and latency in our pipelines by doing some routing (like only sending to LLMs what isn't solved by local approaches like regexes) and by batching LLMs calls together and ultimately fit it into something like (disclosure: this is our implementation):\n\n    from everyrow.ops import merge\n    \n    result = await merge(\n        task=\"Match trial sponsors with parent companies\",\n        left_table=trial_data,\n        right_table=pharma_companies,\n        merge_on_left=\"sponsor\",\n        merge_on_right=\"company\",\n    )\n\nand given these cases are basically embarrassingly parallel (in the stupidest way, you throw every row on all the options), the latency mostly boils down to the available throughput and longest-llm-agent-with-search, in our case we are running virtually arbitrary (publicly web-searchable) problems under 5 minutes and 2-5$/1k of rows to merge (trivial cases are of course for 0, most of the cost is eaten by LLMs generations and web search through things like serper and stuff). \n\nThis is of course one of the few classes of problems that are possible now and weren't before. I don't know, but I find it fascinating - in my 10-year career, I haven't experienced such a shift. And unless I am blind, it seems like this still hasn't been picked up by some of the industries (judging based on the questions from the various sales forums and stuff). Are people just building this in-house and it's just not visible, or am I overestimating how common this pain point is?",

He spent 9 months doing nothing but small contributions to an internal R package, correcting data tests for new hires, and organizing meetings. while I found myself doing tool discovery and teaching myself DE from the ground up. for now I have managed to. write a data ingestion pipeline with dlt, orchestrated with GitHub actions running via docker on azure. But I am getting frustrated as I am not getting the technical guidance, not the strategic Vision for the project. I feel like our progress is too small, and eventually someone from the senior team (who are not data engineering knowledgeable) will notice and fire us. I asked him multiple times to push back on menial small tasks , and he does for a while then goes back to the same shtick. The one time I managed to engage him in the implementation of the pipeline, he fixated on dlt getting 'seemingly' stuck at the load phase, took 3 weeks experimenting.. only for me to take on the same task and write a report in two days about how the issue is that our postgres instance runs out of IOPS quickly during initial loads and the slowness has nothing with dlt or my implementation. \n\nI am asking for guidance on how to make the best out of this as I am certain I cannot make the move to another job any time soon .

Logs are empty.\n\nSetup: Spark 3.5.1 on YARN 3.4, 2 executors u/16GB, driver 8GB, S3A Parquet, Java 21, G1GC. Tried unpersist, clearCache, checkpoint, extended heartbeats, GC monitoring. Memory stays stable.\n\nSuspect Dataset lineage or plan metadata accumulates across iterations and triggers silent termination.\n\nIs the recommended approach now structured streaming micro-batches or restarting batch jobs each loop?

        "content": "1 year on from a disastrous tech assessment ended up landing me the job, a recruiter reached out and offered me a chat for what is basically my dream roll. AWS Data Engineer to develop an ingestion and analytics pipelines from IoT devices. \n\nPretty much owning the provisioning and pipeline process from the ground up supporting a team of data scientists and analysts. \n\nEvery other chat I've been to in my past 3 jobs has been me battling with imposter syndrome. But today, I got this, I know this shiz. I've been shoehorning AWS into my workflow wherever I can, I built a simulated corporate VPC and production ML workloads, learned the CDK syntax, built an S3 lake house.\n\nBut I go to the chat and its really light on actual AWS stuff. They are more interested in my thought process and problem solving. Very refreshing, enjoyable even. \n\nSo why am I falling over on the world's simplest pipelines. 10 million customer dataset, approx 10k product catalogue, product data in one table, transaction data captured from a streaming source daily. \n\nOne of the bullet points is \"The marketing team are interested in tracking the number of times an item is bought for the first time each day\" explain how you would build this pipeline.\n\nAlready covered flattening the nested JSON data into a columner silver layer. I read how many times an item is bought the first time each day as \"how do you track first occurance of an item bought that day\"\n\nThe other person in the chat had to correct my thinking and say no, what they mean is how do you track when the customer first purchased an item overall. \n\nBut then Im reeling from the screw up. I talk about creating a staging table with the 1st occurance each day and then adding the output of this to a final table in the gold layer. She says so where would the intermediate table live, I say it wouldn't be a real table its an in memory transformation step (meaning Id use filter pushdown and schema inference of the parquet in silver to pull the distinct customerid, productid, min(timestamp) and merge into gold where customerid productid doesn't exist. \n\nshe said that would be unworkable with data of this size to have an in memory table, and rather than explain I didnt mean that I would dump 100 million rows into EC2 RAM, I kind of just said ah yeah, it makes sense to realise this in its own bucket. \n\nBut im already in a twist by this point. \n\nThen on the drive home I'm thinking that was so dumb, if I had read the question properly its so obvious that I should have just explained that I'd create a look up table \n\nwith the pertinent columns, customerid, productid, firstpurchase date. \n\nthe pipeline is new data, first purchase per customer of that days data, merge into where not exists (maybe a overwrite if new firstpurchasedate < current firstpurchasedate to handle late arrival). \n\nSo this is eating away at me and I think screw it, im just going to email the other chat person and explain what I meant or how I would actually approach it. So i did. it was a long boring email (similar to this post). But rather than make me feel better about the screw up Im now just in full cringe mode about emailing the chatter. its not the done thing. \n\nRecruiter didn't even call for a debrief. \n\nfml \n\nchat = view of the int",

        "content": "I work at a company with a fairly mature data stack, but we still struggle with environment management and upstream dependency changes.\n\nOur data engineering team builds foundational warehouse tables from upstream business systems using a standard dev/test/prod setup. That part works as expected: they iterate in dev, validate in test with stakeholders, and deploy to prod.\n\nMy team sits downstream as analytics engineers. We build data marts and models for reporting, and we also have our own dev/test/prod environments. The problem is that our environments point directly at the upstream teams’ dev/test/prod assets. In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing. That is expected behavior, but it makes downstream development painful.\n\nAs a result:\n\n* We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.\n* People often develop against prod data just to get stability (which goes against CI/CD)\n* Dev ends up running on full datasets, which is slow and expensive.\n* Issues only fully surface in prod.\n\nI’m considering proposing the following:\n\n* **Dev:** Use a small, representative slice of upstream data (e.g., ≤10k rows per table) that we own as stable dev views/tables.\n* **Test:** A direct copy of prod to validate that everything truly works, including edge cases.\n* **Prod:** Point to upstream prod as usual.\n\nDoes this approach make sense? How do teams typically handle downstream dev/test when upstream data is constantly changing?\n\nRelated question: schema changes. Upstream tables aren’t versioned, and schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?",

        "content": "Afternoon folks, long time lurker, first time poster.    I have spent some time recently getting up to speed with different ways to work with data in/out of Apache Iceberg and exploring different analytics tools / visualisation options.  I use Cloudflare a lot for my side projects, and have recently seen the 'Beta' data platform products incl. the idea of https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/.    \n  \nSo, I decided to give it a go and see if I can build a real end to end data pipeline (the example is product analytics in this case but you could use it for other purposes of course).  I hope the link to my own project is OK, but it's MIT / open source: https://github.com/cliftonc/icelight.\n\nMy reflections / how it works:\n\n\\- Its definitely a beta, as I had to re-create the pipelines once or twice to get it all to actually sync through to R2 ... but it really works!  \n\\- There is a bit of work to get it all wired up, hence why I created the above project to try and automate it.  \n\\- You can run analytics tools (in this example DuckDB - https://duckdb.org/) in containers now and use these to analyse data on R2.  \n\\- Workers are what you use to bind it all together, and they work great.  \n\\- I think (given zero egress fees in R2) you could run this at very low cost overall (perhaps even inside the free tier if you don't have a lot of data or workload).   No infrastructure at all to manage, just 2 workers and a container (if you want DuckDB).  \n\\- I ran into quite a few issues with DuckDB as I didn't fully appreciate that its single process constraints - I had always assumed it was actually a real server - but actually it seems to now work very well with a bit of tweaking, and the fact it is near Postgres capable but running on parquet files on R2 is nothing short of amazing.  \n\\- I have it flushing every minute at the moment to R2, not sure what this means longer term but will send a lot more data at it over coming weeks and see how it goes. \n\nHappy to talk more about it if anyone is interested in this, esp. given Cloudflare is very early into the data engineering world. I am in no way affiliated with Cloudflare, though if anyone from Cloudflare is listening I would be more than happy to chat about my experiences :D \n\n\n\n",

I've been in my most recent role for 3 years and I realised at about the 2 year mark that I was about as senior as I could get in my team and was not learning anything new - simply applying my extensive experience/knowledge on the field to providing solutions/analyses for stakeholders.\n\nThat realisation combined with a live demonstration from Snowflake on the agentic future of analysis got me looking for the next logical career step. There is a data engineering secondment opportunity in my org that will likely be made permanent, so I really need to knuckle down and decide.\n\nOver the last year, the most enjoyment that I've had has not been when providing any insights, but in building data models for reports and in creating small tools using Streamlit/Python to help stakeholders/team members self-serve and reduce friction. The tool-building component is what I found the most enjoyment in because it was all new with a steep/rapid learning curve. Creating the actual permanent BI reports is also interesting and rewarding, but less engaging because there's generally less of a problem to solve there. What does everyone find the most engaging about their role in data engineering?\n\nI don't actually have any formal training or experience in working in an ITIL system as I've always operated under a merchandising/marketing team structure, so I'm not sure at all how I'd go with a more rigid structure and more rigid processes. Has anyone moved in a similar fashion from a more \"fast and loose\" team to a more structured/process-heavy team? What are the pros/cons there?\n\nAnd finally, what does everyone find the most frustating about data engineering? From my brief exposure to the teams that handle it, I imagine that it would be stuff like; undocumented data sources and trying to find the correct joins, validation and constant data quality checks, getting clear answers from a BA on the requirements so that you can create an efficient schema/model.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I’m a 2025 graduate in Big Data Analytics and currently looking for my first job. It’s been about 5.5 months since my internship ended, and during this time I’ve been doing a lot of reflection on my academic journey. The program was supposed to prepare us for roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist, but honestly, I have mixed feelings about how effective it really was.\n\nOver three years, we covered a huge range of topics: statistics, machine learning, big data, databases, networking, cybersecurity, embedded systems, image processing, mobile development, Java EE/ spring bot, SaaS development, ETL, data warehousing, Kafka, spark, and more. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, it often felt scattered and a bit inefficient.\n\nWe kept jumping between multiple languages (C, java, python, javascript) without enough time to truly master any of them. Many technical modules stayed very theoretical, with little connection to real-world use cases: real datasets, real production pipelines, proper data engineering workflows, or even how to debug a broken pipeline beyond adding print statements. Some courses were rushed, some poorly structured, and others lacked continuity or practical guidance.\n\n\n\nI know university is meant to build foundations, not necessarily teach the latest trendy tools. Still, I feel the curriculum could have been more focused and better aligned with what data roles actually require today, such as:\n\n* strong SQL and solid database design\n* Strong python for data processing and pipelines \n* Real ETL and data modeling projects \n* Distributed systems with clear, practical applications\n* A clear separation between web development tracks and data tracks\n* Better guidance on choosing ML algorithms depending on the use case\n\nInstead, everything was mixed together: web dev, mobile dev, low-level systems, data science, big data, and business, without a clear specialization path.\n\nNow I’m trying to fill the gaps by self-studying and building real projects, mainly with a data engineering focus. For context, here are the main projects I worked on during my internships:\n\n1. Machine test results dashboard  \n\n* A web application to visualize machine test results.  \n* Stack: Django REST Framework, MongoDB, React.\n\nIt was a 2-person project over 2 months. I was responsible for defining what should be displayed (failure rate, failure rate by machine/section, etc.) and implementing the calculation logic while making sure the results were accurate. I also helped with the frontend even though it was my first time using JavaScript. A lot of it was assisted by chatgpt and claude, then reviewed and corrected with my teammate.\n\n2. Unix server resource monitoring system   \n\nA server monitoring platform providing:\n\n* Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network via websockets  \n* Historical analysis with time-series visualization\n* ML-based anomaly detection using Isolation Forest\n* Server management (CRUD, grouping, health tracking)\n* Scalable architecture with Kafka streaming and redis caching\n\nStack: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, redis, Kafka, Angular 15, all containerized with Docker.\n\nI admit the stack is more “web-heavy” than “pure data engineering,” but it was chosen to match the company’s ecosystem and increase hiring chances (especially Angular, since most of their tech team were web developers). Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to a position.\n\nNow I’d really need advice from people already working in data engineering:\n\n* What core skills should I prioritize first? \n* How deep should I go into SQL, Python, and system design?\n* What kinds of projects best show readiness for a junior data engineer role(and where can i get the data like the millions of rows of data aside from web scraping)?\n* How do you personally bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations?\n*  What are your thoughts on certifications like those on Coursera?\n* And for the love of god … how do you convince HR that even if you’ve never used their exact stack, you have the fundamentals and can become operational quickly?\n\nAny advice, feedback, or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\*  \n\nMy data program covered a lot but felt too scattered and too theoretical to fully prepare for real data engineering roles. I’m now self-learning, building projects, and looking for guidance on what skills to prioritize and how to position myself as a solid junior data engineer.",

        "author": "BuissnessRake",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello! This is my first post in this sub. I’ve seen a lot of strong practical advice here and would like to get multiple perspectives on how to approach a messy data cleanup and modeling problem.\n\nUntil recently, I worked mostly at startups, so I never dealt with serious legacy data issues. I just joined a midsized private company as an “Analyst.” During the hiring process, after hearing about their challenges, I told them it sounded like they really needed a data engineer or more specifically an analytics engineer. They said nope we just need an analyst, which i thought was odd. FYI: They already have an ERP system, but the data is fragmented, difficult to retrieve, and widely acknowledged across the company as dirty and hard to work with.\n\nOnce I joined, I got access to the tools I needed fairly quickly by befriending IT. However, once I started digging into the ERP backend, I found some fundamental problems. For example, there are duplicated primary keys in header tables. While this can be handled downstream, it highlights that even basic principles like first normal form were not followed. I understand ERPs are often denormalized, but this still feels extreme.\n\nSome historical context that likely contributed to this:\n\n* In the past, someone was directly injecting data via SQL\n* The company later migrated to a cloud ERP\n* Business processes have changed multiple times since then\n\nAs a result, naming conventions, supplier numbers, product numbers, and similar identifiers have all changed over time, often for the same logical entity. Sales data is especially messy. Some calculated fields do not align with what is defined in the ERP’s data dictionary, and overall there is very little shared understanding or trust in the data across the company.\n\nConstraints I am working under:\n\n* I have read-only access to the ERP and cannot write data back, which is appropriate since it is the raw source\n* of-course the ERP is not a read-optimized database, so querying it directly is painful\n* There are over 20,000 tables in total, but after filtering out audit, temp, deprecated, and empty tables, I am down to roughly 500 tables\n* Total row count across those tables is likely 40 to 50 million rows, though normalization makes that hard to reason about\n* I am the first and only data-focused hire\n\nThe business context also matters. There are no real long-term data goals right now. Most work is short-term:\n\n* One-week automations of existing manual processes\n* One to two month dashboard and reporting projects\n\nStakeholders primarily want reports, dashboards, and automated spreadsheets. There is very little demand for deeper analysis, which makes sense given how unreliable the underlying data currently is. Most teams rely heavily on Excel and tribal knowledge, and there is effectively zero SQL experience among stakeholders.\n\nMy initial instinct was to stand up a SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance and start building cleaned, documented models or data marts by domain. However, I am not convinced that:\n\n1. I will get buy-in for that approach\n2. It is the right choice given maintainability and the short-term nature of most deliverables\n\nAs a fallback, I may end up pulling subsets of tables directly into Power BI and doing partial cleaning and reshaping using Power Query transformations just to get something usable in front of stakeholders.\n\nSo my core question is:  \n**How would you approach cleaning, organizing, documenting, and storing this kind of historically inconsistent ERP data while still delivering short-term reports and dashboards that stakeholders are expecting?**\n\nIf I am misunderstanding anything about ERPs, analytics engineering, or data modeling in this context, I would appreciate being corrected.",

Having not drawn up one of these before, is there anything major I'm missing or others would do differently?\n\nThe solution will continue in Azure only so I am wondering whether an AWS Athena layer is even necessary here as a pre-processing step.

There has been very little growth in my career, my financial savings have not improved, and over time it has started affecting my health as well. This situation has been mentally exhausting, and I often feel uncertain about where my career is heading.\n\nBecause of this, I am now thinking seriously about switching to a different role or moving into a new domain.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have built data engineering solutions (with spark) in HDInsight, Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Fabric.\n\nSometimes building a solution will go smoothly; and other times I cannot even connect to my remote resources.  In Fabric the connectivity can be very frustrating.  They have a home-grown networking technology that lets spark notebooks connect to Azure resources.  The interface is called \"Managed Private Endpoints\" (MPE).  It is quite different than connecting via normal service endpoints (within a VNET).  This home-grown technology used to be very unreliable and buggy; but about a year ago it finally became about as reliable as normal TCP/IP (albeit there is still a non-zero SLA for this technology, that you can find in their docs.)\n\nThe main complaint I have with MPE's is that Microsoft is required to make them available on a \"onesie-twosie\" basis for each and every distinct azure resource that you want to connect to!  The virtualized networking software seems like it must be written in resource-dependent way.\n\nMicrosoft had asked Synapse customers to move to Fabric a couple years ago, before introducing many of the critical MPE's.  The missing MPE's have been a show-stopper, since we had previously relied on them in Synapse.  About a month ago they FINALLY introduce a way to use an MPE to connect our spark workloads to our private REST APIs (HTTP with FQDN host names).  That is a step forward, although the timing leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThere are other MPE's that are still not available.  Is anyone aware why network connectivity doesn't get prioritized at Microsoft?  It seems like such a critical requirement for data engineers to connect to our data!!  If I had to make guess, these delays are probably for non-technical reasons.  In this SaaS platform Microsoft is accustomed to making a large profit on their so-called \"gateways\" that move data to ADF and Dataflows (putting it into Fabric storage).  Those data-movement activities will burn thru a ton of our CU credits ... whereas making a direct connection to MPE resources is going to have a much lower cost to customers.  As always, it is frustrating to use a SaaS where the vendor puts their own interests far above those of the customer.   \n  \nIs there another explanation for the lack of MPE network connectivity into our azure tenant?

My little brother fell into that trap, he grabbed a paid Python course and treated it like school, watch video copy solution and move on. He felt productive every day, but the moment a task changed even a little, he froze like nothing really stuck\n\nWhat helped him was joining a free course where there were no answers, you either figured it out or you stayed stuck, It was frustrating, he hated it at first BUT that’s when things started to click!\n\nNow with AI tools like Blackbox around, it’s even easier to skip the hard part, you get a working answer in seconds. The lie is thinking that speed equals learning\n\nReal learning is sitting with confusion. Breaking things. Being wrong. Not knowing what to type next. That discomfort is the skill\n\nCode isn’t learned by watching, It’s learned by getting stuck and staying there a bit longer than feels comfortable",

Fixing bugs without creating 5 more. Knowing what NOT to touch.\nWe actually don't get senior by building 100 apps. We get senior by sticking with a few and actually maintaining them. Seeing what breaks. Learning why it was built that way.\nEven if you code for fun try updating your 6-month-old project. You'll learn more from that than starting fresh.\nI finally learned, we're hired to maintain, not rebuild. That's where the real skill is. \n\nWho has also noticed this in their programming career?",

And you don't have to search around trying to find repos or youtube videos giving you personal project ideas. There is already is massive library of built ideas you can look at, the chrome extension web store!!\n\n  \nFor example:\n\n* Security (input sanitation, rate limiting, actual useful cache management). \n* Cloudflare, which can be useful for several of the above (they have many great COMPLETELY FREE products available).\n* Performance and the value of keeping your bundle size small.\n* Also non-tech skills like competitive research, marketing, consistent branding, etc.\n*  Bonus points if you use a framework like [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) to make your extension available on Firefox.\n* Setting clear acceptance criteria / deliverables and completing them within a timeline. \n* Added bonus: chrome/cloudflare give you a bunch of data/analytics about usage for free, which can be extremely gratifying to see real people logging in and using your tool.\n\nI've been there, building personal projects to bolster your resume can be a hard and sometimes exhausting task. So if you're looking for something more bite-sized, give building an extension a shot. Good luck!",

The issue I ran into was that the \"docs\" if you can even call them that are so confusing and the code just doesn't work with my stack, cause my stack is react, typescript, nextjs and I chose the setup for nextjs and it was all code in js so in my mind I was thinking I could just easily fix the type issues and that was going to be it but it didn't work like that, there were no type issues it was other errors that there docs had no help with. So how am I supposed to fix this when with API's its not like other problems with crud where its usually just giving the issue to you, like every website I look at to setup stripe its completely different code across all those websites. So what I'm trying to ask is how do you learn API's cause googling has done nothing for me, and I've used AI to try to help me and gotten nowhere cause I've heard that somehow stripe is one of the easiest API's for beginners to work with. I've also heard that all API's have the same structure so getting over that initial learning hurdle is the hardest but how true is that?",

        "author": "Positive_Invite_5665",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Before you read this is just my experience from using Codecademy as a $200 a year paying user (https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/penguingnop). I probably will get flamed for this.. and it's fine. My view is probably shared with like 10 people or whatever.\n\nSo I subscribed to Codecademy's $200 a year Pro plan in September of 2025, I excited to learn React and backend technologies. \nAnd before subscribing a few days later, I did some free courses and thought they were decent. But when I finished the Lua course, I realized I didn't learn loops.. Like who the hell teaches Lua without loops? \n(Maybe when you're reading this there was a new update)\nBut I brushed it off thinking, \"Hey, it's probably because it's a free coursee\", though I was disappointed.\n\nAfter subscribing, I started taking their React course and felt completely lost. Like why this scaffold/file system? Why was I suddenly dropped into a dir with files that aren't even jsx? But I did spend a few more hours on it.. and I gave up. The biggest problem I have with this is that the course teaches React v18 to people **NEW to coding**, but why would a new dev want to learn outdated React? Another big issue is that they don't use modern standards like Vite. Like they use some custom project structure, how is that supposed to benefit learners? It also doesn’t use Vite, or even explain how `index.html`, `app.jsx`.. I mean, `app.js` work. New learners are dropped into a dated custom structure with near zero context. And if it wasn't clear what the issue was:\n- Teaching React v18, which is 4 years outdated\n- Not explaining the files or file system\n- (Personally) Not using modern build tools like Vite, and scaffold like create@vite\n\nI then tried the Frontend Career Path, hoping it would make me much better at frontend. I stopped at 29%. The teaching style felt like multiple concepts crammed into single lessons, and outdated YouTube videos from like 4+ years ago. Like, at least use a good camera, mic, and lighting for tutorials, and keep them updated. Most, if not all videos I saw were low quality laptop recordings with crap audio, spoken from heart, crap webcam, and an unconvincing tone. The tone feels like they're at gunpoint forced to sound happy. It's just so depressing.\n\nAfter quitting the frontend path, I tried the backend path. It was slightly better since the JavaScript was ES6+.. sometimes because they still use `require()`. It shouldn't matter though since it's just JavaScript... except they teach backend tools that've evolved a lot since they made the course. if anyone completed the course, it'll be like a kid who traveled back in time to learn what was \"modern\" in that time, NodeJS 17 and whatever ExpressJS they had, by the time the kid comes back to the present day, he'll see that tons of things has changed. And paying $200 a year for outdated content feels terrible. And that money matters to me, 200 is a lot even if it's just yearly.\n\nI've sent a few emails to support, but the replies are all the same generic response from Colleen:\n```\nThank you so much for sharing your feedback! We're constantly working to improve our curriculum based on the feedback that we receive from our customers. I'll be sure to pass along your note to the curriculum team for review.\n```\nI'm not sure if Colleen is coping and pasting emails or actually doing anything. When I get responses like this, I feel like they don't give a damn. It feels like the engineers and people over at Codecademy are either lazy or barely working.\n\nI regret the purchase, worst of all I have to go through support to get a refund, but after multiple identical replies from Colleen about 'passing feedback along,' I have absolutely NO confidence in getting a refund\n\nThis whole experience has demotivated me. When I subscribed, I had light and excitement in my eyes. Now I'm so demotivated that I'm starting to think about others who might feel the same.\n\nSo.. to end this, here's my advice to Codecademy: Keep courses updated, invest in engineers wellbeing, get a proper studio for tutorials, and make coding fun again. People who come to you rely on you, so it is your responsibility to make sure what they learn is updated, well paced and not cramming 10 topics in a lesson, and not \"AI INTERVIEW!!!\"\n\nI'm probably the first to say this, and probably one of the very few who feel this way..\n\nAnd to anyone reading this, please share your story. I'd love to hear from you and I'll try my best to comment on your experience or just \"comments\"",

This means I feel behind when doing something like working on Linux.

E.g a comment to summarise the next 10 lines of code. This of course clashes against the principle of \"comments should explain why something is there and not what it's doing\".\n\nMany open source projects I see, from my perspective, have little to no code comments where I think they would help. I understand the point of self-documenting code but if a few comments would have sped up comprehension rate by 3x then what would be the harm?\n\nThe only strong counter-agument I could think of against lots of comments is that it could be used as a crutch to write bad code but I'm not sure.\n\nI guess the most extreme form of my question would be \"what would be the harm for a project to have many useless comments if we can just quickly skip over them?\"\n",

No offence but yeah I want someone who can actually focus on the specific problems I have and guide me through the work so I can actually UNDERSTAND it not just do the problem in front of me and say \"See?\" And I also tried a site called Wyzant last semester, it's honestly quite expensive and the guy I chose was actually quite good but honestly a bit unreliable with scheduling and stuff so we didn't end up meeting much.

Are there any tips or books that I could get to help me solve this or is it purely just not knowing the language enough?\n\n  \nRust Version: [https://github.com/Ghost9887/ghostdb/tree/master](https://github.com/Ghost9887/ghostdb/tree/master)",

I've completed the Helsinki Python MOOC (intro + advanced), so I'm comfortable with Python fundamentals like control flow, functions, OOP, classes, and basic file handling. I originally did this to support LeetCode practice. I've recently decided that I want to do backend engineering .\n\nRight now, I'm trying to maximize my chances of getting a job postgrad. With Python, I can start backend development immediately using a framework like FastAPI or Django and focus on learning backend concepts rather than spending time learning a new language and its syntax.\n\nMy main question is whether Python plus a backend stack is still a solid path to a backend engineering role without significantly limiting opportunities. If Python meaningfully limits backend roles, I'm open to switching now to something like Java. However, if Python is still viable, sticking with it would let me make faster progress since I wouldn't need to relearn syntax and tooling. I'd appreciate any advice on whether sticking with Python or switching languages would be the best move given my situation.",

I'm in my senior year, my friends keep saying I am in a good situation (they’re focused on frontend and UI/UX, so I’m not in the same boat as them), that I am in a better state than they are, but I don't know what to do in the internship or OJT phase of uni, I tried to apply once for voluntary internship, but there was an assessment, within 2 weeks we need to learn a framework as an assessment we need to finish a 2 full stack web application, first one I passed I used a REST architecture which I am familiar with so it was easy, then the second one we need to learn Vue js as-well as graphql in ruby on rails, ruby on rails was the easy part, but the time constraint on finishing the assessment was the problem, had trouble in balancing uni and that assessment, so I was removed, and I haven't tried to apply to an internship again after that. The main problem I have right now is that I overly relied on AI in my later projects. I know how to code (OOP concepts, SOLID and DRY), some DSA, but on coding interviews, I didn't do well. I overthink the solution, and so I failed some test cases. I'm trying to relearn what I knew before AI affected me. Any advice in general, I'm taking a Java NC III class right now, as well, to rebuild my Java familiarity. I'm in my senior year, and I don't know what internship I want. Should I go dev because I have been doing this for a very long time, or go into networking, because that is a niche and programming is needed there as well?",

It’s called Kuse Cowork — an experimental, local-first AI cowork / agent workspace inspired by Claude Cowork, but with a different set of tradeoffs.\n\nThe core idea is simple: BYOK by default (your own API keys or local models like Ollama / LM Studio), a pure Rust agent backend, local files stay local, and commands run in isolated Docker containers. It’s cross-platform via Tauri (macOS / Windows / Linux), supports extensible “skills” for real workflows (docs, PDFs, spreadsheets), and has MCP built in for tool integration. No hosted inference, no proxying — everything runs on your machine.\n\nIt’s still early and pretty rough in places, so I’m mostly sharing this to get feedback. Does this approach to local agent workspaces make sense? Are skills / MCP the right abstraction, or is this over-engineered? Any obvious security or UX red flags? Repo is here if you want to poke around or roast it:\n\n👉 [https://github.com/kuse-ai/kuse-cowork](https://github.com/kuse-ai/kuse-cowork)\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or blunt feedback!",

The grueling part is when I can’t find the solution for my exact problem in the program. And another issue is I cannot for the life of me figure it out on my own unless I find an article or forum online hinting at what I must do to solve it once and for all.\n\n\n\nWhat do you all do in this situation?

(I thought I was in a test directory, but it turns out I was in the root folder when I ran this command) This is a non-critical system (news aggregation site for enterprise customers which get 50 views) and thankfully there is no user/customer data involved and the core product is mostly unaffected by this. \n\nHere’s the situation:\n\n- No backups or snapshots (confirmed by IT/infra)\n\n- No practical recovery path (IT says restore is not possible)\n\n- Production drifted from git (repo is outdated vs what was actually running)  Turns out people have been working on the live server without commiting anything on git\n\n- Access controls were weak (multiple people had access; no guardrails/approvals except ssh'in into the server)\n\n- Knowledge transfer/runbooks are incomplete, so “what exactly was on prod” is fuzzy. \n\n\nCurrent plan: rebuild using the outdated git repo as the baseline. That likely means we can get a working version back, it would be extremely outdated and all the work we did since then will be lost.\n\nMy manager, who also happens to be the CEO of this company, is extremely upset and said he’s “never seen anything like this in his 20 years as an IT person,” and is threatening termination and potential legal action if it isn’t recovered. I know I made a serious mistake. I’m trying to focus on restoration for now (We are 50 percent complete)\n\nMost importantly, how do I cover myself legally? Any advice",

        "author": "philosograppler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI haven’t posted on this subreddit before, but I’m at a point where I really need some outside perspective on what to do next.\n\nI’m based in NYC and I’ve been working as a software engineer for about six years. I originally got into this field because I wanted to learn to code so I could build my own ideas and maybe start something one day, but I haven’t really acted on that goal the way I thought I would.\n\nFor most of my career I was at a large Fortune 500 company. I was there for five years and then lost my job due to restructuring that turned into mass layoffs. Right after that I traveled a bit and then started job searching. It felt endless. Once I got interview-ready again it still took about six months to land another role.\n\nI thought I finally found the perfect fit. It was a hybrid role at a startup events company where I’d be a Senior SWE working across web and mobile. I joined a newly formed AI R&D team as the first hire. Since the team was brand new there was no PM, no designer, and no scrum master, so it was mostly just me working directly with my manager, who had also just been promoted into management.\n\nFrom the beginning things felt messy. Deadlines were vague and product goals kept shifting from sprint to sprint. Then the CEO fired the cofounder, suddenly changed the company from hybrid to mandatory five days a week in-office, and later fired one of the two engineering managers.\n\nNot long after that I was let go for “performance reasons,” despite never being put on a PIP. When I try to be honest with myself about what they might be referring to, I can only point to two things. One was the CEO being upset that I was late to an all-hands meeting, but I didn’t even know it was happening because my manager forgot to put it on my calendar when I first joined, so I arrived about 30 minutes late. The other was a deadline to switch our product over to a different API endpoint that supported local testing. My manager wrote the backend for it, but the environment I needed to test in was constantly tied up by other engineers, so I moved onto another priority and that pushed the API switch back.\n\nA big part of the frustration is that I was building on top of backend code my manager had basically stitched together quickly, and it didn’t follow basic REST principles. The delay on the API work wasn’t only about me moving slowly. There was technical debt and there were delays and blockers that were out of my control too. I’m not saying I did everything perfectly, but when they let me go and I asked what specifically was wrong, the only answer I got was “poor code quality.” I can’t shake the feeling that once our team started missing deadlines, my manager needed someone to blame, and I ended up being the easiest target for the CEO.\n\nI was only there for five months, and getting let go like that has really messed with my confidence and mental health. Now I don’t know what the right move is. Part of me wants to jump back into applying immediately. Another part of me wants to finally take this as a push to work on my own startup ideas. Right after this happened, I swore I’d do everything I could to make sure I could work for myself eventually, but I’m not fully confident I can actually bring one of my ideas to life.\n\nOn top of that, I have ADHD, and I’ve always had this constant background feeling of underperforming or that I’ve forgotten something important. This whole situation has made that a lot worse, and it’s hard not to spiral into those thoughts.\n\nIf you’ve been through something like this, how did you decide what to do next? Would you focus on getting back into a stable job first, or would you take a risk and try to build something for yourself?",

I’ve been one of their top performers but the pay growth has plateaued.

They also make you pay the very expensive parking downtown. They also lay off 5% of their workforce every year and I’ve seen multiple people on my team let go. I would’ve been okay with everything but recently, one of the higher ups said that they’re tracking how many hours we work in the office, the time we come to the office, the time we leave the office, and there’ll be consequences for everything - which is kind of unreasonable considering that we attend meetings with other regions very early in the morning, work on releases very late at night and respond to incidents and downtimes during the weekends from home. We’ve made this job our life but they make it harder every day and don’t pay us much either.\n\nAnyways, I luckily got an interview call from Netflix. It’s a remote role, my pay is going up significantly and everything looks perfect on the surface. So, if someone worked/works over there, how is it really like working remotely as an SDE at Netflix? What’s the catch? Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day? How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus? How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year? How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it well (my partner and I are planning to have a baby next year)? What do you think about the health insurance they offer? Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?",

I also managed two other teams, that work on five other products and when I asked this individual “ what’s gonna happen there?” he basically was like “ you’ll pretty much be able to do this on the side!” 😳\n\nBasically, since then, I have pulled down the code and it’s a absolute mess, aside from the fact that the performance is utterly atrocious and it’s extremely slow and unintuitive, the code is literally a trash fire pile of AI generated slop. Absolutely no organization, insane architectural decisions that for the sake of anonymity, I won’t go into. And overall, just like an insane volume of code that it would take a human being a very very very, very, very, very, very long time to read through and understand even half of it.\n\nAll the while I’ve been trying to make heads or tails of the code base the executives keep pushing 1 million commits a day, they are like rejoicing in their slack channel. They are so over the moon that finally they can just build whatever they want. Ironically they don’t see the pattern that every time they push something they report a bug or report something else being broken, but I’m also not banking on them noticing that pattern.\n\nThey keep making remarks about how companies that aren’t doing exactly what they’re doing right now are going to fail. They keep making remarks that they finally solved the puzzle. It’s becoming clear that they do not value software engineers and they’ve got it all figured out, from their perspective.\n\nI’m not really sure what to do here, I have a product manager that has been tapped to product manage this and we had a call today where we were basically”WTF is going on”. We have a meeting next week to level set, but I’m just kind of anxious for the outcome of that part of me kinda just wants to say in the most professional way possible “ I don’t know what you guys really need me for it seems like you’ve got it figured out and if you don’t mind, I’d like to focus on my day-to-day tasks”.\n\nLike gun to my head, I think the idea of shipping this to customers is suicidal for our company. It’s an insane amount of code that no one really understands what’s going on, which means the only person that can effectively fix bugs is Claude and I’ve heard horror stories of Claude really not being able to handle big projects.\n\nI just don’t know what to do because I feel like if I was trusting my gut, I would say let’s slow down and talk about what we actually want to build, take some time to actually pass through the code and make sure that we’re making smart choices. But I just know that that would be met with such resentment and distain. I feel like this is a group of individuals that is so angry that for so long people that know what is going on have gotten in the way of what they want, which is more more more now now now.\n\nHas anyone else experience this? What should I do?",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nApple is my dream company and I have been practising very hard for the interviews. I currently work at one of the big banks, graduated from a top 10 CS uni (no 1 in country) and have 2.5 years of professional experience. Life there is good, I get along well with colleagues and we like each other, but my goal has always been to get into a big tech company. The bureaucracy and nature of a bank really stifles engineering i feel, hence my decision to transfer. I simply felt Apple is the pinnacle of engineering standards and I would want to learn from Apple instead.\n\nRecently, I had the interview with the hiring manager for the first round and he seemed really disinterested in me early on, but not necessarily from the start. His body language shows it, he would rock his body back and forth. He asked me only resume-focused questions and just asked one simple technical question which i got correct and then ended the interview.\n\nI was quite taken aback because when i sit for interviews at the other major tech companies, I had expected a rigorous technical questions but it wasnt the case for Apple which felt really strange to me. Then, yesterday (2 days after my interview) my status on the applications portal showed in the 'Archived' state.\n\nTo add on some context, I feel it might have been my work experience. I am relatively early in my career but have a few short stints of about 1 year each and I am only 10 months in the bank.\n\nAlso, in the bank, we dont have root access and i read in big tech they tune kernel parameters for the hyper-scale traffic, use /proc for troubleshooting as it has less overhead and has more info like we can see what version of binary its run, spread out interrupts alongside cores (RSS), etc. So, my Linux professional experience is clearly not stellar tho i know a lot of theory from reading.\n\nWhen i described some stuff to the hiring manager specifically about our disaster recovery process, i am guessing it could feel really different and strange to him that we have to take screenshots and failover abruptly (not canary) and other stuff but that is simply the protocol of the bank.\n\nI would appreciate any advice from you all on my situation. If you were an interviewer / hiring manager , why would you behave the way the Apple Hiring Manager did to me during my interview ? I have been very polite throughout but sth about my interview he was probably dissatisfied. Maybe I rambling away or what not ?\n\nThank you to this awesome community in advance and you all have a great week ahead!",

        "content": "As titled. Software engineer with 5 yoe at a unicorn, I've been with my current company for about 2 years now. I had a life-changing event that happened in my family before my graduated. As a result, during the initial couple years of my career, I was very ambitious and set for faang/unicorn level pay. I pushed and pushed and pushed myself, even though I did not want to. I felt like that was when I developed this chronic fatigue and burnout about work. Anyway, I did not stop, until I got into my current company, and I felt satisfied that I got what I wanted.\n\nSince then I felt like I got out of survival mode, and somehow without fear, I started hating my job more and more. About a year into my current job, my burnout was so bad, to the point that I couldn't bring myself to work more than 1 hour a day no matter how hard I tried. I sat in front of my laptop during nights and weekends but I could not get any work done, it felt like my brain shut down. I ended up taking a sabbatical for three months. I took the time and travelled to Europe and did not do anything but to spend time with my family for three months.\n\nAfter I came back, everything was so much better. I felt better about work, I was way more productive and I could function as normal. Sure I still didn't like working, but I didn't hate it and I could tell it was different than the period I was burnt out.\n\nFastforward to today, a year from my last sabbatical, I feel like the burnout is slowly creeping back. It's been 2 weeks now and I've been extremely unproductive. I feel like I can't get things into my brain, I can feel that it is similar to the burnout I had last time, but fortunately a bit better. I seriously don't know what to do. My company has good wlb, great engineering culture, tc is a bit above faang level. I feel like I have nothing to complain, yet i hate my body for feeling this way. I think the root cause is that this place is a very fast-paced and high growth company. I don't work long hours by any means, but the work is very challenging and expectations are high. There are pros and cons to this, I feel like my work has meaning, i get rewarded, but sometimes it's very very draining. I feel like it's sucking the life out of me. I don't know what to do. I don't hate CS by any means, but this level of mental efforts does not seem like it's something I wanna do with my life. Maybe I want to coast. Maybe I'm ungrateful, maybe I want the pay but not do the work. i feel like I'm slipping and spiraling a bit downwards mentally.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.",

        "author": "LongjumpingPage6168",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, like the title, I don't understand the point of online coding assessments that major companies give on HackerRank, CodeSignal, CodeVue, etc. that we have to do on our own, while being proctored with camera and microphones on. I am OK with technical interviews with another engineer where we can code together and I can communicate my thoughts, processes, and my knowledge while programming. However, what's the point of stupid online assessments that major companies shove down our throats? You tell me that I have to do these proctored online assessments without any access to Internet (I cannot search for syntax or anything related to the coding problems) and I have to program with the camera and microphones on, and I cannot talk or look at anywhere else during the assessment because I'm afraid they would cause me of cheating. No one would hear me communicating my thoughts or processes during coding. And if I cannot pass all test cases within the time limit, I'm automatically eliminated from the hiring process, and my application would be thrown away, all of my past work experiences, skills, and projects I have gained over the years would be useless for them. And even if I pass all the test cases, I can still not move forward due to other reasons.\n\nPeople said that I have to do LeetCode, and I have practiced on my own for years on both LC, HackerRank, CodeSignal,... and solved over 100 problems... I also reviewed all data structures and algorithms again, but at the end, what's the use? Even when doing coding assignments in classes my professors allow us to search online but why cannot I search anything during these stupid assessments? And you know that most of us cannot pass these assessments in this way. So, I fear that even if I do 1000 to 10,000 LC problems the result is still the same, when I know that the companies only care if I pass all the test cases in these coding assessments.\n\nAnd funnily, I got my first part-time web developer job on campus, and my first IT infrastructure internship at a Fortune 500 multi-industry company without any LeetCode-style interviews. Especially in the hiring process for my first internship program, I only had to go through phone screen with a recruiter, and a behavioral interview with the IT manager where we discuss about my projects and past experiences, and within a week, I got hired for the program. But now, I did not get the return offer from the company so I have to do all of these LC over again with no hope.\n\nI feel like this is the only thing that fails me to get the full-time career I need after my graduation in May 2026. The other things like resume, networking, communication, interview skills, I am still learning and improving everyday, but these assessments feel hopeless to me. Just thinking about how I can be unemployed after graduation drives me crazy and makes me feel so embarrassed.\n\nAnd I've heard some people said I can skip these assessments with referrals. Is this true? I have friends who are working in these companies and I used to work with some of them, or we had little interactions but we're still in good terms. How do I reach out to them in a professional way to get the referrals? Can someone tell me? I'm out of options.\n\n",

Outside of that I was pretty happy at my job and would not have minded if I didn't get any offers (other than the obvious blow to my ego).\n\nAlmost all of my jobs were applied through Welcome To The Jungle, formerly Otta.  I responded to a few recruiter email reachouts, but only if the recruiter worked directly for the company, rather than for a third party.  I did not apply to any companies as practice; I only applied to companies that I genuinely wouldn't mind working for and whose salary range was within at least what I was making now, or more.\n\nAlmost all companies followed a pretty standard process - recruiter call, technical screen, hiring manager screen, onsite.  All companies did not ask any leetcode or brainteaser questions (I did my best to filter those companies out).  One company had an online assessment before I talked to anyone, and a take-home later in the process that took ~10 hours.  I had fun doing the take home and did not mind the time it took.\n\nPreparing for my interview was pretty straightforward.  Because I was targeting companies with no leetcode, I did not prepare for coding assessments at all.  I did well on interviews that required me to write code (save for one, where I flubbed due to a misunderstanding of the problem / incorrect assumption as it was based on a real-life product).  For system design, I used the free versions of HelloInterview (I did not pay for membership like the other post), but I did have an existing lifetime membership for GreatFrontEnd for FE system design.  I did not find it that useful for the interviews I encountered.\n\nFor scheduling interviews, the majority of them were scheduled from 6AM-9AM PT (east coast morning), or (2PM-6PM PT) (west coast afternoons), depending on where the company was located.\n\nFor the companies that I got rejected, I think my weakest area was for sure system design questions, and doing technical deep dives of my work projects.  Two of the five companies that rejected me provided detailed feedback, which I appreciated and understood their perspective. Some rejections were purely tactical errors on my part.\n\nIn the end (just before new years), I accepted a remote role for +20% base, and a lot more equity than my current role.  The role I accepted was one where I was most interested in the company anyway; both offers I received were from companies I would've been happy joining.  The entire process took a little less than two months from the initial offer being sent, to me accepting an offer.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

This team is entirely focused on replacing an existing internal platform within the company and I've been stuck on doing mindless CRUD work for the entire 2+ years I've been working. The product is essentially created out of a war started between two directors who disagreed on the current approach of the platform at the company.\n\nBesides the messy team origins, my biggest difficulty has been gaining a deeper domain knowledge and be able to insert myself into key initiatives. I'm not sure if it's bad luck or just me not being smart about which work I pick up, but I somehow always end up taking tasks that don't help me to stand out or make a huge noticeable impact. Our team suffers from very poorly written stories and constantly unclear product requirements so it tends to be a roulette when taking on work for the sprint.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes seniors and tech leads are secluded from ad hoc conversations that happen between leadership, so requirements get changed on the fly at times or critical information is missed leading to mistakes and constant miscommunication of requirements.\n\nRegardless, I screwed up during these few years and couldn't make a name for myself within my org. I've missed my chance to work on more impactful projects and take ownership on bigger features. I've fallen into the state of being a feature monkey and don't see myself going forward any further nor do I think it's worth as several engineers and managers have already begun leaving my org.\n\nThis experience has made me question whether I should even bother continuing engineering as a career. I'm starting to think I'll be capped as a junior / mid level engineer due to my inability to play the game right. I already feel so behind compared to my peers and have really nothing impressive to talk about in interviews in terms of feature ownership.\n\nOverall, working at corporate has started to make me dislike development and I have no motivation or energy to upskill or tackle side projects anymore. I'm pretty lost as for what to do at this point as no team is willing to hire internally and my current endeavors for external opportunities has been absolutely awful. Anyone else feel this way?\n\ntl;dr: mediocre engineer barely surviving at current company, starting to resent full stack work, and hopeless in terms of other job prospects",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI could use some grounded advice from people who have been through a reset.\n\nI have \\~4 years of experience (mostly Data Engineer / Data + backend-ish work). About 6 months ago I resigned from my last job because I was completely burned out. I did not plan the break well, and honestly I have not done much “serious” productive work since then. Most days have been at home recovering, and going down rabbit holes like tech news, trying new dev tools (Claude Code, Codex, etc.), tinkering, but nothing consistent I can show.\n\nNow reality is hitting. I need to land a job in the next few months. The gap is making me anxious, and that anxiety is making me freeze.\n\n**Target roles:** Data Engineer / Backend (Python) - most of my work was involved on GCP.  \n**Stack I’ve worked with:** GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Vertex AI, Cloud Storage), MLflow, Python + SQL, streaming + batch pipelines, CI/CD.\n\nI know the default answer is “grind LeetCode + system design”, and I am doing some of that. But I feel like I’m missing something important about how to restart properly.\n\nI’d really appreciate advice on things like:\n\n* If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?\n* Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE? (I’m open, but I want the fastest path to employability.)\n* What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?\n* What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?\n* Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?\n\nIf it helps: I’m not trying to make excuses. I messed up the structure of the break, and I own that. I just want a clean plan and honest feedback from people who have done it.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Overall, the distribution of talent didn’t seem any different from my own team, which made me wonder whether an internal transfer might be more realistic than I initially thought.\n\nI’ll be starting on an AI-related (but non-research) team in a different product area. The office I’m joining has a fairly strong GDM presence.\n\nI did CS with Math in undergrad with a focus on probabilistic ML, and I have one publication in a top AI journal (not first author).\n\nFor folks who’ve seen or gone through this process:\n\n* How rare are internal transfers to GDM? Do you need to be absolutely exceptional?\n* Beyond strong feedback in my current role, what tends to matter most?\n   * Internal ML work (e.g., 20% project with GDM)\n   * Being active in research communities again\n   * Kaggle or other ML side projects\n   * Internal networking and referrals\n\nAny advice & anecdotes would be really appreciated.

        "content": "I’m looking for advice on how I should proceed moving forward, while giving some context on the “untraditional” path I took to get here.\n\n* 2021: Full-stack coding bootcamp\n* 2021–2022: Worked 1 year as a web dev/front-end dev\n* 2025: Graduated with a BS in CS from WGU’s online university\n\nI’ve been applying for the past several months, sending probably around 200+ applications so far, with only 1 phone interview and 2 recorded video interviews. The last job took me 400 apps in 2021 so I already know this isn't that many applications considering the current market. I’ve mainly been applying on LinkedIn and have been using Simplify to fill out applications.\n\nI realize I’m slowly falling apart because there’s a lot going on in my mind. I honestly feel like I’m not even that great of a developer yet. I spent so much time trying to rush my degree and focused on sending applications that I realized I’ve started to get worse at coding. I’m considering pursuing an OMSCS through Georgia Tech, but I’m not sure if a master’s degree is worth it right now. It would allow me to learn more, possibly specialize in ML/AI, and apply for internships. Admittingly it would also allow me to redirect my mental burden of job apps towards something else. On the other hand I might be spending more time and money for little to no difference.\n\nTyping this out I realize I should probably at least spend my time re-learning some of the things I’ve forgotten while building out some more projects. If anyone has any insight or a different job search approach they’d recommend I’d really appreciate it. I’m not too sure which job boards I should rely on outside of LinkedIn and I’m a little hesitant to use AI auto-apply resources.\n\nAdded my resume below for review:  \n[Resume](https://i.imgur.com/ZGPCMja.png)",

The Google offer is Level 3 (outside of CA, but in U.S.) and the Microsoft offer is SWE 2 in Redmond HQ. I am very much in between these options. While I feel a great match with the Microsoft team and am already located close to the Redmond HQ, relocating to the Google location would increase my H1B odds significantly. I am also told Google has a slightly more brand advantage and better international mobility. Which one of these offers would you recommend to accept, and why? I really appreciate your input and help. Thank you very much!",

        "content": "hi all,\n\nI recently started a new job at a company with a poor reputation. As a May 2025 grad who was becoming increasingly desperate for a foothold, I intended to keep this job for a year or two before leaving for something better, but I am staying with family nearby and commuting (1-1.5hr one-way commute) for the time being.\n\nI am still in “training”, but I have been finding myself feeling increasingly isolated. The relatives I am staying with are distant and I miss home and my immediate family, but I don’t think that this is just homesickness (I attended college a similar distance from my hometown). I am spending 8 hours of the day in a windowless office doing training clearly intended for someone with less experience than me. It is becoming more clear to me that the work that I will be doing after training will not be at all engaging and there is very little collaboration between my teammates. I don’t believe that there is much opportunity for growth. Additionally, I am not only the only woman on my team, but I have not met a single other woman in my (admittedly short) time working here.\n\nSome of this is certainly just what you get in software, but normally when people talk about feeling lonely at work, it has to do with the WFH environment. I am on-site, and the demands of on-site and the particular location of the company (along with the below-standard pay) have made it hard for me to justify doing anything to shorten my commute as around half of my net pay would go to rent/utilities.\n\nI am heavily considering leaving this position and finding temporary employment in my hometown to fill the gap and have some money while I figure out what I want to do. I’m not really sure what I am looking for here. I guess I am just venting and looking for validation and advice. I know that I should be grateful to have a swe job in this market but if this is what swe jobs are I’m not sure that I want them.",

Cloud hosting things I can't even begin to comprehend, what even is Jenkins as well? I just don't know what I'm expected to actually know to get a junior or graduate level job.\n\nI take course after course trying to cover as much as I can, doing many projects, but when I finish one thing I discover another 10 packages or tools I'm expected to learn with it.\n\nMy main intention is to develop software. Although some DevOps seems interesting, it isn't my main career goal. I'm not sure if learning any extra DevOps stuff could boost my chances at a job though so it may be worth it to learn both. \n\nWould just like a little guidance in these topics please",

I know there's the whole debate about \\_vibe coding\\_, but I use AI to generate code for parts of the app whose functionality I already know and giving it a prompt just makes the process faster, or if I don't know that part of the app, I ask it to do some research first.

I have decided for myself that I will stick with my passions for SWE but I'd love to get some advice or hear some other people's opinions.\n\nFor some background, I'm a junior in a university that is not the best for CS and I have had 0 internships so far. My dreams were to be a SWE ever since I started coding in highschool in 2022.\n\nMy second semester in college (2024) I started doing research with a CS professor that I liked and have continued it ever since. During my time at university, I also developed and published a Google Chrome extension, mainly to make life easier, and also a VSCode extension, for my professor's research.\n\nI also love using Django and have built several full stack web apps (although mainly CRUD). But, I have never deployed something other than on a web service platform like Vercel, Onrender, or Heroku. I'm aware that most of the web apps I build are not scalable and will most likely break if more than 1,000 requests hit an endpoint at once. I also know some things like CI/CD or unit tests are very important for real world projects but I've always thought those things are experiences gained at an internship.\n\nI have started applying to internships ever since I was a sophomore and I also attended a career fair last year in the spring. I only started keeping track at the start of my junior year and so far I have more or less applied to 150 intern positions. Only had 2 companies (one small, one medium sized) reach out after for an interview after the OA, but I most likely bombed both because there were no responses after. \n\nI know AI is having a big impact on the job market and there are also layoffs happening in tech companies, but I also know several people who still landed internships at Meta and even Google.\n\nSo, I just wanted to know if anybody could recommend some strategies to stand out more as an applicant or just give some basic advice on my next steps.

It also highlights which retakes give the biggest CGPA lift and catches common mistakes like wrong credit counts.\n\nTo avoid manual entry it pulled grades by logging into the student portal and scraping the data, and it grew to about 3000 users. When the portal switched to heavier redirects I used Selenium to keep the login flow working. Later the university added CAPTCHA and warned against automated access, so I stopped the scraping and made the server down. \n\nSecurity wise, I tried to be strict: I didn’t store passwords, I used HTTPS, limited logs, and deleted any temporary transcript files immediately after parsing. I also kept the heavy “what if” calculations client side so the server didn’t keep sensitive data around or hammer the university systems.\n\nShould I talk about this in interviews or leave it off?

        "content": "For context, I graduated with 4 internships under my belt with a BS in C.S in 2024 from a small no-name college. Took me 7 months to find FTE after graduation and it was until I successfully got an offer last year with a decent modest six figure entry level wage in the bay area.\n\nBut as time went on. This organization is messy, while flatter, it means my direct manager has lots and dozens of reports and oversees the infrastructure group comprised of 4-5 teams of 4-5 people that are almost siloed away from each other. The Python software architecture project work that I do doesn't even correlate with any of my coworkers' work because they manage VM/server infrastructure and windows administration/dev ops/click ops.\n\nMy role got a little more defined when I was handed a Django application and 20 affiliated hardware servers and was told to fix it alone by myself. There is no cloud in this role. All the web servers, databases, and load balancers servers I had to setup, update, and reconfigure by myself. In 4 months, I shipped a working feature end to end using Copilot/Claude for documentation and architectural design reviews; boilerplating the code and then let me apply the specific automated workflow needed to make it work for our use case. I completely revamped the frontend UI with modern look as well and completely overhauled the original design to process requests quicker by creating a more efficient queuing system.\n\nPlus, in Q1 this month I am handed a new Django project to develop and test with (finally) 1 or 2 more developers which should be a better experience.\n\nDespite the mess and lack of structure, I own the first app now and it's my responsibility and I don't plan on leaving within the short term since I haven't yet met my 1 year mark, I am trying to at least make it to my 2nd or 3rd year to maximize learning and salary.\n\nThe only other Django developers are on another team under my manager but I specifically have to reach out to them if I ever want help from them. But so far, AI is my savior for a lot of issues.\n\nI feel like I am growing a lot using the terminology like design patterns and microservices I learned in school/internships, and applying it to what I develop in my role even if it's essentially a bus factor I am making for the organization.\n\nMy manager knows I am independent on this too and he knows I am going to be swamped this and next quarter. And he and I are trying our hardest to make sure I get the support I need when I need it.\n\nThough the performance review cycle ends really soon and I think I did a hell of a job but we'll see if I get that 5-6% raise.\n\nSo far, I am enjoying the experience being employed and funding my travel goals this year.",

I was wondering if people have tips for getting startup jobs as a new/recent grad with very little professional experience.\n\nI recently graduated in May and am currently working full time as a SWE, but am looking to move to a startup. I revamped my resume and have been applying to roles through Wellfound and Otta. Most of the roles either require a significant amount of experience or are ghosting/rejecting me even when I have experience in the tech they use. \n\nI also did not go to a target CS school and do not live in a huge tech hub so I’m not really the prime audience to get reached out to by recruiters. There also aren’t really any networking events where I live either. \n\nDoes anyone have tips for getting interviews at these kinds of companies? I can stick it out at my current company for another year or two but I am not a huge fan of the industry and want to switch to either a startup or big tech soon. \n\nThanks! ",

        "content": "hey yall - posting for a bit of career advice. not really sure where to start so I'll give the rundown. I'm a mid-lvl fullstack SWE at a mid-sized, pre-ipo company - 5 yoe total. Went to a bootcamp back in 2019 and switched into SWE from non-technical role at same company, been there 7 years total now.\n\nmy title and salary progression in that time:\n\n* non-technical role - 60k (with options, no bonus)\n* associate eng - 70k (more options, no bonus)\n* swe 1 - 105k (rsus, no bonus)\n* swe2 - 115k -> 128k -> 140k -> 155k (rsus, no bonus)\n\nas you can see, I've been stuck at mid-lvl for a few years now, despite my gunning for promotion to senior. over the course of the past 2 years, my day to day has become increasingly more technical (involving a lot more system design this past year or so - microservices, API work, etc.) with significantly more responsibility. I wasn't promoted last year like I thought I'd be, but I got rave reviews and have had very candid conversations with management (direct and director lvl) about my future. I'm currently the lead on a pretty significant, high vis project for my group which seems like was a very intentional choice to \"groom\" me into Senior, so to speak. all that to say, this feels like the year it finally happens for me but I really wouldn't know until the summer.\n\nI'm trying to weigh the opportunity cost of potentially sticking it out for the 6 or so months and seeing thru my goal of finally cracking senior vs. taking interviews with hopes of being hired as a senior (and ideally a higher salary as a result). given that I got into this field pretty deep into adulthood, I've always kinda felt like I'm trying to cover a lot of ground as quickly as possible (sometimes to my detriment).\n\nI interviewed extensively last year from feb-sep, the majority of which were for senior roles that I was turned down for due to not having good system design fundamentals. I'm thinking if I try again this year, given my recent practical system design experience maybe I'll get lucky and finally earn myself the promotion.\n\nhow should I play my cards?",

        "content": "I'm a new grad at Amazon that started 6 months ago. I know that there's going to be layoffs here next week, and so I've been preparing to try to find a new job, which hadn't been going too well so far. I'm 53 applications in with 9 rejections and only 3 OAs, and so I figured I'd need to work on my resume by way of projects. At the same time, I've been having trouble figuring out what projects to make. I had a list of ideas (first two were in progress and were originally on my resume):\n\n* interactive Rubik’s Cube in THREE.js (and possibly a solver)\n* 2D/3D Graphing Calculator application (Desmos “clone”)\n* Geometry Dash “git” that allows for pushing/pulling of versions of levels multiple users create with between different devices\n* Ray Tracer, but experimenting with Linux-inspired scheduling strategies to potentially optimize performance in comparison with traditional implementation technique\n* GameBoy emulator iOS mobile app (using Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C)\n* NYC subway map using MTA API for simulating impact of delays on other trains\n* 2048 AI solver with comparison amongst different optimization techniques for score / efficiency\n* something related to embedded systems and/or systems programming (not sure what yet)\n\nI got feedback that they either weren't complex enough to demonstrate technical skills, original enough to be distinguished from what people have already done, practical enough to solve actual problems that people might have and have an impact, or some combination of those. I genuinely couldn't come up with any ideas that actually accounted for all three of these and I couldn't come up with any problems in my life that could be solved with programming a project, so I tried leaning towards using them as learning opportunities that relate to my interests, and planned on switching them out on my resume to fit it for a bigger range job requirements/skills. At the same time as *that* though, I know that experience is a lot more important than projects to recruiters and I did feel like I was starting to get the hang of things with the help of my team at work. But of course, that might not be the case 6 days from now. If it is the case (hoping it is) I was wondering if I could get any advice from anyone for what to do.\n\n",
