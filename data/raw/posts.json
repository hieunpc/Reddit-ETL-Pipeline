It reads from Bronze or Gold to create Parquet files in S3.\n\n**A Silver layer (this part seems off to me):**  \nIceberg tables either created using dbt and the Silver processing as a source or bronze.  \nIt uses dbt for tests, typing, and documentation.\n\n**A Gold layer:**  \nBI-related views created using dbt transforms.\n\nThe whole thing being orchestrated using Airflow or Prefect, or maybe Windmill.\n\nTrino as a query engine to read from the DW. Glue for the catalog. Maybe s3 tables for managed iceberg tables but this product seems too new maybe ?\n\nI don’t know much about Snowflake or Databricks, but I am having trouble seeing the real upsides.\n\nThe need for a DW is that I have a lot of different sources of data and some have huge amount of rows and I want to have a single place where everything is queryable documented and typed. \n\n  \nI don't have any experience in this so If you have any opinions or tips on this, I would really appreciate it.

        "content": "In almost every company that I've worked at (mid to large enterprises), we faced many issues with \"the source of truth\" due to any number of reasons, such as inconsistent logic applied to reporting, siloed data access and information, and others. If a business user came back with a claim that our reports were inaccurate due to comparisons with other sources, we would potentially spend hours trying to track the lineage of the data and compare any transformations/logic applied to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies happen.\n\nI've been building a tool on the side that could help mitigate this by auto-ingesting metadata from different database and BI sources, and tracking lineage and allowing a better way to view everything at a high-level.\n\nBut as I was building it, I realized that it was similar to a lightweight version of a Data Catalog. That got me wondering why more organizations don't use a Data Catalog to keep their data assets organized and tie in the business definitions to those assets in an attempt to create a source of truth. I have actually never worked within a data team that had a formatlized data catalog; we would just do everything including data dictionaries and business glossaries in excel sheets if there was a strong business request, but obviously those would quickly become stale.\n\n**What's been your experience with Data Catalog? If your organization doesn't use one, then why not (apart from the typically high cost)?**\n\nMy guess is the maintenance factor as it could be a nightmare maintaining updated business context to changing metadata especially in orgs without a specialized data governance steward or similar. I also don't see alot of business users using it if the software isn't intuitive, and general tool fatigue.\n",

The SQL coverage is intentionally just enough so it doesn't get in the way of learning the core design concepts.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n* Backend developers who want to move beyond CRUD operations\n* Bootcamp grads who only got surface-level database coverage\n* Self-taught engineers filling gaps in their knowledge\n* Anyone who finds traditional DB courses too abstract\n\nI originally created these videos for my own students when flipping my database course, and decided to make them freely available since there's a real need for accessible, practical resources on this topic.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Full course on GitHub: [https://github.com/StructuredCS/grokking-relational-database-design](https://github.com/StructuredCS/grokking-relational-database-design)\n* Complete playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fg3zQpW0k4UO9eBDLdroADnB18ZAOgj](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fg3zQpW0k4UO9eBDLdroADnB18ZAOgj)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the course content or approach.",

But I’ve also heard some warnings that it might move behind a paywall (Polars Cloud) and the open-source project might end up abandoned/not being maintained in the future.\n\n**Spark** is said to have more committed backing from big sponsors, and doesn't have the same risk of being abandoned. But it's heavier than what I need.\n\nIf I use Polars now, am I potentially just building up technical debt? Or is it reasonable to trust it for production long-term? Would sticking with Spark - even though I don’t need multi-node - be a more reasonable choice?\n\nI’m not very experienced and would love to hear what more experienced people think.

        "content": "Currently, I'm interning in data management, focusing mainly on data analysis. Although I enjoy the field, I've been studying and reflecting a lot about migrating to Data Engineering, mainly because I feel it connects much more with computer science, which is my undergraduate course, and with programming in general.\n\nThe problem is that I'm full of doubts about whether I'm going down the right path. At times, this has generated a lot of anxiety for me—to the point of spending sleepless nights wondering if I'm making the wrong choices or getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe company where I'm interning offers access to Google Cloud Skills Boost, and I'm taking advantage of it to study GCP (BigQuery, pipelines, cloud concepts, etc.). Still, I keep wondering:\nAm I doing the right thing by going straight to the cloud and tools, or should I consolidate more fundamentals first?\nIs it normal for this transition to start out \"confusing\" like this?\n\nI would also really appreciate recommendations for study materials (books, courses, learning paths, practical projects) or even tips from people who already work as Data Engineers. Honestly, I'm a little lost — that's the reality. I identified quite a bit with Data Engineering precisely because it seems to deal much more with programming, architecture, and pipelines, compared to the more analytical side.\n\n\nFor context, today I have contact/knowledge with:\n\n• Python\n\n• SQL\n\n• R\n\n• Databricks (creating views to feed BI)\n\n• A little bit of Spark\n\n• pandas\n\nI would really like to hear the experience of those who have already gone through this migration from Data Analytics to Data Engineering, or those who started directly in the area.\n\nWhat would you do differently looking back?\n\n\nThank you in advance",

        "author": "wei5924",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,\n\nI am building a databricks notebook that joins roughly 6 tables into a main table. Some joins require some of the main table, whilst other joins will use the whole main table. Each join table has a few keys.\n\nMy question is what is the best architecture to perform the join without having an out of memory / stack overflow error?\n\n  \nCurrently I have written a linear script which sequentially goes through each table and does the join. This is slow and confusing to look at. As such other developers cannot make sense of the code (despite me adding comments) and im the main point of contact.\n\n\n\nSolutions tried:\n\n* I had tried to write a function that performs multiple joins using a while loop. However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error. Sometimes i get a driver error and the whole notebook fails to continue to run.\n* I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted. As such we had to roll back to the linear way i wrote before.\n* I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact.\n* Caching after some joins but problem persists.\n\n  \n\n\nOther information:\n\n* Small tables - row count roughly 50-100\n* main table - as of now row count roughly 50k\n* join type - left join on main table \n* All tables are already cleansed and are delta tables \n* Technologies: databricks, pyspark, ADF, ADLS\n\n\n\nSide question: I used to be a software engineer and now moved to being a data engineer. Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without? in terms of time complexity and clean code writing? My assumption is the former but after a few months of writing pyspark code i believe the correct answer is the latter? Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?\n\n",

I’m trying to decide which (if any) of these projects to showcase on my CV/portfolio/LinkedIn, and I’d love if you could take a very quick look and give me some feedback on which are likely to strengthen vs hurt my CV/portfolio. \n\n[**data-tech-stats**](https://github.com/simon-milata/data-tech-stats) ([Live Demo](https://dts.simonmilata.com/))  \nMy latest project which I'm still finishing up. The point of this project was to actually deploy something real while keeping the costs close to 0 and to design an actual API. The DE part is getting the data from GitHub, storing it in S3, aggregating and then visualizing it. My worry is that this project might be a bit too simple and generic. \n\n[**Study-Time-Tracker-Python**](https://github.com/simon-milata/Study-Time-Tracker-Python)  \nThis was my first actual project and the first time using git so the code quality and git usage weren't great. It's also not at all something I would do at work and might seem too amateurish. I do think it's pretty cool tho as it looks pretty nice, is unique and even has a few stars and forks which I think is pretty rare.\n\n[**TkinterOS**](https://github.com/simon-milata/TkinterOS)  \nThis was my second project which I made cause I saw GodotOS and thought it would be cool  to try to recreate it using Tkinter. It includes a bunch of games and an (unfinished) file system. It also has a few stars but the code quality still is still bad. Very unrelated to work too.  \n\n\nI know this might feel out of place being posted on a DE sub but these are the only presentable projects I have so far and I'm mostly interested in DE. These projects were mostly made to practice python and make stuff.  \n  \nFor my next project I'm planning on learning PySpark and trying Redshift / Databricks. My biggest issue is that I feel like the difficulty of DE is the the scale of the data and regulations which is very hard / very expensive to recreate. I also don't really want to make simple projects which just transform some fake data once.  \n\n\nSorry for the blocks of text I have no idea how to write reddit posts. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :)",

The tables are queried around the start of an ETL job to get information like the specific jobs to kick off, when the last time the job was run, etc. Someone labeled this a 'connector framework' years ago but I want to suggest a better name if I rework this since it's so vague and non-descriptive.\n\nIt's too early in the morning and the coffee hasn't hit me yet so I'm struggling to think of a better term - how would you call this? I'd rather just use a industry-wide term or phrase if I actually end up renaming this.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone! I was recently fortunate enough to land a Data Engineering internship at Meta this summer and wanted to ask for advice on how best to prepare.\n\nI’m currently a junior in undergrad with a background primarily in software engineering and ML-oriented work. Through research and projects, I’ve worked on automating ML preprocessing pipelines, data cleaning, and generating structured datasets (e.g., CSV outputs), so I have some exposure to data workflows. That said, I know production-scale data engineering is a very different challenge, and I’d like to be intentional about my preparation.\n\nFrom what I’ve read, Meta’s approach to data engineering is fairly unique compared to many other companies (heavy SQL usage, large-scale analytics), and a lot of internal tooling. Right now, I’m working through the dataexpert .io free bootcamp, which has been helpful, but I’m hoping to supplement it with additional resources or projects that more closely resemble the work I’ll be doing on the job.\n\nIdeally, I’d like to build a realistic end-to-end project, something along the lines of:\n\n* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n* Extracting data from multiple sources\n* Building a DAG-based pipeline\n* Surfacing insights through a dashboard\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. For those who’ve done Data Engineering at Meta (or similar companies), what skills mattered most day-to-day?\n2. Are there any tools, paradigms, or core concepts you’d recommend focusing on ahead of time (especially knowing Meta uses a largely internal stack)?\n3. On the analytical side, what’s the best way to build intuition, should I try setting up my own data warehouse, or focus more on analysis and dashboards using public datasets?\n4. Based on what I described, do you have any project ideas or recommendations that would be especially good prep?\n\nFor reference I am not sure which team I am yet and I have roughly 5 months to prep (starts in May)",

Note, I've spoken to my colleagues and they agree our workload definitly exceeds what the norm is in other companies, rather than this being a skill issue. I’ve been offered a six-month contract in a familiar area that is data related but significantly less stress and a role I have done before. I would earn my annual salary in 6 months and definitly get some mental health recovery, but I’m worried that stepping away from data engineering so early, especially given how fast the field and AI tooling are evolving, could make it difficult to re-enter as I would be unfamialir with the new tools / processes. I personally am quite worried about job security in the near to mid future and don't want to further damage my prospects. At my current role we are literally using and upgrading our AI tech stack on a weekly basis and it's hard enough to keep up while I'm in it, let alone if I leave the domain. All to say, with the constant improvements and upgrades in AI and essentially my current role shifting from programming and more to ideation and agent managment, would taking a break to make noticably more money and give me a mental health break be a bad idea due to the struggles of then re-entering the market. \n\nI'd appreciate any opinions, I'm all ears!\n\nThanks all ! \n\n",

I'm basically the CTO and a generalist/developer/architect, and what I really lack in the data engineering  space is someone to bounce my ideas off.  \n  \nSo please feel free to poke holes in any of this.\n\n**Priorities**\n\n* **High** \\- Cost effective, low-code, avoid lock-in (eg OSS)\n* **Low** \\-  Performance, real-time\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Shopify Plus (customers, products, orders)\n* GA\n* Xero\n* A subscription tool called SKIO with an AP**I**\n\n**Why BigQuery**\n\nI find it pretty cheap if you are judicious about what goes in it. So for example we have about 150k orders per year and I don't need line items because Shopify does that deeper analysis really well. BigQuery would eat that up out volume.\n\n**Why Looker**\n\nI think Looker is very cost effective and can plug in lots of stuff. For eg I can have Spreadsheets for some data and join it in Looker to BigQuery.\n\n**Why AirByte**\n\nA big part of this is deciding on an ETL. When I started we were using Celigo but found them to be pretty inflexible on billing. It's just a good example of lock-in I want to avoid.  \n  \nSo I've been testing the Airbyte Shopify->BigQuery connector and it seems to do what i need. While it has the commercial solution, I feel confident I can switch to the community (open source) version later if I wanted to self host an ETL (which i think is a good long-term strategy in this day and age).\n\n**Lock-in thoughts**\n\nWe are a Microsoft/Sharepoint place and while I don't dislike Azure I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft. We happened to already have Looker and GA because our Shopify vendor preferred it, and the business has never questioned this. So essentially I've put a Google Cloud strategy around these tools, and adding BigQuery is a bit of a no brainer. Obviously there is cloud lock-in to Google here, but in the massive event of Google dropping Looker/BigQuery I reckon we would survive as a business since most of our operational stuff is over in Shopify.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nThe Shopify analytics platform is insanely good. If I could add some custom data to it I wouldn't be here writing this post. But I don't think that's in their business strategy to be a generic BI tool.\n\nUnexpected costs are always a concern. Monitoring unexpected cloud costs, or regretting a SaaS product when you see \"Contact Sales for Pricing\" on some feature. I dunno if I can avoid that.\n\n  \n\n\n",

We've taken that and expanded it into this!\n\n\n\nFor those interested in the tech stack:\n\n1. C++ for internal processing engine + DuckDB, Swift + AppKit for UI\n2. Wrote our own custom caching engine, and SQL transpiler in C++. Transpiler takes DuckDB SQL and converts it into native SQL for full predicate pushdown (i.e. Athena, BigQuery, ClickHouse, Snowflake, Postgres, etc).\n3. Wrote our own graphing library from scratch, all GPU native using custom shaders.\n4. Wrote a custom Amazon S3 OS integration to replicate S3 buckets on Finder. Intercepts sys-level calls to reference remote data.\n5. Super limited use of AI code. i.e. no vibe coding. Claude is high as a kite.

I did go through the search by on this page, and found a decent amount of answers - however I honestly need it explained like im 5 and then I have some follow ups.. and then FAQ won’t open for me. So I’ll start with my background and situation -\n\nI’m 29 years old, and I am a EHS (environmental health and safety) manager for a FAANG company. It’s a stable career. However I am not very content there. I kind up ended up in this career on accident, and then ran with it. I used to be a computer science major, and spent a year or so learning coding through books and online programs as well. I  withdrew from the course, because honestly I siked my self out of it. I convinced myself the market for that field is just too competitive and that it would be a waste of time for me. Reason I felt I didn’t have a chance is because I’m not really in a position to be able to internships as I cannot leave my job to do any (sole provider family of 5) so I felt I was at too big of a disadvantage.\n\nWell I finally decided, I do want to pursue tech because that field is what I truly enjoy. This is part where I need help, I’m having a hard time figuring out exactly what role I should pursue/what the natural progression is for these roles? So to breakdown my interest - I am really interested in all things data, I love engineering/coding, and I’m a big excel nerd. I would like to get into power BI as well, just haven’t jumped on. I do a decent amount of data work at my role now, because my company is huge on metrics/data. I use excel daily to deep dive data and analyze trends and what not on there, and I’ve made a lot of tools/trackers as well.\n\nSo what I’ve kinda narrowed down for the main data roles are\n\nData Analyst\n\nData Scientist\n\nData Engineer\n\nBusiness Intelligence Analyst\n\nSo do all these roles progress together like advance through them, or are they all entirely separate paths? I wanted to see if someone could explain them to me like I’m 5, and then maybe tell me which kind of degree is recommended for each one? I have a decent understanding of data analyst/BI Analyst- so are those starting points to eventually become data engineers? Im also confused on this, because everything I’ve read online is that it seems none of them are entry level, so how would I start?\n\nThe two degrees im tossing around right now are from WGU - either Data Analytics or go back to Computer Science. Are there other/better degrees out there  I should explore for this field?\n\nTLDR - Questions:\n\n\\- can someone break down the main different data roles simply and how/if they progress together?\n\n\\- What’s the better option for a degree - Data Analytics, Computer Science, or is there something else I should explore?\n\n\\- Which degrees are beneficial for each different data role?\n\n\\- Is it dumb for me to want to leave my stable career to pursue this?\n\n\\- Do I even have a chance without really being able to any internships?\n\n\\-What’s the best role for breaking into this field?\n\nSorry guys I know this a lot! Just trying to get the next steps figured out!",

But this is slow compared to when I work on pure python projects in PyCharm, which take full advantage of claude code.\n\nI'm using git folders and my code is checked into source control, but I'm not using an IDE when developing in databricks. I just use the web UI.\n\nWhat I would like to set up is:\n\n\\- claude knows all steps in my pipeline (maybe by exporting the pipeline using 'view as code')  \n\\- claude can see the latest files and understand the types involved, etc  \n\\- bonus: claude can access some tables in read only mode\n\nMy hunch is I need to use VS code with the databricks extension so that I'm in a legit IDE rather than the Databricks UI. But I'm not used to testing notebooks, etc with that setup. Also, to keep the pipeline definition up to date I will need to export that manually and add it to source control when there are changes.

After 10 years of trying, I still can't figure out object oriented programming or high level languages in general. I'm working mostly in C and assembly, I feel like I have the opposite problem of everyone else, I find writing directly to registers and building my own libraries for hardwear peripherals very easy, but I still can't figure out how a class works. I have done online courses, had people try to explain things to me, and whilst I can do very simple things, it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes. Should I just give up and stick to the low level stuff and circuit design, or is there anything more that I can do ?",

        "content": "Post was longer than I expected, TL;DR: High-school level programming experience in Processing/Scratch/Python/Java and 4 weeks experience with C++ about 13 years ago when I was 14. Want to learn programming for game dev. Don't care that they're not entry level languages. \n\n\nOkay, I know, I know, neither of these are beginner friendly at all but honestly I dont care. Im just wanting to learn game dev and I want something I can use for logic that needs to be quick and efficient, like terrain gen, etc. I have some experience in the really basic shit like Processing, Scratch, and Java by taking comp sci in HS but I was an awful student. I also took a 4 week summer camp between my freshman and sophomore years of HS that was for learning simple game dev through C++ but it was REALLY basic and I just made a short 10-minute text adventure. That being said, I have learned about Rust recently and everyone fuckn loves it and I've seen people making some really interesting things with it using its extension for Godot. \n\nFrom my ignorant perspective, C++ seems like a good option to understand more what's going on under the hood, having to manually manage memory and shit, and also has much faster compile times (which ive already experienced when compiling Rust demos in Godot Jesus christ), as well as possibly better job prosepects and translates easier to other languages as I understand Rust is a fairly unique language. With Rust it seems like it's more annoying because you HAVE to handle your memory errors SOMEHOW because the borrow checker thing just doesn't let you fuck that up, as well as maybe being more difficult to understand because of its owner-borrower system or whatever its called, but the whole thing makes sense to me conceptually, not sure how easily I'll be able to implement it tho. (But it seems like it would at least be easier to debug, no?) I've watched videos on both and I haven't been able to find a great answer as to whether one would be better for a beginner. \n\nAgain, I dont care to learn something more basic, I'm already going to be using plenty of GDScript so I will be learning a simpler language anyway so anything I just simply can't do at my skill level at the moment I'll just fall back on that till I sharpen up with Rust/C++.\n\nAppreciate any advice or insight into this question and sorry for the long ass post.

I never blindly copy/paste code, but I do steal the 'intro' on new tools from AI, then build on it after I ask for detailed explanations; however, I feel even this careful approach is harming my growth as a developer.\n\nI have decided to totally abandon AI 1/3 way through my biggest solo project, only reaching out if stuck longer than a few hours. Can anyone share a little light as to how I can break this habit?\n\nIf anyone can maybe nudge me in the right direction in terms of learning most effectively - I would really appreciate it.\n\nSorry to be long-winded, all answers are GREATLY appreciated!",

        "content": "I'm the lead author of [Grokking Relational Database Design (Manning Publications, 2025)](https://mng.bz/PRER), and I've turned the book into a full open-access course. Sharing it here since database design is often overlooked in self-taught journeys, but it's crucial for building real applications.\n\n**What it covers:** The course focuses on database design fundamentals:\n\n* ER modeling and relationship design (including many-to-many patterns)\n* Normalization techniques (1NF through BCNF)\n* Data types, keys, and integrity constraints\n* Indexing strategies and query optimization\n* The complete database design lifecycle\n\n**What's included:**\n\n* 28 video lectures organized into 8 weekly modules\n* Quizzes to test your understanding\n* Database design and implementation assignments\n* Everything free and open-access on GitHub\n\nThe first two weeks cover just enough SQL to get you productive, then the focus shifts entirely to database design. If you're building projects and wondering \"am I designing this database correctly?\" - this course is for you.\n\n**Who it's for:**\n\n* Self-taught developers who skipped formal CS education\n* Bootcamp grads who got minimal database coverage\n* Anyone building backends and realizing they need stronger fundamentals\n* Beginners who want to understand databases beyond basic CRUD\n\nI originally created these videos for my own college students, and decided to make them freely available since there's a real gap in accessible, practical database design education.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Full course: [https://github.com/StructuredCS/grokking-relational-database-design](https://github.com/StructuredCS/grokking-relational-database-design)\n* Video playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fg3zQpW0k4UO9eBDLdroADnB18ZAOgj](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fg3zQpW0k4UO9eBDLdroADnB18ZAOgj)\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

The Playstation 1 and 2 use MIPS architecture, the Gameboy and GBC use z80, and most modern applications and games use x86-64, which is why I'm torn between the three.\n\nI don't have a computer science background and my career isn't anything close to CS unless you count working in excel. I also don't anticipate switching careers. This is purely something I want to do in mh free tkme. I understand basic computer concepts but don't know how to code or program. I've made a few game mods, I can look at code and change a thing or two, and I can locate some stuff in memory to freeze or edit via emulator or CE, but that's probably as close as I've gotten. \n\nAnyways, I am wondering if there are any great online courses or books I can follow that are good for people with little to no CS background? I'm torn between x86, MIPS, or z80, but leaning towards x86 since it seems more comprehensive and I would think going from CISC to RISC would be easier than the inverse. \n\nI rented the book *Assembly X64 Programming in Easy Steps: Modern Coding for MASM, SSE and AVX* from my library since that was all they had. Not sure how that compares to some of the other resources out there. ",

        "author": "Existing_Steak",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I am trying to learn programming and have a question about frameworks/programming languages.\n\nI have made a simple HTTP-based API in both python (using fastAPI) and java (using Spring Boot).\n\nIn fastAPI framework, I notice that I mainly write functions which are either passed in as parameters into other functions or called by other functions. To me, this makes sense from my perspective, or at least feels intuitive. I can literally see the programming \"primitives\" I wrote interacting with each other in my source code. \n\nFor example, I build an endpoint like\n\n```python\n@APIRouter().get(\"/blah\")\ndef get_blah():\n  return \"blah\"\n```\n\nthen I must tell my main FastAPI() object about the routes using `.include_router()`. Nice. I can also somewhat imagine whats going on in my head, like the `APIRouter` object has some record of all the routes I defined via the decorator and that object is being passed to my `FastAPI()` object.\n\nSpring Boot, on the other hand, I notice that I create classes, and some of these classes are never instantiated! At least they're certainly never called in my source code. I can run my application with Gradle and the class I created that was never instantiated actually did something. \n\nE.g., I make this class\n\n```java\n@RestController\npublic class TextController {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/texts\")\n    public List<Text> getTexts() {\n        return service.getTexts();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nbut I never wrote \"TextController blah = new TextController()\" anywhere?\n\nLike, I feel more in control of my FastAPI application than I do with my Spring application? Do others feel like this? Do I just chalk up the framework differences to \"thats how the authors who designed each framework intended it to be\"?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Just wrapped up a month-long project using C++, SDL2, and ImGui. I set out to make a simple app that has the very basic features of Lightroom, but I quickly realized that architecture is a completely different beast than programming the logic. It only does the bare minimum of what I originally planned, and I’m struggling with the feeling that I should have pushed harder. But at this point, the passion for this specific codebase is gone, and I just want to move on.\n\nI learned a lot about the build process and package management, but the codebase ended up as a bit of a spaghetti mess. I’m at the point where I’ve learned enough to see exactly why my current design is flawed, which makes it feel impossible to keep working on it without a 100% rewrite.\n\nI underestimated how hard it would be to design the software. It took me a while to actually set all the dependencies up. Then came writing the pipeline for it to actually be usable. But with each thing I added, I realized another thing had to be fixed or improved. By the time I had implemented the basic features, I'd gone through countless rewrites. Despite my efforts to keep it as decoupled as I could, the codebase was never as clean as I had wanted it to be.\n\nI don't exactly regret making this project since I learned a lot from it. However, I feel like I'd feel a lot better right now if I put that effort elsewhere, or if I actually completed all the features I'd planned on implementing. But I just can't bring myself to work on it any longer. If I want it to be well made then I would have to rewrite the whole thing. It also sucks because as shallow of a reason as it may be, I was looking forward to having something to show off on my GitHub :(",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I understand the concept of \"divide and conquer\", but coding the exact implementation is what is hurting my brain. Specifically the recursion for the divide.\n\nThe conquer is easy. Just merge two already sorted arrays.\n\n    def conquer(left, right):\n        arr = []\n        i = j = 0\n    \n    \n        while (i < len(left) and i < len(right)):\n            if left[i] < right[j]:\n                arr.append(left[i])\n                i+=1\n            else:\n                arr.append(right[j])\n                j+=1\n        \n        arr.extend(right[j:])\n        arr.extend(left[i:])\n    \n    \n    left = [1,3,5,9,10]\n    right = [2,4,6,8,11]\n    \n    \n    answer = conquer(left, right)\n    print(answer)\n\nThe divide, however, is super complicated. I'm trying to understand what's going on line by line.... but it always trips me up. Perhaps it's the \"stacks\" (recursion)?\n\nAllegedly this is the code.\n\n    def divide(arr):\n        if len(arr) <= 1:\n            return arr\n        mid = len(arr) // 2\n    \n    \n        left = arr[:mid]\n        right = arr[mid:]\n    \n    \n        left_sorted = divide(left)\n        right_sorted = divide(right)\n        return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)\n\nWhat I understand so far is the obvious.  \nWe are storing the first half (left), and the second half (right) in arrays.\n\nBut apparently, all the magic is happening here:  \n`left_sorted = divide(left)`  \n`right_sorted = divide(right)`  \n`return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)`  \nWhen I print those values, the output is\n\n`[3] [7]`\n\n`[1] [9]`\n\n`None None`\n\n`[2] [5]`\n\n`[8] [6]`\n\n`[4] None`\n\n`None None`\n\n`None None`\n\naaand I'm officially lost here.\n\nMy brain is trying to run this line by line. But I can't\n\nHow is it getting each element? How is it also running the method for each of them?\n\nit's calling divide() twice, back to back.\n\nCan someone help me write my own divide method? Maybe that way I can figure it out. Or at least a better explanation?\n\nAt first I was going to skip it, but the udemy course does things in increasing difficulty. It went:  \nBubble Sort -> Selection Sort -> Insertion Sort -> Merge Sort (current), then after this is Quick Sort, which is also recursion.\n\nSo I need to master this.....\n\nThanks!\n\n  \nEdit: for those of you reading this thread in the future who have the same question as me\n\nTo get your answer, use the breakpoints feature in VisualStudio code, alongside a lot of print statements. this allow you to see the values getting passed one at a time. with a pen and a sheet of paper, you'll soon be able to visualize how it works on a low level.\n\nfigured it out",

        "content": "Hi there! I'll try to be as brief as possible.\n\nI started working as a software developer at a small start-up in February 2025 and ended up leading a small project that's more or less a small fleet manager. There are many things that apps like fleetio have that the client does not require so please keep that in mind. Our team is of two people and a PM.\n\nI'm the one that leads the meetings and decides on architecture basically. While I know it sounds completely insane that someone with such little experience is doing this, it has been working well so far and the client is really happy.\n\nWith that in mind I started reading DDIA because as I have no senior to learn from, it's quite difficult to know how to scale things, how, when to scale, etc. it might not even be necessary that we scale out, but it is a topic I'm super interested in so the book is super helpful.\n\nMy question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?\n\nI had a quick idea to spin up an app like Pastebin to generate unique links of text, just for fun!\n\nMy idea is :\n\nRedis for generation of unique links with snowflake IDs and TTL to reduce bloat and guessable IDs.\n\nKafka for event streaming and eventual consistency among replicas (in different AZs/regions)\n\nI am thinking of simulating this by having a primary db and a few read only replicas around the world from AWS. I'm also thinking of adding a load balancer just to learn that too.\n\nIs this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.\n\nIf this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?\n\nMy apologies if I sound ignorant about these concepts, I just don't talk to many senior folk, and the ones I know don't have distributed systems experience.\n\nLastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.\n\nThank you for any input you may have and I hope you started the year great!",

So far, all my suggested (theory) code have all been great and very efficient, but I am so slow at translating them into good code that it almost doesn’t matter.\n\nSafe to say I feel way more confident in discrete math, algorithms, and even pseudocode than here because it just feels like a new language I need to learn (which it is lol).\n\nSo I was wondering if Codecademy could help me sharpen those missing syntax skills or if it’s just a waste of money.

        "content": "Hello! So I've recently been working on a simple test game with Monogame. After some trial and error, I made a collision detection system based on several parts:\n\n\\> under Scenes class, I load textures for obstacles in each scene and create a dictionary to map each scene to the obstacle textures to be drawn. Also created a dictionary to map each texture to its position.\n\n\\> in my Map class, I create a 2d array of zeros to represent terrain; then, a method loops thru the dictionary from Scenes, to place 1's on all array elements corresponding to the texture's width&height on the grid.\n\n\\> In the map class, I create methods like this for each direction, which are called in the main Update() method later when the arrow key is detected: (EDIT: position and tex1 in CanMoveL() refer to the player)\n\n            public bool CanMoveL(Vector2 position, Texture2D tex1)\n            {\n                bool check = true;\n    \n    \n                if (position.X == Xbounds[0]+10)\n                {\n                    return false;\n                }\n    \n    \n                for (int y = 5; y < tex1.Height-1; y++){\n    \n    \n                    if (terrain[(int)position.Y+y, (int)position.X +1]==2)\n                    {\n                        check = false;\n                    }\n                }\n                return check;\n    \n    \n            }\n\nNote: I know there are built-in detection methods in monogame, but I'm not really interested in refactoring in the best way possible, I just had the objective of figuring it out from scratch in a way that makes sense. But, if you have some ideas on how you would have approached it/whether my method is way too inefficient, I'd be happy to hear them!\n\nMainly, I'm concerned about the loop that looks through each \"row\" of my character's height, seeing if it hits the obstacle when projected. I was thinking of Numpy style slicing but I couldn't figure that out in c#?\n\nSecondly, It seems like this method is kinda fragmented, with the scene textures loaded in Scenes, but the actual mapping of them in Maps. Should both those be in Maps?\n\nThanks!",

I am trying to avoid ranges or keyless aggregation queries as they will need the scatter-gather approach and does not really add anything towards the purpose of project.\n\nNow I decided to use hash based routing and the logic for that itself is implemetd but I cannot decide how do I choose the sharding key which will be used to decide where the query is to be routed ? I am thinking of maintaining of a registry which maps each key to its respetive table. However as I tried to see how this approach works for some schemas I noticed that many table use same fields which are also unique, which means we can have same sharding key for mutiple tables. We can use this try to groups such tables together in same shard aloowing for more optimised query result. \n\nHowever i am unable to find or think of any algorithm that can help me to find such fields across tables.

In the beginning, I honestly hated UIKit and Swift. Later, when my project moved to SwiftUI, I started enjoying Swift a lot more and became comfortable with iOS development.\n\nThe problem is that I have a habit of constantly exploring other languages and frameworks that have nothing to do with my current job like Java with Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, and recently even Rust. I enjoy learning them, but none of this directly helps me at work.\n\nAt some point, I want to switch companies. Realistically, it probably doesn’t make sense to switch to a completely different role when my professional experience is in iOS.\n\nSo career-wise, what’s the smarter move early on:\n\n1. Should I focus on mastering iOS development deeply and only learn new things when my role demands it?\n2.

It turns out my instincts were right, I mostly got lucky. I didn’t really earn this.\n\nI was hired into a branch that I have no experience in (embedded software) after assuring the hiring manager / senior developer that I would work hard to catch up with the expectations. I genuinely meant that. However, it has been much harder than I anticipated.\n\nYesterday, I had a call with my team lead and another developer, the one who hired me and is essentially involved in everything (his cracked). They told me that my performance has been slow, especially during the last sprint, and that I’m very close to getting fired. They’re not the ones who make that decision, but they were passing the message along.\n\nThe cracked one basically told me (unofficially): If I want to keep my job, I need to work on my free-time. According to him, there’s no way to both catch up and deliver expected work within the official eight-hour workday. I don’t think he’s being unreasonable or malicious, he is just a developer after all, he just wants to protect me. I’m willing to put in extra time, but the problem is that I’m also a university student. Realistically, I can only manage an extra two to three hours a day.\n\nThis sprint fucked me up. It’s Saturday today, and I have homework due next week that I won’t be able to complete properly because I’m spending the weekend trying to avoid getting fired.\n\nI feel like I was hired at the worst possible time. The team was already behind schedule, management is panicking, and I’m expected to deliver at an unrealistically fast pace. I don’t like blaming others, maybe I’m just not learning fast enough, but this still feels off. From the start, it felt too good to be true, fully remote, good pay e.t.c. I have a feeling that it won't end well.",

I don't think AI will eliminate software engineering, but I do think it'll change the number of people who need to it to achieve very good outcomes. With each iteration and vast amounts of training data, the AI models to get better - and honestly, I'm part of the reason, I have to hold my hands up and say I've used GPT a lot since it came out - it synthesizes anything on Google, SO, documentation, etc. so why not use it to get to the bottom of what I need to know way quicker?\n\nAnd I think this is the general consensus - AI will never do away with software engineering, software will always exist, but it will change who does it, and the number of those people.\n\nMore relevant in 2026 though is offshoring. For better or for worse, I understand the rationale of offshoring labor, particularly junior positions. Companies exist solely to deliver profits to their shareholders, investing a lot of money into an \"unproven\" college graduate is far less appealing than investing that same amount of money into 3-4 new graduates.\n\nSo as offshoring accelerates, and AI becomes better and better, I'm \"hiding\". I do my due diligence at work, and I learn what good software is.\n\nBut no matter how many times I implement a strong observability backbone, no matter how many times I write CDK code and deploy to AWS, no matter how many times I implement authentication middleware, etc. - I have the same feeling that I'm on borrowed time.\n\nI'm \"hiding\" in the sense that there will be a time in the future, how soon, I don't know, but there will be a time when my leadership thinks, \"We don't need him anymore\" because I cost them too much, and my work can be consolidated into an offshore option or a senior engineer that is producing more with AI. It'll be a simple decision for them, and honestly I'll be the first to say that their intention aligns with the purpose of a business in the first place, which is to churn a higher profit.\n\nBut until then, I have no choice but to hide, I can upskill and get as good as I want, and believe me I will try to, but there's going to be an inflection point where I can't hide anymore, and by then who knows what the world will look like.\n\nBut do any other juniors sort of feel this way, this sort of existential dread, but also acknowledgement that that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles? In the meantime, I hope we can both be grateful for having a job at a time so difficult. Take care, my friends :)",

He has repeatedly cited that I have a lot of potential & wants me to \"focus on my career\" & that as a manager, \"my career & growth is his utmost focus & concern as a manager\" (in his own words) especially since I am still early in my career (3 years of work experience, this is my first job out of college). Just in today's 1-on-1, he said I should take online assessments with other companies to assess my standing & any lacking/strong areas but \"to lack him know if I get any offer so he can help me evaluate if they are good or he can offer something better or match at the current company\".\n\n  \nI have to preface we have a good working relationship & get along well in social & work settings although we don't interact or hang out after work.\n\n  \nI am asking this because it does feel weird! I am leaning towards him being very caring & taking a genuine concern for my career & growth.\n\nWhat are you guys' opinions?  \n",

I feel like an outsider to group of friends. Every time I do pitch in it always feels like the conversation just dies. So I always end up being the quietest one in the group, because I have nothing to say. And so people rarely speak to me or know me. I can tell because people usually talk very straight and professional to me, and then very casually to everyone else. \n\nNow this wouldn't be a problem, except that the people who are more talkative have better rapport with higher ups, or get recommended more, and so I feel like I get passed over for projects. But I really struggle with casual talk in a professional environment. A lot of stuff in my team is based on \"tribal knowledge\". There are several people who were hired around the same time as me and I feel like they're already ahead of me, they seem to know the managers better, they seem to be more involved in what's going on in the company. \n\nMaybe I unintentionally come off as mean or cold. Definitely robotic. But I'm just nervous and never know what to say. If it has nothing to do with the exact specific task at hand my mind just completely blanks. I wouldn't be able to remember what my favorite movie was if asked. I just don't know what to do because this is always a problem for me.

I am working on internal developer tools. For example, this team is instrumenting custom dev container solutions to create remote dev environments. This involves writing shell scripts, understanding daemons / processes. I had a few projects so far, but these have been relatively unrelated and disjointed. For example, I implemented a small improvement to some scripts. I also migrated some CI / CD pipelines from 1 vendor to another. These projects are also always consistently out of my experience. I don't know anything currently about working with daemons / processes and usually I don't have a point of contact to talk to.

        "author": "_lebrons_Hairline",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "To give a little bit of context,\n\nI’ve been working at a small to midsize biotech startup for a few years as essentially the only SWE on my team (although kinda junior). Honestly, I’ve had regrets since joining, since the role didn’t match the job description, and I’ve been operating mostly solo with little direction until more recently.\n\nRight now I’m at my breaking point. I’m leading a large, org wide project that touches one of our core critical processes, and I’m doing everything: requirements gathering, design, implementation, data migration, refactoring other teams’ code, qa, documentation, project management, and coordinating with multiple stakeholders. Requirements constantly change, and feedback comes only after features are done, and I end up redoing a ton of work. I mention this pretty often to stakeholders but it still doesn't prevent them from mentioning something that should've been mentioned when I was doing the requirements gathering.\n\nDespite this, upper management thinks the project is taking too long and questions decisions without being involved, and can be pretty demeaning to the work that I've done so far. I’ve tried looping them into boards and channels, but it seems like they don't care to look at it and they jump straight to accusations. I've been holding weekly meetings to get everyone aligned and to communicate deadlines as well as providing updates in comms. The core team seems pretty aligned and my boss is empathetic and supportive, and they recognize the work that I do but leadership seems to have unrealistic expectations for our team compared to others. I'm not the only one who sees this favoritism; my boss recognizes it as well.\n\nI’m also juggling other requests on top of this and have been working nights and weekends for months now. It was manageable before and I was used to it, until a few months ago I dealt with some personal stuff which fueled the burnout and pushed me towards a mental breakdown and some ideation related thoughts. A week later, I tried to resume everything as normally as I could but I’m still burnt out; panic attacks, nausea, crying before work, the whole shebang. I took a two week break hoping it would help, but I came back dreading everything.\n\nTo make it worse, leadership is tying my promotion to the success of this massive project, even though they’ve admitted it’s complex and high impact. Its a type of project that can affect all processes org wide if not executed well.  I’m exhausted and feel stuck in a repeating pattern of dealing with the upper management talk and possibly gossip/backbiting from teams/management outside the core group. It's getting really frustrating having to deal with the barrage of questions coming in on the last minute by teams who weren't even part of the project group and now have stuff to say. I have a feeling many teams outside view our team negatively. My boss understands and relates to my frustration as well. Reviews of the company have been echoing similar sentiments of it being toxic, having poor/nonexistent management and exhibiting large amounts of favoritism.\n\nI’ve been seriously considering quitting for a while now and taking a break (even before this project). I have a lot in savings/investments, stupidly low expenses, and could get by for a while without being a SWE (maybe go into retail or something) while managing to save, but I’m scared given how bad the tech market is and don’t see it improving in 2026. So far, I've been trying to suck it up and disengage but its becoming increasingly difficult to do so with the snide comments here and there.\n\nIs it worth staying in a situation like this just because of the economy, or am I burning myself out for nothing? Or should I just wait it out and make them fire me, although its unlikely I get severance? I tried to prep for interviews, but I feel so burnt out that I can't even stand to look at code any more or have the energy to prep after working 12 hours. I feel like my mind is in a constant haze.",

        "content": "I'm 23 years old, and I've had several part time/contract jobs for indie game development studios, and a wealth of programming projects. However, I have never had a full-time job. Unfortunately, my current part-time job has had struggles with finances, leaving me unable to afford paying bills for myself and my long-distance girlfriend without posting on social media begging for donations, even with both of us having part-time jobs. I've been searching for a job as a programmer for 3 years now, with no luck due to the major crash in both the game development and general software scene.\n\nI don't have a degree, but I've taught myself programming over the last 5 years and have what I'd consider pretty decent knowledge for a junior. I have 5 years of C++ and Python and 4 years of C#. I'm also quite experienced in Unreal Engine, and to a lesser degree, Unity. Additionally, I am versed in x86 and ARM assembly, as I spend a lot of time reverse engineering binaries in IDA Pro/Ghidra/Binary Ninja. \n\nHowever, I'm struggling to find jobs that meet my relatively lower-level language experience while hiring a junior dev in terms of workplace experience. Game development and malware analysis are probably where I'd do best, and I could definitely handle general software engineering, but the game development scene is obviously fucked, malware analysis jobs are extremely hard to come by, and my skillset doesn't include web development yet. I'd be fine with learning on the job, but it seems that these days, job postings require experience in almost every aspect to begin with.\n\nI'm aware that contacts are usually the best way to get a job in this industry, but all of my job-related contacts exist in the game dev sphere, and no one's hiring for roles that I'd meet in that scene at the moment. I don't have much connection to people in general software engineering or malware analysis. I cannot afford to travel even close distance due to lack of funds and physical disability, so I don't have much of a chance going to in-person developer meetups. My parents seem content to keep me stuck inside their house while having me pay rent monthly, so I cannot rely on them for funding or travel.\n\nThis has obviously been taking a severe toll on my mental state, as I'm struggling to find work that pays me enough to allow me and my girlfriend to survive, let alone move in together. I'm pretty desperate for a job that pays half-decently, and due to my disability I don't think I could physically handle a minimum wage job, never mind the fact that it probably wouldn't be able to pay the bills where I live, around the Seattle area. I'm already barely earning more than minimum wage for where I live to begin with.\n\nIf anyone is curious, [here's my GitHub page.](http://github.com/WistfulHopes)",

Currently in SoCal and planning to relocate elsewhere soon\n\n\nConcerns:\n\n• Bay Area: Worried about stiff competition and commute. No CS degree, no FAANG experience, and no car\n\n• NYC: Possibly better for my network and commute, but unsure about demand and growth for Swift/iOS\n\n• Zero preference on city lifestyle offerings.

I plan to take 2-3 years to finish the program then apply for new jobs once complete. \n\nI’m having some second thoughts about whether my time would be better spent working on personal projects relevant to my desired position instead of the degree. I have a pretty clear target area that I know I could work on side projects for, but I don’t know if this will be taken less seriously than certified courses. For anyone who has been in a similar position as me, do you think the degree was key for boosting your career? \n\n(I’m not worried about time commitment differences as I would be working the same in either case. The cost of the program is also not a factor.)\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

I had amazing people in my team my seniors have taught me stuff about architecture, decisions, patterns, technologies, every day I was asking less questions and everyone said I was doing fucking amazing and rocking everything, they even let me be on business meetings to discuss business logical decisions and they let me run the project alone for a week. They’re extremely happy with me.\n\nThen after one year I started to introspect and look into the present and future and came to some conclusions…\n\nMy job is fucking easy. I get figma designs, use storybook to pop components and use props to build UIs, then organize stores, hooks, forms, validations, tealium for analytics, A11Y, simple state management and maybe a few edge cases… but it’s a traditional bank not rocket science, SPAs are as simple as they get. And things in banks go veeeeeeeery slowly, therefore sometimes I’ll go a week or so with a blocked API  that blocks my team.\n\nTherefore I am starting to get this feeling…\n\nI am easily replacable by AI…\n\nSo here I am, stuck in a job that isn’t making me an AI-proof Frontend engineer.\n\nCant go to another Frontend job in this market cuz no one will hire.\n\nMy idea was to stay for 3 years here to be able to meet the 3 year + most offers post but tbh I’ll leave with tons of soft skills and lacking technical skills.\n\nFrontend is already very replacable with AI, therefore I was thinking about learning backend to make a switch (more AI safe). But who’s going to hire a backend with 3 YOE as a Frontend, it’s a joke.\n\nSorry for the rant, I’m just worried I’m not upskilling enough in my job to make me a Frontend which is beyond AI capabilities. I love the idea of backend but I just can make simple CRUD a little auth and no one will hire me without experience (I’d need to take a pay decrease to start again)\n\nAnyone got any advice on how to proceed?

I have no internships. The only CS-related experience on my resume is a couple semesters of frontend-focused undergrad research and a software position for a satellite lab at my school, where I haven't yet written a single line of code. My projects are mostly school projects, and nothing that would stand out too much. I do have several years of non-tech job experience, but I'm not sure how impressive that looks to recruiters.\n\nI've worked with most popular programming languages in some capacity (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, etc), but I haven't mastered any. I've also not done any Leetcode practice, so I wouldn't feel confident answering hard interview questions yet.\n\nAs a freshman majoring in computer science, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. Even though I was following along with the coursework, I always felt that I was a bit behind my peers in terms of internships, projects, and real-world CS skills. It's taken me too long to recognize how hard it is to find a job as a new grad, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Is it worth grinding for months trying to land a job in this field given how non-competitive my resume looks? Is there even enough time before I graduate? Or should I just switch fields? There's jobs out there that give $55-60k/yr, are much easier to get, and teach you everything you need to know. When I started college, I had dreams of making six figures working from home, but now I really just want to make a livable wage and not hate my job.\n\nSorry for the bit of venting at the end, but any advice is appreciated. And for any freshman reading this, use me as a lesson of what not to do. Just going to class and being average in everything will not set you up for success in this field.",

No idea. How do I find out? No idea? It feels like our distributed system is so complex that no one knows. We had to severely limit the size of our thread pools because that is how the database is supposed to work most effectively. But if the thread pool queue is filling up what am I supposed to do? I don't see the stress on the database, but there are some errors that we weren't printing out that we are working on surfacing.   \n Then I go to try to talk to other seniors about it or people above me and they kinda give me advice but in the end its me stuck looking through logs and talking to AI about what could possibly happen.   \nI feel like our whole product and codebase is so confusing that no one really knows how to solve this problems. But since I'm the lead on this project, I have to figure it out. I wake up with so much anxiety about this project and just getting out of it.

The only offer I ever received was from Wipro which I \"worked for\" for 2 years. What that boiled down to was training for certificates and joining meetings at 2am that just boiled down to \"any questions?\" Again I was desperate because I had never received offers while my peers in the field were already gaining experience in their own internships. So at one point I'm told I need to move out of my state which the job description never mentioned, so I tell them I can't and I leave. Since then it's been 2 years of me searching for entry level positions to try and start over but I rarely get interviews (once every \\~300 apps). \n\nAnyways, I see very negative opinions on Wipro and I'm worried that the reason why I rarely get interviews is because of my association with them. If that's true would it be better if I scrubbed it from my resume and left a 4 year gap? I'm not sure what I should do about this.",

It seems like a cool company, pretty small too. However, I am aiming for SWE type roles where I can build features and things like that.\n\nI know I cannot be picky in this market, especially since I was not given a return offer from my last company (I believe they only hire senior level people, from what I could observe.) However I would be more inclined to start off in SWE and potentially branch off into SRE, as I am worried that staying as a SRE for too long would close doors to SWE especially if I start my career as a SRE without much real SWE experience.\n\nI am able to apply through their site or via email. I was considering sending an email, stating that I'd be open to a hybrid of SRE and SWE work if its available. Is this a good idea? Any suggestions?\n\nThanks",

My first company I was at I left after about 2.4 years due to frustrations with how little I was taught and being loaded up with senior level work. (Being asked to design entire systems with zero guidance, and my supervisor had not written code in \\~20 years). \n\nI left that position for my current job, and am facing a separate set of issues now. Though to me it feels like there is still very little organization going on here. Even though I am an SWE I. I am being asked to think of the big picture and make innovative contributions to the project (or I will have my employment terminated). The project currently revolves around signal processing which I have next to zero knowledge of. I am facing more issues with domain knowledge rather than software at this point. \n\nAm I just severely dropping the ball here somehow? Or is this how things frequently go in defense? My recent performance review complained about me not completing certain TODOs but when I went and ask my supervisors specifically what wasn't done, none of them could give a single example. The entire email I got basically felt like they said \"you suck, do better or you are fired\". How would you even measure what counts as \"making innovative contributions\" or looking at the big picture here? Is this unreasonable? ",

And I'm being denied for junior roles because recruiters say I'm overqualified (which I kinda figured). In both cases I'm almost never getting to the interview stage, I've had less than 6 over the past year and all but 2 of those were in late 2024.\n\nIn late December and late last week half the jobs I'm finding on recruitment sites are for frontend, which I have partial experience in from my last job thanks to the (frustrating) push for everyone to be full stack. At this rate I'm considering retraining or learning FE stuff and making the switch, but that feels like it could be just as difficult to find a job with when not working because I'd lack the pretence of \"experience\".\n\nTldr; backend job market in the UK sucks, considering retraining in / learning frontend to improve my prospects.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**Update: I decided on NYC. Thanks for all the input!\nUpdate2: was able to negotiate for slightly higher base!**\n\nHi all! I recently received a full-time offer at a company where I previously interned, but in a different org. The role is best described as analytics engineering (data pipelines, dashboards, some modeling).\n\nOffer details:\n\n* Base: \\~$105k (about 75% of the band)\n* Bonus: 10%\n* Role is listed as 0–2 YOE\n* No master’s required (I do have one)\n* Same pay regardless of location\n* Office options: West Hollywood (LA) or Midtown Manhattan (NYC)\n\nI need to choose a location fairly quickly and want to make a decision that makes sense for both lifestyle and long-term growth.\n\n# About me / context\n\n* Single, 25F\n* Early-career, no full-time experience yet\n* Strong academic background (T10 undergrad + top specialized MS; more math/data science, lighter formal CS)\n* Exploring whether to pivot further into AI engineering or SWE — I’ve built a couple of agentic systems recently and really enjoyed it, though I also recognize I may have only scratched the surface\n* Very arts-oriented and tend to feed off the energy of my surroundings\n* Concerts, performing arts, and creative scenes matter a lot to me outside of work\n* Love warm weather and the beach (would go multiple times a week)\n\nI’ve lived full-time in LA (\\~1.5 years) and part-time in the NYC metro area (frequent trips into the city). Toward the end of my time in LA, I started making friends and building more of a social life, but it still doesn’t fully feel like “home.” In contrast, I have longer-term roots in NYC (school, family, and other involvements over the past decade), even though I haven’t lived there full-time before.\n\n# How I’m thinking about NYC vs LA\n\nAfter looking closely at housing, one clear difference is space vs density:\n\n* In NYC, I’d ideally want to live in downtown Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn, which is meaningfully more expensive for the space you get. I’d absolutely need a roommate.\n* In LA, I could live very close to work in West Hollywood, with more space for the same money. I’d still want a roommate, but it feels less constrained.\n\nThis doesn’t feel like a good-vs-bad lifestyle decision — more like a tradeoff:\n\n* NYC: less space, more density and stimulation, amazing energy, easier access to arts and ambitious people, diversity in industries\n* LA: more space, easier day-to-day life, amazing weather, and beach access, but sometimes feels slower or understimulating\n\nOne thing I’m genuinely unsure about is whether NYC actually provides more motivation and momentum early in a career, or whether that’s more about finding the right community in either city. I don’t yet have a strong network in either place, so I’m aware my perception may be biased by who I’ve met so far.\n\nFor future context only (not a third option right now): I’ve also spent a lot of time in San Francisco and could see myself there down the line, especially if I pivot further into tech — so future flexibility is something I’m thinking about — but this decision is strictly NYC vs LA.\n\n# Negotiation context\n\nI’m also in the process for two other roles:\n\n* One might pay similarly, the other potentially more\n* Neither is likely to wrap up within the next \\~1.5 weeks, and I may need to sign this offer before then\n\nThis current offer is the best fit in terms of work itself, but I’m unsure how to think about negotiation given:\n\n* I’m already \\~75% into the band\n* I don’t have full-time experience\n* I do have a master’s, which is more than the role formally requires\n\n# My questions\n\n1. Given everything above — my career stage, personality, priorities, and the work itself — which city would you choose for me: NYC or LA? Why?\n2. For people who’ve lived in both, how did each city actually affect your motivation, growth, and day-to-day energy early in your career?\n3. Negotiation:\n   * Would you negotiate at all in this situation, given I can’t risk losing the offer?\n   * If yes, when is the right time: after receiving the written offer, or only if another offer comes in (even after signing)?\n\nThanks so much — really appreciate any insight. And I apologize for writing this with ChatGPT.",

(Which I have included on my resume as work experience) \n\nI have some projects, but obviously am working on building better ones that align with jobs I apply for. \n\nI will have acquired Sec+ by the end of this month. (Will explain why I’m getting this cert) \n\n So I’m just wondering if I am too cooked for this field and should pivot to IT, or keep trying?\n\nMy current fallback hopes are that with my 2 years of entry IT experience and Sec+ that I can at least land some sort of IT role and pivot to something better after that if I can find something that can sponsor me for a clearance. \n\nI want to know if it is a realistic goal for me to land something in software in the defense industry because I live in the DC area and I assume that these jobs will have a lower barrier to entry. With Sec+ and my experience, is this still an attainable goal? Or is the industry just too cooked for hoping that this is even an option anymore?\n\nI’ve also started studying for Aws certified cloud practitioner as recommended by my employed friends. Is this worth my time? It does seem like a very easy cert. \n\nI do have a decent network (many friends, mutuals and relatives in tech in my area), really thankful for that. I hope to utilize it as much as possible for referrals. I have done tons of resume review and I believe my resume is solid. \n\nI am also interested in getting into Tech consulting as that is a big field in this area. Can anyone give me tips for that? \n\nSide note - I am a US citizen, born and raised, and should have no problems with getting a security clearance. \n\nMy questions:\n Are my goals still realistic?\nShould I change anything?\nAm I cooked?\nAnything else I should know? \n\nMy plan now is to: \n1. Apply aggressively for any entry level IT positions to secure some type of a fallback by June-ish and hopefully have some way of getting sponsored for a security clearance. \n\n2. Also apply to defense software roles for the chance to go straight into my dream field. \n\n3. Keep my skills sharp with Leetcode and projects \n\n\nTLDR: Am I cooked for software jobs? New grad. No internships in swe, 2 years entry level IT experience, Sec+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "author": "QuantumQuack0",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, finally the vacancy I thought I had been waiting years for, has appeared. It's in a certain deep-tech field, on the crossroads of physics, embedded, and networks engineering. The vacancy itself is for embedded software.\n\nProblem is... while I have actual experience with the physics (down to the literal same kind of physical system), I _want_ to work on the control/embedded side of things. But I have no C++ experience, and they explicitly ask for that.\n\nProfessionally, I've only worked in python. I've dabbled a bit in Rust, a tiny bit in C++, and embedded C. I've played around with microcontrollers for a bit, but there aren't really any projects I'd like to do here at home so I didn't stick with it. I'm just afraid that, if they somehow pick me, I will make critical mistakes very early on in the product development (as the <10th employee).\n\nThe other thing is that, for me, it's _yet another_ startup in this field. I've worked at two similar startups now, where I've started bright-eyed and bushy-tailed only to absolutely f%%%ing hate it after 2-3 years. My first job was a very similar, very young startup, where I worked more on the physics-side of things. Given that it was a young startup and I was full of ideas, I worked myself to death. And in the 3rd year, due to that and the fact that I started disagreeing with the direction, I quit.\n\nMy current job is at a more mature startup, on paper not a startup anymore now. Much better WLB, but the startup-like shenanigans are also getting to me here. Tons of technical debt, move-fast-and-break-things, poor communication because we've grown fast but not matured... everything is a mess and it's killing me.\n\nI don't know if I should apply. I actually know the founders/current employees (not super-close but I was a MSc student under one of them, and worked with 2 others during that time) and I'm honestly pretty good at interviewing, so I think I actually have a chance. But part of me just wants to get out of this startup life and the hype around this field. I feel like work has occupied my life far too much ever since my graduation.\n\nI just want to chat with you guys and ask, what would you do? What advice do you have?\n\nEdit: I realize the reason for this post may be a bit unclear. For context, I've actually really come to hate my current job and want to leave asap, but don't want to jump from the frying pan into the fire.",

I’m not a fan of this because it’s unsustainable and it will deplete my savings since the self employment income is unreliable.\n\nAnyway, I have been realizing that I need employment again but these past few months when I check the state of the tech industry it seems like mostly gloom and doom. Throw in how far behind I have fallen these past 3 years and I was already basically only at entry level position - I feel I am probably even more F’d in\nthe A then most of you guys.\n\nI’m hoping someone might help steer me in the right direction, knock some sense into me, or maybe provide a glimmer of hope of a “right path”.\n\nMy goal:\nBecome full time employed ideally remotely.

        "content": "Basically, I might be starting a new role shortly with a tech stack of Node.js, React, SQL, and AWS, but apparently there is a significant aspect of it that involves salesforce integrations with the jsforce SDK. Essentially, we would be creating services / integration layers in Node that are responsible for syncing Salesforce related onboarding data with the core services. And some front end work in React to manage that part.\n\nFrom what I heard in the interviews, I wouldn't be touching any proprietary salesforce stuff, as there is a separate salesforce team that handles that. There would be collaboration though if there are potential issues in the salesforce side, so I might have to occasionally look at some apex code when talking with the salesforce devs. I'm not too worried as long as I stay a software engineer and dont get roped into salesforce land, but in terms of future job searches I'm a bit concerned that if they hear 'salesforce integration' in the interview when describing a recent project they'll run for the hills.
