        "content": "Just as the title says. Fabric has been a pretty rough experience.\n\nI am a team of one in a company that has little data problems. Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \\~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.\n\nA little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.\n\nThe core issues:\n\n* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output\n* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy\n* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity\n* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable\n* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview features\n\nThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.\n\nComing from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.\n\nI'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.\n\nDE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.\n\n  \nEDITED: Because there was too much details and colleagues.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a little over five years of experience. I started my career as a Software Engineer working on Python-based full stack applications for 2 years and later moved into a Data Engineer role at a new company because there were very few Python backend opportunities at the time.\n\nOver the last three and a half years, I’ve realised that I never really got to work as a “proper” data engineer. Most of my work involved data administration, Python automation, some cloud services, cloud data warehouses, basic data modelling, and a few simple Airflow pipelines that pulled data from APIs and loaded it using pandas. I never worked with Spark or large-scale data pipelines.\n\nNow that I’m trying to switch jobs, I’m in a confusing spot. Based on my experience, companies expect me to be a Senior Data Engineer, but I don’t have hands-on experience with many of the tools they expect at that level. At the same time, when I get considered for junior  roles, the pay is around 50 percent lower than what I make today. It’s also hard not to compare myself to people with fewer years of experience who seem to have worked on far more complex data systems.\n\nI’m willing to start now, learn Spark seriously, build strong projects, and put in the effort. I’m just unsure if it’s too late at this stage or if taking a pay cut is the only way to reset my career. Is there a smarter way to transition into real data engineering without completely derailing things?\n\nAny honest advice would really help.\n\nTL;DR: 5+ YOE with a Data Engineer title but limited real DE experience. Now expected to be senior without Spark or large-scale pipeline work. Junior roles mean a big pay cut. Looking for guidance.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I know this subreddit kinda hates LLM solutions, but I think there is an undeniable and underappreciated fact about this. If you search on various forums like SO, reddit, community forums of various data platforms etc. for terms like (would link them, but can't here):\n\n1. fuzzy matching\n2. string distance\n3. CRM contact matching\n4. software list matching\n5. cross-referencing \\[spreadsheets\\]\n6. ...\n\nand so on, you find hundreds or thousands of posts dealing with seemingly easy issues where you have the classic example of not having your join keys exactly matching, and having to do some preprocessing or softening of the keys on which to match. This problem is usually trivial for humans, but very hard to generically solve. Solutions range from stuff like fuzzy string matching, levenshtein distance, word2vec/embedding to custom ML approaches. I personally have spent hundreds of hours over the course of my career putting together horrendous regexes (with various degrees of success). I do think there is still use for these techniques in some relatively specific cases, such as when we are talking about big data and stuff, but for all those CRMs systems that need to match customers to companies that are under 100k rows of rows and so on, it's IMHO solved for negligible cost (like dollars compared to hundreds or thousands of hours of human labour). \n\nThere are different shades of \"matching\" - I think most of the readers imagine something like a pure \"join\" with matching keys, a pretty rare case in the world of messy spreadsheets or outside of RDBMs. Then there are some trivial cases of transformation like capitalization of strings where you can pretty easily get to a canonical form and match on that. Then there are those cases that you still can get quite far with some kind of \"statistic\" distance. And finally there are scenarios where you need some kind of \"semantic distance\". The latter, IMHO the hardest, is something like matching list of S&P500 companies, where you can't really get the results correct unless you do some kind of (web)search. Example is e.g. a ticker change for Facebook in 2022 from FB to META. I believe today LLMs opened the door to solving all of those.\n\nFor example, a classic issue companies have is matching all the used software by anyone in the company to licenses or whitelisted providers. This can be now done by something like this python-pseudocode:\n\n    software = pd.read_csv(\"software.csv\", columns=[\"name\"])\n    suppliers = set(pd.read_csv(\"suppliers.csv\", columns=[\"company\"]))\n    \n    def find_sw_supplier(software_name: str, suppliers: set[str]) -> str | None:\n        return call_llm_agent(\n            f\"Find the supplier of {software_name}, try to match it to the name of a company from the following list: {suppliers}. If you can't find a match, return None.\",\n            tools=[WebSearch],\n        )\n    \n    for software_name in software[\"name\"]:\n        supplier = find_sw_supplier(software_name, suppliers)\n        df.loc[idx, \"supplier\"] = supplier\n\nIt is a bit tricky to run at scale, and can get pricey, but depending on a task it can be drawn down quite significantly depending on the usecase. For example, for our usecases we were able to trim down the cost and latency in our pipelines by doing some routing (like only sending to LLMs what isn't solved by local approaches like regexes) and by batching LLMs calls together and ultimately fit it into something like (disclosure: this is our implementation):\n\n    from everyrow.ops import merge\n    \n    result = await merge(\n        task=\"Match trial sponsors with parent companies\",\n        left_table=trial_data,\n        right_table=pharma_companies,\n        merge_on_left=\"sponsor\",\n        merge_on_right=\"company\",\n    )\n\nand given these cases are basically embarrassingly parallel (in the stupidest way, you throw every row on all the options), the latency mostly boils down to the available throughput and longest-llm-agent-with-search, in our case we are running virtually arbitrary (publicly web-searchable) problems under 5 minutes and 2-5$/1k of rows to merge (trivial cases are of course for 0, most of the cost is eaten by LLMs generations and web search through things like serper and stuff). \n\nThis is of course one of the few classes of problems that are possible now and weren't before. I don't know, but I find it fascinating - in my 10-year career, I haven't experienced such a shift. And unless I am blind, it seems like this still hasn't been picked up by some of the industries (judging based on the questions from the various sales forums and stuff). Are people just building this in-house and it's just not visible, or am I overestimating how common this pain point is?",

Due to memory and compute limits (I’m currently using Google Colab), I can’t load the entire dataset into memory at once.\n\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n\n- Randomly sampled ~1 lakh (100k) rows\n- Performed EDA on the sample to understand   distributions, correlations, and basic patterns\n\nHowever, I’m concerned that sampling may lose important data context, especially:\n\n- Outliers or rare events\n- Long-tail behavior\n- Rare categories that may not appear in the sample\n\nSo I’m considering an alternative approach using pandas chunking:\n\n- Read the data with chunksize=1_000_000\n- Define separate functions for:\n- preprocessing\n- EDA/statistics\n- feature engineering\n\nApply these functions to each chunk\n\nStore the processed chunks in a list\n\nConcatenate everything at the end into a final DataFrame\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Is this chunk-based approach actually safe and scalable for ~30M rows in pandas?\n\n2. Which types of preprocessing / feature engineering are not safe to do chunk-wise due to missing global context?\n\n3. If sampling can lose data context, what’s the recommended way to analyze and process such large datasets while still capturing outliers and rare patterns?\n\n4. Specifically for Google Colab, what are best practices here?\n\n-Multiple passes over data?\n-Storing intermediate results to disk (Parquet/CSV)?\n-Using Dask/Polars instead of pandas?\n\nI’m trying to balance:\n\n-Limited RAM\n-Correct statistical behavior\n-Practical workflows (not enterprise Spark clusters)\n\nWould love to hear how others handle large datasets like this in Colab or similar constrained environments",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am ingesting data from an API. On each notebook run - one run each hour - the notebook makes 1000 API requests. \n\nIn the notebook, all the API responses get combined into a single Dataframe, and the dataframe gets written to a bronze delta lake table (append mode).\n\nNext, a gold notebook reads the newly inserted data from the bronze table (using a watermark timestamp column) and writes it to a gold table (also append).\n\nOn the gold table, I will run optimize or auto compaction, in order to optimize for end user queries. I'll also run vacuum to remove old, unreferenced parquet files.\n\nHowever, on the bronze layer table, is it necessary to run optimize and vacuum there? Or is it just a waste of resources?\n\nInitially I'm thinking that it's not necessary to run optimize and vacuum on this bronze layer table, because end users won't query this table. The only thing that's querying this table frequently is the gold notebook, and it only needs to read the newly inserted data (based on the ingestion timestamp column). Or should I run some infrequent optimize and vacuum operations on this bronze layer table?\n\nFor reference, the bronze table has 40 columns, and each hourly run might return anything from ten thousand to one million rows.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your advices and experiences.",

There are no sprints, because management frequently overrides priorities due to requests from the board and other management areas—almost on a daily basis. It’s basically a ticket queue that we execute as it comes.\n\nDuring the day, I receive many different demands: validating data, mapping new tables, checking alerts from failed processes, discussions about possible data inconsistencies, reviewing PRs, helping interns, answering questions from people on other teams, etc.\n\nSometimes more than 10 people message me at the same time on Teams. I try to filter, organize priorities, and postpone what is not feasible to do on the same day, but more demands arrive than I can realistically handle, so tasks keep piling up.\n\nWe do have a team board, but I don’t like tracking everything there because some tasks are things like “talk to person X about Y” or “validate what person X did wrong,” which I don’t want to expose directly to colleagues and managers. So on the board I keep things more generic, without many comments\n\nLately, I’ve been putting everything into a single markdown file (tasks and personal notes). The most urgent items go to the top of the list as a simple TODO, but it keeps growing and sometimes it becomes hard to manage tasks and priorities\n\nNaturally, there are tasks that never get done. My manager is aware of this and agrees that they should only be prioritized when it makes sense, but new ones keep coming in, and I miss having a tool where I could search for similar tasks or something along those lines\n\nHave you ever faced this difficulty in organizing tasks? Do you have any tips for a simple workflow? I tried using some tools like Todoist and Taskwarrior, but I ended up preferring the ease of searching in a single file, even though it grows very large very quickly and eventually becomes messy and difficult to manage.

        "content": "Hello everyone, I’m a 2025 graduate in Big Data Analytics and currently looking for my first job. It’s been about 5.5 months since my internship ended, and during this time I’ve been doing a lot of reflection on my academic journey. The program was supposed to prepare us for roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist, but honestly, I have mixed feelings about how effective it really was.\n\nOver three years, we covered a huge range of topics: statistics, machine learning, big data, databases, networking, cybersecurity, embedded systems, image processing, mobile development, Java EE/ spring bot, SaaS development, ETL, data warehousing, Kafka, spark, and more. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, it often felt scattered and a bit inefficient.\n\nWe kept jumping between multiple languages (C, java, python, javascript) without enough time to truly master any of them. Many technical modules stayed very theoretical, with little connection to real-world use cases: real datasets, real production pipelines, proper data engineering workflows, or even how to debug a broken pipeline beyond adding print statements. Some courses were rushed, some poorly structured, and others lacked continuity or practical guidance.\n\n\n\nI know university is meant to build foundations, not necessarily teach the latest trendy tools. Still, I feel the curriculum could have been more focused and better aligned with what data roles actually require today, such as:\n\n* strong SQL and solid database design\n* Strong python for data processing and pipelines \n* Real ETL and data modeling projects \n* Distributed systems with clear, practical applications\n* A clear separation between web development tracks and data tracks\n* Better guidance on choosing ML algorithms depending on the use case\n\nInstead, everything was mixed together: web dev, mobile dev, low-level systems, data science, big data, and business, without a clear specialization path.\n\nNow I’m trying to fill the gaps by self-studying and building real projects, mainly with a data engineering focus. For context, here are the main projects I worked on during my internships:\n\n1. Machine test results dashboard  \n\n* A web application to visualize machine test results.  \n* Stack: Django REST Framework, MongoDB, React.\n\nIt was a 2-person project over 2 months. I was responsible for defining what should be displayed (failure rate, failure rate by machine/section, etc.) and implementing the calculation logic while making sure the results were accurate. I also helped with the frontend even though it was my first time using JavaScript. A lot of it was assisted by chatgpt and claude, then reviewed and corrected with my teammate.\n\n2. Unix server resource monitoring system   \n\nA server monitoring platform providing:\n\n* Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network via websockets  \n* Historical analysis with time-series visualization\n* ML-based anomaly detection using Isolation Forest\n* Server management (CRUD, grouping, health tracking)\n* Scalable architecture with Kafka streaming and redis caching\n\nStack: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, redis, Kafka, Angular 15, all containerized with Docker.\n\nI admit the stack is more “web-heavy” than “pure data engineering,” but it was chosen to match the company’s ecosystem and increase hiring chances (especially Angular, since most of their tech team were web developers). Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to a position.\n\nNow I’d really need advice from people already working in data engineering:\n\n* What core skills should I prioritize first? \n* How deep should I go into SQL, Python, and system design?\n* What kinds of projects best show readiness for a junior data engineer role(and where can i get the data like the millions of rows of data aside from web scraping)?\n* How do you personally bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations?\n*  What are your thoughts on certifications like those on Coursera?\n* And for the love of god … how do you convince HR that even if you’ve never used their exact stack, you have the fundamentals and can become operational quickly?\n\nAny advice, feedback, or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\*  \n\nMy data program covered a lot but felt too scattered and too theoretical to fully prepare for real data engineering roles. I’m now self-learning, building projects, and looking for guidance on what skills to prioritize and how to position myself as a solid junior data engineer.",

        "author": "BuissnessRake",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello! This is my first post in this sub. I’ve seen a lot of strong practical advice here and would like to get multiple perspectives on how to approach a messy data cleanup and modeling problem.\n\nUntil recently, I worked mostly at startups, so I never dealt with serious legacy data issues. I just joined a midsized private company as an “Analyst.” During the hiring process, after hearing about their challenges, I told them it sounded like they really needed a data engineer or more specifically an analytics engineer. They said nope we just need an analyst, which i thought was odd. FYI: They already have an ERP system, but the data is fragmented, difficult to retrieve, and widely acknowledged across the company as dirty and hard to work with.\n\nOnce I joined, I got access to the tools I needed fairly quickly by befriending IT. However, once I started digging into the ERP backend, I found some fundamental problems. For example, there are duplicated primary keys in header tables. While this can be handled downstream, it highlights that even basic principles like first normal form were not followed. I understand ERPs are often denormalized, but this still feels extreme.\n\nSome historical context that likely contributed to this:\n\n* In the past, someone was directly injecting data via SQL\n* The company later migrated to a cloud ERP\n* Business processes have changed multiple times since then\n\nAs a result, naming conventions, supplier numbers, product numbers, and similar identifiers have all changed over time, often for the same logical entity. Sales data is especially messy. Some calculated fields do not align with what is defined in the ERP’s data dictionary, and overall there is very little shared understanding or trust in the data across the company.\n\nConstraints I am working under:\n\n* I have read-only access to the ERP and cannot write data back, which is appropriate since it is the raw source\n* of-course the ERP is not a read-optimized database, so querying it directly is painful\n* There are over 20,000 tables in total, but after filtering out audit, temp, deprecated, and empty tables, I am down to roughly 500 tables\n* Total row count across those tables is likely 40 to 50 million rows, though normalization makes that hard to reason about\n* I am the first and only data-focused hire\n\nThe business context also matters. There are no real long-term data goals right now. Most work is short-term:\n\n* One-week automations of existing manual processes\n* One to two month dashboard and reporting projects\n\nStakeholders primarily want reports, dashboards, and automated spreadsheets. There is very little demand for deeper analysis, which makes sense given how unreliable the underlying data currently is. Most teams rely heavily on Excel and tribal knowledge, and there is effectively zero SQL experience among stakeholders.\n\nMy initial instinct was to stand up a SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance and start building cleaned, documented models or data marts by domain. However, I am not convinced that:\n\n1. I will get buy-in for that approach\n2. It is the right choice given maintainability and the short-term nature of most deliverables\n\nAs a fallback, I may end up pulling subsets of tables directly into Power BI and doing partial cleaning and reshaping using Power Query transformations just to get something usable in front of stakeholders.\n\nSo my core question is:  \n**How would you approach cleaning, organizing, documenting, and storing this kind of historically inconsistent ERP data while still delivering short-term reports and dashboards that stakeholders are expecting?**\n\nIf I am misunderstanding anything about ERPs, analytics engineering, or data modeling in this context, I would appreciate being corrected.",

This reduces the risk of data being lost during processing.\n\nThe changing data would be stored in a new table every month, and once that data is around five years old it would be deleted (or handled in a similar way).\n\nI know this sounds fairly simple, but there will be thousands of data entries in the CSV files every 10 minutes.\n\nDo you have any tips or advice? Is it a bad idea to split the unchanging string data into a separate table to save space? Once I know how the business actually wants to use the data, I’ll be back to ask about the best way to really wow them.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "content": "I have built data engineering solutions (with spark) in HDInsight, Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Fabric.\n\nSometimes building a solution will go smoothly; and other times I cannot even connect to my remote resources.  In Fabric the connectivity can be very frustrating.  They have a home-grown networking technology that lets spark notebooks connect to Azure resources.  The interface is called \"Managed Private Endpoints\" (MPE).  It is quite different than connecting via normal service endpoints (within a VNET).  This home-grown technology used to be very unreliable and buggy; but about a year ago it finally became about as reliable as normal TCP/IP (albeit there is still a non-zero SLA for this technology, that you can find in their docs.)\n\nThe main complaint I have with MPE's is that Microsoft is required to make them available on a \"onesie-twosie\" basis for each and every distinct azure resource that you want to connect to!  The virtualized networking software seems like it must be written in resource-dependent way.\n\nMicrosoft had asked Synapse customers to move to Fabric a couple years ago, before introducing many of the critical MPE's.  The missing MPE's have been a show-stopper, since we had previously relied on them in Synapse.  About a month ago they FINALLY introduce a way to use an MPE to connect our spark workloads to our private REST APIs (HTTP with FQDN host names).  That is a step forward, although the timing leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThere are other MPE's that are still not available.  Is anyone aware why network connectivity doesn't get prioritized at Microsoft?  It seems like such a critical requirement for data engineers to connect to our data!!  If I had to make guess, these delays are probably for non-technical reasons.  In this SaaS platform Microsoft is accustomed to making a large profit on their so-called \"gateways\" that move data to ADF and Dataflows (putting it into Fabric storage).  Those data-movement activities will burn thru a ton of our CU credits ... whereas making a direct connection to MPE resources is going to have a much lower cost to customers.  As always, it is frustrating to use a SaaS where the vendor puts their own interests far above those of the customer.   \n  \nIs there another explanation for the lack of MPE network connectivity into our azure tenant?

I want the events emitted from Glue ETL jobs during regular pollung operations. We only have about 500 jobs running a day, and so I’m not sure large, expensive tooling is justified.\n\nI also considered using lambda to write these events to S3. This seems like overkill too, because it’s a whole lambda boot and process per event. Not sure if this is unsafe for some reason as well, or if it risks corruption due to (e.g.,) non-serialized event processing?\n\nWhat have you done in the past? Should I just bite the bullet and introduce Flink to the ecosystem? Should I just accept Lambda as a solution? Is there something I’m missing, instead?\n\nIve considered Marquez as well, but I don’t want to host the service just yet. Right now, I want to start preserving events so that I have the history available for once I’m ready to consume them.",

It is able to scan and output thousands of folders information in an instant.

We are currently recruiting and amount of junior, mid and sometimes even senior developers, who cannot write a simple code by their own without using AI is absolutely ridicoulous.\n\nAI can be helpful at work, but when you learn, it can hurt you more than it helps. It gives you answers too fast. You paste the code, it runs, and you feel good for a moment… but you don’t really know why it works. Then later you get a different problem, something small changes, and suddenly you are stuck. And the worst part is: you don’t build the “debug muscle”, and debugging is a big part of programming.\n\nI see this with juniors sometimes. They can produce code, but when I ask “why did you do it this way?” they can’t explain. When tests fail, they panic. When an error shows up, they don’t know what to try first. It’s not because they are not smart. It’s because AI took the hard part away, and that hard part is exactly what builds skill and confidence.\n\nWhen you learn, the best thing is to struggle a little. Write the code yourself. Read the error message. Try to understand what the program is doing. Use print logs or a debugger. Read docs. It feels slow and annoying at first, but this is how you become strong. This is how you start to “see” problems.\n\nIf you really want to use AI, use it like a helper, not like a driver. Ask for a hint, not a full solution. Ask what an error means. Ask to explain one line. And only do it after you tried alone for some time.",

Noticed clear patterns across all successful implementations that our initial design was completely missing.\n\nThey make sharing incredibly easy with pre-written messages and one-click options, show clear benefit to both referrer and referred person like \"give $10 get $10\", display progress toward rewards so you know how close you are, prompt sharing at natural moments like after completing task not randomly, make rewards actually valuable not just badges or points.\n\nApplied all these patterns to our feature by simplifying sharing to one click with customizable message, implemented two-sided incentive with real value, added progress tracking prominently, triggered share prompts after positive experiences like successful workflow completion.\n\nFeature launched 3 weeks ago and referral rate is 23% meaning almost quarter of users refer at least one person, PM says that's way higher than initial goal of 10%. Honestly just copied what works for other products instead of making up our own approach, turns out proven patterns exist for most features and following them works better than trying to be original.\n\nBiggest lesson is when building growth features research is more important than innovation, these patterns have been tested millions of times already so just implement what works.

I only learned this after I spent months iterating on the same project and weighing tradeoffs against one another.\n\nTo keep this short, I want to know what else you can add to my observation.

I start to doubt my work and losing hope on improving. \n\nOne of the main reason i learned how to program (learnt more on the job than i did in college majoring in programming) and do my work is due to the already existing code and learning from it, and i guess i can understand basic programming logic, also being reliant on AI. Outside from work, nothing,I have no idea about anything not involving my work.

Like when learning promises, I'd link it back to callback functions and explain how they solve callback hell. Building a web of connected knowledge instead of isolated facts.\n\nI also keep a running list of common mistakes I make in a separate doc. Like forgetting to return in array methods or mixing up async/await syntax. Reviewing my actual errors is way more useful than rereading correct examples. Stack overflow obviously helps when I'm stuck but I try to understand WHY something works instead of just copying the solution.\n\nMy current setup is a mix of tools that work together pretty well. I use vscode obviously for coding, github for version control and tracking my projects. For learning and retention, I keep my notes in remnote cause it automatically makes flashcards and quizzes from my notes. I also use codepen for quick experiments when I want to test something without setting up a whole project.\n\nStill got a long way to go but at least now I'm not forgetting everything I learned last week. If you're struggling with retention maybe try something similar, just actively test yourself instead of passively rereading notes.

This has been going on for 4 years, and I'm at my wits end. \n\nIt's becoming increasingly obvious that programming is (fittingly, given how computers work) a binary thing: you either get it and it clicks right away and you love it, or you don't get it and never will. Because you can't. Me? I don't have a very good visual imagination. I can't really picture things all that clearly if I haven't seen them before, and my ability to break problems down isn't that great either. \n\nThe problem-solving is a skill that can be sharpened, I know that. But visual imagination? Nope. What you're born with in that department is what you get, and there CANNOT be any improving it EVER, sucker. Plus, there's so many little pitfalls and beginner's traps and instances of \"oh, you just gotta *know,* duuuuude,\"'s that it truly bewilders me how *anyone* learns to do this at all, let alone gets good at it. Thoughts? 'Cause I'm kinda sick of beating my head against a wall, and I've grown even more sick of the bleeding...",

Our school actually has a free tutoring service for CS majors but most of the tutors are juniors or seniors and I think they just do it for their resume since you can tell their heart is not really in it lol.... No offence but yeah I want someone who can actually focus on the specific problems I have and guide me through the work so I can actually UNDERSTAND it not just do the problem in front of me and say \"See?\" And I also tried a site called Wyzant last semester, it's honestly quite expensive and the guy I chose was actually quite good but honestly a bit unreliable with scheduling and stuff so we didn't end up meeting much.

Should I spend more time trying to resolve these problems? I feel like, as someone starting out, it would be a waste of time to spend hours stuck, rather than learning from my mistakes.",

From what I read on this subreddit it seems like everybody recommends that you have a degree to stand out and land a job. \n\n2. Should I continue my self study and switch to a full stack learning program to stand out? (Which I’m seriously considering) And if I do what additional learning should I do? I’ve read on here that DSA is something that companies look for when hiring, should I add that to things I should study? What projects should I create that will help me stand out to companies when I feel competent enough in my skills? (Again under the assumption I switched to full stack) \n\nI welcome all feedback! Don’t hold back, I need the REALITY of what I need or should do. I’m fully committed continuing learning, I just need a better idea of the path ahead of me. \n\nThanks \n\n\n",

My unit is going to be downsizing over the next year or two as our automation platforms increase in scope weening out the need for largescale manual testers. \n\nThis will be the second time I'm going to get downsized out in replacement for devs. I want to avoid going through this cycle a third time, so I'm making it a priority to start learning development so perhaps I can move into something a little more stable longterm. (Let's pretend AI isn't a thing at the moment.) \n\nHere's the issue: I don't really own any personal computers. I've always had work issued machines, and I can't use it for personal projects. What I do have is an old thinkpad (I'm talking really old.) I've since swapped the old harddrive out and replaced it with an SSD and doubled the ram so it's at least functional... I then installed Ubuntu on it. \n\nWith legacy hardware such as this (it's a thinkpad x220 from 2011....that keyboard tho!) what are my actual options? I know I won't be building native iOS apps on this brick.... but what are some domains I could actually consider working towards some subject matter learning? Coming from a windows only work environment, I'm actually very excited to work in a *unix environment proper. \n\nHere are things I'm interested in:\n\n* Ruby / Rails (ruby is so funky)\n* Webdev in general (html/css/js + framework of choice)\n* C development / OS dev / Kernel Dev (out of my league difficulty wise but probably the most doable on legacy linux machine)\n* infosec / security (I can mangle this laptop, nobody will care.)\n* stretch option: windows app dev with c# and visual studio\n\nI'm very curious about programs like The Odin project for one of the first two points. Looking through it, its interesting that it forces you to use git and pull down and push up your work into a github repo which is FANTASTIC to replicate a real life workflow. I really don't like writing in the browser based editor for freecodecamp (though, it might migrate me to an editor later in the program I dunno)\n\nGiven that linux is a brand new thing to me, I'm finding it to be an amazing environment to move around in. It's just so fascinating. It would be a good place to learn C because I'm not afraid of blowing up the machine by messing with a kernel file or something. (I have ubuntu on a bootable USB and can full wipe/install in about 20 minutes)\n\nAS someone who only has cursory domain knowledge of these areas of interest, there are likely things I'm not fully aware of, or considering when making a decision. \n\nIf you or your best friend asked you \"I have this old POS laptop with linux on it and I want to turn it into a second career eventually. What should I do?\" How would you answer? \n\nThanks so much!",

(learning for fun, will probably have project ideas to implement in the future as I'm always full of project ideas)\n\nNow the course is making me download a code editor (sounds relevant indeed, was starting how much longer I would only be able to code inside the course's website) which is called Visual Studio Code. But when I went to download it I realised they advertise themselves as an open-source AI code editor. I'm all for open source, but the AI bit really bugs me.  \nI don't want AI nowhere near my projects, like, ever (I want a planet i can keep living on), and especially not when learning (I teach (human) languages and maths and know how important the thinking process is) (and no i'm not using Codecademy's AI and am annoyed that it is there but at least i don't have to click the button? So wish there'd be free / cheap courses without AI too but couldn't find them either).\n\nSo I tried looking up \"no AI text editors\" and only found \"no-code AI tools\". I tried \"AI-free\" stuff and found \"free AI\" stuff.\n\nIs there somewhere, like a list of resources, that I could find good non AI text editors, and any non-AI things I may need in the future (I don't even know what I'll need lol)\n\nIf you have old non-AI tools that are still perfectly functional what are they?\n\n  \n*(not sure if context is useful, I'm learning HTML + CSS on Windows, probably will be switching to Linux soon)*\n\nThanks for the help! :)",

I don’t have a strong background in search / constraint solving / routing algorithms, so explanations at a conceptual or introductory level are very welcome.\n\nThis link should show the geometry of the problem and some attempts I made with explanations of why I rejected them, but hopefully the problem makes sense without it. \n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gzLPFA9ZrpQOugkBr52p6JK2eQdSiilcl0bp4G\\_O7tM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gzLPFA9ZrpQOugkBr52p6JK2eQdSiilcl0bp4G_O7tM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\n# Problem overview\n\nI have **69 battery cells** arranged in a mostly regular 2D layout:\n\n* A **6 × 11 grid**, plus **3 extra cells at the front**, centered\n* Total = 69 cells\n\nI need to design a **purely 2D metal interconnect** (laser-cut nickel) that connects these cells electrically under very strict constraints.\n\n\n\n# Electrical constraints\n\n* Cells must be grouped into **23 groups of 3 cells in parallel** (3P “bricks”)\n* Those 23 bricks must then be connected **in series** (23S)\n* The result is **23s3p**\n* The series connection must be a **single continuous path** (no branches)\n* Both electrical endpoints (“in” and “out”) must be located at the **front** of the layout\n\n\n\n# Physical constraints\n\n* There are **only two conductor layers**: one on the top of the cells and one on the bottom\n* No jumpers, flyovers, or insulated crossovers are allowed\n* Each cell has **one terminal on the top and the opposite terminal on the bottom** (polarity matters, + must connect to -)\n* Connections must be short and local — no long traces across the pack\n\n\n\n# Fuse constraints (the hardest part)\n\nEvery cell must have its **own fuse link**, and these impose very strict geometric rules:\n\n* Fuse links must be **very short** adjacent or diagonal at most (this somewhat emerges from other requirements about fuses not crossing, not going over or near cells, etc)\n* Fuse links **must not overlap or cross** any other fuse or conductor on the same layer, fuses on the top layer can be routed independently of bottom layer (they end up coupled because the cells connect them)\n* Fuse links should not share narrow corridors where a blown fuse could melt into another conductor\n* Larger bus connections are allowed to merge into pads or nodes, but **fuses are always individual**\n\n\n\n\n\n# Why I’m stuck\n\nAt a high level, this seems to combine:\n\n* grouping items into exact sets (each cell used exactly once)\n* choosing an order for those sets (a single series path)\n* and routing many short, non-overlapping connections in a tight 2D space\n\nI've tried a bunch of solutions and to manually generate a solution and keep ending up stuck on something.  I don't **KNOW** that there exists a solution with the constraints I've set forth but i think there probably should be.  If anyone can show that there cannot exist a solution for some reason and suggest alternate constraints that most closely match what I have while having a solution that would be appreciated too.\n\n\n\n# What I’m asking for\n\n* Is this a known class of problem (or combination of problems)?  I've looked at a number of approaches but none of them seem to fully encapsulate the problem.\n* Are there standard algorithmic approaches or heuristics for problems like this?\n* Is this usually approached with backtracking, graph search, maze-routing ideas, constraint programming, or something else?\n* Are there examples of similar problems (even outside batteries) that might be good references?\n\nI’m not (necessarily) looking for a turnkey solution (though if i was provided with a simple answer I would not be upset) I’m trying to understand **how people normally reason about and structure problems like this** so I can move in a productive direction.\n\n\n\nThis kind of combinatorial / routing problem is *not* what I usually work on, so I may not know the right terminology or standard methods. If you have suggestions, explanations, or even “you should look up X” pointers, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nThanks for reading, and I’m happy to clarify details if needed.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’m running into a time-based data processing problem and would love some design advice.\nI have two modules: one imports raw punch events from biometric machines (just employee ID + timestamp), and the other lets me define shifts. Using these, I try to figure out which shift an employee worked, whether they were late, overtime, etc. Day shifts work perfectly fine, but night shifts and overlapping shifts are causing issues.\nShifts are very flexible: some start early, others late, many cross midnight, and some overlap. Because of this, grouping punches by calendar day doesn’t work. Processing is done by a scheduled job that must run at a specific time. The problem is that at that moment, some shifts are still in progress while others are starting, which leads to incomplete or incorrect grouping—for example, a punch during a night shift might be interpreted as a full shift or a very short one.\nI’m looking for a general approach to assign raw timestamped events to shifts when shifts can overlap or be incomplete at processing time. Any patterns, strategies, or best practices would be super helpful.",

They’re moving away from the annual, soul-crushing calibration where \\~20% of people landed in one of two negative buckets. Going forward, only 10% are considered not-ok. CME and EE were effectively merged, and the multiplier on that bucket was increased.\n\nPeople are actually pretty happy about this.

For those of us who don't have plenty of YOE, you will get drowned out by other candidates who do. That's the reality. There are simply too many people applying to public job postings for the odds to be in your favor. It's possible to make it this way, but highly unlikely.\n\n**If you are a new grad, junior, or intermediate, networking is the key.** You must lean on your network. Tell your family, friends, and the people you bump into what you're looking for. Take that step, make the cringe LinkedIn post to announce your job hunt is underway, mention what you're good at, and ask your peers to chime in and leave a nice comment. My ego prevented me from doing this for too long, but as soon as I did, people reached out. Since then, I've been in so many interviews that I don't even have time to apply for jobs.

I have exactly the skills they want. And at times, it feels like it's these recruiters who are making the decisions on who is a good fit for the job or not. They call you, discuss with you and write some notes for the hiring manager. And the hiring manager sometimes blindly trusts the notes that the recruiter is giving them.\n\nFor example:  \n1. I told a recruiter I have 6 years of experience in Java. Then her immediate question was \"How many years of experience do you have in ExpressJS\". I said I am not that experienced in Javascript/typescript. To which she responded with \"But you said you have 6 years of experience in Java\". This was one of those job postings that are really vague and don't specify which programming language experience they want. \"Need to have at least 5 years of experience in a modern programming language like Java, Golang, Rust or Javascript/Python\". I applied for the job and had the first screening call with the recruiter.\n\n2. Another time I had a call with a recruiter who asked me what I was doing. I told them that I am working in ARM there is an open source library called DPDK, people use it to be networking stacks in userspace. I am working on bench-marking some of the functionality of that library on ARM processors. We are trying to change some of the functionality of that library to use Arm Neon SIMD instructions.\n\nShe let me blabber on for like 15 mins and then she said \"Alright I need you to repeat everything you told me so far. I need to write notes for the hiring manager\". I sighed and then started repeating everything. And then the second time around she is like \"What is a library?\". \"What is ARM?\". \"Does ARM make processors?\". \"What does it mean that you are optimizing code in a library? Are you a Frontend engineer or a backend engineer?\".\n\nAt that point, I was like let me write those notes for you. And she was like I need to write these notes myself. And then out of politeness I said \"Look I am not a native English speaker. Let me type out some text for you. You can copy that into your notes. I am not that good at verbal communication.\" This was around the point in the call where she asked me to explain to her what SIMD instructions are. She declined that offer.\n\nAnd after the call, I got rejected. This was specifically for a job that required people with experience in ARM Neon.\n\nSometimes I wish I could directly talk to the hiring manager or a software engineer in the team. Sometimes it really feels like these recruiters don't understand what the hell I am working on. And they are the people who are rejecting me :|",

No feel-good motivational messaging will help.\n\nThe job market is tough, but the real problem is that I got into industry once when the the job market would take in anyone off the street with an ability to type. That gave me unrealistic expectations.\n\nNow things are at a place where there is strict gatekeeping. Sorry to those who can't even get interviews.

        "author": "conconxweewee1",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This past week I was asked to tech lead a project that was completely vibe coded by senior VPs and c suite at my company, and I kind of have no idea what’s going on.\n\nOne of the high ups that I report up through, got me on a one on one call and spent a good amount of time glazing me before explaining that the him and a lot of other executives at the company have spent the past couple months vibe coding what he described as “the most important product at the company right now”.\n\nHe then proceeded to say that he really wants me to tech lead this product and get it into production. I think I was kind of still warm and fuzzy from being glazed so much that I just kind of immediately said yes (also in my experience when someone higher up, asked you to do something you say yes, that’s just kind of the way I’ve gotten as far as I have in my career, it sucks, but it’s paid off for me). He also mentioned that by accepting this, I was not allowed to hand code anything, I had to “fully embrace, vibe coding“ whatever that means. I also managed two other teams, that work on five other products and when I asked this individual “ what’s gonna happen there?” he basically was like “ you’ll pretty much be able to do this on the side!” 😳\n\nBasically, since then, I have pulled down the code and it’s a absolute mess, aside from the fact that the performance is utterly atrocious and it’s extremely slow and unintuitive, the code is literally a trash fire pile of AI generated slop. Absolutely no organization, insane architectural decisions that for the sake of anonymity, I won’t go into. And overall, just like an insane volume of code that it would take a human being a very very very, very, very, very, very long time to read through and understand even half of it.\n\nAll the while I’ve been trying to make heads or tails of the code base the executives keep pushing 1 million commits a day, they are like rejoicing in their slack channel. They are so over the moon that finally they can just build whatever they want. Ironically they don’t see the pattern that every time they push something they report a bug or report something else being broken, but I’m also not banking on them noticing that pattern.\n\nThey keep making remarks about how companies that aren’t doing exactly what they’re doing right now are going to fail. They keep making remarks that they finally solved the puzzle. It’s becoming clear that they do not value software engineers and they’ve got it all figured out, from their perspective.\n\nI’m not really sure what to do here, I have a product manager that has been tapped to product manage this and we had a call today where we were basically”WTF is going on”. We have a meeting next week to level set, but I’m just kind of anxious for the outcome of that part of me kinda just wants to say in the most professional way possible “ I don’t know what you guys really need me for it seems like you’ve got it figured out and if you don’t mind, I’d like to focus on my day-to-day tasks”.\n\nLike gun to my head, I think the idea of shipping this to customers is suicidal for our company. It’s an insane amount of code that no one really understands what’s going on, which means the only person that can effectively fix bugs is Claude and I’ve heard horror stories of Claude really not being able to handle big projects.\n\nI just don’t know what to do because I feel like if I was trusting my gut, I would say let’s slow down and talk about what we actually want to build, take some time to actually pass through the code and make sure that we’re making smart choices. But I just know that that would be met with such resentment and distain. I feel like this is a group of individuals that is so angry that for so long people that know what is going on have gotten in the way of what they want, which is more more more now now now.\n\nHas anyone else experience this? What should I do?",

They had the bones when i got there but I iterated a lot on there. Feels kind of bittersweet I got the end of the day meeting and my manager said we determined we have to let you go. They said at this stage they needed less development and a sales guy in my spot.\n\nI ask if it was performance related but they said no and only offered a little criticism that the only critique i had was I couldve understood certain parts of the app more but I literally built a big chunk of it so idk. The ceo even undercut that criticism by saying i certaintly could do my job better and look even if it was perfect I dont think it would effect this decision. Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back. he said he thought the world of me and said i should know hes not the type to mince words but he said he would give a recommendation to whoever. My manager was all quiet in the corner and kinda just said he echoed what the ceo said and just said at this stage of the development we expected to be in a certain spot and it didnt happen.(I almost took that as a personal critique but idk its just raw right now). Apparently they made the decision during christmas but didnt want to tell me until now. I told them I would just walk out quietly at the end of the day(we only had 10 minutes left.) they both seemed genuinely sad but idk I expected my manager to say more knowing he knew but he was just tucked away quiet. Anyway im ranting but I guess thats just the nature of these types of jobs I guess. I kinda saw it coming when we were burning money and they couldnt get people fully on board with the beta. I just feel kinda used.\n\nJust kinda wanted some advice on what jobs are more stable. Ive literally done product oriented jobs with a established product. Consulting and now a start up.

        "content": "Hey y'all, I just got off the phone with my boss with my promotion details and I just need some help figuring out what I should do, because their offer was quite insulting.\n\nMy company back in November asked if I would do a trial run to be the new Technical Lead for my team since my current one was leaving, this trial run would last two months. So its January and I just got off a call with my company where I was told they like me in this role and are giving me the title and a pay raise to go with it. However, the pay raise was only 7k a year, my total pay is now 85k a year for a technical lead position. I have people below me in this position that make more than I do. Not only is the pay way less than I expected, but my company had a job posting for a Technical Lead where the listed salary was 120k, which is still low but 35k more than I was offered. I feel incredibly insulted by the offer they gave me.\n\nI have a few thoughts on what I should do:\n\n1. I am thinking about messaging them back and asking for either 130k a year or my old role back. The extra work from the role is worth way more than 7k extra a year, so if I can't get more pay I would rather just be in an individual contributor role and not leadership.\n2. Or take the offer and try and job hop as soon as I can. While the pay sucks the title is good and could help me land a new role somewhere ill actually get paid well.\n\nWith that said I am not really in a position to lose this job unless I have something else lined up and while I have been looking for a new role already, I haven't had much luck at all with the market being so bad. I would hope the new title would help, but I am unsure with that. So what do you think I should do? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add that I never really wanted this role either, the only reason I accepted it to begin with is because I thought it would have nice pay and my family and I could purchase a home. Now it just feels like a role I don't like and the pay sucks, this is why I might ask for my old role back.\n\nEDIT 2: I have 6 YOE as a developer almost half of which is with this company. My title before this promotion was junior developer so the jump is pretty significant and why I was expecting my pay to have a significant jump as well.\n\nEDIT 3: This is my final update, I spoke with my company and got an extra 10k added to my salary. Its still not where I would like to be but it is better at least. I will probably stick it out another year to have a full year with the title then I will bounce to somewhere that will pay me more. Thanks for all of the advice everyone.",

Based in NYC. I've been interviewing for junior and mid-level Data Analyst, Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer, and Backend SWE roles. I pretty much gave up on landing a DS role for now but I have been pretty open to any data adjacent role. Most of my interviews have been for analyst and analytics engineer roles though.\n\nLately, interviews themselves haven't been the issue. I'm consistently making it to final rounds, and the feedback has actually been positive. Stuff like great culture fit, strong skillset, asks the right questions, etc. No glaring red flags. But… I keep getting rejected at the very end. Usually it's the classic: \"The other candidate had more experience with X tool\" or \"We went with someone with a PhD.\" Sometimes, it'll be \"The role was closed due to budget.\" \n\nI'm honestly getting a bit jaded. I don't think I've ever had this hard of a time and it feels like there are way more interview rounds now than when I first started my career.\n\nWhat's stressing me out more is my personal situation. My girlfriend and I live together, and she's worried we might have to move out of our apartment because retail income just isn't covering the bills. Been stretching my savings from my last job and now the pressure is starting to hit hard.\n\nI'm not really sure what else to do to finally get an offer. Do I just keep grinding and hope timing lines up? Am I aiming at the wrong roles? Is this just how bad the market is right now?\n\nAny advice (or even just commiseration) would be appreciated. ",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nApple is my dream company and I have been practising very hard for the interviews. I currently work at one of the big banks, graduated from a top 10 CS uni (no 1 in country) and have 2.5 years of professional experience. Life there is good, I get along well with colleagues and we like each other, but my goal has always been to get into a big tech company. The bureaucracy and nature of a bank really stifles engineering i feel, hence my decision to transfer. I simply felt Apple is the pinnacle of engineering standards and I would want to learn from Apple instead.\n\nRecently, I had the interview with the hiring manager for the first round and he seemed really disinterested in me early on, but not necessarily from the start. His body language shows it, he would rock his body back and forth. He asked me only resume-focused questions and just asked one simple technical question which i got correct and then ended the interview.\n\nI was quite taken aback because when i sit for interviews at the other major tech companies, I had expected a rigorous technical questions but it wasnt the case for Apple which felt really strange to me. Then, yesterday (2 days after my interview) my status on the applications portal showed in the 'Archived' state.\n\nTo add on some context, I feel it might have been my work experience. I am relatively early in my career but have a few short stints of about 1 year each and I am only 10 months in the bank.\n\nAlso, in the bank, we dont have root access and i read in big tech they tune kernel parameters for the hyper-scale traffic, use /proc for troubleshooting as it has less overhead and has more info like we can see what version of binary its run, spread out interrupts alongside cores (RSS), etc. So, my Linux professional experience is clearly not stellar tho i know a lot of theory from reading.\n\nWhen i described some stuff to the hiring manager specifically about our disaster recovery process, i am guessing it could feel really different and strange to him that we have to take screenshots and failover abruptly (not canary) and other stuff but that is simply the protocol of the bank.\n\nI would appreciate any advice from you all on my situation. If you were an interviewer / hiring manager , why would you behave the way the Apple Hiring Manager did to me during my interview ? I have been very polite throughout but sth about my interview he was probably dissatisfied. Maybe I rambling away or what not ?\n\nThank you to this awesome community in advance and you all have a great week ahead!",

Back then, creating things made me feel alive. During COVID, I started learning programming, and it felt like everything finally connected. I truly believed this was my future.\n\nI joined engineering college with huge dreams. I thought I would figure things out, land a good job, earn well, and finally change my life. I worked hard and got my first internship through a senior—it was unpaid, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to learn.\n\nLater, I got another internship that paid ₹15k per month. After three months, they offered me a junior developer role at ₹40k per month.\n\nI rejected it.\n\nI believed I was meant to build something of my own. I didn’t want to settle too early. I joined someone who was building a product, fixed bugs, improved features, and gave everything I had. I worked for six months and was paid $1,000 in total. I told myself this was a sacrifice, not a mistake.\n\nBut after that, everything slowly collapsed.\n\nEvery SaaS idea I tried failed. I couldn’t focus. I was distracted, overwhelmed, and stuck in constant noise instead of real progress. Days passed. Then months. Now years feel gone.\n\nToday, I’m completely stuck. I apply for jobs every day—no replies, no rejections, just silence. I feel like I’ve gone backward while everyone else moved forward with their lives.\n\nThe worst part is my own mind. It keeps calling me a loser. I regret rejecting that job. At the time, I thought I was being brave. Now it feels like I was just naive.\n\nI’ve had big dreams since I was 12. I always believed my life would change one day. Right now, it feels dark, directionless, and heavy. I have about 10 months left, and it honestly feels like my last chance to turn things around.\n\nI don’t know what I’m capable of anymore. I just know I don’t want this to be the end of my story.",

I would have to travel for this role though but it would be in a very exciting industry that would make most envious I imagine. At the same time, the idea of taking the severance and braving the market is tempting, even knowing how tough hiring is right now. What would you do in my situation? Reddit tells me to hold on no matter what, but will it really take me longer than 6 months to find a job? I have significant savings so I could last much longer than my severance if need to, but I would prefer to stay employed and not draw down my savings. \n\nIf you are wondering I would say my leetcode skills are weak to moderate.

Outside of that I was pretty happy at my job and would not have minded if I didn't get any offers (other than the obvious blow to my ego).\n\nAlmost all of my jobs were applied through Welcome To The Jungle, formerly Otta.  I responded to a few recruiter email reachouts, but only if the recruiter worked directly for the company, rather than for a third party.  I did not apply to any companies as practice; I only applied to companies that I genuinely wouldn't mind working for and whose salary range was within at least what I was making now, or more.\n\nAlmost all companies followed a pretty standard process - recruiter call, technical screen, hiring manager screen, onsite.  All companies did not ask any leetcode or brainteaser questions (I did my best to filter those companies out).  One company had an online assessment before I talked to anyone, and a take-home later in the process that took ~10 hours.  I had fun doing the take home and did not mind the time it took.\n\nPreparing for my interview was pretty straightforward.  Because I was targeting companies with no leetcode, I did not prepare for coding assessments at all.  I did well on interviews that required me to write code (save for one, where I flubbed due to a misunderstanding of the problem / incorrect assumption as it was based on a real-life product).  For system design, I used the free versions of HelloInterview (I did not pay for membership like the other post), but I did have an existing lifetime membership for GreatFrontEnd for FE system design.  I did not find it that useful for the interviews I encountered.\n\nFor scheduling interviews, the majority of them were scheduled from 6AM-9AM PT (east coast morning), or (2PM-6PM PT) (west coast afternoons), depending on where the company was located.\n\nFor the companies that I got rejected, I think my weakest area was for sure system design questions, and doing technical deep dives of my work projects.  Two of the five companies that rejected me provided detailed feedback, which I appreciated and understood their perspective. Some rejections were purely tactical errors on my part.\n\nIn the end (just before new years), I accepted a remote role for +20% base, and a lot more equity than my current role.  The role I accepted was one where I was most interested in the company anyway; both offers I received were from companies I would've been happy joining.  The entire process took a little less than two months from the initial offer being sent, to me accepting an offer.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

        "author": "LongjumpingPage6168",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, like the title, I don't understand the point of online coding assessments that major companies give on HackerRank, CodeSignal, CodeVue, etc. that we have to do on our own, while being proctored with camera and microphones on. I am OK with technical interviews with another engineer where we can code together and I can communicate my thoughts, processes, and my knowledge while programming. However, what's the point of stupid online assessments that major companies shove down our throats? You tell me that I have to do these proctored online assessments without any access to Internet (I cannot search for syntax or anything related to the coding problems) and I have to program with the camera and microphones on, and I cannot talk or look at anywhere else during the assessment because I'm afraid they would cause me of cheating. No one would hear me communicating my thoughts or processes during coding. And if I cannot pass all test cases within the time limit, I'm automatically eliminated from the hiring process, and my application would be thrown away, all of my past work experiences, skills, and projects I have gained over the years would be useless for them. And even if I pass all the test cases, I can still not move forward due to other reasons.\n\nPeople said that I have to do LeetCode, and I have practiced on my own for years on both LC, HackerRank, CodeSignal,... and solved over 100 problems... I also reviewed all data structures and algorithms again, but at the end, what's the use? Even when doing coding assignments in classes my professors allow us to search online but why cannot I search anything during these stupid assessments? And you know that most of us cannot pass these assessments in this way. So, I fear that even if I do 1000 to 10,000 LC problems the result is still the same, when I know that the companies only care if I pass all the test cases in these coding assessments.\n\nAnd funnily, I got my first part-time web developer job on campus, and my first IT infrastructure internship at a Fortune 500 multi-industry company without any LeetCode-style interviews. Especially in the hiring process for my first internship program, I only had to go through phone screen with a recruiter, and a behavioral interview with the IT manager where we discuss about my projects and past experiences, and within a week, I got hired for the program. But now, I did not get the return offer from the company so I have to do all of these LC over again with no hope.\n\nI feel like this is the only thing that fails me to get the full-time career I need after my graduation in May 2026. The other things like resume, networking, communication, interview skills, I am still learning and improving everyday, but these assessments feel hopeless to me. Just thinking about how I can be unemployed after graduation drives me crazy and makes me feel so embarrassed.\n\nAnd I've heard some people said I can skip these assessments with referrals. Is this true? I have friends who are working in these companies and I used to work with some of them, or we had little interactions but we're still in good terms. How do I reach out to them in a professional way to get the referrals? Can someone tell me? I'm out of options.\n\n",

        "content": "For context, I'm a 2023 grad from engineering university, interned at big bank and got converted to a full time offer at the end of it.\n\nI am very grateful to have a job in my current position, but I feel like I've been rotting away as a developer for the past almost 3 years of working at the same company.\n\nMy whole time has been a huge mess unfortunately. This team is entirely focused on replacing an existing internal platform within the company and I've been stuck on doing mindless CRUD work for the entire 2+ years I've been working. The product is essentially created out of a war started between two directors who disagreed on the current approach of the platform at the company.\n\nBesides the messy team origins, my biggest difficulty has been gaining a deeper domain knowledge and be able to insert myself into key initiatives. I'm not sure if it's bad luck or just me not being smart about which work I pick up, but I somehow always end up taking tasks that don't help me to stand out or make a huge noticeable impact. Our team suffers from very poorly written stories and constantly unclear product requirements so it tends to be a roulette when taking on work for the sprint.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes seniors and tech leads are secluded from ad hoc conversations that happen between leadership, so requirements get changed on the fly at times or critical information is missed leading to mistakes and constant miscommunication of requirements.\n\nRegardless, I screwed up during these few years and couldn't make a name for myself within my org. I've missed my chance to work on more impactful projects and take ownership on bigger features. I've fallen into the state of being a feature monkey and don't see myself going forward any further nor do I think it's worth as several engineers and managers have already begun leaving my org.\n\nThis experience has made me question whether I should even bother continuing engineering as a career. I'm starting to think I'll be capped as a junior / mid level engineer due to my inability to play the game right. I already feel so behind compared to my peers and have really nothing impressive to talk about in interviews in terms of feature ownership.\n\nOverall, working at corporate has started to make me dislike development and I have no motivation or energy to upskill or tackle side projects anymore. I'm pretty lost as for what to do at this point as no team is willing to hire internally and my current endeavors for external opportunities has been absolutely awful. Anyone else feel this way?\n\ntl;dr: mediocre engineer barely surviving at current company, starting to resent full stack work, and hopeless in terms of other job prospects",

        "content": "This was for Delivery Consultant. My understanding, is that it's like a consulting arm of AWS where consultant go to clients and act as temporary employees more or less.\n\nHave 5YOE, been out of work for a year. Just got the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification and then applied to the role. 2 months ago, contacted by recruiter after applcation and passed OA. My recruiter asked me to prep 10 STAR stories as well as LeetCode and to wait 3 weeks before scheduling the phone screen which I thought was overkill, but could appreciate that she wanted me to be as prepped as possible. Phone screen was with a chill friendly guy I believe one of the hiring managers for this department. We did 1 STAR with some follow ups, as well as a AWS system design problem which went over smoothly, and then a basic coding challenge which was easy to complete. He hinted that I would be moving forward, which I did 2 days later. Scheduled the final loop for a month right after the holidays.\n\n1st interview guy seemed chill and only asked LPs. Ended 15 min early.\n\n2nd interview, was with a woman who at end informed me she was not part of this department (so the bar raiser), had a friendly introduction. Again, only LPs where she did some follow up, but no hardcore grilling. Ended about 20 minutes early.\n\n3rd interview, was the hiring manager who also did only LPs with me. Again follow ups which I answered, but was prepared for. Halfway through the interview, she all of a sudden asks, you have experience working in small teams, but tell me about roles with big teams and organizations. I was a little off guard and asked if we were still doing the STAR format. She said if I wanted to. I gave a brief story about 3 years of my experience working at a large telecomm comapny (which I already answered with STAR stories from), and mentioned about the dozens of teams I interacted with, and how I worked in a major lift and shift project with microservices with over 50 services and 200 people. She went on and said how as an L5 they were looking for someone with experience leading large organizations, etc. even though at the beginning she said the role varies a lot (startups, large companies, short term and long term contracts)  \nShe then asked me the final LP. I asked if she wanted as story from the telecomm company. She glared at the screen and sharply answered \"sure\". I wasn't sure if this was hostility, or her following interview protocol, but I just mentioned I didnt have any stories left that I havent told her or answer that question, so I talked about one from my 1st job at a 6 person startup. At the end, she did a q and a, and then just said my recruiter would be the point of contact from now on. Again, didnt really read into it, but everyone else just mentioned \"oh, you got 3 interviews left, good luck\" or somethign like that. Ended 20 min early.\n\n4th interview next day, was friendly guy who did 1 LP, followed by some Leetcode. The coding was quite easy (easy/medium) and didn't really have much issues other than some syntax (like making sure 'self' was used when setting up the function). He was friendly and enthusiastic about me getting the optimal solutions. Ended on time.\n\n5th interview the following day was chill guy who did a few LP in the first half. The second half was a barrage of questions in sytem design. I got maybe 75% of them, especially the ones I remember from my SA Pro cert. The ones I didn't, he assured me it was ok, nobody gets them all. But who knows, maybe I missed some that I shouldn't have. We only had a minute left at the end for q and a, but he was willing to stay a bit overtime to answer questions for me.\n\nNext day, get the automated reject email. If I were to guess, it might have somethign to do with the 3rd interview with the hiring manager. From what I've read, most people feel they do well on their LPs, but who knows, maybe I didn't. I prepped the 10 STAR stories, and didn't reuse them for the same interviewer, but maybe I needed more across all of them? Researching, I've heard varying opinions. Finally, I dunno if I was just outclassed by another candidate or an internal candidate I don't know about.  \nJust a bit down since I spent 2 months prepping LeetCode and refining and rehearsing my STAR stories.",

I've been working as a full stack engineer uninterrupted since early 2019. I started at a major US bank, went to a streaming service and now I'm working in ecommerce for a mid-major regional retailer; I don't think I'm anywhere near being a 10X whiz kid dev but I've never had anything less than Above Average ratings on performance reviews and I would say I'm generally perceived as competent at the least. \n\nMy problem comes in that none of these jobs, tasks or projects have given me anything close to resembling satisfaction. I think I've come to realize that while I like solving problems, building tools for people to use and seeing all the cool things we can do, I don't like basically everything else that makes up our jobs as engineers. I don't find joy in upgrading Node versions or repositioning a button to increase customer retention; optimizing our add to cart functions feels like a waste of time to me when it already works and we see no impact on metrics in the slightest. I have trouble bringing myself to care about code coverage in tests for features that no one actually wants and likely only a handful of folks will ever use. I exercise, I eat enough, I drink water and pay my bills on time but I can't imagine myself doing this for the next thirty years of my life. So what's the \"escape plan\"? \n\nI've considered going back to school for an MBA but having spoken to many consultants who have taken that path I don't think it's for me. For a while I also looked at going back for a Masters in CS but that felt like a great way to further pigeon hole myself into only being seen as Guy Who Codes. It also seems silly to just move laterally and become a pure 'product/manager' person who comes up with or supervises the new features that bum me out so much to build. Speaking to folks older than me, the common advice is go speak with a career counselor but the two experiences I've had with them reminded me far too much of those quizzes you had to take in middle school that suggested career paths. \n\nThis forum has helped me out a lot in the past by giving good feedback, tough love, and even just hearing that others are in the same boat so I come to y'all hat in hand wondering - am I crazy for feeling like this? How does one take these skills into some other direction? Is the best advice here to just suck it up and double down on my hobbies, finding joy outside of work?

What is the market like for the less exciting places that might not pay as well but also don't have a hustle culture where you have to compete with your colleagues to just not be the next one laid off?",

        "content": "Strategy for Applying and How to get More Responses:\n\n* Do apply to any and all big companies. This includes Big Tech (tech companies such as Google, Datadog, OpenAI, FAANG etc.) but also includes big non-tech companies (think Walmart, Target, Ford, Epic to a certain extent). However, be prepared to never get responses from these. The conversion rate of responses from these is a lot lower than other companies. This is due to both the amount of people applying, you applying later than other people (they may just only look at the first X number of applications), but also the amount of company leadership, direction, and planning changes that are typical with these big companies (these are expected). You may not get a response and that may mean nothing with your resume or applications. Which leads us to...\n* Apply to startups and / or small businesses. There are a lot of startups out there that may benefit from your specific experience or skills. Where do you find these though? ycombinator, workatastartup, builtinnyc, wellfound are good places to start. More than applying, here is where you might need to \"network\". Look at the founders, look at the people working there. Referrals here are a lot more helpful than in Big Tech companies, because things at smaller companies are a lot more personal and less automated. This is how I found my early-stage startup job. So you might want to look at founders / early employees; see if you have any connections on LinkedIn or went to the same school. See if you have any secondary connections. Reach out to people. Even if not, you can cold message on LinkedIn. You may not get a lot of responses. That's ok / expected. \n* Startups are less cyclical in their hiring, meaning they may hire at random times / year round / for the right person / after fundraises.\n\n  \nMy experiences:\n\n* Have gone through extensive job searches 3X. This helped a ton. Each cycle required 300-700 apps each. Got a random job in 1, an early stage startup the 2nd time, Big Tech the 3rd time.\n* Anecdotal evidence:  Applying with or without a cover letter does not seem to matter in my case, at least it didn't in my experience. The places I got interviews I didn't use a cover letter.\n* For startups, things are a lot more informal... even cold reached out to someone on LinkedIn (alum from my school) once to ask about their experience at their startup, and it turned into an interview lol (for which I got to the final round). They didn't even have a position open, but were willing to hire for the right engineer.\n* Have gotten Amazon, Datadog offers (and currently work at Datadog)",

        "content": "I will try to keep this from becoming a doom post, but I definitely have the job market blues. The degree being everything in 2020 and significantly less in 2026 has taken its toll.\n\nIn the past, I was a hardworking student who worked and attended college full-time. I am pretty far from that now. Due to some poor scheduling on my part, I am not working, and I am in my last semester taking only two courses. It is a very anticlimactic ending.\n\nIn fall, I did a fair amount of interview prep, including attending a semester-long workshop. I also applied to about 300–400 positions without a single interview... Ironically, I received more interviews during my sophomore and junior years. My stats are a 3.4 GPA, two internships (one large corporation and one startup), at a decent state university.\n\n**Schedule**\n\n* 9–10am — wake up and wish I chose a different major\n* 11am — go to class\n* 1pm — lunch\n* 2pm — CodeSignal (4–5 problems) ...pretty inconsistent. 1 week on one week off.\n* 4pm — consider a master’s (EE/CE)\n* 5pm — class work or full-stack coding for capstone\n* 7pm — dinner\n* 8pm — gym\n* 9pm — maybe LeetCode medium problem\n* 10pm — apply to 4–5 positions out of habit\n* 11pm — TV, gaming, beer\n* 2–3am — sleep\n\nReflecting on my bachelor’s degree, as one does in their last semester, I am not very satisfied with the experience. It was highly theoretical, and my main interests in firmware/embedded programming and security were not well supported by the course catalog. I was also worried it would be difficult to break into either niche directly, so I generalized as a backend developer with some cloud experience.\n\nSo ~~rate~~ roast my lazy ass or feel free to share your own routine. Maybe I'll be inspired.",

I'm in NYC if that makes any difference.\n\nI did full stack at my old job, mostly with React and Node.js, along with mostly AWS services. Since I've only interviewed when I first started, I don't have a lot of experience interviewing and don't know what to expect nowadays. I've been studying full time mostly DSA and system design for the past two months and feel like I'm almost there with that. I'm thinking there will also be some live coding implementations that I'm going to incorporate more into my studies. Curious if anyone has good exercises or resources regarding what companies expect for the implementation round. Looking for insights on what to expect and resources outside of DSA/system design. Hoping to start applying in a month. Thanks!",

I don’t think my company I work for now will be able to hire me due to a hiring freeze so I am applying to other jobs. I just recently did a pre screen interview with a recruiter from a big company that I was shocked even reached out to me as I hear nothing, and I passed that. The next step is a technical interview. I was told it will consist of 1-2 DSA medium questions which will be a majority of the interview, followed by some potentially light fundamental questions and talking about my background. I have no problem talking about my background, but the live coding really terrifies me. This is my first ever technical interview as my current company doesn’t do them. I feel the stakes are extra high because of how bad the market is, and the pay is very high. My DSA skills are horrid as is, and the idea of having to narrate live what I’m doing without going silent for too long and then receiving follow up questions makes me think there’s no chance I pass. I guess this post is more of venting than seeing assistance, but I guess I’m looking for some advice. I’m really scared I’ll go silent as I try to think and have no idea what to do ",

The role requires me to relocate, they did not provide compensation but swears it is generous if given the role. \n\nWhether or not I receive the offer, I do not know how to reflect on my experience post-interview. The “interview” was not technical, but seemed to be more vibes-based. An emphasis on culture I suppose, but not necessarily triggering any alarm bells in my head. \n\nThe description notes a requirement for prior LLM-usage/experience. I’m not against AI-assisted coding, but I do not like vibe coding. If you do it, cool, but it’s not for me. I’m worried that’s what they want from me. The job is advertised as just mostly prompting, and then cleaning up the output, and I’m not sure if this is common practice nowadays. I know this isn’t a new approach for a company to adopt, but if I get the role it will be my first FT SWE position barring an internship I had a couple years prior. Given this, I want to ensure this is a role I can grow in and actually learn. Another thing they emphasize is how they want to go all-in on AI. I’m no doomer, but I do think a bubble will pop at some point, and I don’t want to be left on the short end of the stick here. \n\nDo any of you have jobs like this? What is it like? Is it worth moving across the country for if compensated fairly? \n\nIn all honesty, the job description read like a joke to me and the interview was extremely simple. If I get no offer I’ll probably be offended lol. But if I do get one, I’m not even sure if it’s the right choice. I want to be able to reflect on this interview, but I’m not sure what lessons I should bring with me. ",
