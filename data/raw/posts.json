If you are *not* building LLM agents, what cool stuff are you actually working on these days?\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing on your plate right now?\n\nA weird ingestion challenge?\n\nInternal tools?\n\nSomething that sped up your team?\n\nSome insane BigQuery or Snowflake optimization rabbit hole?\n\nI am not looking for PR answers. I want to hear what actual data engineers are building in 2025 that does not involve jamming an LLM between a user and a SQL warehouse.\n\nWhat is your coolest current project?",

        "content": "For every other data engineer or someone in higher hierarchy down the road comes to a choiuce of Apache Iceberg or Databricks Delta Lake, so we went ahead and benchmarked both systems. Just sharing our experience here.\n\nTL;DR  \nBoth formats have their perks: Apache Iceberg offers an open, flexible architecture with surprisingly fast query performance in some cases, while Databricks Delta Lake provides a tightly managed, all-in-one experience where most of the operational overhead is handled for you.\n\nSetup & Methodology\n\nWe used the TPC-H 1 TB dataset  which is a dataset of about 8.66 billion rows across 8 tables to compare the two stacks end-to-end: ingestion and analytics.\n\nFor the Iceberg setup:  \n  \nWe ingested data from PostgreSQL into Apache Iceberg tables on S3, orchestrated through OLake’s high-throughput CDC pipeline using AWS Glue as catalog and EMR Spark for query..  \n Ingestion used 32 parallel threads with chunked, resumable snapshots, ensuring high throughput.  \nOn the query side, we tuned Spark similarly to Databricks (raised shuffle partitions to 128 and disabled vectorised reads due to Arrow buffer issues).\n\nFor the Databricks Delta Lake setup:  \nData was loaded via the JDBC connector from PostgreSQL into Delta tables in 200k-row batches. Databricks’ managed runtime automatically applied file compaction and optimized writes.  \nQueries were run using the same 22 TPC-H analytics queries for a fair comparison.\n\nThis setup made sure we were comparing both ingestion performance and analytical query performance under realistic, production-style workloads.\n\nWhat We Found\n\n* We used OLake to ingest to Iceberg and was about 2x faster - 12 hours vs 25.7 hours on Databricks thanks to parallel chunked ingestion.\n* Iceberg ran the full TPC-H suite 18% faster than Databricks.\n* Cost: Infra cost was 61% lower on Iceberg + OLake (around $21.95 vs $50.71 for the same run).\n\nhere are the overall result and our ideology on this-\n\nDatabricks still wins on ease-of-use: you just click and go. Cluster setup, Spark tuning, and governance are all handled automatically. That’s great for teams that want a managed ecosystem and don’t want to deal with infrastructure.\n\nBut if your team is comfortable managing a Glue/AWS stack and handling a bit more complexity, Iceberg + OLake’s open architecture wins on pure numbers  faster at scale, lower cost, and full engine flexibility (Spark, Trino, Flink) without vendor lock-in.\n\nread our article to know more on our steps followed and the overall benchmarks and the numbers around it curious to know what you people think.  \n  \nThe blog's [here](https://olake.io/iceberg/databricks-vs-iceberg/) \n\n",

        "content": "Lately I’ve been deep diving into data governance because our \"wild west\" data stack is finally catching up with us. I’ve read a ton of dry whitepapers and vendor guides, and I wanted to share a summary of a framework that actually makes sense for modern engineering teams (vs. the old-school \"lock everything down\" approach).\n\nI’m curious if anyone here has successfully moved from a centralized model to a federated one?\n\nThe Core Problem: Most frameworks treat governance as a \"police function.\" They create bottlenecks. The modern approach (often called \"Active Governance\") tries to embed governance into the daily workflow rather than making it a separate compliance task.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the framework components that seem essential:\n\n1.) The Operating Model (The \"Who\") You basically have three choices. From what I’ve seen, #3 is the only one that scales:\n- Centralized: One team controls everything. (Bottleneck city).\n- Decentralized: Every domain does whatever they want. (Chaos).\n- Federated/Hybrid: A central team sets the \"Standards\" (security, quality metrics), but the individual Domain Teams (Marketing, Finance) own the data and the definitions.\n\n2.) The Pillars (The \"What\") If you are building this from scratch, you need to solve for these three:\n- Transparency: Can people actually find the data? (Catalogs, lineage).\n- Quality: Is the data trustworthy? (Automated testing, not just manual checks).\n- Security: Who has access? (RBAC, masking PII).\n\n3.) The \"Left-Shift\" Approach This was a key takeaway for me: Governance needs to move \"left.\" Instead of fixing data quality in the dashboard (downstream), we need to catch it at the source (upstream).\n- Legacy way: Data Steward fixes a report manually.\n- Modern way: The producer is alerted to a schema change or quality drop before the pipeline runs.\n\nThe Tooling Landscape I've been looking at tools that support this \"Federated\" style. Obviously, you have the big clouds (Purview, etc.), but for the \"active\" metadata part, where the catalog actually talks to your stack (Snowflake, dbt, Slack), tools like Atlan or Castor seem to be pushing this methodology the hardest.\n\nQuestion for the power users of this sub: For those of you who have \"solved\" governance, did you start with the tool or the policy first? And how do you get engineers to care about tagging assets without forcing them?\n\nThanks!",

        "author": "raginjason",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "When it comes to reporting, I’m a fan of Kimball/star schema. I believe that the process of creating dimensions and facts actually reveals potential issues inside of your data. Discussing and ironing out grain and relationships between various tables helps with all of this. Often the initial assumptions don’t hold up and the modeling process helps flesh these edge cases out. It also gives you a vocabulary that you don’t have to invent inside your organization (dimension, fact, bridge, SCD, junk dimension, degenerate dimension, etc).\n\nI personally do not see OBT as much of a data model. It always seemed like “we contorted the data and mashed it together so that we got a huge table with the data we want” without too much rhyme or reason. I would add that an exception I have made is to join a star together and materialize that as OBT so that data science or analysts can hack on it in Excel, but this was done as a delivery mechanism not a modeling methodology. Honestly, OBT has always seemed pretty amateur to me. I’m interested if anyone has a different take on OBT. Is there anyone out there advocating for a structured and disciplined approach to creating datamarts with an OBT philosophy? Did I miss it and there actually is a Kimball-ish person for OBT that approaches it with rigor and professionalism?\n\nFor some context, I recently modeled a datamart as a star schema and was asked by an incoming leader “why did you model it with star schema?”. To me, it was equivalent to asking “why did you use a database for the datamart?”. Honestly, for a datamart, I don’t think anything other than star schema makes much sense, so anything else was not really an option. I was so shocked at this question that I didn’t have a non-sarcastic answer so I tabled the question. Other options could be: keep it relational, Datavault, or OBT. None of these seem serious to me (ok datavault is a serious approach as I understand it, but such a niche methodology that I wouldn’t seriously entertain it). The person asking this question is younger and I expect he entered the data space post big data/spark, so likely an OBT fan.\n\nI’m interested in hearing from people who believe OBT is superior to star schema. Am I missing something big about OBT?",

        "author": "Hefty-Citron2066",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "hey folks, curious how others are tackling a problem my team keeps running into.\n\n**TL;DR:** We have data spread across Hive, Iceberg tables, Kafka topics, and some PostgreSQL databases. Managing metadata in 4+ different places is becoming a nightmare. Looking at catalog federation solutions and wanted to share what I found.\n\n## Our Setup\n\nWe're running a pretty typical modern stack but it's gotten messy over time:\n- Legacy Hive metastore (can't kill it yet, too much depends on it)\n- Iceberg tables in S3 for newer lakehouse stuff\n- Kafka with its own schema registry for streaming\n- A few PostgreSQL catalogs that different teams own\n- Mix of AWS and GCP (long story, acquisition stuff)\n\nThe problem is our data engineers waste hours just figuring out where data lives, what the schema is, who owns it, etc. We've tried building internal tooling but it's a constant game of catch-up.\n\n## What I've Been Looking At\n\nI spent the last month evaluating options. Here's what I found:\n\n### Option 1: Consolidate Everything into Unity Catalog\nWe're already using Databricks so this seemed obvious. The governance features are genuinely great. But:\n- It really wants you to move everything into the Databricks ecosystem\n- Our Kafka stuff doesn't integrate well\n- External catalog support feels bolted on\n- Teams with data in GCP pushed back hard on the vendor lock-in\n\n### Option 2: Try to Federate with Apache Polaris\nSnowflake's open source catalog looked promising. Good Iceberg support. But:\n- No real catalog federation (it's still one catalog, not a catalog of catalogs)\n- Doesn't handle non-tabular data (Kafka, message queues, etc.)\n- Still pretty new, limited community\n\n### Option 3: Build Something with Apache Gravitino\nThis one was new to me. It's an Apache project (just graduated to Top-Level Project in May) that does metadata federation. The concept is basically \"catalog of catalogs\" instead of trying to force everything into one system.\n\nWhat caught my attention:\n- Actually federates across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, JDBC sources without moving data\n- Handles both tabular and non-tabular data (they have this concept called \"filesets\")\n- Truly vendor-neutral (backed by Uber, Apple, Intel, Pinterest in the community)\n- We could query across our Hive metastore and Iceberg tables seamlessly\n- Has both REST APIs and Iceberg REST API support\n\nThe catch:\n- You have to self-host (or use Datastrato's managed version)\n- Newer project so some features are still maturing\n- Less polished UI compared to commercial options\n- Community is smaller than Databricks ecosystem\n\n## Real Test I Ran\n\nI set up a quick POC connecting our Hive metastore, one Iceberg catalog, and a test Kafka cluster. Within like 2 hours I had them all federated and could query across them. The metadata layer actually worked - we could see all our tables, topics, and schemas in one place.\n\nThen tried the same query that usually requires us to manually copy data between systems. With Gravitino's federation it just worked. Felt like magic tbh.\n\n## My Take\n\nFor us, I think Gravitino makes sense because:\n- We genuinely can't consolidate everything (different teams, different clouds, regulations)\n- We need to support heterogeneous systems (not just tables)\n- We're comfortable with open source (we already run a lot of Apache stuff)\n- Avoiding vendor lock-in is a real priority after our last platform migration disaster\n\nBut if you're already 100% Databricks or you have simpler needs, Unity Catalog is probably the easier path.\n\n## Question for the Group\n\nIs anyone else using catalog federation approaches? How are you handling metadata sprawl across different systems?\n\nAlso curious if anyone has tried Gravitino in production. The project looks solid but would love to hear real-world experiences beyond my small POC.",

I didn’t even know the DE role existed. It really catched my attention, and I started studying every single day. I’ll admit I made some mistakes (jumping straight into Airflow/AWS, even made a post about Airflow here, LOL), but I kept going because I genuinely enjoy learning about the field.\n\nTwo months ago I actually received two job opportunities. Both meetings went well: they asked about my projects, my skills, my approach to learning, etc. Both processes just vanished. I assume it’s because I have 0 experience. Still, I’ve been studying 4–6 hours a day since I started, and I’m fully committed to become a professional DE.\n\n# My current skill set:\n\n**Python:** PySpark, Polars, DuckDB, OOP  \n**SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL  \n**Databricks:** Delta Lake, Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, Jobs, Roles, Unity Catalog, Secrets, External Locations, Connections, Clusters  \n**BI:** Power BI, Looker  \n**Cloud:** AWS (IAM, S3, Glue) / a bit of DynamoDB and RDS  \n**Workflow Orchestration:** Airflow 3 (Astronomer certified)  \n**Containers:** Docker basics (Images, Containers, Compose, Dockerfile)  \n**Version Control:** Git & GitHub  \n**Storage / Formats:** Parquet, Delta, Iceberg  \n**Other:** Handling fairly large datasets (+100GB files), understanding when to use specific tools, etc  \n**English:** C1/C2 (EF SET certified)\n\n# Projects I’ve built so far:\n\n– An end-to-end ETL built **entirely in SQL** using DuckDB, loading into PostgreSQL.  \n– Another ETL pulling from multiple sources (MySQL, S3, CSV, Parquet), converting everything to Parquet, transforming it, and loading into PostgreSQL. Total volume was \\~4M rows. I also handled IAM for boto3 access.  \n– A small Spark → S3 pipeline (too simple to mention it though).\n\nI know these are beginner/intermediate projects, i’m planning more advanced ones for next year.\n\nNext year, I want to do things properly: structured learning, better projects, certifications, and ideally my first job, even if it’s low pay or long hours. I’m confident I can scale quickly once I get my first actual job.\n\n# My questions:\n\n– If you were in my position, what would you focus on next?  \n– Do you think I’m in the right direction?  \n– What kind of projects actually stand out in a junior DE portfolio?  \n– Do certifications actually matter for someone with zero experience? (Databricks, dbt, Airflow, etc.)\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks.",

The goal is to setup cost reports on AWS and GCP (and add yours from Cloudflare, Azure, etc.) and combine each of them and get a combined overview from all costs and be able to see where most cost comes from.\n\nThere's a YouTube video for more details and detailed explanation of how to set up the cost exports (unfortunately, they weren't straight-forward AWS exports to S3 and GCP to BigQuery). Luckily we dlt that integrates them well. I also added Stripe to get some income data too, so have an overall cost dashboard with costs and income to calculate margins and other important data. I hope this is useful, and I'm sure there's much more that can be added.\n\nAlso, huge thanks to pre-existing dashboard [aws-cur-wizard](https://github.com/Twing-Data/aws-cur-wizard) with very detailed reports. Everything is build on open-source and I included a `make demo` that gets you started immediately without cloud reports setup to see how it works.\n\nPS: I'm also planing to add a GitHub actions to ingest into ClickHouse Cloud, to have a cloud version as an option too, in case you want to run it in an enterprise. Happy to get feedback too, again. The dlt part is manually created so it works, the reports are heavily re-used from aws-cur-wizard, and the rest I used some Claude Code. ",

After a few years of iterations, I have pretty solid tech stack that's fully open-source, easy for students to setup, and mimics what you will do on the job.\n\nDev Environment:\n- Docker Compose - Containers and configs\n- VSCode Dev Containers - IDE in container\n- GitHub CodeSpaces - Browser cloud compute\n\nDatabases:\n- Postgres - Transactional Database\n- Minio - Data Lake\n- DuckDB - Analytical Database\n\nIngestion + Orchestration + Logs:\n- Python Scripts - Simplicity over a tool\n- Data Build Tool - SQL queries on DuckDB\n- Alembic - Python-based database migrations\n- Psycopg - Interact with postgres via Python\n\nCI/CD:\n- GitHub Actions - Simple for students\n \nData:\n- Data[.]gov - Public real-world datasets\n\nCoding Surface:\n- Jupyter Notebooks - Quick and iterative\n- VS Code - Update and implement scripts\n\nThis setup is extremely powerful as you have a full data platform that sets up in minutes, it's filled with real-world data, you can query it right away, and you can see the logs. Plus, since we are using GitHub codespaces, it's essentially free to run in the browser with just a couple clicks! If you don't want to use GitHub Codespces, you can run this locally via Docker Desktop.\n\nBonus for loacal: Since Cursor is based on VSCode, you can use the dev containers in there and then have AI help explain code or concepts (also super helpful for learning).\n\nOne thing I do want to highlight is that since this is meant for students and not production, security and user management controls are very lax (e.g. \"password\" for passwords db configs). I'm optimizing on student learning experience there, but it's probably a great starting point to learn how to implement those controls.\n\nAnything you would add? I've started a Kafka project, so I would love to build out streaming use cases as well. With the latest Kafka update, you no longer need Zookeeper, which keeps the docker compose file simpler!",

This helps with cases where you:\n\n* are data engineering in Rust within a highly connected, low latency ecosystem *(e.g., websocket feeds, Tokio etc.)*,\n* need typed arrays that remain Python/analytics ecosystem compatible\n* are working with real-time data use cases, and need minimal overhead Tabular data structures\n* are compiling lots, want < 2 second build times and basically value a solid data programming experience in Rust. \n\nTherefore, it is a great fit when you are DIY bare bones data engineering, and less so if you are relying on pre-existing tools *(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake).* For example, if you are data streaming in a more low-level manner.\n\n**Data Engineering examples:**\n\n* Stream data live off a Websocket and save it into \"**.arrow\"** or \"**.parquet**\" files.\n* Capture data in Minarrow, flip to Polars on the fly and calculate metrics in real-time, then push them in chunks to a Datastore as a live persistent service\n* Run parallelised statistical calculations on 1 billion rows without much compile-time overhead so Rust becomes workable\n\n**You also get:**\n\n* Strong IDE typing (in Rust)\n* One hit *\\`.to\\_arrow()*\\` and \\`.*to\\_polars()*\\` in Rust\n* Enums instead of dynamic dispatch *(a Rust flavour that's used in the official Arrow Rust crates)*\n* extensive SIMD-accelerated kernel functions available, including 60+ univariate distributions via the partner \\`SIMD-Kernels\\` crate (*fully reconciled to Scipy*). So, for many common cases you can stay in Rust for high performance compute.\n\nEssentially addressing a few areas that the main Arrow RS implementation makes different trade-offs. \n\n**Are you interested?**\n\nFor those who work in high performance data and software engineering and value this type of work, please feel free to ask any questions, even if you predominantly work in Python or another language*.* As, Arrow is one of those frameworks that backs a lot of that ecosystem but is not always well understood, due its back-end nature.\n\nI'm also happy to explain how you can move data across language boundaries *(e.g., Python <-> Rust)* using the Arrow format, or other tricks like this.\n\nHope you found this interesting.\n\nCheers,\n\nPete",

And the idea that it deploys everything, but it will be in invalid step untill you do some manual work really pushes me away. \n\nNext I added a video about git integration and python based deployments. That one is much more code oriented and even \"code-first\", which is great. Still, I was quite annoyed because of the parameter file. If only it could be split, or applied in stages...\n\nAnyway - those are 2 videos I mentioned:  \nFabric deployment pipelines - [https://youtu.be/1AdUcFtl830](https://youtu.be/1AdUcFtl830)  \nGit + Python - [https://youtu.be/dsEA4HG7TtI](https://youtu.be/dsEA4HG7TtI)\n\nHappy to answer any questions or even better get some suggestions for the next topics!  \nPurview?

The request is as below\n\n“We are planning to automate and integrate AI into our test laboratory operations, and we would greatly appreciate your assistance with this initiative. Currently, we spend a significant amount of time copying data into Excel, processing it, and performing analysis. This manual process is inefficient and affects our productivity. Therefore, as the first step, we want to establish a centralized database where all our historical and future testing data—currently stored year-wise in Google Sheets—can be consolidated. Once the database is created, we also require a reporting feature that allows us to generate different types of reports based on selected criteria. We believe your expertise will be valuable in helping us design and implement this solution.”\n\nWhen i called for more information i was told, that what they do now is store all their data in tables on Google sheets and extract the data from there when doing calculations (im assuming using python/google colab?)\n\nOkay so the way I understood is:\n\n1. Have to make database\n2. Have to make ETL Pipeline?\n3. Have to be able to do calculations/analysis and generate reports/dashboards??\n\nSo I have come up with combos as below\n\n1. PostgresSQL database + Power BI\n2. PostgresSQL + Python Dash application\n3. PostgresSQL + Custom React/Vue application\n4. PostgresSQL + Microsoft Fabric?? (I'm so confused as to what this is in the first place, I just learnt about it)\n\nI do not know why they are being so secretive with the actual requirements of this project, I have no idea where even to start. I'm pretty sure the \"reports\" they want is some calculations. Right now, I am just supposed to give them options and they will choose according to their extremely secretive requirements, even then i feel like im pulling things out of my ass, im so lost here please help by choosing which option you would choose for the requirements. \n\nAlso please feel free to give me any advice on how to actual make this thing and if you have any other suggestions please please comment, thank you!

For the past two months I've been working on a Python micro-ORM, which I just published and I wanted to share with you: [https://github.com/manoss96/onlymaps](https://github.com/manoss96/onlymaps)\n\nA micro-ORM is a term used for libraries that do not provide the full set of features a typical ORM does, such as an OOP-based API, lazy loading, database migrations, etc... Instead, it lets you interact with a database via raw SQL, while it handles mapping the SQL query results to in-memory objects.\n\nOnlymaps does just that by using Pydantic underneath. On top of that, it offers:\n\n\\- A minimal API for both sync and async query execution.\n\n\\- Support for all major relational databases.\n\n\\- Thread-safe connections and connection pools.\n\nThis project provides a simpler alternative to typical full-feature ORMs which seem to dominate the Python ORM landscape, such as SQLAlchemy and Django ORM.\n\nAny questions/suggestions are welcome!",

As im the sole data person i prioritize low maintenance over performance.  \ndisclaimer: Im def reaching my knowledge limits with this problem as i still got blind spots regarding networking, please excuse dumb questions or naive thoughts.  \n  \nI see two solution directions:  \na) somehow keeping everything inside the Airflow instance: installing a openvpn client during DAG runtime (working with docker operator or kubernetespodoperator)? --> idek if i got the necessary privileges on the managed instance to make this work  \nb) setting up a separate VM as a bridge in our cloud that has openvpn client+proxy and is being accessed via SSH from the airflow workers? On the VM i would whitelist the Airflow workers IP (which is static).\n\na) feels like im looking for trouble, but i cant pinpoint as im new to both these operators.  \nAm i missing a way easy solution?\n\nThe data itself i will probably want to fetch with a dlt pipeline pushing it to object storage and/or a postgres running both on the same cloud.\n\nCheers!",

And now with current firm for 7 months. My real learning happened while being in the second firm , up-skill on a lot of things, dealt with clients and what not, basically was in a consulting role. \n\nWith the current switch, it’s a big MnC in healthcare with better employee policies than the previous firms I had worked with. The problem here is the type of work I am doing is of no use, not even upto the level of the previous employer. Just writing SQL transformations on DBT as ELT is already dealt by FiveTran, low code - no code tool. \n\nThis is making my learning curve go down and I am really worried about my career as we see AI being involved in every domain and a downward learning curve at this moment in time is not acceptable for me. Even I do learn a few more tools say Databricks, pretty similar to synapse , implementations come up as a problem. \n\nNeed your guidance from those sitting at senior roles or have passed through similar situations in the past.

After many iterations, this exploration eventually matured into what I now call Internet Object (IO).\n\nKey characteristics that came out of the design process:\n\n* schema-first by design (data and metadata clearly separated)\n* row-like nested structures (reduce repeated keys and structural noise)\n* predictable layout that is easier to stream or parse incrementally\n* richer type system for better validation and downstream consumption\n* human-readable but still structured enough for automation\n* about 40-50 percent fewer tokens than the equivalent JSON\n* compatible with JSON concepts, so developers are not learning from scratch\n\nThe article below is the first part of a multi-part series. It is not a full specification, but a starting point showing how a JSON developer can begin thinking in IO: [https://blog.maniartech.com/from-json-to-internet-object-a-lean-schema-first-data-format-part-1-150488e2f274](https://blog.maniartech.com/from-json-to-internet-object-a-lean-schema-first-data-format-part-1-150488e2f274)\n\nThe playground includes a small 200-row ML-style training dataset and also allows interactive experimentation with the syntax: [https://play.internetobject.org/ml-training-data](https://play.internetobject.org/ml-training-data)\n\nMore background on how the idea evolved from 2017 onward: [https://internetobject.org/the-story/](https://internetobject.org/the-story/)\n\nWould be glad to hear thoughts from the data engineering community, especially around schema design, streaming behavior, and practical use-cases.",

Our client sends us data every couple of weeks, and sometimes they include new datasets that belong to older categories. All data lands in S3 first, and Dagster processes it from there.\n\nThe data follows a 3-tier hierarichal pattern. (note: the field names have been changed)\n\n* Each `EQP_Number` contains multiple `AP_Number`\n* Each `AP_Number` has 0 or more `Part_Number` for it (optional)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20m26hc0ow2g1.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f3aa452890a6e899815899ee9acf0129126f176&height=222\n\nExample file list:\n\n    EQP-12_AP-301_Part-1_foo_bar.csv\n    EQP-12_AP-301_Part-2_foo_bar.csv\n    EQP-12_AP-302_Part-1_foo_bar.csv\n    EQP-12_AP-302_Part-2_foo_bar.csv\n    EQP-12_AP-302_Part-3_foo_bar.csv\n    \n    EQP-13_AP-200_foo.csv\n    EQP-13_AP-201_foo.csv\n\nMy current idea is to use a 2-dimensional partition scheme with dynamic partitions for `EQP_Number` and `AP_Number`. But I’m concerned about running into Dagster’s recommended 100k asset limit. Alternatively, I could use a single dynamic partition on EQP_Number, but then I’m worried Dagster will try to reprocess older data (when mew data arrives) which could trigger expensive downstream updates (also one of the assets produces different outputs each run so this would affect downstream data as well).\n\nI’d also like to avoid tagging processed data in S3, since the client plans to move toward a database storage/ingestion flow in the future and we don’t yet know what that will look like.\n\nWhat partitioning approach would you recommend for this?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all! I work at Daft and wanted to share a technical blog post we recently published about improving **LLM batch inference throughput**. My goal here isn’t to advertise anything, just to explain what we learned in the process in case it’s useful to others working on large-scale inference.\n\n**Why we looked into this**\n\nBatch inference behaves differently from online serving. You mostly care about throughput and cost. We kept seeing GPUs sit idle even with plenty of work queued.\n\n**Two big bottlenecks we found**\n\n1. **Uneven sequence lengths** made GPUs wait for the longest prompt.\n2. **Repeated prefixes** (boilerplate, instructions) forced us to recompute the same first tokens for huge portions of the dataset.\n\n**What we built**\n\nWe combined:\n\n* **Continuous/streaming batching** (keep GPUs full instead of using fixed batches)\n* **Prefix-aware grouping and routing** (send prompts with similar prefixes to the same worker so they hit the same cache)\n\nWe call the combination **dynamic prefix bucketing**.\n\n**Results**\n\nOn a 128-GPU L4 cluster running Qwen3-8B, we saw roughly:\n\n* **≈50% faster throughput**\n* **Much higher prefix-cache hit rates (about 54%)**\n* Good scaling until model-load overhead became the bottleneck\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nw7knwg6lh2g1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=76257441bb38b0c7eaf4cbce12e9c5c769d75015\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sr9ovg6lh2g1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=689c014bdd9abebb6b7cf7ccda7cb22c849afde4\n\n**Why I’m sharing**\n\nBatch inference is becoming more common for data processing, enrichment, and ETL pipelines. If you have a lot of prompt prefix overlap, a prefix-aware approach can make a big difference. Happy to discuss approaches and trade-offs, or to hear how others tackle these bottlenecks.\n\n(For anyone interested, the full write-up is [here](https://www.daft.ai/blog/cutting-llm-batch-inference-time-in-half-dynamic-prefix-bucketing-at-scale))",

Before I take this further, I really want to validate whether the problem I’m focusing on is actually real for people and whether the approach makes sense.\n\nTo do that, I built a free “Data Maturity Assessment” to help companies understand how mature their data landscape is. It covers topics like data quality, access, governance, Excel dependency, silos, reporting speed, etc.\n\nI’m planning to create an English version later, but at this stage I’m mainly trying to get early feedback before investing more time.\n\nThis is **not** a sales tool at this stage. I’m genuinely trying to validate whether this solves real pain points.\n\nEdit:  \nForgot the link: [https://oliver-nfnfg7u6.scoreapp.com](https://oliver-nfnfg7u6.scoreapp.com)",

The second part was a technical screening with two backend developers. They showed various technical terms on the screen, one by one, and asked me to explain them: things like API, REST, microservices, encoding vs. encryption vs. hashing, some CLI commands, DOM, XML/JSON/YAML, and so on.\n\nThe thing is, I’ve been working with these concepts for over three years. I use them regularly, and I understand them in practice. But I really struggled to \\*explain\\* them clearly. I couldn’t put into words what I actually know how to do. It made me feel like I completely bombed what should have been simple questions.\n\nSince I’m self-taught, I’m wondering if this is just a gap in the theoretical knowledge you’d typically pick up in school. I already deal with imposter syndrome, but this interview made it feel a lot worse.\n\nI haven’t studied specifically for technical interviews before, but after this experience, I feel like I should.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar? Any advice for improving this kind of theoretical knowledge?",

On top of that, being new means I don't have the experience to be able to accurately tell whether something is hard or easy, which made things even more obviously dumb.\n\nAnd NOW I finally realize that, all I had to do was first cover the base case scenarios (like learning how to build a basic page that navigates around other pages) and then come up with something that I want to build, and start stumbling around 99% of the time trying to figure out how to build it. Obviously that would mean spending more time googling, reading articles, stackoverflow etc. than actually writing code. Duh! It's the first time I do most of the things required.\n\nSo you think at this point \"okay bro, now you know how people learn by building projects and connecting the dots to make functional software, congrats\".

I used InterviewCoder for some of those sessions because it gives structure instead of chaos. It forced me to slow down, think out loud, and understand my approach instead of just clicking through problems. Weirdly enough, I improved faster with less stress. I feel like half of interview prep is just learning to be calm and organized, not solving a million questions. Wish I realized that sooner",

It uses C#, Blazor (particularly SyncFusion), and HTML. I alone have built over 40 page templates (in the last 2 years) for this site at this point, and I don't work with anyone because only one other person codes, and it's my boss, who I am senior to with this kind of programming. Truthfully, I hate it. I hate web development, and I hate doing this day in and day out. I was just sort of forced into it, and now it's destroyed my passion for the field. I could go on about why I hate my current job, but I'll move on.\n\nIf the job market weren't demotivating enough, I'm so exhausted from work that I don't want to sit at my own computer at home, which makes learning so difficult. I remember during my first Python class, I was fascinated by a simple function that told you the total length of all sides of a shape based on the shape and length of one side. I tinkered with that and other code so much and never got tired of it. Now I'm sick of the thought of code, and that makes me sad because my dream is still to get into the gaming industry. The idea of not getting in makes me want to cry.\n\nI want to reignite that love I had for coding. I want to get back into it and find that love for tinkering and understanding how things work (I'm actually very good at learning through reverse engineering. It's how I learned everything I know about web development.) Is there a game or something that teaches code, particularly C++, in a way that is different and fun? I've been trying to work through an Udemy class that is actually taught very well, but I keep running into that block because it's just mostly watching someone code, taking notes, and then doing a couple of exercises throughout the chapter. It's just another class.\n\nAnd please, don't tell me about how difficult things are out there. I already know, and I need to be motivated, not have what little of a spark that's left put out.",

At first, I didn't know where to start, so I started from this mega course on YouTube by SuperSimpleDev. It's 22 hours long and so far I've made it to 6+ hours. But, now I'm getting second thoughts when I see people saying that OdinProject is best for getting a head start.\n\nSo, now I'm confused ... Should I finish this course, or do I ditch it and hop on OdinProject to start all over again? Any insight from experienced programmers would be helpful, thanks.",

Reviews of the Acer haven’t been very encouraging.\n\nFor context, I’m planning to study Computer Science for the next five years. And just use it daily for developing etc, One thing that consistently annoys me about Windows laptops is the fan noise under load and the frequent Windows updates. another issue that i have read is the Snapdragon may have software compatibility quirks.\n\nThe MacBook M4 (16 GB RAM, 256 GB storage) is currently discounted to €1,148 in the EU. Should I go with the budget-friendly Acer or invest in the MacBook for the long term?\n\nextra information, i already own a high-end gaming Windows PC, but i dont even play that much, and not planning on using either laptops for gaming anyways.",

        "content": "I have an idea for a project I want to program, but before I get started I need to know how effective modern captchas are at actually at detecting and stopping bots. If bots can easily pass as humans through all detection methods then my project is a non-starter. I know bots can do things like, be given spending money and then find a person to solve the captcha for them, but I'm just looking at what bots can do by themselves without any outside help.\n\nI'm finding some results through research, but none of it is what I would consider conclusive or scientific. Mostly I'm just finding people maybe making up stories, sharing anecdotes, that kinda thing. I'm not seeing a lot of demonstrations of bots beating captchas but then again if they were doing this I doubt I would see somebody uploading themselves doing it on youtube.\n\nI have some vague knowledge of how captchas work, and that a big part of why they work at all is because, at least in Google's case, they read a bunch of metadata such as speed, how you move your mouse, etc. But I'm very lacking in specifics and I'm open to learn more about them.\n\nFrom some demonstrations I've seen, it looks like if you show a captcha image test to an AI, it will correctly find the squares with the specific object. But then if the AI or an automated program tried to input those results, it would fail due to not passing the metadata stuff? Is that a correct assumption or can AI bypass these checks now? Wouldn't it be pretty trivial to beat this by just making a robot physically tap a phone screen?\n\nI'm not asking if captchas are 100% effective, because I know that's not possible. But even if they're 90% effective, for my purposes that would be good enough. Besides that I'm also open to implementing more ways to verify if someone is a bot, but I'm looking for methods that are quick and practical like how captchas are. Maybe making the user solve multiple captchas instead of just one?",

It was a Full Stack project:\n\n.Net C# Backend\n\nREACT frontend\n\nMVP Design Pattern\n\nSQL Server Express\n\nORM (Microsoft Entity Framework Library) for interacting with the database\n\nThis burnt me out. Due to also working at a company that did not believe in work-life balance, I ended up rushing this project and the dissertation. Granted although not every feature was working perfectly, it did work. And yeah... I passed the module (and burnt out after a final month of finishing work at 5pm and coding or writing dissertation till 2am every day).\n\nInitially my tutor was very against me using this technology stack. As none of it was covered by the Open University. As well as pulling this off I was teaching myself C# from scratch, REACT from scratch and ORM from scratch (I shamefully admit, I had to ask chatGPT a few questions regarding that).\n\nAnyway, fast forward a year or so, and I am finally building a portfolio, as being in a more inf orientated job really does not suit me.\n\nSo this week I started learning Flask. I actually have tried the very tutorials I have now completed previously and to be honest it confused the hell out of me. However... after my ordeal with C# and .Net, damn this just seems easy and straight forward. I would even say I am enjoying it.\n\nAnyway this weekend, I will be refactoring my Tic Tac Toe project to Flask and touching up the Vanilla HTML/CSS frontend I have already made (albeit zero functionality). And yeah.... I am going to need to start taking GitHub more seriously (ie a Readme file).\n\nI know this adds no value to any thing and is not even a question. But I was dreading Flask based on my experience with C# and .Net. Someone even told me recently that I should not have done what I did for my Dissertation Project and it was wayy to ambitious, but whatever.... I passed.",

I learned C# in university and even build some programs for myself but with the worker services I sit there and unless I follow a step-by-step tutorial my mind just goes blanc and it feels like I never heard of C# and .Net  :(\n\nDoes someone has reccommendations for learning sources regarding that topic? I found some websites that talk about worker services in general but when it comes to programming what it's supposed to do they are all just like \"and now you program whatever you want it to do - good luck!\" and thats the part i suprisingly struggle with the most.\n\nI hope someone has any ideas where my knowledge gap seems to be and some resources that help me to fix it. :)",

So I really have no knowledge of anything else. \n\nIf anyone has a recommendation on how and where I can learn and build a foundation in coding in general I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\nI dont know if this post breaks the rules, but I just thought to ask this because this subreddit is named \"learnprogramming.\" Sorry if this goes against the rules. \n",

        "content": "Hi - I am a 2nd year CS student who only recently switched into CS from pure math. I realized how behind I am compared to my peers since I have only completed school courses, which are very theoretical and more so like \"fill in the blanks\" type of projects (at least up until now). I can write pages of math proofs for sorting algorithms but I can't code for the sake of my life.\n\nBecause of this, I accepted a job offer as a data analyst for 8 months. It isn't what I want to pursue since I want to pivot more into the SWE side of tech, but I'm taking it just so I have some time off from school to self-learn programming and build some projects before I get back into school (and also to network since it's a very, very large company.) I feel like I can't contribute much to my course projects. Also, my college is very well known for CS/ AI and I feel like I'm not utilizing my opportunities enough due to how useless I am.\n\nWith that said, with my co-op coming up soon, I need some advice on where I can get started and the best way to go about this most efficiently. I know python and java in terms of syntax, I know all the structures like loops and stuff, but I haven't coded any projects before. I know R and SQL as well but that is useless.\n\nI think I can commit about 3-4 hours per day on average for the next 8 months (I will still be taking a calculus proof course + a data structure class on top of full time work, for the sake of 3rd year courses prequisites).\n\nAny advice will be helpful! I am a bit stupid but I am willing to put in the work to catch up to everyone. It definitely is overwhelming starting from zero haha, there's so many resources, so many terminologies, so many languages out there... I'm hoping I would find the most efficient way so I won't be wasting my time. Hopefully I'll be able to build some complex project by month 5. Thank you :)",

If let's say there is a background job that periodically reruns the function, the API will be re-notified.

I feel like I was exposed to some mathematical programming in Matlab and a lot of proofs.\n\nMy bachelors was in computer science, but for electives I took quantum/math(stuff like number theory), and I was mediocre at it--so I didn't have exposure to any SWE electives/ lack of time investing in programming.\n\nI spent a lot of time looking at hard things without having a foundation nor specialization, and I struggle to be practical in getting things done, how to break down projects, how to learn things.\n\nI am trying to be consistent with Python projects for data science roles, but I think I choose things too big in scope and I end up really lost on how to build out a project on my own. For example, I am trying to build a Python CLI that uses models I downloaded for inference. I have written out the processing logic for predictions on paper, but I get lost in managing multiple python files, how to organize my functions, how to choose the structure of my data, how to handle the logic for the inference pipeline.

I am good at concepts, but not writing the code.** \n\nI am trying to go for \"data science\" roles, but I only sometimes worked in Jupyter notebooks using sci-kit learn models or implemented the math for some algorithm in a singular python file. \n\nI am a little lost on whats the best way to get better programming for data science.

What could possibly be the reason behind this? g++ version on Ubuntu and WSL is the same, so is the block size.\n\nI've handed in my code already so what's done is done on that front.

For that, I need to design a collection system that reliably gathers publicly available thread metadata from Reddit (titles, timestamps, comment counts, etc.) without breaking any API rules or putting load on the infrastructure.\n\nI’ve tried two approaches so far. First, the official Reddit API, but my application wasn’t approved. Second, I tried using a scraping service, but that returned consistent HTTP 403 errors, which I assume are anti-bot protections.\n\nBefore I build the full system, I want to choose the right engineering approach. My constraints are long-term stability, strict rate limiting, predictable failure behavior, and minimal load on external services. Nothing related to bypassing anything; I just want a clean and reliable pipeline.\n\nThe options I'm evaluating are: building a pipeline around the .json endpoints with strict rate limiting and retry logic, using something like Apify to handle scheduling and backoff, or creating a hybrid setup that treats external data sources as unreliable and focuses on resilient architecture, caching, and backpressure.\n\nFrom an engineering point of view, which approach tends to produce the most maintainable and fault-tolerant system for long-term public-data collection?\n\nI’m not trying to gather private info or circumvent restrictions. This is strictly a systems-design question about building a predictable, well-behaved pipeline. Any advice from engineers who have built similar systems would help a lot.",

Bit 2 of pixel 0 is in the 2nd word's most significant bit and so on.  Pixel 1 is the OR of all the 2nd most significant bits of the 4 word set, kapish? The next 16 bits across are held in the next 4 word set in ram.\n\nWhy didn't they simply place adjacent nibbles in memory to represent the pixel's palette index? Perhaps the decision was based on how the hardware draws the additional resolution modes where the number of words for the 4 color medium resolution mode is reduced to 2 and the highest resolution, monochrome is just one word.  Interesting, they might have been able to support an 8 bit palette color index with 8 words allowing for a blocky 256 colors @ 160 x 100 resolution. \n\nSo anyway I was happily coding along doing BSET.W D5,(A0)+  to set a specific bit in word 0 thinking I could automatically work word 1 next then move on to word 2 and so on and was puzzled when the compiler said, no my friend, that is not allowed!\n\nWhat?  What's not allowed? I pulled up the BSET specs and sure enough, BSET only supports an opcode extension of byte or long.  Drat!  So now I have to do an ADDQ #2,A0 after each word manipulation.\n\nI'm still in awe of the 68000 instruction set though, what a thing of beauty.... \n\nInteresting story post complete\n\nSimulate document.getElementById(\"submit-post-button\") click event NOW",

They're either just not at their desk (taking like their 6th walk of the day, grabbing a snack, coffee, etc), or chatting with the people around them, or doing something else on their computer. It's just a huge waste of time, why don't we just work for 4-6 hours then leave? I would think that other software engineers would understand that's it's literally just not possible to code/work efficiently for 8+ hours, but no. \n\nI get 85% of my work done between 9am - 1pm, im sure the majority of these people are like that. I just cant for the life of me understand why they don't just leave? Like you're not doing anything anyways? What if I just start leaving at 3-4pm everyday? Would it be a bad look? \n\nI guarantee I can work 4 hours, and get just as much (if not more) work done than these people working until fucking 530PM\n\nI was thinking of talking to my manager about this, but not sure. He's not technically a 'manager' his title is lead dev, he's super chill and a young guy (mid 20s I believe ).

        "author": "Effective_Clue_1099",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Background: Mid 2022 bootcamp grad. Got a job as a mostly frontend developer for 65k. Was there for \\~1.5 years, after our big project, they laid off about 1/4 of the company.\n\nJust had an 8 round interview process, I thought there wasn't a chance. Got the call, they said it was an easy decision for them and I signed the offer for 115k today. I'm over the moon.\n\n\n\nSo what worked / didn't work\n\nApplying:\n\nHad 3 referrals, none turned into interviews. I think the value of referrals have gone down dramatically in the last couple of years and that a lot of companies stopped giving referral bonuses\n\nI didn't get a single entry / jr level interview. I think the no cs degree hurt for those roles, so many say 1-2 YoE so I thought I was a shoo-in, nah\n\nMy success rate fell sharply after 6 months unemployment. Success rate improved dramatically (only for mobile positions) after publishing a personal project (this was about a year into unemployment, I had a single interview in months 6-12 and it didn't go past hiring manager)\n\nNo interviews from linkedIn job apps, despite targeting same day postings\n\ngot 2 interviews from hiringcafe and an ai auto fill extension (simplify)\n\nI went in-person and dropped off a resume to two local companies that I saw had openings. One gave me an interview (50% success rate, you were right Grandpa)\n\nThe mobile position I got, came from linkedIn. I stumbled across the tech lead of a local company posting about the opening, there was no linkedIn job posting. I messaged him about my app and he said he tried it out, liked it and wanted to interview me.\n\nI think the other 2 or 3 came from hackernews, again, where I was talking directly to somebody technical about my app.\n\nI tried linkedin premium and messaged a ton of hiring managers / recruiters, nothing came from those\n\nI had 6 or 7 interviews in the last year and a half, all above my last role. Was definitely unprepared for the first few, feel I went from jr. to mid level while unemployed.\n\nBut yeah, highest success rate was finding local companies and contacting somebody who was technical (and part of the hiring process) about what I was working on\n\n  \nTechnical Interviews:  \nI was grinding leetcode for a bit but found it not to be worth while (past getting comfortable with mapping and array, obj, string manipulation). I did have some coding challenges but they weren't leetcode mediums or hards, either can you fetch data, format / display / style it or a leetcode easy to see if you can code (though I didn't interview at major companies).\n\n I did have two system designs interviews earlier on that I wasn't prepared for. And one later on that I knew was coming and spent a week cramming for. Did really well in that and moved to final round but didn't get job. My recent interview didn't have a strictly system design round but a lot of topics I had studied did come up in conversation and I'm glad I was able to talk on them\n\nAnother thing that was a huge help was I was MUCH less stressed about the recent interview. I thought I wasn't going to get it, was working as a bartender so had money coming in, might as well see where it goes and try to learn something. Most of the interviews I had when I was deep into unemployment, I would get 2-4 hours of sleep the night before because I was so stressed. Somehow, the night before this company's technical, I had planned on doing leetcode all night but I was strangely tired, thought I wasn't going to get the job anyways and didn't want to waste my night off doing coding problems. I ended up conking out hard way earlier than I typically go to bed and had the best nights rest I've had in two years. I truly don't know how it aligned that way but being well rested was way more valuable than a couple more leetcode problems\n\nBehavioral interviews:\n\nThe 3 companies I interviewed with - post releasing my app - were much more interested in my app than my previous role. They were all for mobile positions.\n\nI also started keeping an interview prep journal that had 6 star stories (and what questions they could be used in) as well as all other questions I've been asked in interviews (and had a separate tab for system design notes)\n\nI would often get a \"how's your week going\" question at the start of interviews. Early into unemployment, I thought, 'I don't want to waste their time', and just say something like, 'It's been a good week, have been looking forward to this interview.' and let them jump into it from there. After it happened a few times I realize they want to see if they can have an actual, casual conversation with you. So in these last few interviews, I always made a point to spend literally a minute, 2 max, chatting. Just something like an event that weekend I was excited for. The recent interview the guy had mentioned having a kid, the next interview I asked what his kid was dressing as for Halloween\n\nThe other thing that was a big help was the CEO really liked me. I really didn't understand the company's industry, so I spent a couple of hours with ai learning about it, making sure I knew some basic terminology, read articles about the company, and had actual, non fluff questions, about the company and the industry for the CEO. In the middle he mentioned being surprised by the questions\n\n\n\n65k -> \\~27/hour -> 115k   \nAgain, absolutely over the moon. Very excited, will be working hard to make sure I continue to grow and never go through such a grueling unemployment period\n\nTl;dr  \nTry talking to technical people directly. Look local. Have some system design knowledge. Build something with users. Be well rested and sociable. Be able to talk about the company, past being a developer. Good luck to those searching and be easy on yourself, it's hard out there.",

We also surprisingly don’t do layoffs, we’ve never had layoffs even when oil hit negative during covid.\n\n\n\nI currently have 4 years of experience in software and before that I was an electrical engineer with 4 years of experience.

The tech stack on the backend is mostly Python with a little bit of .NET, I’ll be dabbling in GO soon as well for our realtime data calculations from RMQ.

We use an in-house office software with a built-in chat and email, but 99% of the time we just use the chat or talk face-to-face.\n\nHowever, the office software sucks. If you don't use it for an hour, it disconnects without any notification. While you're disconnected, chat messages get sent to email, and don't display in chat when you log back on. The home page displays new email notifications, but only some of them, not all of them. I thought it only filtered automated messages, but I was VERY wrong.\n\nThis week my boss was on a business trip. He was still working in my timezone though so we could talk. I was waiting for some details in the chat, but either I was logged off or he just emailed it directly. Either way, no notification.\n\nThe day after he sent it, I had a day off I scheduled in advance. While I was out, he forgot I had off and sent me an email. Same thing, no notification.\n\nTwo days later, I got a message from him. While he'd remembered I had a day off, he was still extremely pissed that I hadn't seen his emails. He said it was the bare minimum act of communication\n\nAdmittedly, it feels like he'd be right at most other companies, but we'd always used other means of communication. Before he left, he even gave me his phone number saying it's how I should contact him if he wasn't online to recieve chat messages, completely overlooking the email.\n\nRegardless, my contract is supposed to be renewed soon, and now I'm worried it won't be. I'm not sure what to do to hopefully avoid being shitcanned.\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Just in case this would be useful to anyone as a datapoint...\n\n**About me:**\n- US Citizen\n- Graduated in 2022 from an average state school you may or may not have heard of \n- 3 YOE at the time of job hunting, all at one SaaS company in SF (+ 2 internships) \n- Full time experience was all backend development, and I did lead a larger project at my last company so I used that as a talking point in interviews \n- Located in San Francisco, looked to the entire Bay Area for my search. Wasn't open to relocation outside the Bay but that didn't seem to matter thanks to the AI boom... \n\n**Gearing up:**\nTotal time from interview prep to first offer: 3 months (beginning of May 2025 to end of July 2025)\nResources used: Paid for neetcode and the design gurus grokking system design course, and studied them meticulously. Already had LC premium and used that for specific companies. Didn't really do mock interviews because I was an interviewer myself at my last company and already had a ton of practice being on the other side of the table. \n\n**Applications & Interviews:**\nNOTE: All numbers are approximate and may be off by 5 or less, especially for interview counts. I didn't meticulously track everything. \n\nNumber of applications: ~250 sent by me. However, I also got reached out to a lot and pretty much all of my interviews came from recruiters coming to me first, so I can't create a reliable Sankey diagram! I only used 2 referrals from my network and got ghosted by those companies anyway. \n\nMostly targeted full stack roles at mid-late stage startups (Series C+), with the occasional big tech interview if they reached out to me first. \n\nHad 35 recruiter screens -> 32 first round interviews -> 14 second round+ interviews. Many of the first rounds were during my first few weeks studying, I used them to get my feet wet and didn't stress too hard over rejections. \n\n14 second+ turned into 2 offers, 5 rejections, and I canceled 5 final rounds & 2 first rounds myself after signing. \n\nI had ~100 individual interview blocks total, according to my calendar. (not 100 companies, 100 interviews). \n\n**The offer I took:**\n- Series D unicorn healthcare startup, fully remote in SF Bay Area (with the option to go into the office whenever I want, or not.) Big upgrade over my previous hybrid job!! \n- Mid level / level below senior \n- $195,000 base salary ($20k raise over previous job), and some ISOs that I don't consider real money. \n- Full pivot into full stack from my previous 100% backend role\n\n(The other offer was $200,000, upleveled from junior to midlevel and hybrid in SF, but it was SaaS and I was tired of SaaS, plus they told me some stuff about the future direction of the company that I didn't quite like.)\n\n**Insights & Tips**\n1. I got asked a lot less Leetcode and a lot more \"practical\" coding, like writing API endpoints, parsing JSONs, and even writing basic websites from end to end.\n2. Around 3-4 interviewers encouraged AI use during the coding interviews. \n3. LinkedIn pushes recently updated profiles to the top of recruiter searches, so every Sunday I would log in and make some minor change to my profile like adding a period, changing a word, etc. Then I would wake up on Monday with a full inbox. \n4. I went back and replied to all the recruiters and startup founders that had emailed me in the past 6 months. Some were still hiring, others weren't. One very kind startup CEO still chatted with me for 30 minutes and offered to pass my resume on to his founder friends, nothing came of it but he gave me good advice anyway. \n5. I interviewed on top of my day job by doing interviews 8-10 am, working 10-5, and then interviewing again 5-6. I didn't take a single \"sick day\" which I'm super proud of lol. Companies with an East coast presence were open to interviewing me as early as 7 am.\n6. As for how I pivoted to full stack with little to no frontend experience, YOLO I guess? The project I led had a small amount of frontend, and when I had fullstack interviews I did React crash courses and followed along. I got to the point where I knew what to look up for frontend, because most interviewers let you Google stuff on the spot if you look like you know what you're talking about, and just need to double check something etc. ",

Then right when you feel like you have a chance, poof, ghosted.

I can put a ton of effort into troubleshooting some failure and fix it, just to get grilled in a meeting on the one little detail that I missed. I can work hard on a project just to get asked by my manager why it isn't done yet.\n\nSpeaking of my manager, he is an anxious basket case who will randomly walk up during the day and ask me to drop everything that I'm doing to work on something \"urgent\". After finishing the \"urgent\" task, he'll ask me about the work that got postponed and why it's behind schedule. To make it even worse, he'll do it in the most condescending way, asking if I \"need help\", or trying to reassign my work to others. No, I don't need help. I need you to leave me alone so that I can do my work that I was already planning to do.\n\nAs for the work itself? Very rarely do I get to build or design something interesting. The majority of the time, I'm digging through the shitheap trying to figure out what this service with 20k lines of code and no comments does. Or reading through internal documents that were written by someone with a 3rd grade vocabulary and not updated for the past decade.\n\nVery rarely do I heard any kind of positive feedback. Most often it is criticism. You could've done this faster. If I do it faster, it could've been cleaner. This despite the fact that our codebase is filled with garbage code that I had to dig through to get what we have today.\n\nI also don't really feel like I'm learning valuable skills.

I currently have \\~4 YOE and am a US citizen (I know this helps when evaluating risk)\n\n1. **Work** \\- Both companies have what I think are interesting work. I put embedded-specific details here for those are interested, but they both feel equally cool - [Embedded Software vs Board Support Package : r/embedded](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1p44co2/embedded_software_vs_board_support_package/). Meta would be more high-level / specific product work while Qualcomm is a more general role where the work will touch many of their products across their portfolio. This makes me wonder if working on a niche application like AR glasses would be better/worse for long-term career development\n2. **Location** \\- Meta would have to be in Sunnyvale while Qualcomm is in San Diego. I currently live in SoCal so I would have a preference to stay here, but I can't deny that there seem to be more opportunities in NorCal. Nonetheless taking Meta would require moving / establishing things in a new location\n3. **Culture** \\- I've been hearing bad things about Meta / Reality Labs, but I'm not sure how true they are since I've been relying on anecdotes from Blind (which is admittedly a negative community). I'm sure Qualcomm has its own pitfalls (e.g. offshoring), but I haven't heard of anything to the severity of Meta's current reputation with stacked ranking and PIPs\n4. **Compensation** \\- Both roles are pretty accurate to their grades on levels.fyi. Qualcomm would be a senior engineer role in San Diego while Meta would be E4 role in Sunnyvale\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I know having the brand name of Meta on a resume does wonders for a career, but I want to make sure I have as complete of a picture as I can.\n\nEdit: since there was some interest in the comments:\n\n* Meta (Sunnyvale) - 193k + 100k RSU/year + 35k sign on\n* Qualcomm (San Diego) - 147k + 43k RSU/year + 35k sign on",

The flip side is the usual big-tech stress: reorganizations, shifting priorities, constant pace, and the general feeling of volatility.\n\nI’m considering an offer for a “Principal”-level role in local government IT. The job is stable, unionized, slower paced, and has a predictable schedule. The work looks more enterprise/ERP-focused and nowhere near as chaotic as big tech.\n\nMy concerns are:\n\nWhether I’m actually ready for a Principal role: I’ve operated at a mid-to-senior IC level, but I haven’t formally held a Principal title before. I’m worried about stepping into Principal-level expectations in a new domain and whether I’ll be able to perform at the level the role requires.\n\nGetting pigeonholed: Government IT tends to have slower-moving tech and more specialized enterprise systems. I’m concerned that if I spend years there, my skills might narrow and limit future private-sector options.\n\nLong-term compensation ceiling: Government positions have fixed salary steps and a hard cap. Once you hit the top step, raises are basically cost-of-living adjustments. In private tech, there’s still room for higher comp and growth.\n\nI’m trying to balance a more stable and predictable lifestyle with the risks of taking on a bigger role, potentially narrowing my skillset, and reducing long-term earning potential.\n\nIf anyone has moved between private tech and government IT, especially mid-career or at a senior level, I’d really appreciate hearing how it affected your career, confidence, and quality of life.",

        "author": "NigoDuppy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I’m trying to figure out when a salary increase actually justifies giving up a very comfortable setup. I officially have a 5-day/week job, but because my manager and I work remotely and are in different countries with different weekends, I’ve effectively been working 4 days a week for the last 1.5 years with a 3-day weekend. The work is simple, mostly Power BI dashboards and Power Automate flows for upper management, with nothing deeply technical or challenging. The problem is that the job is *too* comfortable. I’m not learning much, and I worry that future cost-cutting (I work in corporate) or AI could replace me since the work is so basic.\n\nBecause I essentially work 4 days (32 hrs/week), my hourly rate is higher than it would be in a typical 5-day (40 hrs/week) job. For example, if I took a job with a 50% salary increase for a 5-day schedule, it would end up being only about a 20% increase in hourly pay after adjusting for the extra day and hours I would work. \n\nSo I’m stuck asking myself if a 20–25% hourly increase really worth giving up a 4-day WFH lifestyle?\n\nI’m a CS graduate, but I ended up in this role because the job posting was labeled as Software Engineer. It turns out the only real engineering work was rewriting a legacy system using the Power Platform. After that, it turned into pure dashboards and Power Automate flows on the business side because my manager believed upper management liked fancy, colorful reports that were tangible and made their lives easier.\n\nBefore this job, I was studying AWS, Terraform Linux, and getting into Kubernetes, but I haven’t touched any of that in a year, and I feel like I’m falling behind. If I stay in comfort, I risk stagnating, but at the same time I don’t really know where I can go from here, or what percentage increase in salary or hourly rate is worth leaving this job. \n\nAlso, my company is a large corporate, and one of my goals is to work abroad. I checked their internal positions offering relocation, and almost all of them are either pure engineering or management roles. I don’t think it’s realistic for me to apply to any of these in my current position unless I sharpen my engineering skills, as management is still a pipe dream given that I’m still junior with only about 2 years of total experience.\n\n\nSo essentially my questions boil down to:\n\n1. What kind of pay increase would make you give up a 4-day WFH job? Is 20% hourly increase enough? That’s already roughly a 50% increase in total salary.\n\n2. Should I pivot to a technical path like cloud infra/DevOps, which I plan to study over the next 6 months, or is there a well-paid path using my current skills? Would transitioning to data engineering instead be a better? Is it realistic in that timeframe?",

        "content": "Context: I am a software engineer working at a company that was recently acquired. Currently make 135k. My current company is being merged into a larger parent company and there were some recent layoffs. Management has signaled these will not be the last, and there will be more next year after a 'discovery' phase where they figure out what can be integrated into the parent company's existing software and what cant. Sometime after that (undisclosed time), there will be an RTO to a different city (I am currently WFH). We are currently mostly working on documentation + support work instead of new features. This has resulted in me going on a job hunt.\n\nI have three options:\n\nOffer 1: 165k base salary, 15 days of PTO (WFH). Working on a recently started project modernizing a legacy system (like, lots of logic in stored procedures style legacy) to python / AWS, immediate team and manager seem really nice. \\~20 engineers total in the tech department.\n\nOffer 1 Cons: Company has been owned by private equity for the past 7 years, has  2.7 stars on Glassdoor, mentioning lack of raises, leadership shifting priorities, and layoffs / reorgs, position was a backfill.\n\nOffer 2: 145k base salary, 30k equity in company, unlimited PTO (Mostly WFH, in office \\~2 times per month). Management seems fun (like, trips to Cancun type stuff), really interesting and exciting IoT style work with golang. Company was a Series A startup a few years ago, but is rapidly growing now with lots of customers and doesn't need funding anymore.\n\nOffer 2 Cons: It would just be me and 1 other engineer who is on a contract (my position would be full time) and may or may not convert to full time. The tech side of the company just started and is still a very 'early startup' environment, so I would have to juggle Project Manager + Software Engineer responsibilities. Could be fun, could also be super stressful, especially if the other engineer who seems like would be 'firewall' for the rest of the business leaves after his contract was up.\n\nOption 3. Take neither offer and stay at my current company and keep looking and hope i dont get laid off before i find something better. I have been getting a consistent amount of interviews each month. Seems like the laid off employees at my current company got 2 months severance at least...\n\nWhat are y'all's thoughts?",

        "content": "I'm a senior software engineer at a FAANG-adjacent company, \\~8 YoE having come from a mid-size startup and then a FAANG company for several years. Been at this company about a year - first manager was amazing, probably the best manager I ever had and most of the team agrees. He left a few months in to me joining and a manager from a sister team took over. At first it was thought to be temporary but now it seems there's no plans to backfill. \n\n  \nBasically from the get-go she decided she didn't like me. About 2 weeks into her tenure a change I launched had to be rolled back and from that moment on she's decided I was no good. She was on PTO and then out of town for over a month and basically had no 1-1s with me or most of the team during that period and didn't show up to meetings, but then threatened to hit me with a Below Meets rating for very unclear reasons. I worked my butt off to try to reverse this and just get a Meets, but even since then it's been confusing and nightmarish. \n\nEvery 1-1 with her has been filled with \"feedback\" and it's gotten to the point where now I'm getting anxiety attacks just at the thought of meeting with her. She never asks me what I'm doing or how I am, just launches straight into feedback on how what I'm doing is wrong or how I'm messing up. It's never technical feedback of course, it's always vague, behavioral feedback. The thing is, I'm a pretty engaged member of the team, I speak out quite a bit and I'm opinionated and try to be helpful, but I can never be clear what she actually wants. The kicker is her feedback is contradictory - a few months ago it was \"be on slack more\" and then recently it was \"you're on slack too much\". Things like that. \n\n  \nOne time she finally asked me what I was doing. Her feedback was that she had no idea and that I should be better about surfacing my updates - put the updates in JIRA, write them in the standup updates, surface them in our weekly meeting, as that's what she looks at. I then shared my screen and then showed her: I had put my updates in my JIRA tickets for the week, I had written full and clear standup updates, and I had shared my latest project in our weekly meeting when she was out. She then goes \"Oh okay thanks\". \n\n  \nShe rules on infighting and fear - asking people for feedback on each other, always making it feel like she's trying to build cases against people, etc. \n\n  \nI know I could be biased so I thought it was just me. However, a few months into this, I talked with other people on my team and learned she was the EXACT same way with them, albeit arguably a bit harsher with me. I then heard stories about how her last team at the company entirely disbanded cause of her and that she had gone through the same thing of threatening to downrate someone immediately after becoming their manager with another girl. \n\n  \nThe final straw came recently when the most senior guy on my team recently got fired by her. I was working very closely with him - he was well-respected, been at the company for over 10 years, etc. But after he got fired I found out from him that what he went through was the same as me but worse - she gave him a below meets after 1 meeting with her, kept giving him constant, nitpicky, negative feedback for months with no clear expectations or guidance to improve, and then had HR show up to a meeting with him and threatened PIP or quit. \n\n  \nI could give more specific examples but you get the picture. \n\nI guess first of all I just wanted to vent. Second, I wanted to know - is there any chance this could still just be me exaggerating this in my head, or is this on her at this point? Like, I'm not slacking at work, I produce work constantly, I even worked until 10pm last Friday night just out of fear. Is this normal? What is one supposed to do in this case? Is this just the state of the industry right now? \n\nUltimately I've decided to try to look internally for new roles and also start interviewing externally, but I know that's going to take several months and I'm really stressed at the thought of having to deal with this and study for and do interviews. Like, just the thought of having to interact with her alone gives me stress and anxiety (I've never felt like this at a job before) and I don't know how to make it through. On top of that, I have kind of a side hustle I wanna dive into, it doesn't make much money right now but I haven't been able to give it my all the last few months cause of this situation, and I'm wondering if I should just go into that now or put that more on hold while I look for a new job. \n\n  \nThanks for listening.

        "content": "I'm Canadian. I have a BSc in Psychology. This is my first time posting in a CS subreddit so please let me know if this is not the right place for this question.\n\nI've been thinking of switching into CS and finally decided to apply to schools with lots of Co-op opportunities. So far I've applied to bachelor's in UToronto (waiting), Waterloo (i may not meet eligibility requirements as a graduate), UBC (waiting; 20-month 2nd degree program) and UOttawa (got in).\n\n  \nI prefer getting another bachelors since the schools I've picked comes with a good (rigorous) curriculum and a very good selection of co-op options as well as decent hiring rates post-studies. I want a strong, guided foundation even though I've done a little bit of everything by myself out of curiosity and interest (C++ in university courses, Python in high school, JS, html, CSS, AI/ML, Data Science).\n\n  \nHowever my parents think it would be better to get a CS masters directly instead of \"wasting time\" doing another bachelors. The problem is well-reputed schools in Canada don't seem to offer masters without cs or related undergrad. The schools that do offer this option seems pointless to me because the market is already saturated and I feel like I would just be doing it for the sake of having just any CS related education. Plus they don't seem to offer any of the benefits that bachelors does (Co-op for eg).\n\n  \nClearly I'm biased towards doing a bachelors but I don't want to be close minded. I wanna know if I should consider masters as an actual option right away. My main focus is that my education shouldn't look like a drawback to potential employers, and there should be a better chance of employment. \n\n(Also I've read multiple times that strong portfolio and CS-based projects makes you a good candidate and that you don't need formal education but I honestly don't think I can be impressive enough pull that off. I'm willing to put in the work but I also need some structured learning before I can build my portfolio. Plus CS degree is a part of the mandatory requirements for a lot of job listings that I see so I don't want to be ineligible or automatically screened out for good opportunities)\n\nSo what should I do? CS Masters without Bachelors or CS bachelors.\n\n  \n**TLDR**; Are the chances of landing a job with a CS masters without CS bachelors the same as having a CS bachelors? I know landing a job in general would be hard but which offers me a better chance?",

I've applied what I've learned to my job, creating easy to read dashboards for various metrics and automating many of my data cleaning tasks with Python. When I talked to my cousin who works in tech about the feasibility of switching careers into something like Data Analyst or Business Analyst, he told me \"to be completely honest, your resume won't get looked at without a related degree.\" He told me that the stuff I learned is \"easily replaceable with A.I\" and that I need to get way more technical and learn Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, or a very specific technical field along with a degree in order to have a chance at switching industries.\n\nI was disheartened to hear this, but if he's telling the truth, I don't want to waste my time self-learning if it's not going to lead to a job. I didn't want to go back to school given the extensive time and money commitment it would be, but if it's the only chance I have to find a higher-paying job, I can bite the bullet.

My manager never addressed any particular issues with my performance when we met 1:1 a few months ago (we never had a 1:1 since), but I was still worried. For every task I’ve been given so far, there’s a point where I don’t know what to do after I try figuring out myself and have to ask for help. I have been asked to give ETAs fore and can my very loose estimations were always less than how long it actually took to finish tasks since I barely know what I’m doing. There had also been an instance where I messed up the deployment for some of my changes, and my teammates had to help me rollback. One of the tasks I had been working on were supposed to be finished before this past week, but I couldn’t since the changes were more involved than I initially realized because of differences in the service between non-prod and prod (whereas it worked in non-prod where I had been testing prior). Teammates also had to step in again for that. I’ll even try reading through docs our team has to try to get a better sense of things, just for things to still not click. I know I’m supposed to properly ramp myself up within 2 more months, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to. There was a new task I was working on today, and once again, I got stuck on it and don’t know what to do. I was really hoping to make some progress during the weekend so I can finish it ASAP, but…I guess that isn’t happening anymore.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I should probably cut my losses and focus more energy on getting a new position since people are saying that there’s another layoff in January, and I heard that my organization was going to be impacted. I don’t have any other ground of suspicion of getting laid off, but another intern I knew had gotten laid off during the first wave when he started a few months before me, and I’m one of the least experienced people on my team. Either that, or I’m guessing getting PIP’d. I was wondering if anyone happened to have any advice for what to do.",

No positive response in weeks and it's getting close to the point where my parents are going to force me into some random dead end job for the rest of my life. (I don't count the random calls out of nowhere as they're either scam job training or they hang up after realizing I don't have years of experience). I have no confidence I'll ever be able to get out of jobs like that (if I'm working full time in some random back breaking job I won't have time or energy to interview or do anything else, and upward mobility doesn't exist, and once recruiters see my resume with a dead end job on top they will reject immediately because a guy with actual skills wouldn't be forced into a job like that). I'm also not physically strong or sociable so jobs like that would probably kill me after years in them. And it would mentally destroy me too, what's the point of trying at all in school or in general if I can only get a useless dead end job?\n\nI feel so useless, I know I should be spending every day applying to 100+ places and doing useful projects but I'm not very motivated to? I've actively tried to force myself into it, deleting video games off my computer and archiving the folders for most of my useless projects but I kind of relapsed and did more work in those, but I should know those projects are going to absolutely nothing for me useful. I need someone to push me around so I can finally delete them and move onto something that will actually help me. They have no impressive metrics so there is nothing to put in resume bullet points. No recruiter is going to be impressed by an ugly indie rpg prototype or a garbage chess engine that's 100x slower than the stuff you can already get out there. And neither of those projects have a massive CI/CD pipeline or use expensive cloud servers or use Docker or whatever else is on the long list of technologies that are mandatory nowadays\n\nI just don't know what to do? I need to get a good job at some point but it's feeling more and more impossible? This time of the year might be really bad for hiring also, but I feel like I can't wait months to get a job or else it looks like I'm unhireable\n\nResume wise it is pretty unimpressive but I'm losing motivation to try to make \"impressive\" things, I haven't been able to come up with any \"useful\" project ideas that justify me paying money for an enterprise level server for something (found somewhere that said that real projects have to use enterprise level things, free servers are for useless toy projects). I can't \"make something I'm interested in\" because the things I'm interested in are all useless, I need to only work on useful things which means I can't pick something that I like to work on, I have to only work on something that will help me and not just play all day. I don't feel like I'm skilled enough to make a project useful and impressive for a specific company since they have their own experienced developers, who am I to think that I can surpass all of them combined? (Plus even if I spent months on a project like that what's to say their recruiter just rejects me before even seeing the project, or the company just rejects me anyway because they flat out aren't hiring low experience people?)",

Should I remake those?\n\nAlso, what have I missed in regards to CSS/HTML/bootstrap/AI/wordpress and overall dev?  My strong points were always less JS and more CMS builds and pixel perfect design to life.  CSS was always my strongest suit.  React devs loved me for making their apps look great.\n\nThanks.",

        "content": "hello guys,\n\nso I am a new grad, working my first corporate tech job after graduating in may this year, at a bank with the title of a SWE. Has the role name in the offer and everything, but was placed on the QA Automation team. At first, I did not know much, except that it's not liked, so I gave it a couple weeks, got some tasks, and I realized that I don't like this work at all, it isn't fufilling and I miss development work. I tell this information to my boss, about how the role is misleading and how I want to switch and be given tasks, and if it's possible to switch and they said it can happen, but it takes time and that someone did that after working in qa for a couple years. So, this isn't a good situation for me, I don't want to be stuck doing this work forever, then struggle later getting a dev job. Even hearing the word QA is becoming a trigger word for me, because there's that seperation between being qa and being a dev, and I am not considered a dev.  It sucks knowing that after 4 years of grinding CS work, and doing full-stack projects, that you spend your time running tests and trying to find bugs, but don't get to fix them. Since i only worked here 2-3 months now, should I include this in my resume when I am applying, or pretend it dosen't exist and just apply without it? Also has many people had this issue happen to them? I know it's not the end of the world, but it makes me anxious knowing each day longer I am here, the more I feel like I am settling and i can do better. So I decided to just bite the bullet and start back on applying, but I just want to know whats the best thing for me to do. Thanks for reading.",

        "content": "I’m about to enter the job market for the first time, and it feels weird because I’ve never actually done a real job hunt before. The funny part? I'm not even entry level.\n\nFor context, I’m a senior full-stack engineer with \\~7 years at a Fortune 200 company. I got incredibly lucky with an internship that converted to full-time, so I've never interviewed anywhere lol (the internship didn't have a traditional interview process. I didn't even answer a single technical question.)\n\nRequired to be in another state by fall 2026, which means I need to start looking ASAP. Problem is...I'm in my late 20s and have literally zero job hunting experience.\n\n* **My first question:** How important are portfolio projects for senior-level roles? \n\nI've got a few (including a personal site) and I'm working on wrapping up a bigger Rust project, but I'm worried I'm just wasting my time if employers don't actually care about this stuff outside of entry-level.\n\nI'm also worried staying at one company for 7 years might've hurt me. I'm significantly underpaid for my experience and degree (MS in CS + certs) right now, and I'm paranoid that long tenure looks like I'm either stuck or coasting. I keep hearing conflicting takes: some say it's a red flag for stagnation, others say it doesn't matter.\n\n* **My second question:** Anyone know how this actually plays out in the job market? I'm pretty ignorant about this stuff. Can't change it now, but good to know for the future.\n\n\n\n**TDLR:** What should a senior dev actually focus on when entering the market for the first time?

However, I really enjoyed my time with B (can't understate this enough), and I know the hours would be considerably better (at least 1h30m less than A, daily).\n\nB is also a much bigger name, and has a couple particularly deep strengths which could enable me to seriously upskill and pivot back to finance if I wanted to. TC grows steadily year-on-year; I think £150-160k TC by year 4.\n\nOn the other hand, I suspect that As comp would grow similarly fast, and probably skews towards big bonuses in particularly good years.

So I'm the kind of guy that has spend months studying out of algorithm questions and data structures on leet code and things like that And I still get confused even on the easier questions. And of course you're looking for a job, it's heavy on coding questions just to get through the door. And I'm not sure what I can do at this point I feel like all the studying just goes to waste. I'm better at like architecting and design and I've been studying system design and I've been better at that than I am a coding questions. \n\nAny advice on what I can do? I feel so trapped....",

Until some Accounting Major took over as CEO and yesterday dropped the bombshell that the company will be \"restructured\" to prioritize \"value\" and \"delivering business outcomes while remaining lean\". He wont say it, but in other words, his genius mind believes that with AI one fullstack dev can now do the job of 10 frontend devs and 10 backend devs or something.\n\nAnd so, I am offered a \"bigger oppurtunity\" from my current position with a generous 8% increase in pay despite a 10x increase in responsibilities. /s obviously.\n\nI feel like I dont want to be dealing with the shitshow of having them replace competent staff with young AI-brained people and my job will be putting out fires whule being compensated with peanuts. Leaving is a no-brainer, but I am wondering if I should at least wait until March next year to receive my bonus before tendering my resignation. Most of the others around me are being slapped with voluntary seperation offers with them told to leave by Dec. Meaning that the shitshow, for me, will be from Jan to June if I tender on March (3 months notice). Idk if I am mentally ready to face the ordeal.\n\nEdit: Also have a competitive offer from another firm to join before my bonus for 15% increase",

They mentioned about the first round being data coding round and I can use Python/Scala with Spark or Pandas to solve the problem. \n\nI'm not sure what to expect in that round and have been revising Spark and Scala. \n\nHas anyone done similar rounds and can tell few questions that I can expect ?\n\nShould I also brush up my SQL knowledge or data warehouse modelling for this or next rounds ?
