        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI wasn't planning to share my article here. But Only this week, I had 3 conversations this week wit fairly senior data engineers who see AI as a thread. Here's what I usually see:\n\n* Annoyed because they have to support AI enigneers (yet feel unseen)\n* Affraid because don't know if they may lose their job in a restructure\n* Want to navigate in \"the new world\" and have no idea where to start\n\nHere's the essence, so you don't need to read the whole thing\n\nAI engineering is largely data engineering with new buzzwords and probabalistic transformations. Here's a quick map:\n\n* **LLM = The Logic Engine.** This is the component that processes the data.\n* **Prompt = The Input.** This is literally the query or the parameter you are feeding into the engine.\n* **Embeddings = The Feature.** This is classic feature engineering. You are taking unstructured text and turning it into a vector (a list of numbers) so the system can perform math on it.\n* **Vector Database = The Storage.** That's the indexing and storage layer for those feature vectors.\n* **RAG = The Context.** Retrieval step. You’re pulling relevant data to give the logic engine the context it needs to answer correctly.\n* **Agent = The System.** This is the orchestration layer. It’s what wraps the engine, the storage, and the inputs into a functional workflow.2\n\nDon't let the \"AI\" label intimidate you. The infrastructure challenges, are the same ones we’ve been dealing with for years. The names have just changed to make it sound more revolutionary than it actually is.\n\nI hope this will help so of you.",

        "content": "I’ve been in FAANG for about 5 years now, across multiple teams and orgs (new data teams, SDE-heavy teams, BI-heavy teams, large and small setups), and one thing that’s consistently surprised me is how little classic data modeling I’ve actually seen applied in practice.\n\nWhen I joined as a junior/intern, I expected things like proper dimensional modeling, careful handling of changing business meaning, SCD Type 2 being a common pattern, and shared dimensions that teams actually align on — but in reality most teams seem extremely execution-focused, with the job dominated by pipelines, orchestration, data quality, alerts, lineage, governance, security, and infra, while modeling and design feel like maybe 5–10% of the work at most.\n\nEven at senior levels, I’ve often found that concepts like “ensuring the business meaning of a column doesn’t silently change” or why SCD2 exists aren’t universally understood or consistently applied. In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).\n\nMy logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations. Curious what others think: have you seen the same pattern?",

        "content": "Mine has evolved a bit over the last year. Today it’s a mix of newer faces alongside a couple of absolute bedrocks in data and analytics.  \n  \nApache Arrow  \nIt's the technology you didn’t even know you loved. It’s how Streamlit improved load speed, how DataFusion moves DataFrames around, and the memory model behind Polars. Now it has its own SQL protocol with Flight SQL and database drivers via ADBC. The idea of Arrow as the standard for data interoperability feels inevitable.  \n  \nDuckDB   \nI was so late to DuckDB that it’s a little embarrassing. At first, I thought it was mostly useful for data apps and lambda functions. Boy was I was wrong. The SQL syntax, the extensions, the ease of use, the seamless switch between in-memory and local persistence…and DuckLake. Like many before me, I fell for what DuckDB can do. It feels like magic.  \n  \nPostgres  \nI used to roll my eyes every time I read “Just use Postgres.” in the comments section. I had it pegged as a transactional database for software apps. After working with DuckLake, Supabase, and most recently ADBC, I get it now. Postgres can do almost anything, including serious analytics. As Mimoune Djouallah put it recently, “PostgreSQL is not an OLTP database, it’s a freaking data platform.”  \n  \nPython  \nWhere would analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, data platforms and AI engineering be without Python? Can you honestly imagine a data world where it doesn’t exist? I can’t. For that reason alone it will always have a spot on my Mount Rushmore. 4 EVA.  \n  \nI would be remiss if I didn't list these honorable mentions:  \n  \n\\* Apache Parquet  \n\\* Rust  \n\\* S3 / GCS  \n  \nThis was actually a fun exercise and a lot harder than it looks 🤪",

Majority (\\~95%) of the data pipelines are for a lakehouse environment, so lakehouse is a key decision point. We did a poc with Fabric, but it did not really meet our need, on the following points:\n\n\\- GovCloud. Majority of the services of Fabric are still not in GCC, so commercial was the choice of poc for us. But the transition of couple of lakehouses from Synapse to the Fabric was really painful. Also, the pricing model is very ambiguous. For example, if we need powerbi premium licenses, how Fabric handles that? \n\n\\- Lakehouse Explorer does not supportfor OneLake security RW permissions. RBAC also not mature for row level security.\n\n\\- Capacity based model lead to vety unpredictable costing, and Microsoft reps were unable to provide good answers,\n\nSo we are looking to Databricks, and Snowflake. I am very curious to know thought and experiences for you'll for these platforms. To my limited toe-dipping Databricks environments, it is very well suited for lakehouse. Snowflake, not so. Do you agree with this?\n\nHow Databricks handles govcloud situations? Do they have mature services in govcloud? How is their pricing model compared to Fabric, and Snowflake?\n\nManagement is very interested in my opinion as a data engineer, and also values whatever I will decide for the long run.

        "author": "wtfzambo",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# SOLVED: See solution a the bottom\n\nHello, I have been searching far and wide for a solution to my predicaments but I can't seem to figure it out, even with extensive help of AI.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nI have a skewed dataset representing 9 clients. One client is roughly 10x larger than the others. I’m trying to use `repartition` to shuffle data across nodes and balance the workload, but the execution remains bottlenecked on a single task.\n\n# Details:\n\nI'm running a simple extraction + load pipeline:\n\n`Read from DB -> add columns -> write to data lake.`\n\nThe data source is a bit peculiar: each client has its own independent database.\n\nThe large client's data consistently lands on a single node during all phases of the job. While other nodes finish their tasks very quickly, this one \"straggler\" task bottlenecks the entire job.\n\nI attempted to redistribute the data to spread the load, but nothing seems to trigger an even shuffle. I’ve tried:\n\n* Salting the keys.\n* Enabling Adaptive Query Execution (AQE).\n* `repartition(n, \"salt_column\")` , `repartition(n, \"client_id\", \"salt\")`.\n* `repartition(n)`\n\nSee picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo94vesrk2ig1.png?width=5030&format=png&auto=webp&s=399be044a1f8a3e9557553b97056141ed342b0b3\n\nIn very short pseudocode, here is what I'm doing:\n\n    data = []\n    \n    for db in db_list: # Reading from 9 independent source DBs\n        data.append(\n            spark.read.format(\"jdbc\").option(\"db\", \"table\").load()\n        )\n    \n    df_unioned = union_all(data)\n    df_unioned = df_unioned.sortWithinPartition(client_id)\n    \n    # This is where I'm stuck:\n    df_unioned = df_unioned.repartition(100, \"salt_column\")\n    \n    df_unioned.write.parquet(\"path/to/lake\")\n\nLooking at the Physical Plan, I've noticed there is no `Exchange` (Shuffle) happening before the write. Despite calling `repartition`, Spark is keeping the `numPartitions=1` from the JDBC scans all the way through the `Union`, resulting in a 'one-partition-per-client' bottleneck during the write phase.\n\nHelp me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope :(\n\nPS:\n\nA couple of extra points, maybe they're useful:\n\n\\- This data in specific is quite small, just a few gigabytes (i'm testing on a subset of the full data)\n\n\\- For the record, the repartition DOES happen: if I do \\`repartition(100)\\`, I will have 100 tiny files in the data lake. What doesn't happen is the shuffle between nodes or even cores.\n\n# Solution\n\nIt was AQE + a later query in the job causing this. This later query, which comes after writing out to data lake, does an aggregation on the \\`client\\_id\\`. Apparently, AQE understands this and goes \"instead of doing two shuffles (1 for repartitioning and another one to aggregate) I'm just gonna do zero since the data is already partitioned by \\`client\\_id\\`\".",

When I check the refresh history, the three small tables are loaded successfully, but the large one gets stuck in a loop and times out after 24 hours.\n\nWhat’s strange is that we have other dataflows pulling much more data from different data sources without any issues. This one, however, just won’t load the 1 million row table. Given our capacity, this should be an easy task.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar scenario?\n\nWhat do you think could be the issue here?

        "author": "dbjan",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the \"medallion\" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.\n\nFirst - on all of these projects we were pushed by the \"data architect\" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).\n\nSecond - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's  time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.\n\nAre you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?\n\nI understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : D\n\nAlso I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..\n\nWhat are your views on this?

Lance is an open source, modern, columnar lakehouse format for AI/ML datasets that include multimodal data, embeddings, nested fields, and more. LanceDB is an open source, embedded library that exposes convenient APIs on top of the Lance format to manage embeddings and indices.\n\nCheck out the latest Lance datasets uploaded by the awesome OSS community here:\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance\n\nWhat the Hugging Face integration means in practice for Lance format and LanceDB users on the Hub:\n- Binary assets (images, audio, videos) stored inline as blobs: No external files and pointers to manage\n- Efficient columnar access: Directly stream metadata from the Hub without touching heavier data (like videos) for fast exploration\n- Prebuilt indices can be shared alongside the data: Vector/FTS/scalar indices are packaged with the dataset, so no need to redo the work already done by others\n- Fast random access and scans: Lance format specializes in blazing fast random access (helps with vector search and data shuffles for training). It does so without compromising scan performance, so your large analytical queries can be run on traditional tabular data using engines like DuckDB, Spark, Ray, Trino, etc.\n\nEarlier, to share large multimodal datasets, you had to store multiple directories with binary assets + pointer URLs to the large blobs in your Parquet tables on the Hub. Once downloaded, as a user, you'd have had to recreate any vector/FTS indices on your local machine, which can be an expensive process.\n\nNow, with Lance officially supported as a format on the Hub, you can package all your datasets along with their indices as a single, shareable artifact, with familiar table semantics that work with your favourite query engine. Reuse others' work, and prepare your models for training, search and analytics/RAG with ease!\n\nIt's very exciting to see the variety of Lance datasets that people [have uploaded](https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance) already on the HF Hub, feel free to share your own, and spread the word!",

Stored procedures call stored procedures and inserting an entity may wind up touching 30+ tables. A lot of the time, it's required. The ERP manages finances, staff, business operations; there is a lot of conditional logic to determine what to insert, update, delete, etc.. \n\nAre there any tools or techniques that could be useful here? I'm comfortable programming, but if a tool can do a job better and more efficiently, I'd rather use it. ",

        "content": "If I run a query like ``df2 = df.groupBy(\"Country\").count()``, does running ``.repartition(\"Country\")`` before the groupBy make the query faster? AI is giving contradictory answers on this so I decided to ask Reddit.\n\nThe book written by the creators of Spark (\"Spark: The Definitive Guide\") say that there are not too many ways to optimize an aggregation:\n\n>For the most part, there are not too many ways that you can optimize specific aggregations\nbeyond filtering data before the aggregation having a sufficiently high number\nof partitions. However, if you’re using RDDs, controlling exactly how these aggregations\nare performed (e.g., using reduceByKey when possible over groupByKey) can be\nvery helpful and improve the speed and stability of your code.\n\nThe way this was worded leads me to believe that a repartition (or bucketBy, or partitionBy on the physical storage) will not speed up a groupBy.\n\nThis, I don't understand however. If I have a country column in a table that can take one of five values, and each country is in a seperate partition, then Spark will simply count the number of records in each partition without having to do a shuffle. This leads me to believe that repartition (or partitionBy, if you want to do it on the hard disk) will almost always speed up a groupby. So why do the authors say that there aren't many ways to optimize an aggregation? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I'm of course implying that in an actual production environment you would run the .groupBy after the .repartition more than once. Otherwise, if you run a single .groupBy query, you're just moving the shuffle one step above.",

        "content": "Context:  \nI’m building a horizontally scaled proxy/gateway system. Each node is shipped as a binary and should be installable on new servers with minimal config. Nodes need shared state like sessions, user creds, quotas, and proxy pool data.\n\na. My current proposal is: each node talks only to a central internal API using a node key. That API handles all reads/writes to Redis/DB. This gives me tighter control over node onboarding, revocation, and limits blast radius if a node is ever compromised. It also avoids putting datastore credentials on every node.\n\nb. An alternative design (suggested by an LLM during architecture exploration) is letting every node connect directly to Redis for hot-path data (sessions, quotas, counters) and use it as the shared state layer, skipping the API hop. -- i didn't like the idea too much but the LLM kept defending it every time so maybe i am missin something!?! \n\nI’m trying to decide which pattern is more appropriate in practice for systems like gateways/proxies/workers: direct datastore access from each node, or API-mediated access only.\n\nWould like feedback from people who’ve run distributed production systems.",

The lineage extraction goes deep, not just stopping at the column level but extending to nested struct field access and array element access. It also accounts for [both inputs and side inputs](https://github.com/lpraat/inbq?tab=readme-ov-file#concepts).\n\nYou can use inbq as a [Python library,](https://pypi.org/project/inbq/) [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/inbq), or via its [CLI](http://github.com/lpraat/inbq?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line-interface).\n\nFeedbacks, feature requests, and contributions are welcome!",

Many of these responsibilities can be handled in dbt through tests and macros, and I’ve already implemented those pieces.\n\nWhat I’d like to enable is a way for every new dbt project to automatically include these generic tests and macros—essentially a shared baseline that should apply to all dbt projects. The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.\n\nThat said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.\n\nGiven that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",

I'm looking ahead to when I have to present my work, and wonder if they're going to laugh me out of the room if I present it in GUI form.  Do you think it's common for a data engineer to use the GUI with less than a week's experience?

The point is, from what I see and others tell, is that tools are easier to learn but the theory and thinking is key.\n\nI'm fortunate enough to be able to pursue a MS and that's my goal. I wanted to hear y'all's thoughts on a Masters in Information Sciences. Specifically something like this: https://ecatalog.nccu.edu/preview\\_program.php?catoid=34&poid=6710\n\nMy goal is to learn everything data related (DA, DS & DE). I can do analysis but no one's hiring and so it's difficult to get domain experience. I'm working on contacting local businesses and offering free data analysis services in the hopes of getting some useful experience. I'm learning a lot of the DS tools myself and I have the Statistics knowledge to back me but there's no entry-level DS anymore. DE is the only one that appears to be difficult to self-learn and relies on learning on the job which is why I'm thinking a MS that helps me with that is better than a MS in DS (which are mostly new and cash-grabs).\n\nI could also further study Applied Statistics but that's a different discussion. I wanted to get advice on MIS for DE specifically. Thanks!",

        "content": "Hi. Question about production access. Does your organization allow users/developers who are not admins or in IT access to run their pipelines in production? Meaning they developed it but maybe IT provided the platform such as Airflow, nifi, etc. To run it.  If they can’t run it do they have production access but just more restricted? Like read access so that they can debug why a pipeline failed and push changes without have to ask someone to send them the logs for them to see what happened.\n\nI’m asking this since right now I’m in an org where there are a few platforms but the two biggest don’t allow anyone outside their 2-5 person teams access to it. Essentially developers are expected to build pipelines and hand them off and that’s it. No view into prod anything.   The reasoning by those admins is that developers don’t need to see prod and it’s keeps their environment secure. They will monitor and notify us if something goes wrong.  I think this is dumb honestly as in my opinion that if you can’t grant people production access and keep it secure at the same time your environment is not as good as you think.  I also think that developers need prod access if they are an engineer. At minimum I think they should have read access so that they can easy see how their pipelines are performing and debug if needed.  The environments and nifi and ssis for the record and this isn’t a post to bash them so I’m only saying that for context. I don’t care what the platform is per se but just the workflow in general.\n\nHow does your organization work? Am I missing a reason why developers should not have prod access to if they are required to build and debug pipelines?",

I wanted to build a Kimball model but my boss didn't want one. I took a step back and at the same time moved into a medium/large sized business from startup culture. I wanted to see their design and identify if/what I was misunderstanding. A consulting firm came in and started changing things, changing everything. I was not in these discussions because I was new and still learning the code base but the pipeline used to have 4 layers, data lake, star schema, reporting layer and finally a data warehouse layer (flat tables that combined multiple reporting tables to make it super easy for low skilled analysts to use). The consulting firm correctly said we should only have 3 layers but apparently didn't provide ANY direction or oversight. My boss responded by removing the star schema! well they technically removed it but simply merged the logic from two layers into one script... pushing the entire concept of data warehousing into the hands of individual engineers to keep straight. I wish I could describe it better but let's just say it takes experienced top level engineers months of hand holding to get straight. \n\nAnyway I'm sure you see the problem I'm talking about. Threw me soo far off track and I started questioning EVERYTHING I knew! lost my confidence and my recruiter picked up on it.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So my boss recently told me that try-catch statements are \"garbage\" and that I should avoid using them when developing. This wasn't specific to any particular language - they seemed to mean it as a general programming principle. I'm pretty confused because I thought error handling with try-catch was fundamental to most modern programming languages. I know it can be misused (like catching exceptions and doing nothing, or using exceptions for control flow), but completely avoiding it seems extreme. Is there some programming philosophy or best practice I'm missing here? Are there alternatives to try-catch that are considered better? Or is my boss maybe referring to specific anti-patterns that I should be aware of? Has anyone else encountered this \"no try-catch\" philosophy? What are the actual best practices around exception handling across different languages? Any insight would be really helpful - I want to understand if there's something legitimate here or if I should push back on this guidance.\n\n  \n‐--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \nWhen people say vague things like \"That's not good programming,\" I always ask, \"Why?\"\nWhy is it garbage? Why is it bad design? Why isn't it good programming?\n\nWhen I asked that, they said, \"You should at least make a program that doesn't produce errors,\" and then laughed at me.\n\nAnyway, thanks for all the responses. I posted this because I was genuinely confused after that conversation and wanted to see if I was missing something obvious.",

Then, the last part is translating high level written instructions into syntax based on a certain language.\n\nThis is based on my opinion and how I have been coding also being language agonistic by ensuring that logic comes first before anything else. \n\nMay be, some experienced devs may correct or share thoughts on this but this is basically based on what I have experienced throughout my programming journey.",

        "author": "UsefulExplanation131",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey, everyone. Im really hoping to get outside perspectives on some difficulties ive been experiencing while learning to program. I keep experiencing burn out and exhaustion over and over again and I can’t figure out why it keeps happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore and just can’t think clearly about my situation anymore. \n\n\n\nHere is some background:\n\n  \n\n\nRough timeline of my programming journey: August 2022- I begin working through TOP curriculum with the goal of seeing if i enjoy programming. I decide that i do enjoy it -> Feb 2024 - I physically and mentally burn out from my job as a delivery driver. Managing my job, programming, and therapy was too much and I quit after i got injured while working.  March 2024- after spending a year going from 45 mins of studying/week to 10 hours/week, a mental health crisis, and 1 month after quitting my job, i complete the foundations module of TOP -> Nov or Dec 2024 - I take advantage of being unemployed and living off savings to focus hard on programming. I build up to studying 25-30 hours/week consistently. I realize I don’t like front end stuff. I choose the js path on TOP, skip the “advanced html/css” and “react section,” but complete everything else up to the file uploader project of the “NodeJS” section. Around December i take a small break to focus on an art project, and that snowballed to a few months of no programming (though i think that would’ve happened regardless if i took a break or not). -> Feb 2026 - the past year and few months were a blur of trying so hard to build back the habit of programming as well as i did the first time. I spend some months completely dreading programming and unable to start and some months of still struggling, but able to at least show up mostly consistently. I follow a pattern of on for 2-3 months to off for 2-3 months. After i learn I don’t like front end stuff and realize that endlessly building endpoints was equally dreadful, i decide to focus on other backend topics and keep finding myself bouncing around. I spend a few months on [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) then burn out. I go to nand2tetris to switch things up, last a month, then burn out. I decide to learn C from “C programming: a modern approach,” to switch things up again, and actually have some fun, but things fizzle out again. Every attempt leaves me broken and exhausted. At this point, I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to restart. The feelings that kept me going during my most consistent periods of study, feeling like im improving and growing as a person and programmer, the satisfaction and euphoria of solving some problem that I genuinely believed i could not solve, just have been completely absent for so long. \n\n\n\nDuring all of this, ive been working hard in therapy to resolve a lot of things including social anxiety. I bring this up because i have bad social anxiety that prevents me from going to local programming meetups, participating in online programming communities, and applying for jobs. Going at this mostly alone just adds another layer of complexity to it all. Ive made a lot of progress on that front but still have a ways to go. \n\n\n\nI haven’t programmed in a couple months now and its like no amount of time away makes me dread programming any less. I feel spiritually broken. Im too close to my situation to think objectively anymore. What do y’all think i could do differently? Why does programming keep becoming this thing that i dread? Am i focusing on studying too much and not spending enough time making projects? For me, the hardest part about this whole journey (and ive realized this applies to many, maybe most, endeavors) hasn’t even been the intellectual side of things. That’s hard, sure, but by far the hardest part has been the emotional side of things. Specifically, having to find a way to program consistently over time. That’s the aspect of all of this that is the most soul crushing. It was hard to get yourself to program today, and guess what? You have to do it all over again tomorrow. And the day after. Maybe not every single day, but most weeks, most months. How do y’all not get overwhelmed with this? I think i do a decent job of focusing only on the short term but the big picture and the stakes are always on the back of my mind. I do find enjoyment in solving some programming problems, but I can’t deny that I wouldn’t be pursuing this if it wasn’t a well paying career that doesn’t require a degree. Which is the reason why i even decided to see if i enjoy programming and why i still pursue it after all this struggle. Every job ive had up to this point has been low skilled work. Server, cook, cashier, delivery driver, etc. I’m almost 25 and i want and need to get a career going. I can’t keep living the life that ive been living and programming seems to be a good enough fit. It’s intellectually challenging, doesn’t require a degree, well paying, and i find a lot of it enjoyable (even if there are a lot of things i find tedious and annoyingly boring).\n\n\n\nThat being said, i do have ideas that get me excited and could be solved using code. Some of my programming project ideas include:\n\n* Something similar to GitHub but for digital artists to save snapshots of their artwork. \n* Data management system for iot devices. Inspiration came from thinking about how massive amounts of data from telescopes are efficiently stored and organized\n* A tool that takes a 3D model and allows you to see the cross section along the axial planes\n* A massive library of artworks that pulls artwork from the online catalogs of museums and other collection websites\n\nI can’t help but feel like i am not ready for any of these projects and that I need to keep studying and learning before i can attempt any of them. That was part of the inspiration to learn c, to better learn how databases work by making a simple database since these are all data intensive projects. \n\nAnyway, if anyone has anything to share about what I could do better, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading, ill stop yapping now\n\n  \n",

There is also an \"harder\" version of it where you need to print 2 pyramids. you know, the beginner level stuffs..\n\nsince i dont have prior syntax knowledge i asked AI to generate me a code in order to check it, study it and understand it. and after i did it, i felt everything was clear, i knew what every line did and why. NICE RIGHT?\n\n\\#\n\n\\##\n\n\\###\n\n\\####\n\nwhen it came part 2 i decided to imperatively not use AI and only using my knowledge acquired from the first exercise to complete it.\n\nthis time the first of the two pyramid had to be reversed, so with blank spaces before the \"#\" symbols. Like this:\n\n\\#\n\n\\##\n\n  \\###\n\n\\####\n\nSo how do you reverse a pyramid? by starting printing spaces instead of ashes right ? perfect. This concept was pretty obvious and clear in my mind, as it should be, but the application? impossible. I could't \"invent\" a way to do it. I just lacked the creativity, even if i had all the starting points in front of me.\n\nThe formula to print the ashes was the same exact formula for basically all the other operations in the program:\n\nfor (int s = 0; s < height - i; s++)  \n{  \nprintf(\"  \")  \n}\n\nthe only difference here is that im subtracting the variable (i) from the (height), because as the height increases i should also decrease the number of spaces. Perfect, logic and it works...BUT I COULDNT INVENT IT MYSELF!!!  \ni totally lacked the creativity to think about subtracting (i) from (height) in order to solve my problem...i knew about the base formula and what it did, but i couldn't modify myself and understand what to do\n\nI HAD TO LOOK AT THE SOLUTION IN ORDER TO UNDERSTED WHAT TO DO.\n\nthis is the very first set of exercises, this is the base. This is \"hello world\" level almost and yet i failed miserably.\n\nI feel super bad because i genuinely love the idea of becoming a good programmer. im 100% convinced about it.\n\nbut this kind of misses makes me think that im just retarded to be honest... Imagine at a job when things gets serious and i can't even wrap my had around the simplest of problems...i'd get fired, or not even assumed probably.\n\nso yea, tell me what you think...tell me how miserable my story has been your eyes.\n\nPlease just be hard and tell me the truth.",

The base system is promising and could be excellent, if the QA was more thorough.*\n\n**So, why do I say coddy is utter garbage?**  \n  \n\\- The website is riddled with bugs, from non-loading lessons to timeouts and very... very slow validation.\n\n\\- A lot of the lessons have errors: They aren't properly formated, do not explain all the methods and systems needed to actually solve a lesson.\n\n\\- The \"daily challenge\" system is a joke. Its some poorly made AI system that gives you a basic ass task like \"Print hello world 10 times\" despite being at chapters like HashMaps etc.\n\n\\- There are numerous lessons where they do not actually explain to you what the desired output needs to be (given, you can see that by clicking the \"expected output\" toggle - but you should be able to see exactly what you need to do from the challenge description. \n\n\\- This last point goes hand in hand with the issue that the output needs to be exact. They had one extra space at the end of their output, despite not showing that because you're tasked with printing the result of each itteration on a new line anyway? Instantly lose the \"first try\" challenge.\n\n\\- Courses aren't even finished. I started the Python and Java course at the same time, hoping to refresh my python knowledge and picking up Java at the same time. Java's whole point is to be an OOP-language. Guess what: Section 3 \"Object oriented Programming\" is \"Coming Soon\"™. What the actual fu\\*\\*?\n\n\\- The website is clearly built around just monetizing everything as agressively as possible. I got lucky and was able to use a discount code during November to get 30% off monthly subscriptions so it was \"only\" 14.95 a month. Still: I do not feel like that value is really justified. The website has a lot of AI-Slop and wannabe intelligent assistance systems that either fail, timeout (I now know this is a firebase website because the website is printing firebase errors everywhere on every fuc\\*\\*\\* interaction) and lots of lessons are very, very poorly worded.\n\nThis could've been a 8.5/10 rating but as it stands, I'd say coddy is at best a 4/10 and you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nTo their credit: They recently updated their Quizz section which made it less buggy and a lot more interactive.",

        "title": "Coupling data with behaviour considered harmful",
        "author": "Achereto",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've seen a couple of posts by people new to programming struggling with understanding OOP and people in the responses making claims about the benefits of OOP. I want to give a bit of a different perspective on it, having written OO code for over 15 years and moving away from it over the last 2-3 years.\n\nThe core idea of OO is to model things analogue to the real world. So for example a `Datetime` object would represent a specific date and time, and everything related to that (like adding a second or minute) would be implemented by the object. It would also allow you to compare dates in an expressive way. Some languages allow you to have something like `if (today < tomorrow)`, or calculate the difference using `one_day := tomorrow - today` which is neat. \n\n**This approach couples data with behaviour.** If you need to add behaviour to a class and you don't own the class, you can't just add the behaviour to the class, and if the fields of the class are private you also can't easily access them from the subclass. So you're already facing a design problem. Yes, people have thought about it and found solutions but the key is that the coupling of data and behaviour *created* the design problem that had to be solved. With structs and functions you could just write a new function and would be done. No design problem in the first place.\n\nBut the problem becomes worse: With objects acting on their own behalf you lose the efficiency of [iterating over data and modifying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVbI1HIzCE). For every update on an object, you have to call a method and create significant computation overhead (and no, the compiler usually can't optimize this away).\n\nIn fact, the problems created by coupling data to behaviour (like classes do) has become such a pain for developers that we started teaching \"Composition over Inheritance\". In simple terms this means that an object (containing data) shouldn't implement its own behaviour any more, but instead provide placeholders for other objects that implement specific behavior can be used by the original object, effectively decoupling data from behaviour again (undoing OO). One of the better talks explaining this principle is [Nothing is Something by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) from ~10 years ago. In her example in the second half of her talk you can see that the `House` class is stripped down to data and placeholders for behaviour, giving her the maximum flexibility for new features.\n\nTo reiterate: **OOP couples data with behaviour. The design problems arising from this are best solved by decoupling data from behaviour again**\n\nIf you need more convincing data, then you can look at all the [OOP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). 13 of those 22 patterns (including the most useful ones) are actually separating data from behaviour, 3 are debatable if they do (Composite, Facade, Proxy) and only 6 (Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Flyweight, Memento, Observer) aren't about separating data from behaviour.\n\nIf coupling data with behaviour is the root problem for many design problems in programming and the solutions people come up with are different ways to decouple data from behaviour again, then you should clearly avoid coupling them in the first place to avoid all of these problems.\n\nSo what should you learn instead of OO? I would say that Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a good start as they seems to continue emerging as a solution to most design problems. Even \"Composition over Inheritance\" is already a step towards ECS. ECS have become more popular of the last years with both Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine switching to it. There is a fantastic video about the [ECS in Hytale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglU107_DA4) as well, explaining how this makes modding extremely easy. More upcoming companies will do ECS in the next years and learning it now will put you in an advantage in the hiring processes. \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk. :)\n\n(ps: not sure if \"Tutorial\" is the right Flair because I don't actually show code, but it may be the best fit for explaining a concept and its downsides)",

I also didn't try doing anything beyond the assigned tasks in it, and pretty soon forgot everything I learned.\n\nNow, of course, everybody uses Python, but I instead learned R, which I don't regret as such, because I still like R more, but I wish I at least tried to learn Python sooner, since I have to use it now in my work anyway.\n\nAnd of course, C/C++, which I didn't even try learning until very recently. Doing it as an adult, even with experience in other languages, is much harder than it had to be.",

        "content": "A bit of a niche question, but I'm hoping someone in the community could help me out with this, since I'm finding a scarce amount of resources online regarding this topic. I'm a bachelor of music student and my main focus has been in emerging music technology for a long time, but it was only recently when I took an elective course in Pure Data that my mind was opened to the possibilities of creating my own VSTs, and it wasn't until even more recently that my roommate/bandmate suggested that he use his electrical engineering course to good use and we make music hardware together. Naturally, I love this idea, and we've been conceptualising a few admittedly ambitious ideas for boutique guitar pedals, synthesizers and other music hardware that we'd love to use ourselves, but now that he's started his EE course, I'm at a position where I really do have to start locking in and learning the relevant programming. I'm aware it'll take years before we're both skilled enough to create anything close to the ideas that we have now, but I figure it's never too early to start learning now.\n\n  \nFor VSTs in particular, I know the JUCE framework for C++ is the standard, and I've found a decent amount of resources on that, so I'm not too worried about it. My bigger question regards the hardware side of things. Which microcontrollers are standard for pedals, eurorack modules, synthesizers, etc, or does it depend more on processing power and other factors i'm not yet aware of? Is C++ a good language to know or should I also think about branching out and learning other languages instead? How does one even write code for microcontrollers and make it interact with the electronic components on the PCB? Are these stupid questions?\n\n  \nAs you can tell, I am truly lost in the dark here as I haven't an ounce of programming experience (outside of pure data and briefly learning GML when I was younger) but I know I can learn it, I just desperately need to know where to start, where to find resources, who to talk to, and what I should focus on learning now.

I saw a few explanations about using it so you don’t have to change things across systems if the private variable is changed but that also confused me a bit. \n\nAnother reason I saw was that it’s for security reasons, however this one doesn’t quite make sense to me because can’t you just use setters and getters?

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Before I start my rant, I want to say I use AI everyday. I use it for:\n\n1. Understanding a concept/service. Why is it designed in a particular way and verifying the sources (not all the time, only when I am skeptical of the answers).\n2. Understanding a piece of code from a language I am not familiar with. Asking the LLM to explain each line.\n3. Asking the agent to edit a specific function in an unfamiliar language to do a certain thing and asking the agent to explain line by line.\n4. Writing unit tests.\n5. Pros/Cons of a system design approach. \n6. Fixing the grammatical mistakes that I make while writing something or asking it to rewrite certain sentences which are harder for audiences to grasp.\n\nThe ability of an LLM to do all of the above is big win and a big productivity boost for me. I am still amazed by the capabilities of an LLM to do all the above. \n\nHowever, I am somewhat disappointed and puzzled by the upper management push to not write code at all and delegate the writing part to AI agents. When we wrote code line by line, it gave us the ability to understand the software that we are building in a fundamental level. The friction we had when writing code, helped us to develop critical thinking and helped develop the debugging skills (the golden egg the management got over time). If we delegate this work to AI, are we not going to lose this skill eventually ? When things go wrong, the senior management is going to ask the engineers to fix the issue not an LLM. The engineer has to have atleast some mental model of how the code works. Isn't it too late and expensive to rewrite things when a production issue happens ?\n\nFinally, how are software engineers going to create novel libraries/services if they don’t write code and understand the underlying behavior. Are we sure that the engineers can create a library like React if they have not written HTML/JS by hand in years. \n\nI want to know your thoughts and hear opposing view points. I am of the opinion that an LLM can make me 1.2x faster not 10x faster. This is a conversation I have been having internally with me and many of my colleagues (who are very smart than me) did not reciprocate the same feelings. I want to know where I am going wrong.",

I mean it definitely is but perhaps the answer lies lower level and I'd just need to \"get good\".\n\nBut that introduces another issue though. If you program full stack and dive too deep, you end up taking the habit of over engineering everything and then development takes ages...\n\nBut on the other side if you use only the most automated tools/libraries to make things really fast, you end up with slow and low feature slop that's turning your pc cooling system into a jet engine...\n\nI feel so lost...

The main idea is to use a real-life sword as a motion controller, kind of like a Wii Remote but in sword form.I’ve hit a wall with tracking and I’m honestly a bit stuck on what direction to take.Here’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n* **MPU6050 (IMU):** I spent about a week trying to figure out how to use it properly, but I couldn’t find documentation/tutorials that didnt end up in a disaster. I eventually gave up on this approach.\n* **Webcam + AprilTags (Python):** I managed to get some basic detection working, but it started feeling overly complicated, especially when I thought about where and how I’d even place the tags on the sword in a practical way.\n* **Other ideas (not tried yet):**\n   * Color masking / color tracking\n   * Something ML-based like YOLO\n\nAt this point, my goal has degraded to: Read rough orientation (is the sword pointing up / down / left / right) and detect swings.  Any advice will be appreciated!",

Monetization is not allowed under these terms.\n\nHowever, “WhoLiked” appears to offer this functionality in a consumer app with in-app purchases, without requiring users to manually export and upload their data.\n\nFrom a technical and compliance perspective, I’m wondering:\n\n* How could “WhoLiked” technically access this data?\n* Are there any officially supported ways to implement this use case?\n* If not, does this likely involve methods that violate TikTok’s API terms or privacy policies?\n\nI’m trying to build an app that follows platform rules and avoids legal, account, or app store risks, so I’d appreciate insights from developers who have experience with similar integrations.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "The situation is the following: both my parents are retired, and because they have neither hobbies nor social life, they spend most of their time at home watching the news. Due to this I noticed a deterioration lately in their mental health and mood. \n\nI thought I could download some of the series they used to watch time ago, store them in a USB and connect it to the TV so they can watch that instead of the news all the time. My parents are old and they would not know how to navigate through Netflix or other platforms, so I‘d have to do it this way.\n\nWhat I would like, and here is my question for you, is a file in the USB that randomly plays any video file in the USB. My parents basically use the TV as background noise so they wouldn’t care about what’s playing or follow the episodes in a given order. I want a file that they click on it and it plays whatever in the USB stick, and I need it to be random so it doesn’t always play the same episode first. I also need it to play episodes non-stop, so that they don’t need to click on the file after every episode.\n\nI have some knowledge in Python and bash, so if you give me a hint on what kind of file could do such a thing maybe I can write it on my own. \n\nThe approach I can think of is the following; when I click on this file it will:\n- Collect all the file names in the USB (or the ones with a video format).\n- Sort them on a random order.\n- Grab the first 20 files on the list.\n- Play this 20 episodes as a playlist.\n\nOn a computer I could write it so that VLC plays this list of files, but on a TV I don’t know how it could be done. It’s also not a Smart TV, so I cable install apps. ",

(in the sense of how is what I learned applied and how can I apply it)\n\nAnd these stall me, especially because finding direction in this is quite hard. \n\nProgramming has its own language peform the actual languages which I am learning a lot of googling and writing it down (got a dictionary growing here). It is a lot and feels overwhelming but is super stimulating. \n\n  \nIn terms of what I can do with this information, I am working on making my own blog that I can basically upload on (upload used loosely bc I can also write in the code itself) with the help of my boyfriend.

If you're here simply because you are looking to make a lot of money, you're in the wrong place\"\n\nThis is what the dean of students told Jordan Belfort (The Wolf of Wall Street) and his fellow classmates his first day of dental school. Belfort dropped out.\n\nA lot of you all here need to take some inspiration from that. Gatekeepers are annoying I know but the doom and gloom in this field has reached a point where I, as a senior engineer in this field, feel a call to gatekeep a little bit.\n\nThe COVID era job market is never coming back - at least not any time soon which may as well mean never for those of you trying to break into this field with no passion. And that word is the heart of what I want to get at here; passion.\n\nObviously there are still dentists today. Most of whom became dentists well after Belfort was a student and discouraged from his dreams. Just as there will be software engineers well into the future.\n\nBut the people that became dentists despite the market drying up did so because they had a true passion for the field. It still pays well sure but there was a golden age that has now passed and this is where CS is now.\n\nThis post isn't to straight up tell you to give up on a CS career. But, if you have been struggling to find a job for awhile now, you should take a step back and a bit of time to reflect on why you are here. If its just for the money, it might be time to pivot to something else.\n\nThe golden age of software engineering is over\n\nEDIT: This post went from 70+ upvotes to sub 10 in a matter of minutes. Reddit is controlled by bots and is generally a bad place to solicit life and career advice. You cannot trust what you see on this platform\n\nEDIT 2: Don't overanalyze the dentist analogy. Like I originally said there are obviously still dentists today. And they make great money IF they get jobs. The analogy is not to say they don't do well if they land jobs its to say they do well IF THEY DO land jobs. And thats the challenge of the current CS market. Its great money IF YOU CAN LAND A JOB. And to land a job in todays market you can't just mail it in. Thats my point",

I wake up every day motivated to contribute to a company that sells food. We all need food. And that makes it meaningful to me. And also you’re welcome.\n\nMoments spent in Power BI dashboards, watching shifts in purchasing behavior, tracking category growth in Kombucha, Spindrift, and non-alcoholic beverages, and translating those insights into actionable strategy? Ecstasy. Seeing those trend lines move is why I wake up everyday\n\nThere are too many contrarians here reflexively dismissing uncomfortable truths, and not enough people willing to acknowledge how the industry actually works and what  it really takes to thrive in it.\n\nI for one am so grateful to be a data scientist at a large grocery chain.

        "title": "AI Doom and layoffs",
        "author": "iwuvpuppies",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I made this post to help explain the current state of software development jobs, especially for new and junior developers. I hope this eases some of your worries. It is long, bear with me.\n\nSoftware Engineering, like any other careers is cyclical. Jobs are at the mercy of demand, trends, and capital. We saw an influx during 2010's and especially during and after Covid (early 2020's) when companies started hiring to hoard talent.\n\nLets get to the layoffs. For those who think layoffs are the direct result of AI, you are not completely wrong. But there are more factors at play. The hard reality is the American economy may be in the midst of economic hardship (recession). This takes us to my first point.\n\n1. Companies using AI as an excuse to downsize and make the books look good.\n\nFirst reason: Executive Bonuses. Public companies are at the mercy of quarterly reports. One bad quarter could cost some asshole millionaire his/her job. This sadly incentivizes short term gains and hurts the company long term. But who cares as long as they get their bonus right? AI is a goldmine for execs. They buy a Claude or Copilot subscription and start firing devs. They then take the money they were paying those devs back to the board or shareholders and get rewarded with a bonus.\n\nSecond reason: Optics. Instead of telling shareholders they need to cut costs (signs of weakness), companies can now conveniently say \"AI Efficiency\". “We don’t need as many people” sounds better than “we can’t afford them”.  To top that off, the market rewards any mention of AI with a stock bump. Again the millionaire assholes gets their bonus.\n\n2. Management is not immune to industry trends. Leadership is not perfect, they will make mistakes. Unfortunately we are often the victims of those mistakes. Executives talk to peers, copy what other companies are doing, then push it internally. Often times, this comes in the form of asking devs to vibe code/prompts/use agents.\n\n3. Take a close look at motivations. The same people dooming and glooming software development are often the ones collecting million dollar bonuses for selling the hype and tools.\n\nBelow is how things will play out:\n\nAfter management finishes downsizing and the quality of the product goes to shit (either from the vibe coding or short staffing), we will see the following:\n\n* Companies admiting AI didn’t deliver the expected benefits\n* Anyone tied to the AI initiative gets fired (after they get their million dollar bonuses of course)\n* Start hiring engineers again\n* AI repositioned as “assistive\" rather than substitutive\n\nTime and time again we have seen this with offshoring, outsourcing and any form of automation.\n\nMy recommendation, if you enjoy coding, keep doing it. After the hype and fad dies down, this job will continue to be in demand.\n\n“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and executive bonuses”",

        "author": "tran981",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've been a SDE in FAANG for almost 5 years, mostly rated Top Tier each year, worked on lots of scope, and left last year due to moral reasons and burning out from ever increasing workloads from Big Tech. I took a large break to heal and moved back in with my parents to reconnect since I moved far away to pursue this role and I figured it would be easy to land a Job near my hometown which is near a big city.\n\nBUT its been about 6 months after I started seriously searching and it feels like all of the jobs openings are in Big Tech and I can barely find roles that would I felt would be regular jobs a few years ago. Every small-mid size company has only 1-2 roles open at a time, if at all, and the competition is intense. Every application has hundreds of people applying based on LinkedIn and Indeed.\n\nI don't think I qualify or want to push myself to take Senior roles, which have much more openings by far, but for Mid Level roles, I feel like I'm looking a unicorn. Friends who work in non Big Tech jobs tell me how wonderful it is to work in a low stress environment and have coworkers who have been there for decades, while I feel like I'm going crazy just looking for a job.\n\nI knew the job search would be bad, but its genuinely horrible and I can't imagine what someone without experience or less experience than what you'd get at FAANG would be going through right now. I'm leveraging use of all resources of networks, cold calling, and the like, but with how dry the market is, every rejection and non offer after long interview sessions hits like a truck.\n\nI love this work, am staunchly anti-AI, and don't expect a large paycheck for my next job, but is it so hard of an ask for fulfilling work that I don't have to think about all day and on weekends?? (shout out last employer!!)\n\nI landed my FAANG job from an internship and I have no idea if this is the norm or if I've just been privileged. How was the market actually before all of this? I know the pandemic was a hot market for SDE jobs, but its hard to believe given the dichotomy between today's market. \n\nThe only consistent interview requests I get now are from big tech companies and I'm trying my absolute best to not re-enter the meat grinder for as long as possible. Is there any hope for a healthy job in this economy??",

        "content": "My manager used to be a FE dev, and has been a manager for ages. He is a skip level. During our 1:1 he asked if I was using AI, how I was finding it. I said blatantly that it is good for boilerplate and understanding the repo and changes done, and great for tests, albeit still needs significant edits. For actual development work, it has proved lackluster.\n\nHe was pushing that coding was dead and AI should be able to do all of it now, so we should all be much faster. He also mentioned software quality in the same discussion, advocating AI should make it easier. He then gave an example of someone he knew in a well known company who was very experienced, IC6 level, and he was bring told that he needs to use AI or go away. Whilst using AI has been useful, I do think the extent of it's usage is being stretched significantly by people who are even developers or were themselves. \n\nHow does everyone find using AI for their companies so far? When i make a new side project and do simple client side work, it's great and I rarely need to read any code. But for my corporate job, it still hallucinated a lot even with very specific prompting. Am I doing it wrong and has this improved significantly to the level my manager was claiming, or is it still useful for learning and planning to some extent but not execution?

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was promoted to Senior Engineer originally about 11/12 years ago. After a few years I left the company as I felt like promotion above that was impossible. I was essentially doing the work of other tech leads in the company, but there was always a vague reason promotion to get the title I was already doing wasnt coming. It was always \"next cycle\". \n\nI left and went to another company. Hired as a Senior, within about a year or two I'm basically acting tech lead again in terms of responsibilities. But again, every cycle I was told I'd be promoted in the *next* cycle and it never happened. \n\nAfter frustration, I left and started the cycle again at my current company. I'm now approaching my 4th anniversary and the same cycle has played out again, and I'm sensing the same excuses coming as to why no promotion will happen again this year.\n\nI'm very frustrated. I'm working at a higher level than my title suggests and have been for a long while now. No offense to the people around me but I now report up through people with much less experience.\n\nIf I leave, I can't get past a screening for a \"lead\", \"staff\", \"principal\" roles because they want a few years at that title already. If I accept another Senior position, I'm basically back to \"Day 1\" and have to grind to reach the ever elusive carrot or promotion in a few years and I'm worn out of trying hard, having responsibility pushed on me, but never actually getting the reward. \n\nWhat do people at this level do. I'm good at my job from a technical perspective and I seem to be well trusted in terms of people skills, managing a team, but the political side of forcing promotions seems to not be something I'm good at. \n\nEdit: Thank you for the helpful and respectful comments, it has given me a few things I need to think about and improve my approach towards. For the hostile comments, I'm not quite sure why my question has made a few folks so angry but I wish you well regardless. \n\nEdit 2: Received a Reddit Cares for this post. Unacceptable. ",

From the moment of waking up, until going to bed, I would stay anxious, would keep on getting teams messages from my manager and director, and would always be worried and anxious about delivering my work.\n\nSix months ago my team got internally switched and not only my tech stack changed, but also I was unable to understand anything in the new team -- how deployment worked, unit testing, which person takes care of which thing, whom to reach out when people have a disagreement on the approach you used, etc etc.\n\nIn my previous team, there was a collaborative environment. The team knew there are things that I don't know, because they have never been properly communicated, so I was helped with that. There are changes in the team or deployment process? communicated. Some new framework? communicated. Some update in our best practices? communicated too.\n\nBut in the new team, the approach turned out to be very much 'sink or swim'. You are told some things initially but then rest of the things, even processes, even whom to reach out and even what to do when there is a conflict with someone else, everything was left on you. Your ticket/task was handled to you and it was said to be your ownership \n\nThe moment you are assigned your task, you treat it like a sword hanging near your neck and you do everything possible to deliver it on time. Something unexpected causing delays? Some other component which you rely on, not working properly? Nobody cares. You need to deliver on the deadline anyhow.\n\nI don't really like this kind of a culture, really. I loved the old, collaborative culture where it felt like we are working on a mission together with our team. Where our team is not our enemy, but they are comrades. But my director told me that if I don't become highly independent, I won't survive the industry.\n\nHas it become become the norm lately that sink or swim is the only approach to work being adopted in the tech industry? Is there no scope of collaborative and friendly cultures anymore?",

I thought that I had made some sort of mistake or forgot to do something.\n\nLast night, HR messaged me and said that my manager has asked that I lower the ratings that I gave to all of my reports.\n\nI'm upset by this for many reasons and don't know how to respond.\n\nI work in the same office as my manager and feel like we have a decent relationship. Why is he going through HR instead of coming to me?\n\nI gave my reports ratings that I sincerely believe they deserve. My boss is completely non technical and has no idea what makes a good software engineering employee. He's not qualified to rate them. If my employees don't deserve the rating that I gave them, then what do they need to do in order to get the higher rating, since they're already doing those things? \n\nI don't know how to respond, because every way forward involves something that has the potential to hurt my career, my employment status, or my integrity.\n\nI could lie to my employees and make something up as to why they didn't deserve better. That's likely the best thing for my employment status and career, at least at this company. But it makes me absolutely sick.\n\nI could tell my employees that I rated them higher but that my boss, who they have daily contact with, didn't think they deserved it. That doesn't feel like a good idea.\n\nI could refuse to change the rating. That's also not going to go well for me.\n\nMy decision as of right now is that I'm going to set up a . meeting with HR and tell them that I'm not going to change their ratings without some convincing justification.\n\nI feel like if my boss wants the ratings changed, then my reports should be moved under him, and he needs to own their ratings. I'm unhappy about it in any case, but I'm more comfortable if he owns what he's done and the software engineers know it was him. \n\nI left my last company for similar reasons, and I'm now considering switching again.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to proceed?\n\nUpdate: \nAfter reading the advice here, I've messaged HR to set up a meeting with them to try and understand:\n1. Why they want me to downgrade my ratings\n2. How do I tell my reports that calibration forced me to rate them lower even though they're doing everything they were supposed to be doing to get their ratings?

My team seems cool and the work sounds like it'll be pretty interesting. Unfortunately the office is 1.5 hours away from my place (I've been couch surfing at a friend's place during the workweek to mitigate this) and the pay itself is also pretty low. There's also mandatory 5-day RTO (with rumored hourly minimums).\n\nThe offer for the new job starts in June, 2 day hybrid office requirement, and is 15 minutes from home. The question is, how do I actually make this transition? Do I do as much work as possible to offset my team having to essentially interview, hire and onboard someone new? When should I let my manager know? The priority is minimizing the impact my early departure could potentially have.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "I am currently in my last year of a Computer Science degree at a T10 public university and will be graduating this June after finishing the degree in three years. I am also minoring in Statistics and Management and have applied for a Master's program as a backup.\n\nAcademically, I have done well with a 3.7 GPA and I have never really struggled to understand CS concepts. With a few hours of focused studying, I can usually grasp everything and do well on exams. The issue has not been that the material is too hard. It is more about motivation and how I feel about the path I am on.\n\nAfter freshman year, where I honestly did not do much career wise, reality hit me in my second year. I felt like I had to catch up. I took on multiple research projects to make up for my lack of industry experience, built personal projects, constantly took 20 units a quarter along with some community college classes, and spent a lot of time grinding LeetCode. I really pushed myself because I thought that if I did everything right, the results would come.\n\nBut even after all that effort, I did not see the outcomes I expected in terms of internships or job offers. That gap between effort and results has been mentally exhausting. Over time, the constant grind with no clear payoff has worn me down, and I have lost the excitement I used to have for CS.\n\nI have realized that I do not hate problem solving. I still like thinking through ideas and solutions. I especially enjoy working with numbers and seeing patterns, which is why my Statistics and Management minor has felt more interesting recently. What I do not enjoy is the actual process of coding. Sitting and building things line by line feels draining, even though thinking about the solution at a higher level feels engaging.\n\nRight now I am not excited about more studying, more interview prep, or more side projects. I want to work and get real experience instead of staying in this cycle of preparation. Applying for a Master's was partly strategic because I have not landed a job yet, not purely because I am excited to keep studying.\n\nAt this point, I am trying to figure out if this loss of passion is just temporary burnout from overworking myself, or if my interests are actually shifting toward something more analytical or business focused rather than pure software engineering.\n\nI know I am just ranting and will probably just get flamed in the comments (please be nice)",

For the longest time I was quite against using AI to develop code because I wanted to enjoy the challenges, solve problems etc. I simply enjoy my job too much to want to delegate it away.\n\nAnd recently, I've been experimenting with some AIs (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) because as much as I enjoy my job, I don't want to fall behind. But my real, hands on experience was that AI was only really useful as a glorified autocomplete, generating boilerplate code, and maybe stuff like terraform skeleton code. It's good for things that are not a problem at all and that I can do quite fast myself anyway, but whenever I try to use AI to solve an actual problem/something I'm stuck on/something that requires logic, it always fails miserably. Trying to talk it into actually doing the work, and even pointing out the mistakes (and entering the, 'you're right, I'll fix that!' loop for ever), it makes me feel like a Sisyphus, and it never goes anywhere. Pretty much every single time I've attempted it, I was better off writing the code myself anyway.  \n\nBut everywhere I look, I see people about agentic ai, using ai in development and increasing the productivity 10x, etc. but in reality, these are never followed up with real life actual examples, it just feels like a cloud of buzzwords and people parroting what's currently popular. \n\n",

Obviously, job hunting is a numbers game, and there's a random element to it. But I genuinely haven't had a **single** organic interview during this entire period. Even some years ago, when I was unemployed for an extended period like this, I was still able to land an interview every month or so.\n\nFor context, I have over 6 years of professional experience and a background in React, JavaScript + TypeScript, Python, and more. These are, no doubt, heavily crowded tech stacks in the market right now. Additionally, I used the phrase \"organic interview\" earlier, since I did have a few interviews early in my job search, but only after reaching out to some old connections about openings at their companies. None of those interviews led to anything.\n\nThese past 8 months (with some breaks in between days/weeks), I've applied to over 600 openings and tried what feels like everything. I've rewritten my resume about 6 times, and at one point even hired a professional resume-writing service to tailor my resume to my background and target roles. But still nothing.\n\nI'm just so lost at this point in terms of what to do now. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd greatly appreciate it. So far I've tried:\n\n* Rewriting my resume multiple times, improving keyword targeting, human & ATS readability, and quantifiable career achievements.\n* Revamping my LinkedIn profile multiple times.\n* Optimizing my portfolio multiple times.\n* Applying to jobs on niche job boards and common job boards like Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor.\n* Applying to jobs at different times of the day and week.\n* Reaching out to CTOs, CEOs, or Hiring Managers of the companies I'm applying to.\n* Applying for jobs with salaries well below market value.\n* Using various filtering options to target jobs posted within minutes, hours, days, or at most weeks.",

HR and people involved feel good drafting a super demanding job posting requirement and process. I internally cringe when I compare it to what actually is the job.\n\nThe truth is no one wants to challenge it, my theory is it’s because in terms of optics. When leaders and execs say they hire senior only, it gives the impression that they are raising the bar, that they work on super hard problems, that the org super mature, etc... No one wants to say the truth that sometimes \"well actually what we work on here is not too hard, let's get a coachable hire we can invest in\". Last we tried we got shut down hard.\n\nWhat happens then, we eventually find someone senior enough that can pass the process, then they are underutilized, get frustrated and leave. Or they stay but invent problems and over engineer (and some important basic work does not get done).\n\nIn the recent job posting I worked on, we had to remove a line about how \"you will get to coach juniors\" because we literally don't have any now. The simple tasks haven't disappeared, it’s just that seniors are wasting time on them instead of juniors.\n\nFrustrated with this, can anyone relate?[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qwmnv8)",

It’s not a big prestigious company like amazon but im literally so happy and cannot complain.\n\nIm like one of the dumbest people I know so if I can do it, SO CAN YOU. DONT GIVE UP!! if you are still struggling to find an internship, here are some tips that helped me:\n\n* use linkedin to network but not for applying to jobs. they repost jobs and it’s just a waste of time because everyone is applying to those postings\n* surround yourself with ambitious friends. im so thankful that my friends are so smart and supportive because they helped me fix my resume, and seeing their success just motivates me to do better\n* in the job interview, you need to show some personality. lots of candidates focus too much on GETTING the interview but remember you also need to pass it, show that you are someone enjoyable to be around\n* try to find internships the moment they get posted, literally the day of. use github repos or stalk company sites directly\n* stay consistent and protect your mental health. I kept applying even when nothing was working, but I also made sure I had hobbies and friends outside of job hunting so rejections did not completely wreck me\n\nAt the end of the day, i think it’s just a game of luck.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m asking mostly out of curiosity and to get a sense of how things look from inside the industry today.\n\nI used to be a software developer in Seattle about ten years ago. I worked in the field for roughly two years before deciding to switch careers and move on to something else. I’ve been out of tech for a long time now, but I still loosely follow what’s going on. Watching the wave of layoffs since 2022, one thing I’ve been wondering about is whether they disproportionately affected people who entered tech through coding bootcamps during the 2015 to 2021 boom. Back when I was around, bootcamps were just starting to become a thing, and later they seemed to turn into a very common path into junior roles. From the outside, it feels like when hiring tightened, companies cut a lot of junior or surface level roles first. That made me wonder whether former bootcamp hires, especially career switchers with fewer years of deep experience, were more exposed compared to traditional CS grads or more senior engineers.\n\nI’m not trying to bash bootcamps or the people who went through them. I’m genuinely curious whether people inside companies noticed any real pattern during layoffs, or whether this is mostly selection bias and anecdotal noise.\n\nFor those who stayed in tech through the last few years, did layoffs feel credential blind, or were certain backgrounds more vulnerable? Did former bootcamp grads fare worse, better, or about the same as everyone else once the market contracted? Would really appreciate perspectives from engineers, hiring managers, or anyone who went through layoffs themselves.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nFormer software dev from Seattle, out of the industry for about 10 years. Curious whether the post-2022 layoffs hit former bootcamp hires harder than others, or if that’s just anecdotal.",

For those that have worked in huge tech companies, where scalability issues arise and where the company has an active engineering blog, how much was this experience worth more than, say, an average tech company with boring tech and average engineers and average crud software? I'm currently in the latter, and although  I feel I am learning, I'm not sure if I'm missing out on that big tech experience to do some serious \"good\" engineering with great processes and mentors. And I fear without actual expertise I might be on the way to be replaced. Am I making sense here? Or is big tech experience overhyped?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So a year ago I started at my first development job after a career change. I consider myself BLESSED to have found a role, and such a good one to get started in. The job is way chiller than I ever could have expected. I'm fully remote, on a team of five (with some very experienced people), On Call weekend once every ten weeks or so but it's generally very uneventful. Leadership is thoughtful, people get along, WLB is amazing (working hours are working hours, 4 weeks PTO, etc). It's really a genuinely great situation. \n\nThe bad is that the work isn't really challenging or interesting. We maintain probably 20-30 different legacy Java applications, frequently that just looks like small little feature or workflow changes, database work, or some kind of server script that needs to be done. We're in the process of modernizing them - but the vast majority (which truly are very simple boring CRUD workflows) are getting moved into a proprietary \"pro-code\" platform (a convuluted, absolute mess of a thing that uses java objects in a bizarre way) with the remaining 5-6 of them being rewritten as cloud native react apps. \n\nRight now, we're inbetween that. Theres a few developers that are staying pretty busy doing deep dives into a high impact java app that was originally written around 2006, but the rewrites haven't started yet and I find myself doing super low impact work and trying to \"look\" busy because theres just not much to do. For a while I was enjoying that - doing projects around the house or the yard but now I'm over that. I want to do something interesting and I have NO interest in taking part in the low code nonsense. I'm being underutilized. I also only get paid around 65k (LCOL area so whatever, but even the \"leads\" are barely pushing 100). \n\nIt seems obvious to look for something else but I work with awesome people, have a ton of free time, fully remote, AND good management? I'd hate to leave and go somewhere else thats miserable. \n\nBackground: 31, Career changer, went to an average state school after high school for accounting, proceeded to go work at a car dealership because I liked cars and hated taxes. Did pretty well, moved through the ranks, wanted to do something more intellectually challenging, went back to school (WGU don't flame me) to get a CS degree (honestly I was always a nerd who understood computers well and tinkered with stuff so I was more looking for the HR checkbox, I know it's not great though). Decent soft skills, better than a lot of my coworkers for sure, could probably do well at leetcode mediums if I gave it some effort, but no strong interest in relocating. Would consider myself competent and a strong employee but I'm probably never going to be the guy coding on the weekends because he just loves it that much. Have considered signing up for OMSCS to lose some of that wgu stigma and open up possibilities but with AI here it kind of feels like: why? ",

I felt purposeless, like I had a \"fake job,\" and struggled with the lack of structure (I’ve discussed this extensively in therapy).\n\n- Last Year: Worked a 1-year stint for a government contractor (hybrid).

But the contract folded over the summer due to budget cuts (DOGE), forcing me to find a new job quickly. Some other parts of the job didn't quite work...it was a far commute in particular.\n\n- Current Role (6 months): I joined a smaller \"boutique\" government contracting firm. It’s 100% remote, and the same bad feelings have returned. On top of the isolation, the environment is toxic, disorganized, and the codebase is chaotic. But after the shakeup last summer with contracting work, I felt desperate. \n\nI’m looking again and have landed 5 interviews, mostly focusing on in-person or hybrid roles.

They seem really modern, use Svelte and more prototyping stuff, but just the nature of it can't be remote. \n\nWhere I'm at rn, I mean...it's really not working out, and I have the experience to know and see these are some bad managers and work environment...even outside of it being remote. \n\nI feel at odds. My mental health and history tell me I need to be in the office (or at least hybrid) to feel purposeful and get out of the house. But now that it's becoming real, I’m worried I’m going to miss the freedom of remote work once it's gone.\n\nAlso planning to push for more money. I currently make around $170k TC. I'm gonna push more for $200k-$220k. Security clearance work and being only on-site, I think could justify it. They don't really know my situation that I don't like remote and could use it to my advantage I feel.\n\nI don't have an offer in-hand but...I can read the signs one of these 5 will come through at least.\n\nHas anyone else here realized they just can't do remote work? Did you regret going back to the office, or did the structure help you?",

        "author": "kyngslyr",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience, mostly working with .NET/C# and SQL. I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role, which means I’ve had exposure to architecture decisions, client calls, and owning delivery end to end.\n\nLately though, I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.\n\nI recently went through interviews with a US-led SaaS company, and they’ve communicated intent to extend an offer. The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role.\n\nFrom conversations with their engineering leadership, though, this doesn’t sound like a traditional ticket-only support job. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes. They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.\n\nWhat I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.\n\nThere’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.\n\nIf you’ve worked in product SaaS companies or made a similar move, how would you look at this? What would you watch for early on to tell whether it’s actually a stepping stone versus a dead end? Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?\n\nEDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.",

Because of my history with the company (basically rotating between teams in my department), I’ve had the chance to touch basically everything: Frontend, Backend, Databases, Devops pipelines, K8s/containers, Cloud infrastructure, AuthN/AuthZ, API gateways/reverse proxies, and Messaging (Pub/sub). I’ve become the \"jack of all trades\" in our department.\n\nManagement is now aggressively pushing me toward a Tech Lead/Lead developer role. They want me focused on unblocking other developers, guiding engineers, and handling the \"big picture\" stuff. This would drastically reduce my time \"in the trenches\" where I'm basically delegating the day to day stuff.\n\nThe issue is that I’m already losing my time to code. My typical day now includes: mentoring other junior developers/interns, discussing integration points with other systems, stakeholder meetings with my EM, sprint planning, and removing blockers for other engineers - for example, getting our authN/authZ infra setup or API routes design done so that implementation can begin on a new module.\n\nI’ve only been coding seriously for 5–6 years (including personal projects and my college degree) and only have \\~2 years of \"professional\" industry experience. I feel like it is **way too early** to stop being an Individual Contributor (IC). I want to experience being a \"Senior dev\" and build true deep technical expertise. Basically I foresee my career moving towards the \"IC\" path rather than the \"EM\" one.\n\nEven worse, I’m starting to feel anxious (like I'm not ready for this step up) and feel like a fraud. Because I’ve been a generalist, I look at our dedicated Backend engineers and realize they are better at their jobs than I am. They have depth I don't have in terms of programming and db design.\n\nHas anyone else been fast-tracked like this and am I right to think that \\~2 years of experience is too shallow for a Tech Lead role?",

        "content": "Hi, I'm a Cloud Data Engineer with 5 YOE, up until now my work has been quite traditional, i've worked with ETL and ELT, recently I even began my \"seniorship path\" by forming a couple new resources in the team and managing by my own several projects with a quite difficult stakeholder.\n\nEverything was (more or less) fine. The problem started recently, where my manager decided that I have to learn Business Intelligence, in particular how to make dashboard (a task that I hate and I'm really bad at since I have basically zero aesthetic sense), in order not to present my job to internal stakeholders, but to sell them outside the company (and this worries me A LOT, I spoke about this with my internal stakeholder and he seemed worried too).\n\nMy perception about why this did happen was that the head of data made some terrible choices that burned out the budget and now they have to find a way to save money (about 60% of the BI team left not being replaced recently).  They'll probably to sell this transition as a new way to intend the Data Engineering job, compliant with our target company model.\n\nNow I'll soon have to speak with my manager about this, I'll for sure tell him that I'm not ok with this, and that I expected to proceed in a more managerial path, rather than taking on more technical work, that I cannot do and I'm not brilliant with. But I fear that this won't make any changes. \n\nSo what would you do in my place?\n\nI thought about:\n\n1. Leaving the company (the market isn't as bad as in the US, so it's not out of questions, but i still would like to have an offer first)\n2. Take a step back and ask for part-time trying to use the free time to land some other job (perhaps freelance or something different)\n3. Go to HR, tell them that I'm not anymore happy with my position and see if there's something else available withing the company.\n4. Comply and see what happens (if they will fire me, they'll have to give me an exit bonus)\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nAs a Data Engineer forced to take on even Business Intelligence tasks due to corporate politics. I hate them and I suck at them. What would you do in my place?",

I don’t miss writing code itself. I don’t see myself continuing to write code in the long term.\n\nI want to work more with people, at a “zoom-out” level, have more influence on decision-making, work with stakeholders, etc.\n\nOn one hand, this sounds exactly like product management, but I’m worried about becoming a junior again in today’s tough market, and also about a potential pay cut (or at least not increasing my salary for the next few years).\n\nOn the other hand, there’s the team lead path, which is appealing because it preserves some technical involvement (at least at the design and architecture level) and usually comes with higher pay. But I’ve never managed people and don’t know how I’d be at it.\n\nI’d appreciate insights.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m 21 and recently graduated with a CS degree (perfect GPA, 4–5 solid projects, but no internship). I’ve been applying for about 4 months now and mostly getting rejections or ghosted. It’s been pretty discouraging and I’m honestly feeling burned out from coding and job hunting.\n\nRight now, I’m working a minimum wage job, but a family friend just offered me a store manager position. It pays $15/hour plus 25% of the store’s monthly profit (around $2k), and I can choose my hours. It would likely come out to around $4.5k–5k/month.\n\nThe downside is:\n\n\t•\tIt could be long hours (possibly 50–70/week)\n\n\t•\tIf I get a CS job later, it might be hard to leave immediately\n\n\t•\tI’m worried about getting “stuck” and drifting away from tech\n\nThe upside is:\n\n\t•\tMuch better pay than I make now\n\n\t•\tLess financial stress\n\n\t•\tTime to recover from burnout\n\n\t•\tManagement/business experience\n\nI’m torn between:\n\n\t1.\tTaking the job and using it as a temporary step while I recover and keep applying, or\n\n\t2.\tTurning it down and going all-in on CS job hunting, even though I’m mentally exhausted\n\nFor people who’ve been in similar situations:\n\n\t•\tIs taking this kind of job a smart move short-term?\n\n\t•\tHow risky is it for my long-term CS career?\n\n\t•\tAny advice on how to balance both?\n\nI’d really appreciate any perspective. Thanks in advance.",
