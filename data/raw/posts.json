        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI wasn't planning to share my article here. But Only this week, I had 3 conversations this week wit fairly senior data engineers who see AI as a thread. Here's what I usually see:\n\n* Annoyed because they have to support AI enigneers (yet feel unseen)\n* Affraid because don't know if they may lose their job in a restructure\n* Want to navigate in \"the new world\" and have no idea where to start\n\nHere's the essence, so you don't need to read the whole thing\n\nAI engineering is largely data engineering with new buzzwords and probabalistic transformations. Here's a quick map:\n\n* **LLM = The Logic Engine.** This is the component that processes the data.\n* **Prompt = The Input.** This is literally the query or the parameter you are feeding into the engine.\n* **Embeddings = The Feature.** This is classic feature engineering. You are taking unstructured text and turning it into a vector (a list of numbers) so the system can perform math on it.\n* **Vector Database = The Storage.** That's the indexing and storage layer for those feature vectors.\n* **RAG = The Context.** Retrieval step. You’re pulling relevant data to give the logic engine the context it needs to answer correctly.\n* **Agent = The System.** This is the orchestration layer. It’s what wraps the engine, the storage, and the inputs into a functional workflow.2\n\nDon't let the \"AI\" label intimidate you. The infrastructure challenges, are the same ones we’ve been dealing with for years. The names have just changed to make it sound more revolutionary than it actually is.\n\nI hope this will help so of you.",

        "author": "Likewise231",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’ve been in FAANG for about 5 years now, across multiple teams and orgs (new data teams, SDE-heavy teams, BI-heavy teams, large and small setups), and one thing that’s consistently surprised me is how little classic data modeling I’ve actually seen applied in practice.\n\nWhen I joined as a junior/intern, I expected things like proper dimensional modeling, careful handling of changing business meaning, SCD Type 2 being a common pattern, and shared dimensions that teams actually align on — but in reality most teams seem extremely execution-focused, with the job dominated by pipelines, orchestration, data quality, alerts, lineage, governance, security, and infra, while modeling and design feel like maybe 5–10% of the work at most.\n\nEven at senior levels, I’ve often found that concepts like “ensuring the business meaning of a column doesn’t silently change” or why SCD2 exists aren’t universally understood or consistently applied. In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).\n\nMy logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations. Curious what others think: have you seen the same pattern?",

I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.\n\nWhy am I potentially cooked?\n\nData stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. \n\nNow that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.\n\nI asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.\n\nI know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.\n\nI’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?\n\nTldr:\nAlmost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

( and I would be surprised if nobody faced this issue previously\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84e7n1hdghig1.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=db8862f6c28d797bb10553f07f9cf54b02849580\n\nI'm trying to implement this process where my client is airflow and my server an HTTP api that I exposed. this api can take a very long time to give a response ( like 1-2h) so the idea is for Airflow to send a request and acknowledge the server received it correcly. and once the server finished its task, it can callback an pre-defined url to continue the dag without blocking a worker in the meantime",

        "content": "Mine has evolved a bit over the last year. Today it’s a mix of newer faces alongside a couple of absolute bedrocks in data and analytics.  \n  \nApache Arrow  \nIt's the technology you didn’t even know you loved. It’s how Streamlit improved load speed, how DataFusion moves DataFrames around, and the memory model behind Polars. Now it has its own SQL protocol with Flight SQL and database drivers via ADBC. The idea of Arrow as the standard for data interoperability feels inevitable.  \n  \nDuckDB   \nI was so late to DuckDB that it’s a little embarrassing. At first, I thought it was mostly useful for data apps and lambda functions. Boy was I was wrong. The SQL syntax, the extensions, the ease of use, the seamless switch between in-memory and local persistence…and DuckLake. Like many before me, I fell for what DuckDB can do. It feels like magic.  \n  \nPostgres  \nI used to roll my eyes every time I read “Just use Postgres.” in the comments section. I had it pegged as a transactional database for software apps. After working with DuckLake, Supabase, and most recently ADBC, I get it now. Postgres can do almost anything, including serious analytics. As Mimoune Djouallah put it recently, “PostgreSQL is not an OLTP database, it’s a freaking data platform.”  \n  \nPython  \nWhere would analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, data platforms and AI engineering be without Python? Can you honestly imagine a data world where it doesn’t exist? I can’t. For that reason alone it will always have a spot on my Mount Rushmore. 4 EVA.  \n  \nI would be remiss if I didn't list these honorable mentions:  \n  \n\\* Apache Parquet  \n\\* Rust  \n\\* S3 / GCS  \n  \nThis was actually a fun exercise and a lot harder than it looks 🤪",

Majority of the services of Fabric are still not in GCC, so commercial was the choice of poc for us. But the transition of couple of lakehouses from Synapse to the Fabric was really painful. Also, the pricing model is very ambiguous. For example, if we need powerbi premium licenses, how Fabric handles that? \n\n\\- Lakehouse Explorer does not supportfor OneLake security RW permissions. RBAC also not mature for row level security.\n\n\\- Capacity based model lead to vety unpredictable costing, and Microsoft reps were unable to provide good answers,\n\nSo we are looking to Databricks, and Snowflake. I am very curious to know thought and experiences for you'll for these platforms. To my limited toe-dipping Databricks environments, it is very well suited for lakehouse. Snowflake, not so.

        "author": "wtfzambo",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# SOLVED: See solution a the bottom\n\nHello, I have been searching far and wide for a solution to my predicaments but I can't seem to figure it out, even with extensive help of AI.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nI have a skewed dataset representing 9 clients. One client is roughly 10x larger than the others. I’m trying to use `repartition` to shuffle data across nodes and balance the workload, but the execution remains bottlenecked on a single task.\n\n# Details:\n\nI'm running a simple extraction + load pipeline:\n\n`Read from DB -> add columns -> write to data lake.`\n\nThe data source is a bit peculiar: each client has its own independent database.\n\nThe large client's data consistently lands on a single node during all phases of the job. While other nodes finish their tasks very quickly, this one \"straggler\" task bottlenecks the entire job.\n\nI attempted to redistribute the data to spread the load, but nothing seems to trigger an even shuffle. I’ve tried:\n\n* Salting the keys.\n* Enabling Adaptive Query Execution (AQE).\n* `repartition(n, \"salt_column\")` , `repartition(n, \"client_id\", \"salt\")`.\n* `repartition(n)`\n\nSee picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo94vesrk2ig1.png?width=5030&format=png&auto=webp&s=399be044a1f8a3e9557553b97056141ed342b0b3\n\nIn very short pseudocode, here is what I'm doing:\n\n    data = []\n    \n    for db in db_list: # Reading from 9 independent source DBs\n        data.append(\n            spark.read.format(\"jdbc\").option(\"db\", \"table\").load()\n        )\n    \n    df_unioned = union_all(data)\n    df_unioned = df_unioned.sortWithinPartition(client_id)\n    \n    # This is where I'm stuck:\n    df_unioned = df_unioned.repartition(100, \"salt_column\")\n    \n    df_unioned.write.parquet(\"path/to/lake\")\n\nLooking at the Physical Plan, I've noticed there is no `Exchange` (Shuffle) happening before the write. Despite calling `repartition`, Spark is keeping the `numPartitions=1` from the JDBC scans all the way through the `Union`, resulting in a 'one-partition-per-client' bottleneck during the write phase.\n\nHelp me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope :(\n\nPS:\n\nA couple of extra points, maybe they're useful:\n\n\\- This data in specific is quite small, just a few gigabytes (i'm testing on a subset of the full data)\n\n\\- For the record, the repartition DOES happen: if I do \\`repartition(100)\\`, I will have 100 tiny files in the data lake. What doesn't happen is the shuffle between nodes or even cores.\n\n# Solution\n\nIt was AQE + a later query in the job causing this. This later query, which comes after writing out to data lake, does an aggregation on the \\`client\\_id\\`. Apparently, AQE understands this and goes \"instead of doing two shuffles (1 for repartitioning and another one to aggregate) I'm just gonna do zero since the data is already partitioned by \\`client\\_id\\`\".",

        "content": "Hi all, we’ve just open sourced Floecat: https://github.com/eng-floe/floecat\n\nFloecat is a catalog-of-catalogs that federates Iceberg and Delta catalogs and augments them with planner-grade metadata and statistics (histograms, MCVs, PK/FK relationships, etc.) to support cost-based SQL query planning.\n\nIt exposes an Iceberg REST Catalog API, so engines like Trino and DuckDB can use it as a single canonical catalog in front of multiple upstream Iceberg catalogs.\n\nWe built Floecat because existing lakehouse catalogs focus on metadata mutation, not metadata consumption. For our own SQL engine (Floe), we needed stable, reusable statistics and relational metadata to support predictable planning over Iceberg and Delta. Floe will be available later this year, but Floecat is designed to be engine-agnostic.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, I wrote more about the motivation and design here: https://floedb.ai/blog/introducing-floecat-a-catalog-of-catalogs-for-the-modern-lakehouse\n\nFeedback is very welcome, especially from folks who’ve struggled with planning, stats, or metadata across multiple lakehouse catalogs.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm the CTO at Floe.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "> Disclaimer: I currently work at LanceDB and have been a member of Lance's and Hugging Face's open source communities for several years.\n\nRecently, Lance became an [officially supported format](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-x-huggingface-a-new-era-of-sharing-multimodal-data/) on the Hugging Face Hub. Lance is an open source, modern, columnar lakehouse format for AI/ML datasets that include multimodal data, embeddings, nested fields, and more. LanceDB is an open source, embedded library that exposes convenient APIs on top of the Lance format to manage embeddings and indices.\n\nCheck out the latest Lance datasets uploaded by the awesome OSS community here:\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance\n\nWhat the Hugging Face integration means in practice for Lance format and LanceDB users on the Hub:\n- Binary assets (images, audio, videos) stored inline as blobs: No external files and pointers to manage\n- Efficient columnar access: Directly stream metadata from the Hub without touching heavier data (like videos) for fast exploration\n- Prebuilt indices can be shared alongside the data: Vector/FTS/scalar indices are packaged with the dataset, so no need to redo the work already done by others\n- Fast random access and scans: Lance format specializes in blazing fast random access (helps with vector search and data shuffles for training). It does so without compromising scan performance, so your large analytical queries can be run on traditional tabular data using engines like DuckDB, Spark, Ray, Trino, etc.\n\nEarlier, to share large multimodal datasets, you had to store multiple directories with binary assets + pointer URLs to the large blobs in your Parquet tables on the Hub. Once downloaded, as a user, you'd have had to recreate any vector/FTS indices on your local machine, which can be an expensive process.\n\nNow, with Lance officially supported as a format on the Hub, you can package all your datasets along with their indices as a single, shareable artifact, with familiar table semantics that work with your favourite query engine. Reuse others' work, and prepare your models for training, search and analytics/RAG with ease!\n\nIt's very exciting to see the variety of Lance datasets that people [have uploaded](https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance) already on the HF Hub, feel free to share your own, and spread the word!",

This post may be long because I am asking a more open-ended question.  \n  \nI am a recent computer science graduate who started working for a large non-profit organization which is reliant upon an old, very complex, ERP system (say... a few hundred tables, hundreds of millions of records). \n\nThey don't provide an API, integrations are done by directly touching the database. Each one was developed ad-hoc, as the need arose over the last 2 decades. There is some code sharing but not always. 2 integrations which ostensibly provide the same information may have small divergences in exactly how they touch the database. They are written in a mix of C# and SQL stored procedures/functions. \n\nMany of these are very complex. Stored procedures call stored procedures and inserting an entity may wind up touching 30+ tables. A lot of the time, it's required. The ERP manages finances, staff, business operations; there is a lot of conditional logic to determine what to insert, update, delete, etc.. \n\nAre there any tools or techniques that could be useful here? I'm comfortable programming, but if a tool can do a job better and more efficiently, I'd rather use it. ",

        "content": "If I run a query like ``df2 = df.groupBy(\"Country\").count()``, does running ``.repartition(\"Country\")`` before the groupBy make the query faster? AI is giving contradictory answers on this so I decided to ask Reddit.\n\nThe book written by the creators of Spark (\"Spark: The Definitive Guide\") say that there are not too many ways to optimize an aggregation:\n\n>For the most part, there are not too many ways that you can optimize specific aggregations\nbeyond filtering data before the aggregation having a sufficiently high number\nof partitions. However, if you’re using RDDs, controlling exactly how these aggregations\nare performed (e.g., using reduceByKey when possible over groupByKey) can be\nvery helpful and improve the speed and stability of your code.\n\nThe way this was worded leads me to believe that a repartition (or bucketBy, or partitionBy on the physical storage) will not speed up a groupBy.\n\nThis, I don't understand however. If I have a country column in a table that can take one of five values, and each country is in a seperate partition, then Spark will simply count the number of records in each partition without having to do a shuffle. This leads me to believe that repartition (or partitionBy, if you want to do it on the hard disk) will almost always speed up a groupby. So why do the authors say that there aren't many ways to optimize an aggregation? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I'm of course implying that in an actual production environment you would run the .groupBy after the .repartition more than once. Otherwise, if you run a single .groupBy query, you're just moving the shuffle one step above.",

An alternative design (suggested by an LLM during architecture exploration) is letting every node connect directly to Redis for hot-path data (sessions, quotas, counters) and use it as the shared state layer, skipping the API hop. -- i didn't like the idea too much but the LLM kept defending it every time so maybe i am missin something!?! \n\nI’m trying to decide which pattern is more appropriate in practice for systems like gateways/proxies/workers: direct datastore access from each node, or API-mediated access only.\n\nWould like feedback from people who’ve run distributed production systems.",

The lineage extraction goes deep, not just stopping at the column level but extending to nested struct field access and array element access. It also accounts for [both inputs and side inputs](https://github.com/lpraat/inbq?tab=readme-ov-file#concepts).\n\nYou can use inbq as a [Python library,](https://pypi.org/project/inbq/) [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/inbq), or via its [CLI](http://github.com/lpraat/inbq?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line-interface).\n\nFeedbacks, feature requests, and contributions are welcome!",

        "content": "Segment data export contains most of the latest data, but also a long tail of older data spanning ~6 months. Downstream users query Segment with event date filter, so it’s the ideal partitioning key to prune the maximum amount of data.\nWe ingest data into Iceberg hourly. This is a read-heavy dataset, and we perform Iceberg maintenance daily. However, the rewrite data operation on a 1–10 TB Parquet Iceberg table with thousands of columns is extremely slow, as it ends up touching nearly 500 partitions. There could also be other bottlenecks involved apart from S3 I/O.\nHas anyone worked on something similar or faced this issue before?",

Ive finally managed to land a role on industrial automation and grabbed my first databricks project and finally got my first job as a data engineer at a big 4.\n\n\nHeres the thing, I feel like I overpaid a ton for this. Something feels off and i dont understand. I just think how i created this monetary burden and massive time sink moving to HCOL, paying the degrees, studying for them, etc. And the worst thing is that pay isnt even decent, i just undersold myself to finslly get the foot on the door (officially).\n\n\nIm really confused why I feel anhedonia. Right now it feels like the cost i paid was too high and it was not a good decision. Yes I very much like this, but the level of emocional and financial anxiety is cancelling whatever joy I might have from finally being a data engineer. I would like to have a family, house and financial stability and ive got nothing done. Ive been chasing my dream job for the least 3 years lol.

        "content": "Most data engineering stacks are optimised for batch and scale. That’s fine until you actually need low-latency analytics, live dashboards, or fast iteration on streaming data - then you’re suddenly standing up Flink, renting beefy cloud instances, or duct-taping together tools that were never designed for the job. Even worse - you go to push it into Databricks that you are paying 20k a month for and it doesn’t really stream. Mate.\n\nI kept running into this, so I’ve been building [Minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow) \\- a fast, minimal columnar data library that’s wire-compatible with Apache Arrow but purpose-built to run efficiently on a single machine.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Core data building block paired with “*SIMD-Kernels*” crate -> delivers sub-second aggregations on laptop-class hardware - no cluster, no JVM/Java OOM, no orchestrator\n* Drives live dashboards directly from streaming data without an intermediate warehouse or materialised view layer (you and/or your mate Claude still need to wire it up yourself)\n* Converts to Arrow, Polars, or PyArrow at the boundary via zero-copy, so it slots into existing ecosystems without serialisation overhead *(.to\\\\\\_polars() in Rust)*\n* Pairs with a companion crate (*Lightstream*) if you want to push results straight to the browser over WebSocket\n\n**Where it fits** *(and where it doesn’t):*\n\nThis sits at pipeline as code, or the engine-internals level. It’s a building block for engineers who are comfortable constructing pipelines and systems, not a plug-and-play BI tool. If your workload is distributed and you genuinely need horizontal scale, keep using Spark/Flink - Minarrow won’t replace that.\n\nBut if you’re in the zone - and prefer compiling for performance, and working with the blocks you need, this is the layer I wanted to exist and couldn’t find.\n\nHappy to answer questions, take criticism, or hear what you feel you’ve actually been missing in your stack.\n\nAlso, if you’ve focused more on the Python side happy to help point you into Rust land.\n\nThanks for checking it out.",

        "content": "Hi. Question about production access. Does your organization allow users/developers who are not admins or in IT access to run their pipelines in production? Meaning they developed it but maybe IT provided the platform such as Airflow, nifi, etc. To run it.  If they can’t run it do they have production access but just more restricted? Like read access so that they can debug why a pipeline failed and push changes without have to ask someone to send them the logs for them to see what happened.\n\nI’m asking this since right now I’m in an org where there are a few platforms but the two biggest don’t allow anyone outside their 2-5 person teams access to it. Essentially developers are expected to build pipelines and hand them off and that’s it. No view into prod anything.   The reasoning by those admins is that developers don’t need to see prod and it’s keeps their environment secure. They will monitor and notify us if something goes wrong.  I think this is dumb honestly as in my opinion that if you can’t grant people production access and keep it secure at the same time your environment is not as good as you think.  I also think that developers need prod access if they are an engineer. At minimum I think they should have read access so that they can easy see how their pipelines are performing and debug if needed.  The environments and nifi and ssis for the record and this isn’t a post to bash them so I’m only saying that for context. I don’t care what the platform is per se but just the workflow in general.\n\nHow does your organization work? Am I missing a reason why developers should not have prod access to if they are required to build and debug pipelines?",

I am losing rows because of some unknown reason and I don't know how to debug it.\n\nMy dataset is large it's about lol esports matches and I decided that my fact table will be player stats. on the picture you can see two dimensions Role and League. Role is a table I filled by hand (it's not extracted data). Essentially each row in my dataset is a match that has the names of 10 players, the column names are called lik redTop blueMiddle, red and blue being the team side and top middle etc being the role. so what I did is I split each row into 10 rows essentially, for each player. What I don't get is why this happens, when I look at the role table the correct values are there. I noticed that it isn't that random roles are missing, there is no sup(support) role and jun(jungle) in the database.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gc9iajtp3ig1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc0afb7e5a6224460e5e72a6a9da9e6e83535c4b\n\nAny help would be appreciated\n\nedit: because of some commenters requests here is the workflow:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vnau3ms8g4ig1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c1f1f69dc878b97cf8b9bad8cf7fc02bf6c2897\n\ni drew where the problem is essentially with rough estimates of the rows",

The fact that people are saying that \"Programming is dead\" infruits me so much.\n\nAnd AI can't even code to save it's life. It spits out nonsense inefficient code that doesn't even work half the time.\n\nMost students in my university do not have any programming skills. They just rely on LLMs to write code for them.

The first thing I noticed is that most softwares we see are built on top of open source tools that have been made by thousands of developers world wide example: Linux, Database Management Systems, Frameworks so most devs work on business logic on top of this software.\n\nWhat is important for any programmer are fundamentals when you understand some commonly used fundamentals like: data types, variables, conditions statements, loops, collections, functions, data structure and OOP are enough for expressing logic. \n\nBefore writing and following syntax I basically think a good programmer understands something in a very high level way instructions, also how the full flow works without touching the syntax. Then, the last part is translating high level written instructions into syntax based on a certain language.\n\nThis is based on my opinion and how I have been coding also being language agonistic by ensuring that logic comes first before anything else. \n\nMay be, some experienced devs may correct or share thoughts on this but this is basically based on what I have experienced throughout my programming journey.",

        "author": "UsefulExplanation131",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey, everyone. Im really hoping to get outside perspectives on some difficulties ive been experiencing while learning to program. I keep experiencing burn out and exhaustion over and over again and I can’t figure out why it keeps happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore and just can’t think clearly about my situation anymore. \n\n\n\nHere is some background:\n\n  \n\n\nRough timeline of my programming journey: August 2022- I begin working through TOP curriculum with the goal of seeing if i enjoy programming. I decide that i do enjoy it -> Feb 2024 - I physically and mentally burn out from my job as a delivery driver. Managing my job, programming, and therapy was too much and I quit after i got injured while working.  March 2024- after spending a year going from 45 mins of studying/week to 10 hours/week, a mental health crisis, and 1 month after quitting my job, i complete the foundations module of TOP -> Nov or Dec 2024 - I take advantage of being unemployed and living off savings to focus hard on programming. I build up to studying 25-30 hours/week consistently. I realize I don’t like front end stuff. I choose the js path on TOP, skip the “advanced html/css” and “react section,” but complete everything else up to the file uploader project of the “NodeJS” section. Around December i take a small break to focus on an art project, and that snowballed to a few months of no programming (though i think that would’ve happened regardless if i took a break or not). -> Feb 2026 - the past year and few months were a blur of trying so hard to build back the habit of programming as well as i did the first time. I spend some months completely dreading programming and unable to start and some months of still struggling, but able to at least show up mostly consistently. I follow a pattern of on for 2-3 months to off for 2-3 months. After i learn I don’t like front end stuff and realize that endlessly building endpoints was equally dreadful, i decide to focus on other backend topics and keep finding myself bouncing around. I spend a few months on [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) then burn out. I go to nand2tetris to switch things up, last a month, then burn out. I decide to learn C from “C programming: a modern approach,” to switch things up again, and actually have some fun, but things fizzle out again. Every attempt leaves me broken and exhausted. At this point, I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to restart. The feelings that kept me going during my most consistent periods of study, feeling like im improving and growing as a person and programmer, the satisfaction and euphoria of solving some problem that I genuinely believed i could not solve, just have been completely absent for so long. \n\n\n\nDuring all of this, ive been working hard in therapy to resolve a lot of things including social anxiety. I bring this up because i have bad social anxiety that prevents me from going to local programming meetups, participating in online programming communities, and applying for jobs. Going at this mostly alone just adds another layer of complexity to it all. Ive made a lot of progress on that front but still have a ways to go. \n\n\n\nI haven’t programmed in a couple months now and its like no amount of time away makes me dread programming any less. I feel spiritually broken. Im too close to my situation to think objectively anymore. What do y’all think i could do differently? Why does programming keep becoming this thing that i dread? Am i focusing on studying too much and not spending enough time making projects? For me, the hardest part about this whole journey (and ive realized this applies to many, maybe most, endeavors) hasn’t even been the intellectual side of things. That’s hard, sure, but by far the hardest part has been the emotional side of things. Specifically, having to find a way to program consistently over time. That’s the aspect of all of this that is the most soul crushing. It was hard to get yourself to program today, and guess what? You have to do it all over again tomorrow. And the day after. Maybe not every single day, but most weeks, most months. How do y’all not get overwhelmed with this? I think i do a decent job of focusing only on the short term but the big picture and the stakes are always on the back of my mind. I do find enjoyment in solving some programming problems, but I can’t deny that I wouldn’t be pursuing this if it wasn’t a well paying career that doesn’t require a degree. Which is the reason why i even decided to see if i enjoy programming and why i still pursue it after all this struggle. Every job ive had up to this point has been low skilled work. Server, cook, cashier, delivery driver, etc. I’m almost 25 and i want and need to get a career going. I can’t keep living the life that ive been living and programming seems to be a good enough fit. It’s intellectually challenging, doesn’t require a degree, well paying, and i find a lot of it enjoyable (even if there are a lot of things i find tedious and annoyingly boring).\n\n\n\nThat being said, i do have ideas that get me excited and could be solved using code. Some of my programming project ideas include:\n\n* Something similar to GitHub but for digital artists to save snapshots of their artwork. \n* Data management system for iot devices. Inspiration came from thinking about how massive amounts of data from telescopes are efficiently stored and organized\n* A tool that takes a 3D model and allows you to see the cross section along the axial planes\n* A massive library of artworks that pulls artwork from the online catalogs of museums and other collection websites\n\nI can’t help but feel like i am not ready for any of these projects and that I need to keep studying and learning before i can attempt any of them. That was part of the inspiration to learn c, to better learn how databases work by making a simple database since these are all data intensive projects. \n\nAnyway, if anyone has anything to share about what I could do better, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading, ill stop yapping now\n\n  \n",

Or it's just managed by pointers? \n\n3. How is an instance of a class that has no methods in it different from a struct type variable? \n\n4. How is a method different from a function that does some operations based on different values of its properties? ",

There is also an \"harder\" version of it where you need to print 2 pyramids. you know, the beginner level stuffs..\n\nsince i dont have prior syntax knowledge i asked AI to generate me a code in order to check it, study it and understand it. and after i did it, i felt everything was clear, i knew what every line did and why. NICE RIGHT?\n\n\\#\n\n\\##\n\n\\###\n\n\\####\n\nwhen it came part 2 i decided to imperatively not use AI and only using my knowledge acquired from the first exercise to complete it.\n\nthis time the first of the two pyramid had to be reversed, so with blank spaces before the \"#\" symbols. Like this:\n\n\\#\n\n\\##\n\n  \\###\n\n\\####\n\nSo how do you reverse a pyramid? by starting printing spaces instead of ashes right ? perfect. This concept was pretty obvious and clear in my mind, as it should be, but the application? impossible. I could't \"invent\" a way to do it. I just lacked the creativity, even if i had all the starting points in front of me.\n\nThe formula to print the ashes was the same exact formula for basically all the other operations in the program:\n\nfor (int s = 0; s < height - i; s++)  \n{  \nprintf(\"  \")  \n}\n\nthe only difference here is that im subtracting the variable (i) from the (height), because as the height increases i should also decrease the number of spaces. Perfect, logic and it works...BUT I COULDNT INVENT IT MYSELF!!!  \ni totally lacked the creativity to think about subtracting (i) from (height) in order to solve my problem...i knew about the base formula and what it did, but i couldn't modify myself and understand what to do\n\nI HAD TO LOOK AT THE SOLUTION IN ORDER TO UNDERSTED WHAT TO DO.\n\nthis is the very first set of exercises, this is the base.

Its some poorly made AI system that gives you a basic ass task like \"Print hello world 10 times\" despite being at chapters like HashMaps etc.\n\n\\- There are numerous lessons where they do not actually explain to you what the desired output needs to be (given, you can see that by clicking the \"expected output\" toggle - but you should be able to see exactly what you need to do from the challenge description. \n\n\\- This last point goes hand in hand with the issue that the output needs to be exact. They had one extra space at the end of their output, despite not showing that because you're tasked with printing the result of each itteration on a new line anyway? Instantly lose the \"first try\" challenge.\n\n\\- Courses aren't even finished. I started the Python and Java course at the same time, hoping to refresh my python knowledge and picking up Java at the same time. Java's whole point is to be an OOP-language. Guess what: Section 3 \"Object oriented Programming\" is \"Coming Soon\"™. What the actual fu\\*\\*?\n\n\\- The website is clearly built around just monetizing everything as agressively as possible. I got lucky and was able to use a discount code during November to get 30% off monthly subscriptions so it was \"only\" 14.95 a month. Still: I do not feel like that value is really justified. The website has a lot of AI-Slop and wannabe intelligent assistance systems that either fail, timeout (I now know this is a firebase website because the website is printing firebase errors everywhere on every fuc\\*\\*\\* interaction) and lots of lessons are very, very poorly worded.\n\nThis could've been a 8.5/10 rating but as it stands, I'd say coddy is at best a 4/10 and you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nTo their credit: They recently updated their Quizz section which made it less buggy and a lot more interactive.",

        "title": "Coupling data with behaviour considered harmful",
        "author": "Achereto",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've seen a couple of posts by people new to programming struggling with understanding OOP and people in the responses making claims about the benefits of OOP. I want to give a bit of a different perspective on it, having written OO code for over 15 years and moving away from it over the last 2-3 years.\n\nThe core idea of OO is to model things analogue to the real world. So for example a `Datetime` object would represent a specific date and time, and everything related to that (like adding a second or minute) would be implemented by the object. It would also allow you to compare dates in an expressive way. Some languages allow you to have something like `if (today < tomorrow)`, or calculate the difference using `one_day := tomorrow - today` which is neat. \n\n**This approach couples data with behaviour.** If you need to add behaviour to a class and you don't own the class, you can't just add the behaviour to the class, and if the fields of the class are private you also can't easily access them from the subclass. So you're already facing a design problem. Yes, people have thought about it and found solutions but the key is that the coupling of data and behaviour *created* the design problem that had to be solved. With structs and functions you could just write a new function and would be done. No design problem in the first place.\n\nBut the problem becomes worse: With objects acting on their own behalf you lose the efficiency of [iterating over data and modifying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVbI1HIzCE). For every update on an object, you have to call a method and create significant computation overhead (and no, the compiler usually can't optimize this away).\n\nIn fact, the problems created by coupling data to behaviour (like classes do) has become such a pain for developers that we started teaching \"Composition over Inheritance\". In simple terms this means that an object (containing data) shouldn't implement its own behaviour any more, but instead provide placeholders for other objects that implement specific behavior can be used by the original object, effectively decoupling data from behaviour again (undoing OO). One of the better talks explaining this principle is [Nothing is Something by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) from ~10 years ago. In her example in the second half of her talk you can see that the `House` class is stripped down to data and placeholders for behaviour, giving her the maximum flexibility for new features.\n\nTo reiterate: **OOP couples data with behaviour. The design problems arising from this are best solved by decoupling data from behaviour again**\n\nIf you need more convincing data, then you can look at all the [OOP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). 13 of those 22 patterns (including the most useful ones) are actually separating data from behaviour, 3 are debatable if they do (Composite, Facade, Proxy) and only 6 (Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Flyweight, Memento, Observer) aren't about separating data from behaviour.\n\nIf coupling data with behaviour is the root problem for many design problems in programming and the solutions people come up with are different ways to decouple data from behaviour again, then you should clearly avoid coupling them in the first place to avoid all of these problems.\n\nSo what should you learn instead of OO? I would say that Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a good start as they seems to continue emerging as a solution to most design problems. Even \"Composition over Inheritance\" is already a step towards ECS. ECS have become more popular of the last years with both Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine switching to it. There is a fantastic video about the [ECS in Hytale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglU107_DA4) as well, explaining how this makes modding extremely easy. More upcoming companies will do ECS in the next years and learning it now will put you in an advantage in the hiring processes. \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk. :)\n\n(ps: not sure if \"Tutorial\" is the right Flair because I don't actually show code, but it may be the best fit for explaining a concept and its downsides)",

I did everything backwards:\n\n1. Started with migration, then model\n2. Realized I was missing stuff but wanted to commit as a \"checkpoint\"\n3. Accidentally merged into main instead of keeping it in my branch\n4. Senior dev got frustrated, said \"these are basics you should already know\" and \"we'll let you learn but this is really basic stuff\"\n\nLater I realized I should've planned the static layout and component architecture FIRST, but ran out of time.\n\n**My actual skill level:** Honestly, I oversold myself a bit on my CV. I claimed \"knowledge of HTML/CSS\" but today I confused `<head>` with `<header>`. I've learned mostly theory at university but almost zero practical workflow stuff (Git branching strategies, component architecture, etc.)\n\n**My mental state:** I was laughing at myself because honestly, I felt stupid. But I'm also scared. I don't want to feel overwhelming anxiety or cry about this. Part of me thinks \"I'll just wait and see if they fire me\" but I also don't want to give up without trying.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is it normal to mess up this badly in your first week?\n2. How do I learn fast enough without annoying my senior dev with \"basic\" questions?\n3. Should I come clean about my actual skill level?\n4. What resources would you recommend for someone in my situation?\n5. Is this setup (no docs, no methodology, small team) a red flag or normal for smaller operations?\n\nI know 3 months is when people usually evaluate juniors, but this is DAY 5 and I'm already panicking.

        "content": "So I have been learning computer science in college and getting specialized in web development just so I can get a better chance of landing an entry level job and I ran across something that I have been confused about. So in my understanding from my CS courses, an array is a contiguous composite data structure which holds *homogeneous* values which are ordered with an index. However in JS, arrays are composite data structures which hold *heterogeneous* values and are ordered with an index. Would an array in JS be closer to a record as far as data structures go or am I putting the cart before the horse in the importance of the allowance of more than one data structure? Is it more important that arrays are index-based by their definition more than it is important that they are homogeneous? \n\nAny and all help would be great, thanks!!",

Studying abroad is expensive, and while I still receive financial support for now, that support won’t last forever. In the future, I’ll need to fully support myself.\n\nI’ve already completed 3 out of 6 semesters. For the remaining 3, my tuition and basic living expenses are covered, but not comfortably. That’s why I want to start preparing now instead of waiting until graduation and regretting it later.\n\nMy course includes things like:\n\n* Algorithms & Data Structures\n* OOP\n* Operating Systems\n* Networking\n* Databases\n* Web Development\n* Software Engineering\n* AI / Machine Learning / Data Science\n\nRight now, I’m not desperate for money, so my goal isn’t quick cash. My goal is to **build a real, valuable skill** that can support me long-term and make me employable internationally.\n\nI’m ready to put in serious effort, not just watch tutorials. I want to actually build things and become useful.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* If you were in my position, what skill path would you focus on?\n* Software engineering, data/AI, backend, automation, something else?\n* What would you spend the next 6–12 months learning?\n* What mistakes should I avoid as a student trying to become independent?\n\nI’d really appreciate honest advice from people who’ve been through this or are already working in tech.\n\nThanks in advance.",

The camera will be external, not mounted on the robot, and will be overlooking the arena from above to see the entire field.\n\nAnd here's my question: Is it possible to determine in real time where the opponent robot's front and back sides are? Also, can a \"friend-or-foe\" system be implemented so that my robot can recognize itself?\n\nI should add that I have NEVER worked with CV before and am just studying the material for now. I have a whole year of study ahead of me, so I think I'll have enough time.\n\nI also want to clarify that I will be doing all this in C++.",

        "title": "Where should I start with learning to write code for VSTs and for music hardware?",
        "author": "reduke2",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "A bit of a niche question, but I'm hoping someone in the community could help me out with this, since I'm finding a scarce amount of resources online regarding this topic. I'm a bachelor of music student and my main focus has been in emerging music technology for a long time, but it was only recently when I took an elective course in Pure Data that my mind was opened to the possibilities of creating my own VSTs, and it wasn't until even more recently that my roommate/bandmate suggested that he use his electrical engineering course to good use and we make music hardware together. Naturally, I love this idea, and we've been conceptualising a few admittedly ambitious ideas for boutique guitar pedals, synthesizers and other music hardware that we'd love to use ourselves, but now that he's started his EE course, I'm at a position where I really do have to start locking in and learning the relevant programming. I'm aware it'll take years before we're both skilled enough to create anything close to the ideas that we have now, but I figure it's never too early to start learning now.\n\n  \nFor VSTs in particular, I know the JUCE framework for C++ is the standard, and I've found a decent amount of resources on that, so I'm not too worried about it. My bigger question regards the hardware side of things. Which microcontrollers are standard for pedals, eurorack modules, synthesizers, etc, or does it depend more on processing power and other factors i'm not yet aware of? Is C++ a good language to know or should I also think about branching out and learning other languages instead? How does one even write code for microcontrollers and make it interact with the electronic components on the PCB? Are these stupid questions?\n\n  \nAs you can tell, I am truly lost in the dark here as I haven't an ounce of programming experience (outside of pure data and briefly learning GML when I was younger) but I know I can learn it, I just desperately need to know where to start, where to find resources, who to talk to, and what I should focus on learning now. Thank you very much in advance!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Before I start my rant, I want to say I use AI everyday. I use it for:\n\n1. Understanding a concept/service. Why is it designed in a particular way and verifying the sources (not all the time, only when I am skeptical of the answers).\n2. Understanding a piece of code from a language I am not familiar with. Asking the LLM to explain each line.\n3. Asking the agent to edit a specific function in an unfamiliar language to do a certain thing and asking the agent to explain line by line.\n4. Writing unit tests.\n5. Pros/Cons of a system design approach. \n6. Fixing the grammatical mistakes that I make while writing something or asking it to rewrite certain sentences which are harder for audiences to grasp.\n\nThe ability of an LLM to do all of the above is big win and a big productivity boost for me. I am still amazed by the capabilities of an LLM to do all the above. \n\nHowever, I am somewhat disappointed and puzzled by the upper management push to not write code at all and delegate the writing part to AI agents. When we wrote code line by line, it gave us the ability to understand the software that we are building in a fundamental level. The friction we had when writing code, helped us to develop critical thinking and helped develop the debugging skills (the golden egg the management got over time). If we delegate this work to AI, are we not going to lose this skill eventually ? When things go wrong, the senior management is going to ask the engineers to fix the issue not an LLM. The engineer has to have atleast some mental model of how the code works. Isn't it too late and expensive to rewrite things when a production issue happens ?\n\nFinally, how are software engineers going to create novel libraries/services if they don’t write code and understand the underlying behavior. Are we sure that the engineers can create a library like React if they have not written HTML/JS by hand in years. \n\nI want to know your thoughts and hear opposing view points. I am of the opinion that an LLM can make me 1.2x faster not 10x faster. This is a conversation I have been having internally with me and many of my colleagues (who are very smart than me) did not reciprocate the same feelings. I want to know where I am going wrong.",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m working on a small app project and trying to understand how the app “WhoLiked” is able to access and display users’ liked TikTok videos.\n\nAccording to TikTok’s public documentation, access to liked videos is restricted to the Research API, which is limited to non-commercial, non-profit use. Monetization is not allowed under these terms.\n\nHowever, “WhoLiked” appears to offer this functionality in a consumer app with in-app purchases, without requiring users to manually export and upload their data.\n\nFrom a technical and compliance perspective, I’m wondering:\n\n* How could “WhoLiked” technically access this data?\n* Are there any officially supported ways to implement this use case?\n* If not, does this likely involve methods that violate TikTok’s API terms or privacy policies?\n\nI’m trying to build an app that follows platform rules and avoids legal, account, or app store risks, so I’d appreciate insights from developers who have experience with similar integrations.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "The situation is the following: both my parents are retired, and because they have neither hobbies nor social life, they spend most of their time at home watching the news. Due to this I noticed a deterioration lately in their mental health and mood. \n\nI thought I could download some of the series they used to watch time ago, store them in a USB and connect it to the TV so they can watch that instead of the news all the time. My parents are old and they would not know how to navigate through Netflix or other platforms, so I‘d have to do it this way.\n\nWhat I would like, and here is my question for you, is a file in the USB that randomly plays any video file in the USB. My parents basically use the TV as background noise so they wouldn’t care about what’s playing or follow the episodes in a given order. I want a file that they click on it and it plays whatever in the USB stick, and I need it to be random so it doesn’t always play the same episode first. I also need it to play episodes non-stop, so that they don’t need to click on the file after every episode.\n\nI have some knowledge in Python and bash, so if you give me a hint on what kind of file could do such a thing maybe I can write it on my own. \n\nThe approach I can think of is the following; when I click on this file it will:\n- Collect all the file names in the USB (or the ones with a video format).\n- Sort them on a random order.\n- Grab the first 20 files on the list.\n- Play this 20 episodes as a playlist.\n\nOn a computer I could write it so that VLC plays this list of files, but on a TV I don’t know how it could be done. It’s also not a Smart TV, so I cable install apps. ",

Intuitively, I would think so but I am also very capable on not thinking.\n\nLater, I add each node to a map whilst also calculating the total song files under each folder.\n\n    private fun computeTotal(node: FileNode, localNodeIndex: MutableMap<String, FileNode>) {\n        if (!node.isFolder) {\n            node.musicTotal = 1\n            node.durationTotal = node.song?.duration ?: 0\n            node.albumId = node.song?.albumId ?: 0L\n            localNodeIndex[node.absolutePath] = node\n            return\n        }\n    \n        var count = 0\n        var duration = 0L\n        var albumId: Long? = null\n    \n        node.children.values.forEach { child ->\n            computeTotal(child, localNodeIndex)\n            count += child.musicTotal\n            duration += child.durationTotal\n            if (albumId == null && child.albumId != 0L) albumId = child.albumId\n        }\n    \n        node.musicTotal = count\n        node.durationTotal = duration\n        node.albumId = albumId ?: 0L\n    \n        localNodeIndex[node.absolutePath] = node\n    }\n\nWould this map: localNodeIndex be sorted (by absolutePath)? Again intuitively I believe so, especially if the tree is sorted, but I am not fully certain.\n\nI also wish to get all the song file paths under a certain folder (given that folder's node) and currently I do this by using a sorted list of the paths, binary searching for the folder, using the index of the insertion point + musicTotal to sublist from the song path list (I do check if the boundary paths begin with the folder path).\n\nBinary search function \n\n    fun <T> List<T>.findFirstIndex(curPath: String, selector: (T) -> String): Int {\n        return binarySearch(this, 0, this.size, curPath, selector)\n    }\n\n    @Suppress(\"SameParameterValue\")\n    private inline fun <T> binarySearch(\n        list: List<T>, fromIndex: Int, toIndex: Int, key: String, selector: (T) -> String\n    ): Int {\n        var low = fromIndex\n        var high = toIndex - 1\n\n        while (low <= high) {\n            val mid = (low + high) ushr 1\n            val midVal = list[mid]\n\n            val midKey = selector(midVal)\n\n            if (midKey < key) low = mid + 1\n            else if (midKey > key) high = mid - 1\n            else error(\"index found for $key which should not have been found\")\n        }\n        return low\n    }\n\nWould there be any methods better than doing so? I briefly considered recursion but for higher tier folders, this should be very slow.",

If you're here simply because you are looking to make a lot of money, you're in the wrong place\"\n\nThis is what the dean of students told Jordan Belfort (The Wolf of Wall Street) and his fellow classmates his first day of dental school. Belfort dropped out.\n\nA lot of you all here need to take some inspiration from that. Gatekeepers are annoying I know but the doom and gloom in this field has reached a point where I, as a senior engineer in this field, feel a call to gatekeep a little bit.\n\nThe COVID era job market is never coming back - at least not any time soon which may as well mean never for those of you trying to break into this field with no passion. And that word is the heart of what I want to get at here; passion.\n\nObviously there are still dentists today. Most of whom became dentists well after Belfort was a student and discouraged from his dreams. Just as there will be software engineers well into the future.\n\nBut the people that became dentists despite the market drying up did so because they had a true passion for the field. It still pays well sure but there was a golden age that has now passed and this is where CS is now.\n\nThis post isn't to straight up tell you to give up on a CS career. But, if you have been struggling to find a job for awhile now, you should take a step back and a bit of time to reflect on why you are here. If its just for the money, it might be time to pivot to something else.\n\nThe golden age of software engineering is over\n\nEDIT: This post went from 70+ upvotes to sub 10 in a matter of minutes. Reddit is controlled by bots and is generally a bad place to solicit life and career advice. You cannot trust what you see on this platform\n\nEDIT 2: Don't overanalyze the dentist analogy. Like I originally said there are obviously still dentists today. And they make great money IF they get jobs. The analogy is not to say they don't do well if they land jobs its to say they do well IF THEY DO land jobs. And thats the challenge of the current CS market. Its great money IF YOU CAN LAND A JOB. And to land a job in todays market you can't just mail it in. Thats my point",

And also you’re welcome.\n\nMoments spent in Power BI dashboards, watching shifts in purchasing behavior, tracking category growth in Kombucha, Spindrift, and non-alcoholic beverages, and translating those insights into actionable strategy? Ecstasy. Seeing those trend lines move is why I wake up everyday\n\nThere are too many contrarians here reflexively dismissing uncomfortable truths, and not enough people willing to acknowledge how the industry actually works and what  it really takes to thrive in it.\n\nI for one am so grateful to be a data scientist at a large grocery chain.

Is there something magical that's happening right now that makes the current agents with the current context window constraints able to handle highly complex systems?\n\nDo the folks at the top really not care about the cognitive decline associated with these kinds of tools? \n\nIs my conspiracy theory right that they're just trying to outsource us like every capitalist before them?",

When I get an interview, I do well.\n\nBut I don't get any interviews. I've been applying for months. Out of the hundreds of jobs I've applied for on Indeed/ LinkedIn I've only had a single application go far (Okta, where I got to the final stages).\n\nI could chalk this up to the market being crap but at my current job, we are currently hiring, and the quality of candidates is abysmal. Mostly people from other countries without any real software experience. \"AI\" Engineers with vibe-coded projects. If I find a candidate with a decent resume, when I interview them, the majority can't even reverse a string. For senior positions.\n\nSo I don't understand. What is going on the market right now?

        "author": "iwuvpuppies",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I made this post to help explain the current state of software development jobs, especially for new and junior developers. I hope this eases some of your worries. It is long, bear with me.\n\nSoftware Engineering, like any other careers is cyclical. Jobs are at the mercy of demand, trends, and capital. We saw an influx during 2010's and especially during and after Covid (early 2020's) when companies started hiring to hoard talent.\n\nLets get to the layoffs. For those who think layoffs are the direct result of AI, you are not completely wrong. But there are more factors at play. The hard reality is the American economy may be in the midst of economic hardship (recession). This takes us to my first point.\n\n1. Companies using AI as an excuse to downsize and make the books look good.\n\nFirst reason: Executive Bonuses. Public companies are at the mercy of quarterly reports. One bad quarter could cost some asshole millionaire his/her job. This sadly incentivizes short term gains and hurts the company long term. But who cares as long as they get their bonus right? AI is a goldmine for execs. They buy a Claude or Copilot subscription and start firing devs. They then take the money they were paying those devs back to the board or shareholders and get rewarded with a bonus.\n\nSecond reason: Optics. Instead of telling shareholders they need to cut costs (signs of weakness), companies can now conveniently say \"AI Efficiency\". “We don’t need as many people” sounds better than “we can’t afford them”.  To top that off, the market rewards any mention of AI with a stock bump. Again the millionaire assholes gets their bonus.\n\n2. Management is not immune to industry trends. Leadership is not perfect, they will make mistakes. Unfortunately we are often the victims of those mistakes. Executives talk to peers, copy what other companies are doing, then push it internally. Often times, this comes in the form of asking devs to vibe code/prompts/use agents.\n\n3. Take a close look at motivations. The same people dooming and glooming software development are often the ones collecting million dollar bonuses for selling the hype and tools.\n\nBelow is how things will play out:\n\nAfter management finishes downsizing and the quality of the product goes to shit (either from the vibe coding or short staffing), we will see the following:\n\n* Companies admiting AI didn’t deliver the expected benefits\n* Anyone tied to the AI initiative gets fired (after they get their million dollar bonuses of course)\n* Start hiring engineers again\n* AI repositioned as “assistive\" rather than substitutive\n\nTime and time again we have seen this with offshoring, outsourcing and any form of automation.\n\nMy recommendation, if you enjoy coding, keep doing it. After the hype and fad dies down, this job will continue to be in demand.\n\n“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and executive bonuses”",

Like taking on a side project feels so daunting especially now when we have to still study LC and system design for job hunting (and the bar has gone way up so its not just basic lc, its competitive programming level problems) and on top of that need to be solid in several different languages and have multiple side projects and be an AI / RAG / full stack expert.

From the moment of waking up, until going to bed, I would stay anxious, would keep on getting teams messages from my manager and director, and would always be worried and anxious about delivering my work.\n\nSix months ago my team got internally switched and not only my tech stack changed, but also I was unable to understand anything in the new team -- how deployment worked, unit testing, which person takes care of which thing, whom to reach out when people have a disagreement on the approach you used, etc etc.\n\nIn my previous team, there was a collaborative environment. The team knew there are things that I don't know, because they have never been properly communicated, so I was helped with that. There are changes in the team or deployment process? communicated. Some new framework? communicated. Some update in our best practices? communicated too.\n\nBut in the new team, the approach turned out to be very much 'sink or swim'. You are told some things initially but then rest of the things, even processes, even whom to reach out and even what to do when there is a conflict with someone else, everything was left on you. Your ticket/task was handled to you and it was said to be your ownership \n\nThe moment you are assigned your task, you treat it like a sword hanging near your neck and you do everything possible to deliver it on time. Something unexpected causing delays? Some other component which you rely on, not working properly? Nobody cares. You need to deliver on the deadline anyhow.\n\nI don't really like this kind of a culture, really. I loved the old, collaborative culture where it felt like we are working on a mission together with our team. Where our team is not our enemy, but they are comrades. But my director told me that if I don't become highly independent, I won't survive the industry.\n\nHas it become become the norm lately that sink or swim is the only approach to work being adopted in the tech industry? Is there no scope of collaborative and friendly cultures anymore?",

I took a large break to heal and moved back in with my parents to reconnect since I moved far away to pursue this role and I figured it would be easy to land a Job near my hometown which is near a big city.\n\nBUT its been about 6 months after I started seriously searching and it feels like all of the jobs openings are in Big Tech and I can barely find roles that would I felt would be regular jobs a few years ago. Every small-mid size company has only 1-2 roles open at a time, if at all, and the competition is intense. Every application has hundreds of people applying based on LinkedIn and Indeed.\n\nI don't think I qualify or want to push myself to take Senior roles, which have much more openings by far, but for Mid Level roles, I feel like I'm looking a unicorn. Friends who work in non Big Tech jobs tell me how wonderful it is to work in a low stress environment and have coworkers who have been there for decades, while I feel like I'm going crazy just looking for a job.\n\nI knew the job search would be bad, but its genuinely horrible and I can't imagine what someone without experience or less experience than what you'd get at FAANG would be going through right now. I'm leveraging use of all resources of networks, cold calling, and the like, but with how dry the market is, every rejection and non offer after long interview sessions hits like a truck.\n\nI love this work, am staunchly anti-AI, and don't expect a large paycheck for my next job, but is it so hard of an ask for fulfilling work that I don't have to think about all day and on weekends?? (shout out last employer!!)\n\nI landed my FAANG job from an internship and I have no idea if this is the norm or if I've just been privileged. How was the market actually before all of this? I know the pandemic was a hot market for SDE jobs, but its hard to believe given the dichotomy between today's market. \n\nThe only consistent interview requests I get now are from big tech companies and I'm trying my absolute best to not re-enter the meat grinder for as long as possible.

I was essentially doing the work of other tech leads in the company, but there was always a vague reason promotion to get the title I was already doing wasnt coming. It was always \"next cycle\". \n\nI left and went to another company. Hired as a Senior, within about a year or two I'm basically acting tech lead again in terms of responsibilities. But again, every cycle I was told I'd be promoted in the *next* cycle and it never happened. \n\nAfter frustration, I left and started the cycle again at my current company. I'm now approaching my 4th anniversary and the same cycle has played out again, and I'm sensing the same excuses coming as to why no promotion will happen again this year.\n\nI'm very frustrated. I'm working at a higher level than my title suggests and have been for a long while now. No offense to the people around me but I now report up through people with much less experience.\n\nIf I leave, I can't get past a screening for a \"lead\", \"staff\", \"principal\" roles because they want a few years at that title already. If I accept another Senior position, I'm basically back to \"Day 1\" and have to grind to reach the ever elusive carrot or promotion in a few years and I'm worn out of trying hard, having responsibility pushed on me, but never actually getting the reward. \n\nWhat do people at this level do. I'm good at my job from a technical perspective and I seem to be well trusted in terms of people skills, managing a team, but the political side of forcing promotions seems to not be something I'm good at. \n\nEdit: Thank you for the helpful and respectful comments, it has given me a few things I need to think about and improve my approach towards. For the hostile comments, I'm not quite sure why my question has made a few folks so angry but I wish you well regardless. \n\nEdit 2: Received a Reddit Cares for this post. Unacceptable. ",

        "content": "Hello everyone. Very fortunate to have received another offer.\n\nBasically I just joined my first FT role here at a bank. My team seems cool and the work sounds like it'll be pretty interesting. Unfortunately the office is 1.5 hours away from my place (I've been couch surfing at a friend's place during the workweek to mitigate this) and the pay itself is also pretty low. There's also mandatory 5-day RTO (with rumored hourly minimums).\n\nThe offer for the new job starts in June, 2 day hybrid office requirement, and is 15 minutes from home. The question is, how do I actually make this transition? Do I do as much work as possible to offset my team having to essentially interview, hire and onboard someone new? When should I let my manager know? The priority is minimizing the impact my early departure could potentially have.\n\nThank you.",

I felt like a dissapointment to my parents, especially seeing my friends progress with their lives while i was back at home bedrotting everyday. I told myself that i NEEDED to lock in and get an internship for this summer, orelse I had to apply for some retail job like starbucks to keep me afloat.\n\nWelp… this morning after 624 job applications, I finally got my offer letter today. It’s not a big prestigious company like amazon but im literally so happy and cannot complain.\n\nIm like one of the dumbest people I know so if I can do it, SO CAN YOU. DONT GIVE UP!! if you are still struggling to find an internship, here are some tips that helped me:\n\n* use linkedin to network but not for applying to jobs. they repost jobs and it’s just a waste of time because everyone is applying to those postings\n* surround yourself with ambitious friends. im so thankful that my friends are so smart and supportive because they helped me fix my resume, and seeing their success just motivates me to do better\n* in the job interview, you need to show some personality. lots of candidates focus too much on GETTING the interview but remember you also need to pass it, show that you are someone enjoyable to be around\n* try to find internships the moment they get posted, literally the day of. constantly refresh github repos, intern insider, discord, etc. or stalk company sites directly\n* stay consistent and protect your mental health. I kept applying even when nothing was working, but I also made sure I had hobbies and friends outside of job hunting so rejections did not completely wreck me\n\nAt the end of the day, i think it’s just a game of luck. Keep putting shots up and eventually one will fall in.. or something like that. Happy to answer any questions about my job search and help give more advice if youre struggling!",

You can filter by funding stage, remote, equity, and see who you’re actually talking to.

        "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm a mid level dev, I also do quite a lot of devops work. For the longest time I was quite against using AI to develop code because I wanted to enjoy the challenges, solve problems etc. I simply enjoy my job too much to want to delegate it away.\n\nAnd recently, I've been experimenting with some AIs (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) because as much as I enjoy my job, I don't want to fall behind. But my real, hands on experience was that AI was only really useful as a glorified autocomplete, generating boilerplate code, and maybe stuff like terraform skeleton code. It's good for things that are not a problem at all and that I can do quite fast myself anyway, but whenever I try to use AI to solve an actual problem/something I'm stuck on/something that requires logic, it always fails miserably. Trying to talk it into actually doing the work, and even pointing out the mistakes (and entering the, 'you're right, I'll fix that!' loop for ever), it makes me feel like a Sisyphus, and it never goes anywhere. Pretty much every single time I've attempted it, I was better off writing the code myself anyway.  \n\nBut everywhere I look, I see people about agentic ai, using ai in development and increasing the productivity 10x, etc. but in reality, these are never followed up with real life actual examples, it just feels like a cloud of buzzwords and people parroting what's currently popular. \n\n",

        "author": "dr335i",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So a year ago I started at my first development job after a career change. I consider myself BLESSED to have found a role, and such a good one to get started in. The job is way chiller than I ever could have expected. I'm fully remote, on a team of five (with some very experienced people), On Call weekend once every ten weeks or so but it's generally very uneventful. Leadership is thoughtful, people get along, WLB is amazing (working hours are working hours, 4 weeks PTO, etc). It's really a genuinely great situation. \n\nThe bad is that the work isn't really challenging or interesting. We maintain probably 20-30 different legacy Java applications, frequently that just looks like small little feature or workflow changes, database work, or some kind of server script that needs to be done. We're in the process of modernizing them - but the vast majority (which truly are very simple boring CRUD workflows) are getting moved into a proprietary \"pro-code\" platform (a convuluted, absolute mess of a thing that uses java objects in a bizarre way) with the remaining 5-6 of them being rewritten as cloud native react apps. \n\nRight now, we're inbetween that. Theres a few developers that are staying pretty busy doing deep dives into a high impact java app that was originally written around 2006, but the rewrites haven't started yet and I find myself doing super low impact work and trying to \"look\" busy because theres just not much to do. For a while I was enjoying that - doing projects around the house or the yard but now I'm over that. I want to do something interesting and I have NO interest in taking part in the low code nonsense. I'm being underutilized. I also only get paid around 65k (LCOL area so whatever, but even the \"leads\" are barely pushing 100). \n\nIt seems obvious to look for something else but I work with awesome people, have a ton of free time, fully remote, AND good management? I'd hate to leave and go somewhere else thats miserable. \n\nBackground: 31, Career changer, went to an average state school after high school for accounting, proceeded to go work at a car dealership because I liked cars and hated taxes. Did pretty well, moved through the ranks, wanted to do something more intellectually challenging, went back to school (WGU don't flame me) to get a CS degree (honestly I was always a nerd who understood computers well and tinkered with stuff so I was more looking for the HR checkbox, I know it's not great though). Decent soft skills, better than a lot of my coworkers for sure, could probably do well at leetcode mediums if I gave it some effort, but no strong interest in relocating. Would consider myself competent and a strong employee but I'm probably never going to be the guy coding on the weekends because he just loves it that much. Have considered signing up for OMSCS to lose some of that wgu stigma and open up possibilities but with AI here it kind of feels like: why? ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I honestly think what’s happening in the job market is pretty obvious. It’s not just AI taking everyone’s jobs (maybe some of them, sure), but a lot of work is simply being outsourced to cheaper labor markets : Eastern Europe, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc.\n\nI’m pretty active on a bunch of subreddits, and the difference is obvious. You’ve got people in the US and Western Europe saying they’ve applied to 100+ jobs and can’t even land an interview. Meanwhile, people in places like India or the Philippines talk pretty casually about getting IT jobs, call center work, remote contracts  and earning high income ( relative to their country’s norm) .\n\nIf someone like Trump argues that protectionist policies are necessary to protect Western industries,  workers and western dominance , and points to China building its economy off the back of offshored manufacturing , then why isn’t this treated the same way? Offshoring these tech jobs might not look as dramatic as factories moving overseas, but it’s shifting income, skills, and long-term capacity to other countries. It should be treated as a threat to western dominance \n\nAnd the bigger picture is this: when you offshore work, you’re not just saving money in the short term. You’re helping build those countries skilled workforce. Over time, those countries  will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.\n\nIt just feels like we’re watching the same pattern repeat, only this time with tech and services instead of manufacturing. Maybe it’s a bit wild to say but I don’t think companies that offshore lots of their jobs like this should be allowed to operate in the country or at the very least they should face much higher taxation that makes offshoring unattractive ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.\n\nSoftware engineering used to feel like the golden path. High pay, tons of demand, solid job security. Then bootcamps blew up, CS enrollments exploded, and now it feels pretty saturated at the entry level. On top of that, AI tools are starting to automate parts of coding, which makes the future feel a bit uncertain.\n\nNow I’m wondering if machine learning is heading in the same direction.\n\nML pays a lot of money right now. The salaries are honestly a big part of why people are drawn to it. But I’m seeing more and more people pivot into ML, more courses, more degrees, more certifications, and some universities are even starting dedicated AI degrees now. It feels like everyone wants in. People from all kinds of backgrounds are moving into ML and AI too, math majors, engineering majors, stats, physics, and even people outside traditional tech paths, similar to how CS became the default choice for so many different majors a few years ago. At the same time, tools are getting better. With foundation models and high-level frameworks, you don’t always need to build things from scratch anymore.\n\nAs a counterpoint though, ML is definitely harder than traditional CS in a lot of ways. The math, the theory, reading research papers, running experiments. The learning curve feels steeper. It’s not something you can just pick up in a few months and be truly good at. So maybe that barrier keeps it from becoming as saturated as general software engineering?\n\nI’m personally interested in going into AI and robotics, specifically machine learning or computer vision at robotics companies. That’s the long term goal. I just don’t know if this is still a smart path or if it’s going to become overcrowded and unstable in the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nWould love to hear from people already in ML or robotics. Is it still worth it? Or are we heading toward the same oversaturation issues that SWE is facing?",

Obviously, job hunting is a numbers game, and there's a random element to it. But I genuinely haven't had a **single** organic interview during this entire period. Even some years ago, when I was unemployed for an extended period like this, I was still able to land an interview every month or so.\n\nFor context, I have over 6 years of professional experience and a background in React, JavaScript + TypeScript, Python, and more. These are, no doubt, heavily crowded tech stacks in the market right now. Additionally, I used the phrase \"organic interview\" earlier, since I did have a few interviews early in my job search, but only after reaching out to some old connections about openings at their companies. None of those interviews led to anything.\n\nThese past 8 months (with some breaks in between days/weeks), I've applied to over 600 openings and tried what feels like everything. I've rewritten my resume about 6 times, and at one point even hired a professional resume-writing service to tailor my resume to my background and target roles. But still nothing.\n\nI'm just so lost at this point in terms of what to do now. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd greatly appreciate it.

        "author": "se898",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m asking mostly out of curiosity and to get a sense of how things look from inside the industry today.\n\nI used to be a software developer in Seattle about ten years ago. I worked in the field for roughly two years before deciding to switch careers and move on to something else. I’ve been out of tech for a long time now, but I still loosely follow what’s going on. Watching the wave of layoffs since 2022, one thing I’ve been wondering about is whether they disproportionately affected people who entered tech through coding bootcamps during the 2015 to 2021 boom. Back when I was around, bootcamps were just starting to become a thing, and later they seemed to turn into a very common path into junior roles. From the outside, it feels like when hiring tightened, companies cut a lot of junior or surface level roles first. That made me wonder whether former bootcamp hires, especially career switchers with fewer years of deep experience, were more exposed compared to traditional CS grads or more senior engineers.\n\nI’m not trying to bash bootcamps or the people who went through them. I’m genuinely curious whether people inside companies noticed any real pattern during layoffs, or whether this is mostly selection bias and anecdotal noise.\n\nFor those who stayed in tech through the last few years, did layoffs feel credential blind, or were certain backgrounds more vulnerable? Did former bootcamp grads fare worse, better, or about the same as everyone else once the market contracted? Would really appreciate perspectives from engineers, hiring managers, or anyone who went through layoffs themselves.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nFormer software dev from Seattle, out of the industry for about 10 years. Curious whether the post-2022 layoffs hit former bootcamp hires harder than others, or if that’s just anecdotal.",

It seems like my mind has stopped functioning and I can't find a solution on my own so I really need help from wise strangers on the internet.\n\nSo here goes my story: I am a 34 years old man (birthday in about a week from now). I was born and raised in a third world country. I completed my BS in CS in 2013 and I have worked as a software dev until 2019 when I started my own business (not related to tech) so I kinda gave up on my career.\n\nMy business was doing good and everything was fine until in 2025, I moved to the US. My family is here and I was alone back in my country so it made sense to move here. I thought I could keep my business running remotely but unfortunately, due to some issues I couldn't and it all came crashing down.\n\nNow, I dont have anything. I no longer have a career to get a job in IT here nor do I have a business to support me. I am also in $19K of debt. I have started working an odd job to survive here which pays $19/hour but I am even unable to meet my basic need as I need to pay the rent here. I am unable to find a job with better pay. My resume is a disaster.\n\nI desperately need to revive my career but I don't know how. I was a .NET (C#) dev back then and I use to work on MVC & Web forms projects. I also use to make REST & SOAP APIs. I did dabble in a little bit of [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) core too. I used to work on MS SQL too.\n\nI asked ChatGPT and it recommened to start with Azure cloud as I can leverage my background in .NET & C#. Although I have no experience in cloud, do you think it is a wise suggestion? I have started prepping for AZ900 (which I know, doesnt help in securing a job as its just fundamentals but its a necessary step to cloud). Its been so long since I coded that I have forgotten almost everything about it.\n\nOr should I look into AI and Data Science stuff? Feels complicated but since there is all the hype about it and how AI is the future, I am not sure. I was never good at maths so I am not sure if I will be able to grasp it.\n\nSo can anyone of you please help me in guiding towards a path (in detail please if possible) where I can potentially have a financially stable life? I have always been a hard worker and have been praised for my work ethics, even in the odd job here. So I know with a little bit of help, I can rise again.\n\nRight now, I feel broken. I have nothing to show for 34 years of my life. All my friends/ex-colleagues have good careers and are married, have their own house, cars, kids and living a stable (or close to it) life. I can't go back to my country as there is absolutely nothing there for me and I am finding it extremely hard to survive here. After bills, I dont have enough money for basic groceries here. I had a comfortable life back home and was earning well and never had a physical/laborious job in my life. Here I am working 12 hours shift as a warehouse worker. I dont mind it but it feels like I am wasting away my life.\n\nI am sorry if my post looks like I am looking for pity. I am not. Its just that I do not have anyone to talk to about this and I am not in a good state of mind right now.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I would really appreciate your help.\n\nTLDR: .NET dev who abandoned his career in 2019, is now looking to go back to his career in tech and asking for the correct path.",

The 2nd human can think in a truly independent way regardless of what the first human has tried. Hallucinations can still happen between humans but they are much rarer and even when they do happen are usually understandable and predictable.\n\nIn short, I've observed that human collaboration is scalable in a way that AI agent collaboration is not.\n\nIt's almost as if due to the simple fact that each human has a unique neural net wiring, human collaboration is able to make discoveries and break throughs that a single neural net whether synthetic or biological, cannot compete against.\n\nIt's as if the current state of the art for AI is still only at the level where it's a tool. If I didn't know better, I would say investors are being duped into believing it'll reach true human level autonomy. Surely, these benevolent tech \"leaders\" wouldn't bend the truth like that.",

After the pandemic... it fluctuated between 100% remote and hybrid. Every time I went fully remote, I eventually hated it. I felt purposeless, like I had a \"fake job,\" and struggled with the lack of structure (I’ve discussed this extensively in therapy).\n\n- Last Year: Worked a 1-year stint for a government contractor (hybrid). This worked fairly well for me mentally. I actually did a lot of work on remote days, but from a closer office just to focus. But the contract folded over the summer due to budget cuts (DOGE), forcing me to find a new job quickly. Some other parts of the job didn't quite work...it was a far commute in particular.\n\n- Current Role (6 months): I joined a smaller \"boutique\" government contracting firm. It’s 100% remote, and the same bad feelings have returned. On top of the isolation, the environment is toxic, disorganized, and the codebase is chaotic. But after the shakeup last summer with contracting work, I felt desperate. \n\nI’m looking again and have landed 5 interviews, mostly focusing on in-person or hybrid roles. Mostly SCIF work in the government contracting world...but the front-runner is a role 20 minutes from my house with core hours of 10am–2pm. They seem really modern, use Svelte and more prototyping stuff, but just the nature of it can't be remote. \n\nWhere I'm at rn, I mean...it's really not working out, and I have the experience to know and see these are some bad managers and work environment...even outside of it being remote. \n\nI feel at odds. My mental health and history tell me I need to be in the office (or at least hybrid) to feel purposeful and get out of the house. But now that it's becoming real, I’m worried I’m going to miss the freedom of remote work once it's gone.\n\nAlso planning to push for more money. I currently make around $170k TC. I'm gonna push more for $200k-$220k. Security clearance work and being only on-site, I think could justify it. They don't really know my situation that I don't like remote and could use it to my advantage I feel.\n\nI don't have an offer in-hand but...I can read the signs one of these 5 will come through at least.\n\nHas anyone else here realized they just can't do remote work? Did you regret going back to the office, or did the structure help you?",

        "author": "kyngslyr",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience, mostly working with .NET/C# and SQL. I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role, which means I’ve had exposure to architecture decisions, client calls, and owning delivery end to end.\n\nLately though, I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.\n\nI recently went through interviews with a US-led SaaS company, and they’ve communicated intent to extend an offer. The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role.\n\nFrom conversations with their engineering leadership, though, this doesn’t sound like a traditional ticket-only support job. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes. They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.\n\nWhat I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.\n\nThere’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.\n\nIf you’ve worked in product SaaS companies or made a similar move, how would you look at this? What would you watch for early on to tell whether it’s actually a stepping stone versus a dead end? Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?\n\nEDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.",

Because of my history with the company (basically rotating between teams in my department), I’ve had the chance to touch basically everything: Frontend, Backend, Databases, Devops pipelines, K8s/containers, Cloud infrastructure, AuthN/AuthZ, API gateways/reverse proxies, and Messaging (Pub/sub). I’ve become the \"jack of all trades\" in our department.\n\nManagement is now aggressively pushing me toward a Tech Lead/Lead developer role. They want me focused on unblocking other developers, guiding engineers, and handling the \"big picture\" stuff. This would drastically reduce my time \"in the trenches\" where I'm basically delegating the day to day stuff.\n\nThe issue is that I’m already losing my time to code. My typical day now includes: mentoring other junior developers/interns, discussing integration points with other systems, stakeholder meetings with my EM, sprint planning, and removing blockers for other engineers - for example, getting our authN/authZ infra setup or API routes design done so that implementation can begin on a new module.\n\nI’ve only been coding seriously for 5–6 years (including personal projects and my college degree) and only have \\~2 years of \"professional\" industry experience. I feel like it is **way too early** to stop being an Individual Contributor (IC). I want to experience being a \"Senior dev\" and build true deep technical expertise. Basically I foresee my career moving towards the \"IC\" path rather than the \"EM\" one.\n\nEven worse, I’m starting to feel anxious (like I'm not ready for this step up) and feel like a fraud. Because I’ve been a generalist, I look at our dedicated Backend engineers and realize they are better at their jobs than I am. They have depth I don't have in terms of programming and db design.\n\nHas anyone else been fast-tracked like this and am I right to think that \\~2 years of experience is too shallow for a Tech Lead role?",

        "content": "Hi the following wall of text is just me whining about my luck running out, whoa is me, yada yada. But I would appreciate advice after reading between the lines.  \n  \nRecently I was turned down for a job specifically because they said I lacked a bachelor's degree. I have an associate's degree from a community college, and some 4 year university for a mechanical engineering before I ran out of money. I got an insanely lucky break at a small startup anyway for roughly 6 years, then a year at an enterprise position. Both of them remote which is insanely lucky because I live in south PA, hours away from most tech centers. I should have saved up and moved but I was making pretty below average pay so it never really added up. Plus family things kept me rooted where I am. I should have jumped ship from my job sooner but I thought all the experience would look better rather then job hopping. I also had a weird sense of loyalty since they took me on without a bachelors in the first place. The stupid part is I was trying to save up to return to college at that enterprise job but then I was laid off.   \n  \nThat was a year ago. I got an entry level helpdesk position at an old job for about half the pay I was making and I've been trapped here ever since. I got maybe 8 interviews total last year and half of them the companies disappeared overnight. The other half went with what unicorns I assume the market is oversaturated with now. At least that's what it felt like.\n\nAt this point I am at a loss of what to do. I've been up and down the existential nightmare of the AI hype and have safely arrived at the \"it's a tool nothing more\" stance but it feels like it's going to be another couple years before CEOs recognize this. I know most of this thread is in the same boat dealing with that aftermath. But what do I do in the meantime? I get small one off \"maintenance\" with my old company's software I play up a bit on my resume and I'm \"technically\" still registered with them but I feel like it's hurting more then helping. I only play it up because I was under the impression it's much harder to get hired in software if you haven't been doing it recently. If I say I've been doing 99% tech support for the past year that makes it sound like I'm not even an engineer anymore. I had a recruiter straight up ask me \"why'd you leave to do tech support instead\" like I did this on purpose. It's demeaning. It's not that I mind IT but I don't have the certs to move up in it, and I always wanted to build software for a living. It's part of the reason I started having trouble with my bachelor's degree originally, because I wanted to change trajectory and it ended up being too expensive to.\n\nI have a handful of active personal projects, including a rust library, a game engine, and a joint one with a dev friend I've been working on that's more of a SaaS. I feel like entrepreneurship might be my only hope at this point but I don't consider myself business brained, nor do I necessarily consider myself a designer. Even my system design is probably just mediocre at best. I feel gross using AI to churn out slop. I am trying to figure out a way to use it productively like i know peers of mine manage without feeling like I'm building on top of popsicle sticks. I think I'm better then AI but by how much i couldn't tell you.\n\nAnyway I know this is a bit of a sad sap ramble but really it comes down to income. I love software development, I've been doing it since I was a kid, but I also need money. I have mouths to feed and a mortgage and entry level jobs aren't cutting it. My credit card is almost maxed out and the interest is enough I can never pay it off. I'm hoping the answer isn't just to take up a trade like my dad and father in law did. I always felt like software is what I'm meant to do and it kills me that I can't make it happen anymore. If I could even just get some gigs like the good ol days I could hunker down until the economy corrects, but the gig market is basically dead from what I've found. And I haven't had a single bite on Fiver/Upwork. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation?",

The problem started recently, where my manager decided that I have to learn Business Intelligence, in particular how to make dashboard (a task that I hate and I'm really bad at since I have basically zero aesthetic sense), in order not to present my job to internal stakeholders, but to sell them outside the company (and this worries me A LOT, I spoke about this with my internal stakeholder and he seemed worried too).\n\nMy perception about why this did happen was that the head of data made some terrible choices that burned out the budget and now they have to find a way to save money (about 60% of the BI team left not being replaced recently).  They'll probably to sell this transition as a new way to intend the Data Engineering job, compliant with our target company model.\n\nNow I'll soon have to speak with my manager about this, I'll for sure tell him that I'm not ok with this, and that I expected to proceed in a more managerial path, rather than taking on more technical work, that I cannot do and I'm not brilliant with. But I fear that this won't make any changes. \n\nSo what would you do in my place?\n\nI thought about:\n\n1. Leaving the company (the market isn't as bad as in the US, so it's not out of questions, but i still would like to have an offer first)\n2. Take a step back and ask for part-time trying to use the free time to land some other job (perhaps freelance or something different)\n3. Go to HR, tell them that I'm not anymore happy with my position and see if there's something else available withing the company.\n4. Comply and see what happens (if they will fire me, they'll have to give me an exit bonus)\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nAs a Data Engineer forced to take on even Business Intelligence tasks due to corporate politics.

For background, I work in a remote marketing company in the US that pays 18 dollars an hour that has been a bizarre experience (in a very bad way). They fired their employee that trained me right before they offered a paid position too. Probably not a coincidence.\n\nMy work expectations went from conducting audits for social media accounts with Excel and Python (in the first week) to doing a ton of stuff that does not involve coding. I am now expected to manage all 52 of their social media accounts. I have to edit and add captions to videos along with scheduling them, coming up with titles, descriptions, hashtags, tagging people, thumbnail design, etc. I have to be tech support and solve every tech problem they have. I have to manage their database and answer some of their client’s phone calls too regarding whatever questions they have. I am now expected to be their project coordinator too.\n\nRegarding coding related things, they want me to automate employees’ entire workflow, be a cybersecurity expert, design user interfaces, automate website creation for clients, and build AI agents. I do not have the experience, knowledge, or time to do many of these tasks and despite trying to explain these concerns to my employer, it goes on deaf ears as “it’s critical for the company as clients come first.” I only have so much time out the day to do things.

I am getting messaged on night after working hours constantly inquiring about various tasks too.\n\nThere is excessive micromanagement in my opinion that just makes my life miserable. I am expected to give a detailed report every hour (yes, every hour) on what work I’ve done, what work I’m currently doing, the work I have remaining and it’s ETA, what setbacks I’ve had, and proposed solutions. At the end of the day, I’m expected to give a report on what I’ve learned for the day. I also have keep time of every task I have done. There are constant impromptu meetings asking all of this information above along with the fact that we have a Jira like website that has this information already which makes it insanely redundant.\n\nWhat is the craziness level here?
