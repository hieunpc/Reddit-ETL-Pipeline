        "content": "I started working this job in mid 2019. Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.\n\nBeing new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.\n\nThe premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!\n\nFast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.\n\nEvery single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.\n\nMassive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nIn none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.\n\nChoosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...\n\nSure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.\n\nI understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".\n\nAnyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. \n\nIt was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know?  Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. \n\nWhen I realized, my gut reaction was a \"no\".  The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. \n\nI started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?\n\nI ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing. \n\nGood luck to all on both sides of this. ",

        "author": "anxiouscrimp",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Keen for any thoughts or feedback.\n\nBackground - I’ve worked at my current employer, a mid-sized luxury retailer. We turn over about £200m annually. I’m the sole BI architect and have been for the last 5 years or so. I’ve been with the company for 11 years. I do everything - requirements, building out the data warehouse, building and maintaining the cubes, some SSRS development. In the last two years I’ve designed and built a new ELT framework for us to move away from SSIS and integrate to all of our various disparate systems - ERP, CRM, GA4, digital marketing platforms etc etc. Then I’ve cleaned all of this data, modelled it and built a PBI semantic model on top to bring everything together. That’s the first (and biggest) phase of replacing our existing estate.\n\nChallenge - I had a very good relationship with our previous CTO. Now a new CTO (a contractor) has joined and he seems to be completely ignoring me. We’ve barely had any interaction. He’s worked with GCP in the past and immediately has set up meetings with a google partner. In the first meeting they opened with ‘so we understand that you’ve got a very fractured data estate with no single source of truth’ which is just totally untrue. But this CTO seems to have no interest in engaging with me in the slightest and I’m hearing from other people that he just wants to ‘move us to bigquery’. We’re entirely on Microsoft for everything - not just BI - so this is an enormous piece of work without a clear benefit. In my opinion the issues we have are generally people based - not enough people and certainly not enough people translating data into something actionable or understandable. I’m open to the idea of moving some or part of our estate to GCP - but shouldn’t such a large move like this be considered in the context of ‘what problem are we trying to solve?’\n\nI’m feeling pretty upset - I’ve given a lot to this company over the years and this behaviour feels disrespectful and weird. I’m keen to hear from anyone if they’ve seen this behaviour in the past and how to approach it. At the moment my plan is to write a document outlining our current data estate for him to read and then talk him through. Obviously I’ll also update my CV.\n\nTLDR: new contract CTO has joined and is ignoring and sidelining me. He seems very intent on moving us to GCP despite not really understanding any of our actual challenges. Why is he doing this? Is this a strategy?",

My manager has the title but zero technical involvement.\n\nThe highlight reel:\n\n\\- Presented a migration to the CTO that saves six figures annually. Built the entire business case, ran the pilot, did the presentation. Manager sat in the room and said nothing. CTO: \"amazing job.\"\n\n\\- I run two vendor negotiations. Manager delegated the business case writing to me, then won't sign off. One is a \\~$20K/year tool well within his budget. He still escalates to the CTO for permission.\n\n\\- A credit card registration (literally 2 minutes) for an approved migration took 10+ days. When I nudged him on a CTO-visible thread, he pulled me aside and made it clear he didn't appreciate being called out in front of leadership. The tone was... not great.\n\n\\- His weekly updates to leadership? Written by us. He copy-pastes our summaries.\n\n\\- Forgot to process my contractually agreed bonus. Twice. I had to escalate to the CTO myself.\n\nThe CTO sees my work directly and responds well. I want to have a title + comp conversation, but here's the dilemma: that conversation should technically go through my manager. The same manager who \\*\\*forgot\\*\\* my bonus twice, blocks vendor decisions, and copy-pastes my summaries. Going to the CTO directly feels like the only path that leads anywhere, but I know it's politically risky.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Anyone navigated a title conversation that should go through your manager but realistically can't? How did you handle it?\n\n2. If you got promoted past your manager, title first or reporting change at the same time?\n\n3. When your manager starts getting defensive or hostile because they feel their position threatened, how seriously do you take that?\n\n4. If the conversation doesn't land, how fast did you leave?\n\nNot trying to destroy the guy. He's not evil, just ... very ineffective and knows the corporate playbook. But honestly I can't keep working with guy he blocks more than he enables.",

They said they didnt think I was senior enough but want me for a mid level role because my technical skills are strong. Theyre paying 170k base and have really good benefits. The hiring manager said they could fast track me to senior after a year but obviously its not guaranteed. \n\n  \nI think i want to take this but just wanted a sanity check. This job hunt wore me down and really hurt my ego. I thought I would be senior level by now and advancing my career. This job seems good though at least pay (paying more than most senior roles i applied to) and work life balance wise. I just want to get to senior level cause I feel like being mid level for so long will hurt me when applying again. ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So, I'm learning data engineering core principles sort of for the first time. I mean, I've had some experience, like intermediate Python, SQL, building manual ETL pipelines, Docker containers, ML, and Streamlit UI. It's been great, but I wanted to up my game, so now I'm following a really enjoyable data engineering Zoom camp. I love it. But what I'm noticing is these tools, great as they may be, they're all higher level abstractions of like what would be core, straight up, no-frills, writing raw syntax to perform multiple different tasks, and when combined together become your powerful ETL or ELT pipelines. \n\nMy question is this, these tools are great. They save so much time, and they have these really nice built-in \"SWE-like\" features, like DBT has nice built-in tests and lineage enforcement, etc., and I love it. But what happens if I'm a brand new practitioner, and I'm learning these tools, and I'm using them religiously, and things start to fail or  or require debugging? Since I only knew the higher-level abstraction, does that become a risk for me because I never truly learned the core syntax that these higher-level abstractions are solving? \n\nAnd on that same matter, can the same be said about agentic AI and MCP servers? These are just higher-level abstractions of what was already a higher-level abstraction in some of these other tools like DBT or Kestra or DLT, etc. So what does that mean as these levels of higher abstraction become magnified and many people entering the workforce, if there is going to be a future workforce, don't ever truly learn the core principles or core syntax? What does that mean for us all if we're relying on higher abstractions and relying on agents to abstract those higher abstractions even further? What does that mean for our skill set in the long-term? Will we lose our skill set? Will we even be able to debug? What do all these AI labs think about that? Or is that what they're banking on? That everybody must rely on them 100%?",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "For instance, does a star schema actually reduce redundancy in comparison to putting everything in a flat table? Instead of the fact table containing dimension descriptions, it will just contain IDs with the primary key of the dimension table, the dimension table being the table which gives the ID-description mapping for that specific dimension. In other words, a star schema simply replaces the strings with IDs in a fact table. Adding to the fact that you now store the ID-string mapping in a seperate dimension table, you are actually using more storage, not less storage.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the purpose of database normalization is not to \"reduce redundancy\" or to use storage more efficiently, but to make updates and deletes easier. If a customer changes their email, you update one row instead of a million rows.\n\nThe only situation in which I can see a star schema being more space-efficient than a flat table, or in which a snowflake schema is more space-efficient than a star schema, are the cases in which the number of rows is so large that storing n integers + 1 string requires less space than storing n strings. Correct me if I'm wrong or missing something, I'm still learning about this stuff.",

It was only a year contract and mid way I applied to grad school for Data Science. At the beginning of my program I also started a Data Engineering Apprenticeship, it went on for almost the whole school year. I completed my first year with great grades. That summer I started a summer internship as a “Systems Engineer“. The role was in the database team and was more of a “Database Admin“ role. \n\nThis is where the story takes a dumb turn. I’ll never forgive myself for having everything and letting depression ruin me instead.\n\nAt the beginning of my internship I had 3 family deaths and I spiraled. I stopped trying at work, was barely doing things just to get by. I remember even missing a trip to a data center that my team was going on. I isolated myself. I even got a full time offer in the end and I never responded to the email. I wasn’t talking to anyone. 2nd year started and I started to attend but stopped eventuall. I should have dropped out but I couldn’t even bring myself to type up an email. I just failed and didn’t re-enroll. I moved in with my brother bc I wasn’t taking care of myself. I essentially took a year off, which consist of me getting help. After about a year of the fog dissipating, I finally felt ready to try again. I’m not re-enrolling in school bc I’m pretty sure my GPA tanked, and I realized DS isnt my passion, I REALLY REALLY enjoyed my DE apprenticeship and constantly using SQL in my database role.\n\n  \nAll that said, I have been job searching for about 8 months now. Which totals to 1 year and 8 months since my last “tech” role. This looks so so bad on paper. What would you guys do if you were me? How would you go about making yourself marketable again? I am applying for very low level roles bc I think that’s they only thing I qualify for right now; data entry w SQL, Data Reporting, Data Specialist, etc. \n\n  \nTLDR: I had my career going in a great direction towards DE and let depression ruin everythin. Almost 2 years later I am trying to rebuild but I am unmarketable. What would you do to get back in the DE career path?",

Because right now my pipelines are about as self healing as a broken arm. We've got airflow orchestrating about 40 dags across various sources and when something breaks, which is weekly at minimum, someone has to manually investigate, figure out what changed, update the code, test it, and redeploy. That's not self healing, that's just regular healing with extra steps.\n\nI get that there's a spectrum here. Some tools do automatic retries with exponential backoff which is fine but that's just basic error handling not healing. Some claim to handle api changes automatically but I'm skeptical about how well that actually works when a vendor restructures their entire api endpoint. The part I care most about is when a saas vendor changes their api schema or deprecates an endpoint. That's what causes 80% of our breaks. If something could genuinely detect that and adapt without human intervention that would actually be worth paying for.",

I decided to simplify this and determine bottlenecks from spark job metadata. It's kept intentionally simple and recognizes three crucial patterns - data explosion, large scan and shuffle\\_write. It also resolves sql hint, let's you see the query connected to the job without having to click through two pages of horribly designed ui, it also detects slow stages and other goodies.\n\nIn general, when I debug performance issues with spark jobs myself, I usually have to click through stages trying to find where we are shuffling hard and spilling all around. This simplifies this process. It's not fancy, it's simple terminal app, but it does its jobs.\n\nFeature requests and burns are all welcome.

This is very compute-intensive so I am thinking it is optimal to just pull data nightly and fed it into a data warehouse we would own. This would also play nice with our other smaller ERP/CRM softwares we need data from.\n\nThe data jobs are fairly small.. I would say like 20 tables/views with \\~5000 rows on average.

I am thinking Azure SQL server as that looks to be $40-150/mo but wanted to come here to confirm if my suspicion is correct or there are any other tools I am overlooking.

        "author": "Winsaucerer",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi! Very excited to share my project **spawn**, a DB migration/build system.\n\nFor now, it supports PostgreSQL via `psql` to create and apply migrations, as well as write golden file tests (I plan to support other db's down the line). It has some innovations that I think make it very useful relative to other options I've tried.\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/saward/spawn](https://github.com/saward/spawn)\n\n**Docs:** [https://docs.spawn.dev/](https://docs.spawn.dev/)\n\nShout out to minijinja ([https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/)) which has made a lot of the awesomeness possible!\n\nSome features (PostgreSQL via `psql` only for now):\n\n* Create SQL (for tests or data insertion) from JSON data sources\n* Store functions/views/data in separate files for easy organisation and editing\n* `git diff` shows exactly what changed in a function in new migrations\n* Easy writing of tests for functions/views/triggers\n* Env-specific variables, so migrations apply test data to dev/local DB targets only\n* Generate data from JSON files\n* Macros for easily generating repeatable SQL, and other cool tricks (e.g., view tear-down and re-create)\n\nI started this project around two years ago. I’ve finally been able to get it to an MVP state I’m happy with.\n\nI created spawn to solve my own personal pain points. The main one was, how to manage updates for things like views and functions? There's a few challenges (and spawn doesn't solve all), but the main one was creating and reviewing the migration. The typical (without spawn) approach is one of:\n\n1. Copy function into new migration and edit. This makes PR reviews hard because all you see is a big blob of new changes.\n2. Repeatable migrations. This breaks old migrations when building from scratch, if those migrations depend on DDL or DML from repeatable migrations.\n3. Sqitch rework. Works, but is a bit cumbersome overall with the DAG, and I hit limitations with sqitch's variables support (and needing Perl) for other things I wanted to do.\n\nSpawn is my attempt to solve this, along with an easy (single binary) way to write and run tests. You:\n\n* Store view or function in its own separate file.\n* Include it in your migration with a template (e.g., {% include \"functions/hello.sql\" %})\n* Build migration to see the final SQL, or apply to database.\n* Pin migration to forever lock it to the component as it is now. This is very similar to 'git commit', allowing the old migration to run the same as when it was first created, even if you later change functions/hello.sql.\n* Update the function later by editing functions/hello.sql in place and importing it into your new migration. Git diff shows exactly what changed in hello.sql.\n\nPlease check it out, let me know what you think, and hopefully it's as useful for you as it has been for me. Thanks!\n\n(AI disclosure: around 90% of the non-test code is artisanal code written by me. AI was used more once the core architecture was in place, and for assisting in generating docs)",

There quite a few interesting avenues exploring streaming, and other features, besides extending to other providers (Gemini, Codex, etc), so do feel free to open an issue or contribute with a PR.\n\nOfficial DuckDB Community docs: [https://duckdb.org/community\\_extensions/extensions/agent\\_data](https://duckdb.org/community_extensions/extensions/agent_data)\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/axsaucedo/agent\\_data\\_duckdb](https://github.com/axsaucedo/agent_data_duckdb)",

I certainly did, so I created something to help scout out those unknown codebases. Here:\n\n[mitro54/DAIS: < DATA / AI SHELL >](https://github.com/mitro54/DAIS)\n\nHi,\n\nI created this open-source project/platform, Data/AI shell, or DAIS in short, to add capabilities to your favourite shell. At its core, it is a PTY Shell wrapper written in C++\n\nSome of the current features are:\n\n\\- The ability to add some extra info to your standard \"ls\" command, the \"ls\" formatting, and your terminal colors are fully customizable. It is able to scan and output thousands of folders information in an instant. It is capable of scanning and estimating how many rows there are in your text files, without causing any delays, for example estimating and outputting info about .csv file with 21.5 million rows happens as fast as your standard 'ls' output would.\n\n\\- The ability to query your databases with automatic recursive .env search\n\n\\- Ability to run the exact same functionalities in remote sessions through ssh. This works by deploying a safe remote agent transparently to your session.\n\n\\- Easy setup and will prompt you to automatically install missing dependencies if needed\n\n\\- Has a lot of configuration options to make it work in your environments, in your style\n\n\\- Tested rigorously for safety\n\nEverything else can be found in the README\n\nI will keep on updating and building this project along my B. Eng studies to become a Data/AI Engineer, as I notice more pain points or find issues. If you want to help, please do! Any suggestions and opinions of the project are welcome.\n\nSomething i've thought about for example is implementing the possibility to run OpenClaw or other type of agentic/llm system with it.",

Our sources include various Marketing APIs, MySQL, and SQL Server On Prem Source Systems. Currently, we use Metadata Driven Ingestion via Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load data directly into a dedicated SQL Server Bronze DB.\n\nOption A: Dedicated Bronze Database (SQL Server)\n\nThe Setup: Ingestion goes straight into SQL tables. Dev and Prod DWH reside on different servers. The Dev environment accesses the Prod Bronze DB via Linked Servers.\n\nWorkflow: Engineers have write access to Bronze for manual CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements. Silver/Gold are read-only and managed via CI/CD.\n\nOption B: ADLS Gen2 Data Lake (Parquet)\n\nThe Setup: Redirect the ADF metadata pipelines to write data as Parquet files to ADLS before loading into the DWH. Tho, this feels like significant engineering overhead for little benefit. I would need to manage/orchestrate two independent metadata pipelines to feed Dev and Prod Lake containers. But I will still need to somehow create a staging layer or db for both dev and prod so dbt can pick up from there as it cant natively connect to adls storage and ingest the data. So i need to use ADF again to go from the Data in the Lake to both environments seperately. \n\nAt 100GB, is the Data Lake approach over-engineered? If a source schema breaks the Prod load, it has to be fixed regardless of the storage layer. I just dont see the point of the Data Lake anymore. In case we wanna migrate in the future to Snowflake or smth a data lake would already been setup. Even tho even in that case I would simply create the Data Lake „quickly“ using ADFs copy activity and dump everything from the PROD Bronze DB into that Lake as a starting point. \n\nAny help is appreciated!",

        "author": "MitocondrialPoro",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hej all,\nI am running in to a metrics consistency problem in what felt like normal, decent architecture. But now it behaves more like a trains here in winter. Mostly works, until suddenly not.\n\nHere are the details.Data comes from:\n\n* Applications sending events to Kafka\n* Files landing in S3\n* A handful of databases (DB2, MySQL, Oracle)\n* A couple of SaaS systems\n\nFrom there:\n* NIghtly spark jobs on Databricks create curated tables\n* Some of these curated tables are pushed into Snowflake\n* We also have streaming jobs writing to both Databricks and Snowflake\n* Snowflake is shared across multiple tenants. Same account, separate warehouses, ACLs in place.\n\nOn architecture diagram this looks reasonable. In reality, documetnation is thin and mostcontrols are manual operational procedures. Management is crurently excited about “AI agents” than investing in proper orchestration or governance tooling, so we are working with what we have.\n\n**Problem**: A core metric, let’s call it DXI is calculated in Databricks using one curated table set, and in Snowflake suing another curated table set. Both sets are ultimately derived from the same upstream raw sources. Some pipelines flow through Kafka, others ingest directly from DB2 and land in Databricks before promotion to Snowflake. Sometimes the metric matches closely enough to be acceptable. Other times it diverges enough to raise eyebrows. There is no obvious pattern yet. \n\nWhat makes this awkward is that one of our corporate leaders explicitly suggested calculating the same KPI independently in both systems as a way to validate the architecture. It sounded clever at the time. Now it is escalating because the numbers do not match always and confidence in the architecture is getting shaky. \n\nThis architecture is around 7 years old. Built and modified by multiple people, many are no longer here. Tribal knowledge mostly evaporated over time. \n\n**Question**: Since I have inherited this situation, where should I start? Some options I am struggling with:\n\n* Valdiate transformation logic parity line by line across about 350+ pipelines that touch the raw data and see where things could be diverging? This will take me forever, and I am also not very well versed with some of the complex Spark stuff that is going on in Databricks.\n* The lineage tool we have seems to overly simplify the lineage by skipping steps between curated tables and raw sources and just points it as an arrow. It gives no concept of how this could have happened as there are many pipelines between those systems. This is probably the most frustrating part for me to deal with and I am this close to giving up hope on using it.\n* I do notice sporadic errors on the nightly runs of pipelines and there seems to be a correlation between those and when the KPI calculation diverges on following days. But the errors seem pretty widely spread out and don’t seem to have a discernible pattern. \n* In the process of trying to find the culprint, I have actually uncovered data loss due to type conversion on three places, which although not related the KPI directly, gives me the impression that there could be such issues lurking all over the place.\n\nI am trying to approach this systematically, not emotionally. At the moment it feels like chasing ghosts across two platforms. Would appreciate any input on how to structure the investigation..",

However, when I do this, Spark does not register any partition information in Glue table metadata.\n\n\n\nAs I understand, when we use hive, during writes, spark updates table metadata in Glue such as partition information by invoking UpdatePartition API. And therefore, when we write new partitions in Hive, we can get EventBridge notifications from Glue for events such as BatchCreatePartition. Also, when we invoke GetPartitions, we can get partition information from Glue Tables.\n\n\n\nI understand Iceberg works based on metadata and has a feature for hidden partitioning but I am not sure if this is the sole reason Spark is not registering metadata info with Glue table. This is causing various issues such as not being able to detect data changes in tables, not being able to run Glue Data Quality checks on selected partitions, etc. \n\n\n\nIs there a simple way I can get this partition change and update information directly from Glue?\n\n\n\nOne of the bad ways to do this will be to create S3 notifications, subscribe to those and then run Glue Crawler on those events, which will create another S3 based Glue table with the correct partition information. And then do DQ checks on this new table. I do not like this approach at all because I will need to setup significant automation to achieve this.",

Transformations are reusable from bronze until gold layer, depending on what one is familiar with, these can be SQL select statements or python notebooks or other processes but basically standard and reused in the data management as soon as you have landed the data within your platform.\n\nI’d like to follow the same approach to make integrations low cost and easier to establish. Low cost in the sense that you reuse components (logic app, event hub, etc) through parameterization which are then populated upon execution from a metadata table in SQL.

Would like to get Dev set up in the future, but it’s not ready today. \n\nBudget is limited.

I understand how, if I was using integers or natural keys, I can use order by on write and cluster\\_by to control how data is organized in micro partitions to achieve maximum query pruning. \n\nWhat I can’t understand is how this works when I switch to using hash keys - which are ultimately very random non-sequential strings. If I try to group my micro partitions by hash key value it will force the partitions to keep getting recreated as I “insert” new hash key values, rather then something like a “date/customer” natural key which would likely just add new micro partitions rather than updating existing partitions. \n\nIf I add date/customer to the fact as natural keys, don’t expose them to the users, and use them for no other purpose then incremental loading and micro partition organizing— does this actually help? I mean, isn’t snowflake going to ultimately use this hash keys which are unordered in my scenario?\n\nWhat’s the design pattern here? What am I missing? Thanks in advance.",

Seemed reasonable. I had no idea what I was about to walk into.\n\n\n\nThe first two hours were fine, I knew requests and BeautifulSoup from a tutorial. Then the site started blocking me and I had no idea why. Then I figured out rotating headers but the data was inconsistently structured across different listing types and my parser kept breaking in ways I couldn't predict. Then I realised I hadn't thought about where to actually store anything. Then I had to learn a bit of scheduling to make it run automaticly. Every single step opened three more questions I didn't know existed an hour earlier. I finished something working after about two weeks and it was genuinely one of the best learning experiences I've had, but I think the reason \"just build projects\" feels useless as advice is that nobody tells you the project will completley fall apart four times before it works and that is the actual point. If someone had told me upfront that constant breakage is the mechanism and not a sign I'm doing it wrong I would have panicked so much less in week one.

Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and IDEs. Common examples include manually renaming a symbol across many source code files, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (https://xkcd.com/1597/).\n\nAt least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier both during school and after graduation (most jobs do not formally teach these topics either).\n\nTo help mitigate this, the three of us developed a class, originally called Hacker Tools in 2019 and then renamed to Missing Semester in 2020 (some great past discussion here: https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/eyagda/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_mit/). Over the past several years, we’ve seen the course translated into over a dozen languages, inspire similar courses at other universities, and be adopted by several companies as part of their standard onboarding materials.\n\nBased on feedback and discussions here and elsewhere, along with our updated perspective from working in industry for several years, we have developed a new iteration of the course. The 2026 edition covers several new topics such as packaging/shipping code, code quality, agentic coding, and soft skills. Some things never change, though; we’re still using this hacky Python DSL for editing our multi-camera-angle lecture videos: https://github.com/missing-semester/videos.\n\nAs always, we’d love to hear any feedback from the community to help us improve the course content!\n\n—Anish, Jon, and Jose",

        "title": "How to Learn JavaScript - From a Dev With 10 Years in JS",
        "author": "nikolaymakhonin",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I want to share how I think you should learn JavaScript most effectively. My opinion is based only on my own experience, keep that in mind - I've never taught programming to anyone.\n\nTreat these tips as a roadmap you can use to understand where to go and how, but go wherever YOU want.\n\nThese tips work for many other languages too (C++, C#, PHP, Python, Java, ...), except maybe functional languages - I have no experience there.\n\nMy background: professional developer, around 20 years in different areas, self-taught my whole life, no courses whatsoever. Lots of experience with C++, C#, Java, PHP and JavaScript. Right now my main thing is JavaScript and frontend.\n\n---\n\n## Theory\n\nI think the fastest way to learn a programming language is to study its building blocks one by one - the pieces programs are made of - while clearly separating the language itself from applying the language to anything: libraries, frameworks, web page manipulation, algorithms, architecture, all that stuff.\n\nThe order for learning JavaScript should be roughly this:\n\n1. Data and how it's stored and processed in a computer\n2. Simple data types, including arrays\n3. Arithmetic and logical operations and expressions\n4. Core language constructs: if, switch/case, for, while, etc.\n5. Functions\n6. More complex data types: objects, maps, collections, ...\n7. Async programming. Async functions.\n8. OOP and Classes\n9. Iterators/Generators\n10. ...\n\nWhen you look for textbooks, the table of contents should roughly match this order. This way you'll at least have a learning plan and a rough idea of where you are - what you already know, what you don't yet. And you can skim the TOC to see what the language can do in general. This obviously doesn't mean you should throw away other textbooks and not read them.\n\nGradually, as you study the language itself, you can also start learning how it's applied. Since there are many different applications and it's unclear what a person will end up doing, I can't give any advice here. The one thing universal for all JavaScript development directions is the language itself in its pure form.\n\nAfter JavaScript you can also learn TypeScript. Many companies require this skill, for example in React development. TypeScript just adds type annotations to JavaScript - increases code readability, simplifies development, catches many errors while you're still writing code. It's much easier to learn than JavaScript itself.\n\nFull JavaScript documentation: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\nIt makes sense to reinforce what you learn by solving short simple problems. If the problems are too hard and too long, you might not get enough satisfaction from them. They shouldn't be too easy either, or they'll become boring routine.\n\nPractice should be sequential just like theory. Free JavaScript problem sets: [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nThere are also sites like CodeWars and CodeCombat - they have difficulty levels, but they're not for sequential learning, they're for training programming skills for people who already know the language.\n\nThe format in these problem sets is the same: you write code in one window, press Test, your code gets checked. At first it can be hard to understand, especially why everything is set up so complicated - might be worth watching some YouTube videos on this, where people explain it in detail including why problem sets are structured this way. This knowledge will be useful in real work too, because this approach to development is used a lot in practice.\n\n---\n\n## Interest and Motivation\n\n**What feeds motivation:**\n\n- A sense of beauty in the language, roughly the same as the beauty of pure non-applied math.\n- Knowledge that will stay relevant for a long time. What you learn about JavaScript and TypeScript probably won't go obsolete in the coming decades. JS is way too firmly stuck in web development, because to this day it's the only language you can directly write browser programs in. And the knowledge you get from learning JS will help you learn other languages easier, since JS has procedural programming, object-oriented, and elements of functional programming. These concepts are very similar across many languages.\n- Solving small problems\n- Wanting to run an experiment\n- Wanting to make a pile of money\n- Wanting to build your own project (better keep it short and within your abilities)\n- Motivation goes up when you successfully reach a goal. If goals are long and hard to achieve, motivation drops. If goals are too simple, achieving them turns into boring routine. Stay in the middle with everything: choosing textbooks, courses, problems, projects, experiments, etc.\n\n**What kills motivation:**\n\n- Contempt. \"JavaScript is shit.\" You can find plenty of flaws in JavaScript, no doubt. You can just know about them, keep them in mind, without feeling any negative emotions about it. And it's worth remembering - what matters in evaluating a language isn't a list of its pros and cons, but whether you can solve complex problems quickly and simply using this language in its area. My answer - absolutely yes.\n- Perfectionism.\n- Forcing yourself to finish a project, study a boring topic, complete a dull course. Early on you might have tons of unfinished projects and skipped topics you lost interest in, and that's great. It means perfectionism isn't running the show.\n- Wanting to read a textbook in strict order. Not wanting to try other textbooks or other courses until you finish the current ones. There's no single track for everyone.\n- Trying to push through a hard topic when your brain has already given up. At first it will be hard, and you need to let your brain rest and digest more often. Rest is a very important part of learning. Rest when you want to, as much as you want, and come back to learning when you feel like it.\n- Obsessions. If you want to kill your interest in programming for a long time or forever, obsessions are perfect for that. They'll suck all the energy and interest out of you, and when you come to your senses it'll be too late.\n\n---\n\n## Other Tips\n\n- **Marathon.** If you want to learn the language fast and start earning, learning to program shouldn't turn into playing in a sandbox - otherwise you'll spend a bunch of time on fun stuff with pictures, and end up not even reaching beginner level. To learn programming you have to strain your brain, let it rest, then strain it again, getting stronger each time, absorbing more material, same as people build muscle. The brain doesn't restructure and train overnight. Learning programming is a marathon over a very long distance. This marathon doesn't have to be self-torture though - straining your brain can actually be pleasant, and thinking about moving toward your goal is even more pleasant.\n\n- **You don't need to learn everything.** There's a lot of information, but not all of it is relevant right now, and of course you don't need to memorize everything down to the last detail. Often it's enough to just remember that a language feature exists - place short bookmarks in your head or in your notes, like markers on a map, so you can recall when needed that this feature exists and study it in more detail. No point loading your brain with things you're not using right now and won't use often in the future. Following this will seriously cut down your learning time and unload your brain. In the end, you'll remember well whatever you use often in practice - and that's the ideal use of your memory.\n\n- **Goal and path to goal.** To learn the language fast, you also need to move in the right direction. And to move in the right direction, you need to understand the end goal, the intermediate steps toward it, at least a rough plan. The main goal for a beginner, in my opinion, should be getting a job as an intern or Junior developer, because the real programming learning happens during actual work, especially if there's a mentor at work. Knowing this goal, you can build a rough plan to get there - for example find out what specific skills and knowledge most popular job listings require.\n\n- **Mentor.** To move in the right direction you also need to understand what's worth spending time on and what's not. A beginner can't figure this out, because you'd already need a lot of programming experience to know all these nuances. So early on a mentor will be useful - a person who is an experienced programmer themselves and can suggest the right direction, what to do and how, do code review, point out mistakes, answer questions, etc. This is common practice, many companies hire outside mentors to guide beginners.\n\n- **English.** English is very important in programming, but not because programming languages themselves are in English, or because many docs and books are in English - that's all small stuff. The main thing is being able to communicate with clients, managers, and other programmers who don't speak your native language. This skill will seriously expand your job search options, and to much higher-paying jobs at that.\n\n- **AI as a mentor.** LLM can work as a mentor for beginners but its expertise not enough for middle level. It also gives good suggestions for online services and textbooks.\n\n- **Deep understanding of the language.** Being able to read practically any code, understand it, execute it in your head - this really helps with understanding other people's code, debugging, designing. With this skill you get more ideas, you can find better solutions by eliminating impossible ones, and so on. It also helps with learning, since many ideas and algorithms are easier to express as code. A programming language is also, to some degree, a language programmers communicate with each other in. Often in their conversations you'll hear - stop talking, show me the code. Understanding every little thing in code really simplifies design, debugging, keeping code clean and quality, finding best solutions. Worth striving for - seek out things you don't understand and dig into them.\n\n- **Patterns.** Most of programming isn't inventing something from scratch, not reinventing wheels, but reusing template code over and over. There are thousands of these patterns and there's no point learning them all. They get remembered on their own as you gain programming experience, read other people's code, and pick up their ideas. Good code patterns for different tasks can be found at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), though even there you sometimes find upvoted garbage code.\n\n- **Rubber duck method.** If you can't figure out what the bug is in your program, try going through it step by step, explaining EVERY detail so that even a rubber duck sitting next to you would understand it all. This same method is often used to make sure there are no bugs in a program - I use it every time after writing a chunk of code, reviewing it and executing it in my head.\n\n- **Step-by-step debugging.** Step-by-step debugging tools really help you understand your own code, find bugs, make sure your understanding of the code matches reality. During step-by-step debugging you can literally watch code execute step by step and look at variable values on each step. This really helps when learning the language, understanding how everything works inside. You can run step-by-step JavaScript debugging in the browser, in DevTools - just paste code into the console but write the word `debugger` before the code. I use this when I need to make sure there are no obvious algorithm errors in complex code.\n\n- **Research skills.** Research is a very important and inseparable part of developing anything. Pick up any task - pretty much any of them requires research, unless you already have experience doing the exact same task. Research is basically finding the best answer to questions like: what tool to use here, how to organize the code, what architecture to apply to this task, what are this tool's capabilities, how to solve this, etc. Research is basically a mini scientific paper, because it's done using the scientific method: gather information, generate ideas, test ideas, pick the best one.\n\n- **Self-learning skills.** You need to keep learning the entire time you work as a programmer, constantly raising your level. Even if a programmer manages to land in a niche where there's nothing left to learn - learned everything, just work - most likely that'll be boring low-paying work with higher competition and less interest, because you're doing the same thing all the time. The best and highest-paid specialists are those who can solve any problems, including the hardest and seemingly unsolvable ones. That is the programmer's job after all - solving problems brought by clients, which are often complex or unusual. And you can only become that kind of specialist with self-learning skills and the ability to do independent research.",

I like systems logic, but complex calculus or advanced statistics kind of turns me down a bit (I could still learn and refresh my memory, if necessary)\n\n1) Is Python backend development \"math-heavy\" in the real world, or is that only for AI/Data Science? Would Java be a safer \"low-math\" haven for me? \n\n2) Is it worth pivoting to Java now to avoid the high saturation of Python juniors, even if Java feels \"stricter\" and a bit more difficult to get into?\n\n3) Should I stick to the Boot.dev course, learn OOP and DSA in that course, and then switch? What do you suggest? They have Linux, SQL and git courses.\n\n​My Goal: > I want to reach a Junior Backend role (Chilean corporate or INTERNATIONAL remote) where I can actually grow, as soon as humanly possible.  (Of course aiming to work in a position that I like)\n\n​Thanks for any career advice. Just trying to build a stable future for my kid.\n\nTL;DR: 30yo, Chile. CS Degree in 2018. Wasted 7 years in a dead-end, unrelated job. Now \"speedrunning\" a comeback via Boot.dev. I want a Backend role ASAP, but I'm worried about \"Math traps\" in Python and market saturation.\n",

But idk if those are actually good or just shortcuts that'll bite me later.\n\nI'm not a complete beginner to coding - did some python and javascript stuff before - but never built an actual mobile app. Would it be better to just dive into the native android stuff or should i look at some of these easier platforms first to get something working?\n\nWhat path would you guys recommend for someone who wants to actually learn properly but also not spend 6 months before having anything to show? Also any tools you recommend that can help me get a quick MVP built would be very helpful. Ty in advance!",

Helps in the moment but doesn't seem to stick long-term.\n\nAnki flashcards: For syntax and common patterns. Jury's still out on whether this is actually useful for programming. Feels weird flashcarding code.\n\nTalking through concepts out loud: When I finally understand something, like really grasp WHY a list comprehension works the way it does and not just how to type one, I talk through it out loud and record it in Willow Voice. The transcript goes into a concepts folder I can review. Explaining it out loud cements it way better than just reading about it, and I have notes in my own words to reference later. This has been the most useful method so far, honestly.\n\nSmall projects: Trying to apply each new concept in a tiny project instead of just doing textbook exercises.

I will act as the project manager and senior advisor by guiding development, offering mentorship and unblocking any issues that come up.  The final result will be an open source project that you can use in your portfolio. \n\nThe group will be run like a real life software company.  You’ll learn how to work in an agile environment, do code reviews, build pipelines, how to develop a real life product with a team, and more. \n\n**About you**:\n\nThe ideal candidate is someone who has little to no professional experience but is eager to learn and break into tech. Must be at least 18 years of age.  Must be willing to put in at least a few hours per week, and must be friendly and kind.\n\n**About me:** \n\nI am a senior software engineer who has some time on his hands after working for a very successful startup that was acquired last year.  I was self taught and leaned on others online heavily to learn early in my career and would like to pay it forward.\n\nLeave a comment or drop me a DM if you’d be interested in a program like this.

Recently I started learning backend development and decided to build a purely backend focused project to actually understand how things work beyond tutorials.\n\nI built a CRUD API for a social media style application with users, posts, and votes tables. Creating the routes with FastAPI felt surprisingly straightforward at first. Authentication, however, was a completely different story. Integrating JWT took me a few days of going through videos, debugging, and trying to understand what was really happening under the hood. Eventually I got it working, which felt like a small breakthrough.\n\nFor the database, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy as the ORM to define my schemas. I also set up Alembic for migrations, which helped me understand how schema versioning works in real projects. That part made the project feel much more realistic.\n\nAfter finishing the core functionality, I realized that writing endpoints is only half the job. They need to be tested properly. So I created a tests directory and used pytest to cover different scenarios and edge cases. That was another learning curve, especially figuring out test databases and dependency overrides.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for me was Docker. I had never containerized an application before, and initially it felt overwhelming. But after spending time reading the docs and experimenting, I finally managed to dockerize the app. That moment felt like a genuine win.\n\nI know this is still a basic backend project and there is a lot more to learn, like proper deployment and scaling. I am thinking of adding a load simulation using Locust to test with 1000 plus virtual users just to explore performance aspects.\n\nIt may not be groundbreaking, but it feels like real progress to me. I am excited to keep improving it.\n\nAlso, if anyone can suggest free platforms where I can deploy this as a college student, I would really appreciate it.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Without the external structure of a classroom, I find it nearly impossible to maintain consistency. On the other hand, I recently tried a bootcamp, but I couldn't finish it. The combination of rigid deadlines and my tendency to procrastinate (classic ADHD paralysis) meant I fell behind and couldn't catch up.\n\n**My situation:**\n\n* **Long-term goal:** I want to get a University degree, but that is a long-term project for my current life situation. I want to start learning *now* so I’m prepared when I finally enroll.\n* **The struggle:** If a course is too \"go at your own pace,\" I lose focus. If it has high-pressure deadlines without face-to-face interaction, I burn out.\n* **What I’m looking for:** Are there specific resources, platforms, or study methods that provide \"soft structure\"? Perhaps something gamified, or communities that offer body-doubling/co-working sessions for beginners?\n\nFor those of you with ADHD who are now working as devs: How did you bridge the gap between \"wanting to learn\" and actually \"doing the work\" before you had the structure of a formal job or degree?\n\nThanks in advance!",

It does validation in Zod and then is added to the DB. This is kindof a different related service on its own but handles the same data.\n**Database** - Currently PostgreSQL queried with Sequelize. \n\nThese will be deployed to two different Cloud Runs (serverless) services on GCP where the ingestion service is scheduled and then there's the app. Haven't decided yet about where the DB is going to be ultimately but maybe CloudSQL makes sense and that integrates well with Looker studio analytics tool.\n\nFor my use case TypeScript and a relational db makes more sense as there are many related tables and also data integrity of these business deals is important so schema validation needs to work well here.\n\nHowever, the amount of different columns in my tables is now around 30 and there might be more later so querying might become a bit performance expensive especially when there's eventually gonna be thousands of entries, if not tens of thousands.\n\nAlso as a sidenote, I am later contemplating a chatbot AI like feature in the app which could use some form of NL2Query solution to get requested deal information from inquiries eg. \"How many people are assigned for x particular deals from last month?\" \n\nEverything except the frontend is set up and works well already and the amount of users and data is not that large yet.\n\nI guess my question is whether rethinking the REST and moving into GraphQL would be better for this use case instead of just keeping things as is and using Elasticsearch if more effective inqueries are needed?\n\nThanks!",

        "author": "MindlessAssistance52",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nSo I am at chapter 21 of the book, and the author has finished building a \"add/subtract unit\" part of the CPU. \n\nhttps://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter21/\n\nMy confusion is about the subtract part of the arithmetic unit. When we start a subtraction, we use the opcode \"10\", which forces a CI of 1 for the two's complement operation. (Which ends up giving something like A + B inverted + 1) This is done for the first pair of bytes for a multibyte number. Afterwards, the next pairs are treated using the Opcode of \"11\".\n\nThe actual CY In has no effect at this stage (Opcode 10), so the only things we are left with are the first part of the sum and a potential Carry out.\n\nPreviously, the author built something called a \"triple byte accumulator\" which was a precursor (https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter20/) where when doing a subtraction using two's complement, if you had a carry out generated during the operation, it would end up being used in the middle byte part, and if the middle byte sum ended up producing a carry out as well, it would end up being used in the high byte part of the operation of the 24 bit number.\n\nNow, the author, for some unknown reason to me, has introduced two \"XOR gates\" at the input and ouput of the arithmetic unit. He doesn't mention anything about them besides : \n\n> This is a little different from the circuits shown in the book in that the values of both CY In and CY Out are inverted for subtraction. (The entry in the lower-right corner of the table on page 322 should be inverted CY)\n\nIn the book, at the point where I am, nothing is mentioned as to why or what is done with those inverted signals.\n\nDuring addition (Opcodes of 00 or 01), those XOR gates have no effect whatsoever as if they did not exist. When subtraction/\"addition in two's complement\" is done, they do invert the Carry out signal of the adder ... but here is the strange thing:\n\nif my adder produces a Carry output of 1 , the XOR transforms it to 0 ... and when this tranformed signal is used in the next part of the operation for the next pair of bytes, the XOR gate at the input \"undoes\" the 0 so we end up having a raw bit of 1 ... as if nothing actually happened. The same logic happens if my carry output produces a 0, it is transformed to 1, and when it is fed back to the CY In, the XOR gates undoes the effect and we end up with a 0 again as the input to the adder.\n\nClearly, then, those gates are not affecting the function of the actual \"subtraction\" and everything is functioning as I would expect it to. My question then would be : why exactly is the author adding those two XOR gates?\n\nThe only reason I could think of is those inverted signals are going to serve some (unknown) use later on, but outside of that I can't really think of anything else.\n\nAny help or guidance would be much appreciated...",

        "content": "First-year CS student here.\n\nI understand that many companies have already integrated AI tools into their development workflows, and I know that learning how to use them effectively will only become more important over time. At the same time, I really want to make sure I build a strong foundation in core computer science/programming concepts.\n\nWhat I don’t want is to become overly dependent on AI and skip the deep thinking required to truly understand the material. But I also don’t want to fall behind people who have mastered prompt engineering and can use AI to scaffold and deploy a functional CRUD app in an afternoon.\n\nSo I guess my question is:\n\nHow do you balance learning the fundamentals while still keeping up with AI tools? Should beginners avoid AI at first? Is there a right time to start integrating it into your workflow?",

I decided I'd rather spend my time learning some skills (i also started learning japanese for recreation) than playing video games and doom scrolling in social media.

Maybe one in Python and one in R? Bonus points if it's economics adjacent.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nP.S. To add some context, I've played around with linear and nonlinear regression before, as well as with very light data cleaning. On the other hand, I have no clue what an API is or what Git / version control might mean (beyond a few preliminary Google searches). As for survey design, I can imagine it might require an outsized amount of effort to incorporate into a project, so I'm not too hung up on including it if I can just teach myself the basic theory instead.",

        "content": "Hi, I'm working on a function to detect threefold repetition for a simple chess engine. Since C doesn't have dynamic lists, I decided to implement the board history using a linked list. Now I’m running into some weird bugs: the function sometimes detects a draw after four identical positions, and sometimes it says the game is drawn even if a position has occurred only twice. I tried printing the board every time it gets compared to the last board, and every board that has been played gets compared to the last one (as it should). Here's the function and the nodes:\n\n    struct Position { \n        char position[64];\n        char turn; int ep_square;\n        // 0 = nobody can castle, 1 = white can castle, 2 = black can castle, 3 = both can castle \n        int castling_queen; \n        int castling_king; \n        struct Position* next; }; \n    \n    static struct Position history_init = { \n        .position = { 'r','n','b','q','k','b','n','r',\n                      'p','p','p','p','p','p','p','p',\n                        /* ... empty squares ... */  \n                      'P','P','P','P','P','P','P','P',\n                      'R','N','B','Q','K','B','N','R' \n                    }, \n        .turn = 'w', \n        .ep_square = -1, // 'ep' means en passant \n        .castling_king = 0, \n        .castling_queen = 0, \n        .next = NULL };\n    \n    static struct Position* history_end = &history_init; \n    int is_3fold_rep(){ \n        struct Position* this_history = &history_init; \n        struct Position* last_history = history_end; \n        const char* desired_position = last_history -> position; \n        const char desired_turn = last_history -> turn; \n        const int desired_castling_king = last_history -> castling_king; \n        const int desired_castling_queen = last_history -> castling_queen; \n        const int desired_ep_square = last_history -> ep_square; \n    \n        int repetitions = 0; \n        while (this_history != NULL){ \n            int castling_match = (this_history->castling_king == desired_castling_king) && (this_history->castling_queen == desired_castling_queen); \n            int ep_square_match = this_history->ep_square == desired_ep_square; \n            int turn_match = this_history->turn == desired_turn; \n            int rights_match = castling_match && ep_square_match && turn_match; \n            if (rights_match && memcmp(this_history->position, desired_position, 64) == 0){ \n                repetitions++; \n            } \n        this_history = this_history->next; \n        } \n        return repetitions >= 3; \n    }\n\nIf the snippet isn't clear you can check out full code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Puupalikka/simple-chess-engine). The idea is to compare all of the previous states to the last one, and count the identical positions.",

Deleting all python extensions and their files then reinstalling them (works only for few hours then the problem returns)\n2. upgrading/downgrading python, python extensions.\n3. changing the python locator in VSC settings from native to js (solved the problem for few weeks then it suddenly returned back and this solution no longer works)\n4. reloading the windows and clearing workspaces cache.\n5.

The weird thing is, I keep noticing these parallels between logic games on the LSAT and writing conditional statements. When I'm building if/else chains or tracing through nested loops, it genuinley feels similar to solving a sequencing game where you have to track which constraints apply in what order. My brain seems to latch onto that kind of structured reasoning pretty fast.\n\n\n\nBut I'm also running into walls my LSAT brain completley can't help with. Syntax errors are brutal because I'll understand the logic perfectly and still forget a colon or mess up an indentation and the whole script breaks. LSAT trained me to reason on paper in the abstract, so the hands-on debugging side feels like a totally seperate skill that I haven't even started building yet. Has anyone transitioned from a logic-heavy non-tech background into programming? Im genuinely unsure if my prep gives me a real edge or if I'm basically starting from zero in terms of what actually matters here.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking for quite a while about designing a loop-centric programming language, and during my research I came across the theoretical LOOP language associated with Dennis Ritchie, who has always been one of my biggest inspirations.\n\nThe project I’m working on is called Gamma Loop. It’s a transpiled language, with the transpiler written entirely in C. The idea behind this choice is to keep the toolchain lightweight, portable, and fast, while still leveraging mature C compilers for optimisation and broad platform support. The goal is not to compete with mainstream languages, but to explore a minimal, loop-driven design that could be useful for specific niche or experimental applications.\n\nConceptually, I’m focusing on making iteration the central abstraction of the language. Rather than treating loops as just another control structure, the idea is to build the language around them as the primary computational mechanism. The syntax is intentionally minimal and structured, and I’m aiming for clarity over feature density.\n\nAt this stage, I’m mainly interested in feedback from a theoretical and language-design perspective:\n\n1.Does a loop-centric paradigm offer meaningful conceptual advantages?\n\n2.Would such a design be interesting from a computability or formal methods standpoint?\n\n\t\n\nI’d really appreciate any thoughts, criticism, or references.",

Though I have a windows vm setup it is not nearly as nice as doing everything on my orginal system. I also do not like video lessons, like in 1 too much, but 2. seems too short. For 3 I am unsure about if it may be going much more in depth than I need. Also I am afraid I might have problems with the distro, since I want to stay on arch during the course / book.\n\nI have decent-ish understanding of computer architecture, since I have completed the game \"turing complete\" halwayish. The same also applies for C.\n\n I don't have really a purpose for ASM right now, I just want to learn new stuff and be able to go more low level. Someday I may use the skills for malware analysis, though I am very much uncertain about this.\n\nIf anyone has another resource that they would recommend over the ones listed, please tell me about it.\n\nThanks.",

So far the plugin works: it cycles through the animations and loops correctly. The bug is: during the text animations, any cell that precedes the first character of the text is rendered without any formatting - a leading black bar. This bar will move, lengthen, and shorten as the text animates.   \n  \nI have tried many things to force the default terminal background to match my regular background (#282828) but none of them have stuck. Any block of code in tte.lua that is commented with an XXX is something I have tried that doesn't work. I've looked at the source code for tte and some old nvim-terminal bug fixes but AI isn't helping and I'm grasping at straws now.  \n  \nRequirements:  \n- tte in your path: [tte](https://github.com/ChrisBuilds/terminaltexteffects) (installed with pipx)  \n- nvim  \n- a non-empty text file, mine is at /tmp/tte-input.txt  \n  \nReproduce:  \n- Open nvim with tte.lua in your plugins and tte in your path  \n- :TTEStart opens a window with tte looping  \n- You should see the black leading bar.  \n  \nAttachments:  \n- Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/KyJcPRw](https://imgur.com/a/KyJcPRw)  <--- this is not a screenshot of code  \n- My init.lua: [https://www.fragbin.com/r/EH9JIX6](https://www.fragbin.com/r/EH9JIX6)  \n- tte.lua: [https://www.fragbin.com/r/X11YG](https://www.fragbin.com/r/X11YG)  \n  \nAny help would be greatly appreciated!  \n  \nEdit: I use [nvim-xresources](https://github.com/martineausimon/nvim-xresources) to set my nvim color palette  \nEdit: The animation colorshift doesn't actually move the first character.

I have a project which is configured with the help of stm32 cube mx and has its own core/Drivers/.ioc files. It is like a ground for using the processor together with other external modules, like sensors, flash chip, LED drivers which are on the same PCB together with the MCU. I have two products using a processor of this family - one is with 64 pins and other with 100 pins. But they have basiccally the same hardware design and use the same pin mapping and peripherals as close as possible to one another. So both can use the same ground project and its configuration and picking different peripherals based on needs. The customer interface is defined separately, in a project that used to be called Application where MMI part is. It is a higher level project and does not need to know what hw there is. Before it was possible to have the ground project as a submodule to  a couple of application projects and it was building with a different IDE and MCU (another producer)   \nI have not found still how this option can work with STM32 IDE. If I create an app project in the IDE and add Ground project I get error about not finding a directory although I have added all necessary folders in the Include paths. I want the .ioc / core /drivers to be used drom the ground project and not create a new one. I linked the ground project to the app project but did not help.   \n Is there a way to use another STM32 project as a subproject (or ground) and change only the main project (Application). and in case the subproject changes to easily pull the updated one into several main projects.   \nI will appreciate any tips and advice. ",

While this is legally protected in theory the reality is taking such a leave shakes confidence in your management's faith in you to deliver. \n\nWhen I returned from FMLA I was pressured through covert means into leaving the company because, of course, letting me go for the reasons I took my FMLA directly would've been illegal.\n\nFast forward to my current position I made the mistake of casually mentioning to my manager in a 1:1 the medical conditions I deal with that caused me to take FMLA at my last job. Now every other week he asks me if im okay. His confidence in me is shaken and its probably the beginning of the end.\n\nWith how cooked the current job market is there is no mercy in this industry. You must be a robot of productivity with no human condition or you will be pushed out and replaced by AI, offshoring, or some well connected nepo baby willing to work 60 hours a week for junior salary.\n\n2026 has no mercy",

The funniest part is that the system supposed to replace those awful coders is built by the coders themselves.\n\nPerhaps it’s time us coders focused on replacing someone else's job instead of their own. I like the idea of replacing CEOs and managers by creating a solution that uses AI and an internal integration layer to make the best possible decisions. By combining all available company data, market data, and projections, it would make CEOs and managers mostly irrelevant (except, maybe, for some PR). This would ensure only founders or the board are needed, while the best executive decisions are made via an AI management layer.\n\nI think this is an inevitable part of management anyway, but I must admit I do like the idea of disrupting the people who can't wait to replace the people whose work they know nothing about.\n\nAnyway, I have over 15 years of development experience across multiple fields. If this sounds like something fun to build, if for nothing else, just to be able to start making posts about how all CEOs and managers will soon be replaced by AI, then get in touch.",

It started with using it as a accessory with basic plan to current state where each developer has $3500 limit (which also they increase happily) of pay per use after the standard 500 requests are exhausted.\n\n  \nThe engineering leadership has explicitly asked engineers to **not write code manually** their stand is to perform every aspect of development via cursor only. Bug analysis, technical design ( hld or lld), code implementation, test case design , tests implementation everything is forced via cursor. The JIRA timelines are set as such that even if you want to go through code manually or want to write code manually you won't be able to and their answer is to use cursor to do analysis and everything. Cursor usage is tracked and people with highest usage are awarded ( literally).\n\n  \nI want to understand how to navigate this shift. Skills of understanding or writing code doesn't seem to matter now or learning different tools ( like docker etc etc )or tech stacks seems futile. When this ai wave started learning Rag, loRa , vector indexes and all made sense but now it only come down to how good you prompt and having basic understanding of software development cycles.\n\n  \nPlease suggest on how to upgrade to navigate this shift also is level of cursor adoption happening in all orgs?",

I mean, aren’t there many other jobs or fields they can do as well with a degree in CS? We dont necessarily have to pursue SDE/SWE-esque roles and leetcode all day?\n\nI’ve personally done 3 internships before and none of them relate to coding so I’m just wondering what’s this sentiment about being told to switch majors if one is not good at programming.

Have been wanting to hop for a mid-level promo, but have stuck on my current team due to the competitive job market.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was notified that I'm being put on a pip/ focus by my manager. There are a variety of ways that this could play out, but I'm only interested in two:\n\n1. Pass the pip. If I grind out the project, I think there's a fair chance that I could make it. My team is already -2 headcount I don't think my manager wants to lose me. Doing so would likely make getting a promotion or swapping teams hard/ impossible so that I'd need to switch companies anyway, though. The main benefits would be that I could more easily come back to the company later (no black mark for failing the pip), and/ or more time to find another job.\n2. Fail the pip and take the severance. This should let me *barely* hit my RSU vest date, and would give me 60 days of severance to find a new job. Including the time spent on pip/ focus, I'd have 4-5 months to interview and find something new. Since I'm looking to jump anyway, this option is appealing (2 months of free pay), but I'd have a black mark that would make it difficult to rejoin the same company again in the future.\n\nWhat should I do in this situation? I've also heard that taking FMLA can be beneficial during focus, but I'm not sure exactly how, as I'm not on a visa.",

I’m asking for names of non-fanatical researchers and engineers to listen to or read.  \nMost of the replies just prove my point. Even when I try to ask for resources, I end up being pulled into one side of the debate.  \n  \n\\---\n\nI’m a newly graduated computer engineer. After a few months without a job, I decided to prepare for a government engineering exam for a stable, well-paid position. If I fail, I’ll return to job hunting. While studying, I still follow tech news and social media, where I see extreme views about AI/LLMs either denying they’re real or claiming there will be no jobs left.\n\nPersonally, I use it for learning, translating (even after writing this text, I told AI to fix grammar mistakes without changing my text), and of course coding small projects that I don’t really care about, like a habit tracker or my static Jekyll blog. I believe it’s a great tool that will make our jobs easier, and the only bad thing I think we programmers might face is being pushed toward more productivity. I know ai is a new trend too, while interviewing on school I got pushed to add LLM to random apps that have zero usability like LLM powered graduation system etc. So I see myself at center. But both sides of the internet disagree with me, and I’m confused.\n\n**The Anti-AI** side claims the AI boom will collapse and disappear, leaving only old AI generated artifacts behind. They reject LLMs entirely. I disagree. if companies can make money from it, it won’t just vanish. They call entire LLM products slop (yes %90 of them are) but they get frustrated even when someone uses AI voice with their own voice.  \n**The Pro-AI** side, on the other hand, says the AI bubble isn’t real and that if I don’t use AI everywhere, I’m doomed. They claim art and desk jobs are already dead. I don’t think that’s true either, at least for now. Many self-proclaimed “prompt engineers” don’t understand what good code actually looks like. It may work today on one machine, but that doesn’t mean it’s reliable everywhere.\n\n**TL;DR:** I’ve noticed social media is extremely polarized about AI. One side says it’s fake and will collapse, the other says it will replace all jobs and you’re doomed without it. I personally see AI as a useful tool that improves productivity, but not as something that will either disappear or completely replace human work.\n\nSo my question is: I believe these two separate groups are in huge echo chambers that only hear what they want, and I just can’t research and learn about AI technologies without entering those chambers of insanity. I would love to learn from people who are trying to share information instead of propaganda. I would really appreciate it if you could share what you read or watch.",

The only reason I can think that this wouldn't happen is if they discover some serious deficiency or red flag in you, but I'm guessing that that's not the case with most people who get rejected after a final round, most people got rejected because there was someone else who was just a little bit better (I'm making an assumption there so feel free to challenge that assumption if you think I'm wrong).\n\nThe reason I ask is because I've made it to multiple final rounds in the past few months and got rejected, but most of these companies are large companies with many very similar positions.\n\nI'd be interested to know the thoughts of those with hiring experience.",

The linking between notes is genuinely useful.\n- Willow Voice for quick voice capture. If I just solved a tricky bug or made a design decision, I talk through my reasoning for a couple minutes and drop the transcript into Obsidian later. Faster than writing and I capture more of my actual thought process this way.\n- GitHub issues/PRs for code-specific decisions. I try to be thorough in PR descriptions because future-me always thanks present-me.\n- Todoist for daily task tracking. Just a dumping ground so nothing lives in my head.\n- A daily standup note in Obsidian. 3 bullets: what I did yesterday, what I'm doing today, blockers. Takes 2 minutes, saves me from blanking in standup.\n\nThe voice capture part was honestly the missing piece.

I've been here a little over 6 months at this point. I spent my first 3 years out of college as the first employee at a tiny aerospace startup, then 1.5 years working on automated fruit sorting before getting laid off and being out of a job for 10ish months. When I got this job, I felt so grateful to be employed again. \n\nHowever, now at the six month mark, I'm struggling with something of an existential crisis. For the first time in my career, I don't feel any sort of connection to my work, and I'm working without any sort of drive or passion. My previous jobs, I felt like there were real stakes, not just numbers on an investor's sheet. \n\nI like the people I work with quite a bit, but at this company, like many others I'm sure, the LLM bug is *strong*. Frequently when you have a question, someone's answer is \"have you asked Claude?\" It's maddening to me. I cut my teeth on actual research and engineering, so when I had questions, I had to hit the books. Now I'm...supposed to ask a neural network-powered auto-summarizer. \n\nCombine these things with the constant drumbeat of people saying \"we're automating ourselves out of a job\" and it really is wearing me down. I genuinely disagree with that sentiment, I know there'll continue to be a need for software engineers. But all of those things put together has me really questioning my place and my career choice, whether or not I'm betraying my own ideals, etc. I started working on my master's at my last job, and I find myself wondering what the point of this degree will even be once it's done, just because of how everything looks and sounds right now. \n\nTo anyone out there with more experience than me, I'd really appreciate your advice on navigating this. I recognize that the LLM part in particular is a pretty sizable paradigm shift that we're all dealing with, but I have to imagine some of this sounds familiar to some greybeards out there. \n\nThanks so much for reading my ramble, hope to hear from you.\n\nSigned,\nA Lost Engineer",

One day, someone on the team triggered this bug, causing a huge problem. I brought up to my manager that this kind of bug is not normal. I offered to perhaps fix it, and offered multiple “levels” of fixes, with the most minimal being a 2 line change that’s forward-facing so at least it wouldn’t happen *again*\n\nHe said I had no idea what I was doing, said I was lying on my resume, and told me whatever I learned in the past doesn’t matter here because this company is simply **better** than whatever companies I worked at before. He said he didn’t want to hear me talk about it again. He instructed me to “document the process” of adding a string to the i18n. It almost seemed like the frontend was so flimsy, they didn’t want anyone to touch it unless *absolutely necessary*.\n\nOn the same note with that i18n, I noticed that the plurals were… all just wrong. People would have strings like “10 user(s) online”. I told them that this doesn’t work in other languages, and they asked me to prove it was actually a problem. I went through the spanish translations and pointed out at least 20, and a couple extra in other languages. I proposed using a built-in \\`Intl\\` library, and they said I was way overcomplicating things and that I still haven’t proved there’s a problem because they “don’t speak any language other than english” and “didn’t understand what was wrong with the spanish translation”. I didn’t really know how to respond; I showed them in google translate using “el angel” and “los angeles”, but they kept insisting I was making problems where none existed\n\nWhenever I talk to anyone at work about anything, it feels like I’m expending “good will tokens”. Like even just asking a simple yes/no question will take a week of work to earn back. I reeeeeally don’t like talking to anyone I work with, at any company I’ve been at. I can’t tell if I’m doing something wrong that’s pissing people off, so I try to lay low and do nothing wrong. Whatever technical skills I have seem more or less worthless these days, honestly. Sure, give me a ticket and I’ll get it done very quickly with thorough unit/integration/e2e tests before the deadline… but… **something** is gonna go wrong after that and none of that will matter\n\nI’m just wondering, is this what it’s like for most people, or is it like… genuinely me that’s the problem?",

I graduated back in 2017 with a B.S in CS. \n\nSo I am trying to seek best path forward to pivot my career to either Backend development or preferably machine learning. \n\nI have heard alot about online masters degrees like omscs but also heard about how they are only useful if you do internships. Due to financial commitments, I cant just quit my job so I need to work to pay the bills and study in my spare time. \n\nWhat are your advice in regards to ways to pivot my path? \n\nThinking out loud getting a masters degree seems like a good idea but my concerns are :   \n1. Does it actually make a difference without internships?  \n2. It requires 3 letters of recommendation and it has been so long I dont think any of my professors even remember me or are even teaching to be able to ask for letters recommendation specially since back then there were not many internships or school projects for me to actually have more meaningful interactions with them. I also have only maybe 1 or 2 manager recommendations I may be able to acquire from work. \n\n  \nAny advice is much appreciated. ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey,\n\nI graduated with a CS degree two years ago, and have been working for 1.5 yrs now in an SME.\n\nThe first year was fairly typical. There were some web development projects for a client, where I was a junior dev in the team doing fullstack. Although there was some crunch, I got to learn a lot of skills hands-on.\n\nThe last few months however, the company has begun to lay off most devs. There's 3-4 devs on this product, and what concerns me is that we're now building it pretty much entirely with tools like Claude and Antigravity aiming to get it done fast. Granted, the lead is experienced and knows his fundamentals very well, and he did lot of the development himself before I came onto the project, so the project is likely not a lost cause.\n\nI'm mainly concerned about my own career growth. Don't get me wrong, I use Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity a lot when I'm stuck, and try to learn the concepts from there.\n\nBut I feel like I don't really learn as much about the fundamentals, languages and frameworks used, etc. when I just spit prompts to Antigravity to fix errors, build this or implement X feature - and for that to be the development process. I don't know if it'll be good for my career development in future. I kind of have to vibe-code for now though, since deadlines are tight and I'm expected to be 10x more productive with AI.\n\nThe working hour expectations are a secondary thing - there's been periods throughout of working on weekends, after hours, maybe public holidays. I think that's a give-or-take thing though, where I've got to set my own boundaries. Besides, my friends in other industries seem to have it worse.\n\nTherefore, I'm kind of considering looking for another software dev job where I have the leeway and time to do things more manually and learn skills better. Heck, pivoting and being a BA is something I've been interested in doing for a while now. But how widespread is kind of AI usage in other companies? If many companies are doing this, maybe I shouldn't rush into things.\n\nAny advice for me to proceed from here? I've also got a side project going on, if that helps.\n\nThanks!",

For example, the software engineers that work for me are underpaid level 2 engineers. No matter how hard they work, they have no chance of getting to the next level unless we can prove to the company that we have some need for a level 3 engineer. I have a couple of engineers who are very ambitious and have made it clear that they want to advance. They're willing to do whatever it takes, but the hard truth is that their chances of advancing have almost nothing to do with their work.\n\nAs I understood HR,.they would rather have an overqualified junior developer leave and replace them with a new junior developer than promote them and pay more for a more senior developer.\n\nLevel 2 developers make around $80K at my company, which is located in Austin, Texas. I've seen the recruiter turn down great software developers who asked for $81k. If you couple that with the fact that there's almost no opportunity for wage growth or promotions, it's going to be very tough on me as a manager.\n\nThere's a lot more going on with this company than this issue, as you may see from my other posts, but my current thinking is that I'm going to stabilize the office as much as I can and then head for the exit. I hope that's as soon as possible, but I know the market isn't great. \n\nAm I thinking correctly?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I just graduated from a state university in December, 2025. I started my CS degree in August 2021, and did pretty well in my classes until I had a mental health issue and resulted in me failing a bunch of classes. It forced me to use my summers to catch up on those classes so I never got the chance to do any internships. For me at that point I just wanted to graduate and get me degree. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my career but I liked programming ever since HS so I tried to focus on that. \n\nI took a bunch of electives around it like Full Stack in C# and doing a capstone where I made my own project with a couple other people. I hated it. I could never get over the OOP hump of just abstraction over abstraction. It never clicked with me. However, since my university's CS department was so behind in today's tech, our project was just a CRUD machine so I just got through it and passed the class. All of my classes were like that more or less. For my Mobile App dev class, our project was a Wordle Clone. For my Databases class, our project was a simple Flask and SQLite CRUD program. Looking back on all of my classes in CS, I never learned anything useful. Yeah, I have strong soft skills like problem solving and recognizing patterns, but I never learned any marketable skills. And I understand a CS degree isn't the same as SWE but what am I supposed to do now? \n\nFast forward two months after graduating and I have no impressive projects or career experience. I tried to teach myself React and Javascript since we were never exposed to that in school and I'm so lost. I keep hearing BUILD, BUILD, BUILD but I don't even know where to begin. All of my theoretical knowledge of SWE is just a soup of classes, data structures, and OOP but I can't apply it. Maybe I'm just used to having professors give me a structed course and steps to learn but I just can't teach myself. I don't even know what I want to learn. Front-end, back-end, app dev, full stack, the list goes on. \n\nI decided last month that I wanted to create a full-stack app using React/Typescript/Firebase that connects local musicians together through a social platform allowing them to find others who share the same musical taste as them. For example, if someone who doesn;t know about the local music scene around them they could create an account and list the instrument they play, experience, and what music they like. And then others could find them on this site and message them and arrange a meet. I thought this would be a cool idea and I could show recruiters or whoever. \n\nSince I had no experience building anything at that scale with Auth, Email Verification, Rate limiting I used Claude Code to help me design it. Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree but I still had no idea what I was actually coding. I could see a chunks of code and understand it how it does a specific function but going line by line I didn't know what it actually did. But after a couple weeks I got a MVP, rough documentation of the systems, and rigorously debugged and tested it. And it works. Yeah there's some rough spots and the CSS/design isn't the best but it works. The thing is from this project I just learned how to do system design and product management. I created a product and got an output but I never understood the middle part, the actual programming. And now I finally understand that I just hate programming and it isn't for me.  \n\n\nSo now I'm having a career crisis (I haven't even started my career yet) and scrambling to find out what I need to do. The data world seems interesting so I started to lookup what it means to be a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and AI/ML Engineer. From what I understand, everything past a Data Analyst is heavy programming so I don't want to do that. I know intermediate Python and basic SQL and little bit of Excel so maybe Data Analyst is something I should do? I messed around with Pandas and CSV files and I like how I can see trends from just mounds of data. I also kinda like Stats and Prob in college but idk. I would like to pivot to become a Data Analyst but idek where to begin. Do I get a cert like the IBM Data Analyst or is that a waste of time. I just want to learn.\n\n  \n",

Now they DID say the process can take 1-2 weeks exec approval.\n\nThe HR called me this past Thursday and said that due to the holiday weekend, there is delays and also there are many roles that need to be approved so that is why the delay is happening. She was hoping by Tuesday latest that we will get approvals and be able to send through he offer letter. It is now EOD Monday, and I am a ball of anxiety because I was so excited about this offer.\n\nHas this happened to anyone? Did the offer still come through? Am I freaking out for no reason? I have a good job (haven’t put in notice yet ) that I am DYING to leave. Any thoughts help!",

I think honestly it is because I went into college after high school without a plan and have based on halo scripting skills believed I could maybe make some habit out of it. \n\nFreshmen year was undeclared so really I went into it 2nd year (except for a intro to CS). I have learned basic C++ logic along with discrete, matrix I and calc I. By second semester I ran into data structures, webdev frontend and intro to AI (it was not just those 3 but those were the CS classes).My college offers core classes, and honestly it has gotten to a point that without them I probably lose it because it seems I am just sick and tired of the major and was incredibly burnt out. Reckon despite the grades I got being pretty good like As and Bs I still just sick of the major. First semester junior was not so bad but now in my second I got Backend Webdev, Programming Languages and Software Architecture and it has gotten to a point where I am really questioning if this major is worth anything.\n\nOther things to note, I have 3 minors (math is freebie I technically get that regardless) but I have one in History and Theology for the sake of not losing it. They are not at all a problem for me it is just for a break from code. I also seem over the years been very good at being creative with code like stories and whatnot (Data structures we made a text based RPG and the story plot took me 5 minutes to make) along with webdev having like the vision for it.\n\nI just wanna know more or less, based on those out there in job fields already is just having a bachlor's degree worth it anymore. I keep hearing about how bad the job market is and well honestly I just believe I am in it to get the degree and then just get out there doing some form of job instead of just school.

Anyone else notice similar patterns after intense workdays, especially in roles with heavy context switching? \n\n",

He said a good portion of their summer interns get return offers at the end of their program and they absolutely intend to do the same going forward.\n\nI don't mind the work, and I don't mind doing that full-time if I do happen to get a return offer BUT I am still a programmer at heart and I would definitely prefer a job or internship that has me writing code, be it traditional SWE or agentic AI or traditional ML.\n\nIf I do get the role and I don't have any other offer, I will take it. I don't think I can be a choosy beggar in this market lol\n\nBut do you guys think it will hurt my chances for a more traditional role later on?

        "content": "I received a chat message and email from HR yesterday that I had been identified as a critical resource on my team and that they were going to send a survey to my supervisors, peers, and subordinates, asking for feedback on my performance. I was told repeatedly in the email that \"This is not negative!\". I was also told that I'm one of three people in the entire company that they've done this for. The \"goal\" according to them is to help ME and to.make things easier for ME. They will take the survey results and create a learning plan for me. \n\nEmbedded in this email where they kept repeatedly saying \"This is NOT a bad thing!\" was a small snippet that mentioned \"planning for my succession\". \n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is, how does this help ME? My team needs more resources, and that would help me a lot. The company could pay me more, but I'd take more resources over more money - anything that would help me to not work 80 hours per week. We have a very flat structure and there's no path upwards for me. Besides that, I don't think I'd want to go any higher in the supervisory chain. My next level would be director, but it would likely result in more responsibilities with no more pay.\n\nI'm not worried about the feedback of my subordinates or peers. I'm a bit worried about one C level guy who seems to want to hurt me for some reason. And maybe this feedback will help me become a better leader. But I'm not convinced that there's not some ulterior motive, as the company itself is pretty rotten \n\nEx: They fired a guy on Tuesday and HR held an online meeting with our office telling us why people getting fired was a \"good thing\". I'm sure the single dad who was already underpaid felt that way as they walked him to the door with his box of stuff.\n\nSo, should I worry about this? Is this good, bad, or neutral?",

        "content": "TL;DR: Interview went ok but got AI hype red flags. Technical interview coming up - what to expect for C#/SQL \"Senior\" questions? Main concern: they want references but my \"previous company\" was actually a personal project I ran with some US friends, not registered. What do I do?\n\nContext from [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r6n544/should_i_stick_to_backend_only_is_full_stack/): 10 years hobbyist .NET dev, first professional job attempt.\n\nThe Interview:\n\nHR said \"We're looking for a C#, SQL developer\" (no seniority mentioned, but I'm assuming maybe Senior? for 2.5k USD remote LATAM I really doubt it).\n\nThe guy was really persistent about AI adoption, at some point he just told me: \"We contacted you because all our deployments are on Azure and you have solid .NET background, but in the end after some time the language won't matter, AI will code everything in any lang, so we don't really worry about it... so are you currently using AI? how are you implementing it? do you know RAG?\"\n\nObviously I said yes even though I had no idea what RAG was. Now buying Udemy course to catch up. They have their own local models apparently.\n\nWhen I heard \"the language won't matter\" I saw a huge red flag, almost cancelled right there, but I need the job so I just went \"ok, alright, you're right\". I truly doubt anybody can debug \"any language\" without understanding it deeply.\n\nI'm taking this because it's my first option, but this caused me some noise tbh. I think this company fell into AI hype hard and doesn't understand it, trying to implement AI where is not needed (migrations, etc). But I can adapt.\n\nGood stuff: HR mentioned quarterly performance reviews (\"how do you feel, what to improve, etc\") which sounds decent despite bad Glassdoor reviews.\n\nNext steps he told me:\n\n* Psychometric tests (personality, english, basic logic) - done\n* Technical interview (no leetcode, no coding, just some \"advanced\" questions to determine my level) - this scares me tbh.\n* Reference check to validate CV history\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What kind of technical questions for C#/SQL should I expect? Company does software solutions/migrations for other companies, they have about 500 employees, Azure + .NET stack. They said basics of Azure is fine, not in-depth knowledge needed. How to prep? I feel like I don't know sh!t but also feel like impostor syndrome talking.\n2. About my references: They want contact from \"*previous company*\". But as I said in my previous post, this wasn't a company officially registered, it was a personal project I ran with some friends in the US for 7+ years. Even during the interview I said it but the guy didn't care or didn't listen carefully. My take is to be truly honest here in the next contact I get from them, I don't want to get the job lying, if I'm not a good fit, they should consider this and just don't hire me. Or if they hire me, maybe is because they don't care.\n\nAnyways, the problem is they're assuming I worked in a small company but it was never legally registered, not even as LLC. My friend did register an LLC but that was a year ago, not related to me at all. If they dig they'll see the LLC registration date doesn't match my 8 years timeline. So I guess I can't use that.\n\nThey said it's \"*to comply with regulations and just a formality*\" to confirm I worked there the time I said.\n\nBest I can do is give them number of my co-owners (they financed it, not tech guys, but can confirm project existed 7+ years). Profits were low, was side project for them, main income for me, now the project is closing as I was the only one maintaining it and basically is not even an extra income now.\n\nI can't just not talk about this because this project is where I learned almost everything I know now today. Yet I fail when it comes to Distributed Systems, I never used Kafka, nor RabbitMQ in my life, didn't even needed, I know the concepts but only that...\n\nSo, how deep do US companies dig on references? Just phone call/email or more in-depth? How do they check my background? I was in Venezuela for all those years, I have like 2 years in this new country (LATAM anyways), banking system is crap there in Venezuela so I used mostly Binance to hold money. But I know for sure this is not formal and looks terrible.\n\nReally lost here. If you think I should avoid this company to dodge legal troubles, let me know.\n\nEDIT: I'm trying to sell myself as a Mid Level, not Senior per se (although I don't mention it at all) because as I haven't worked in teams ever, I know I'm not a real senior. The project is 100% real, is online and I can talk about it all day long, I designed every single part of it and it's running smoothly so far, but almost no clients because it's very niche and scalating it would require a lot of money that I current don't have.",

These tend to be more simple things like spreadsheet manipulation using pandas, or doing OCR analysis on documents and sending that info to our construction management software using their API. Also have been trying to implement the OpenAI API whenever i see fit, i feel like companies are looking for these skills more and more.\n\n  \nWhat i want to know is how can I use this experience to transition into the next stage of my career? I am planning on moving to the Boston area in about 1.5 to 2 years. Should I be looking for \"solutions engineer\" roles in that area and is this a growing job market? \n\nWould it be hard to transition into traditional SWE?

Lots of companies ask upfront what are my yearly salary expectations and upon googling a bit, I found mixed results for my experience tbh, so I figured Id ask on reddit where theres always real people willing to share real data.\n\nIm currently an iOS dev with a little bit over 5years of experience.\n\nFor whatever reason, the internet suggested from 50k all the way to like 90k so I wonder what a more realistic salary expectation might be.\n\nMost offers im getting are from Berlin.\n\nThanks!\n\nPd: I dont think this qualifies as salary sharing (because of the sub rule). Otherwise please let me know!",

Informatics is currently my least favourite module and, to be honest, it sometimes feels unproductive for me because I often end up going home and teaching myself the material anyway. I also spend a decent amount of time self-teaching programming, and I’ve found that I’m quite capable of picking up the practical coding aspects on my own. Because of that, I feel like I could independently cover a significant portion of what Informatics offers.\n\nI genuinely enjoy Statistics, it’s probably my favourite subject at the moment.\n\nOne of my main concerns, though, is whether companies would care that I did a Mathematics degree instead of a pure Computer Science degree. Would I be seen as less competitive or treated as second-tier compared to CS graduates, or would a strong maths background actually be viewed favourably? I might pursue an honours in CS afterwards. I’m already working on personal projects, certifications, and actively looking into internships.\n\nThank you for your help me",

        "content": "Recently got a Software Developer job, this is my 2nd week. I was contacted by a recruiter to apply for another job. I haven’t put my new job on my LinkedIn yet so I assume they think I’m still looking for new opportunities. I told the recruiter I had an offer on the table for 90k, which is what I make now. I was scared to tell them that I had already accepted the offer, and already started working - thought this may make me look like a job hopper. I told them I had an offer and that I’m open to new possibilities. They told me they can offer me something closer to 100k and a 10% bonus, plus it’s hybrid work whereas at my current role it’s in person. Not to mention the new role is for a Fortune 100 company as opposed to a startup.\n\nI took the interview kind of as a “let’s see what happens” and turns out they are moving me on to the final round of interviews. Now I’m starting to seriously consider the possibility of a change in employment. The new job is using the same tech stack but it’s more money, bigger company, and hybrid work. How does this look though? I only disclosed to the recruiter that I have an offer currently, but not to the interviewers. Should I tell them at all about my current job, that I just started a job and within 1 week I’m looking for a change?\n\nNot sure how to approach this situation, would really appreciate the advice on what to do if the new role makes me an offer and if I should risk moving to a new job within 1 week of just starting my current job. I mean how would I even handle this with my current job, would I need to give them a two week notice? Would they just let me go right away?",
