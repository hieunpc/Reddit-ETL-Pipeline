        "content": "I started working this job in mid 2019. Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.\n\nBeing new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.\n\nThe premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!\n\nFast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.\n\nEvery single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.\n\nMassive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nIn none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.\n\nChoosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...\n\nSure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.\n\nI understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".\n\nAnyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. \n\nIt was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know?  Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. \n\nWhen I realized, my gut reaction was a \"no\".  The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. \n\nI started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?\n\nI ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing. \n\nGood luck to all on both sides of this. ",

He still escalates to the CTO for permission.\n\n\\- A credit card registration (literally 2 minutes) for an approved migration took 10+ days.

Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.\n\nPrecog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish. \nEach has tradeoffs depending on your scale, team size, and needs.

I got a new cloud data engineer position and half of my new team was just laid off this week -- I probably have 2-3 months left. My friend in a similar role just got laid off this week at the company I worked for before when we both worked together.\n\nSo, I did some research on jobs to upgrade to that won't be replaceable by AI. These were the top 5 that I have an interest in. ChatGPT said these jobs are expected to increase in supply over the years coming up. I checked online and there's currently only 1 of these positions available for every 50 data engineering positions.\n\nIf I teach myself the skills for one of these positions, does anyone think there will be a supply for them in the future? The salary ranges below look a little high based on when I was researching the actual pay for jobs hiring today.\n\n* AI Data Engineer: $180k–$250k\n* AI Infrastructure Engineer: $200k–$300k\n* Applied AI Engineer: $170k–$250\n* AI Platform Engineer: $200k–$320k\n* Quant / AI Finance Engineer: $250k–500k+\n\nI have a plan to create a SaaS website to showcase my pgvector + embeddings + RAG skills to recruiters to get an AI Data Engineer position for $180k - $250k. It would make a database searchable so the user could ask a question and it would give a response or automatically build a pipeline, among other features.\n\nAnd then create another SaaS website that analyzes stock/crypto for trading analysis (and possibly have it auto trade so when LLM models are good enough then I could connect it to my already-built app). This would help get a Quant / AI Finance Engineer position for $250k - $500k.\n\nI think creating a couple of projects / websites might be the quickest way to learn these skills and would also show recruiters that I have real experience doing these things. I already have data engineering, software development, AI LLM API development, and frontend + backend SaaS experience.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Is this a realistic approach? Are there any other positions I should try to get instead of one of these?",

I also find it frustrating that sometimes when I ask a question to different people (whom have been with the team for more than a year) only for them to give off different answers.\n\nOur documentation is so scattered its stored on individual or group OneNote, confluence, excel, azure dev ops, some obscure SharePoint, and sometimes pdfs that were just being shared or sometimes not even shared (for reasons beyond my understanding). On the bright side, they are pushing towards a more unified and reliable way of storing documentation. \n\nI get anxious answering to users / operations manager because honestly, I'm scared that what I'm saying is absolutely wrong or something I assumed, so every time I have to ask someone to verify what I'm saying.\n\nI also feel misled with my title of being a data engineer and doing specifically only investigation and escalation to other teams and it feels more like a support rather than a DE (and this is for the whole team, there will be no touching of pipelines / code or actual data).\n\nOn some positive note, I got my AZ-900 and AI-102 (planning for more) and I constantly try to better myself by taking advantage of the free learning sites of the company and now starting some side projects.\n\n  \nGiven of what I am experiencing, is this my cue to find another job ?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "For instance, does a star schema actually reduce redundancy in comparison to putting everything in a flat table? Instead of the fact table containing dimension descriptions, it will just contain IDs with the primary key of the dimension table, the dimension table being the table which gives the ID-description mapping for that specific dimension. In other words, a star schema simply replaces the strings with IDs in a fact table. Adding to the fact that you now store the ID-string mapping in a seperate dimension table, you are actually using more storage, not less storage.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the purpose of database normalization is not to \"reduce redundancy\" or to use storage more efficiently, but to make updates and deletes easier. If a customer changes their email, you update one row instead of a million rows.\n\nThe only situation in which I can see a star schema being more space-efficient than a flat table, or in which a snowflake schema is more space-efficient than a star schema, are the cases in which the number of rows is so large that storing n integers + 1 string requires less space than storing n strings.

I mean, I've had some experience, like intermediate Python, SQL, building manual ETL pipelines, Docker containers, ML, and Streamlit UI. It's been great, but I wanted to up my game, so now I'm following a really enjoyable data engineering Zoom camp. I love it. But what I'm noticing is these tools, great as they may be, they're all higher level abstractions of like what would be core, straight up, no-frills, writing raw syntax to perform multiple different tasks, and when combined together become your powerful ETL or ELT pipelines. \n\nMy question is this, these tools are great. They save so much time, and they have these really nice built-in \"SWE-like\" features, like DBT has nice built-in tests and lineage enforcement, etc., and I love it. But what happens if I'm a brand new practitioner, and I'm learning these tools, and I'm using them religiously, and things start to fail or  or require debugging? Since I only knew the higher-level abstraction, does that become a risk for me because I never truly learned the core syntax that these higher-level abstractions are solving? \n\nAnd on that same matter, can the same be said about agentic AI and MCP servers? These are just higher-level abstractions of what was already a higher-level abstraction in some of these other tools like DBT or Kestra or DLT, etc. So what does that mean as these levels of higher abstraction become magnified and many people entering the workforce, if there is going to be a future workforce, don't ever truly learn the core principles or core syntax? What does that mean for us all if we're relying on higher abstractions and relying on agents to abstract those higher abstractions even further? What does that mean for our skill set in the long-term? Will we lose our skill set? Will we even be able to debug? What do all these AI labs think about that? Or is that what they're banking on? That everybody must rely on them 100%?",

It was only a year contract and mid way I applied to grad school for Data Science. At the beginning of my program I also started a Data Engineering Apprenticeship, it went on for almost the whole school year. I completed my first year with great grades. That summer I started a summer internship as a “Systems Engineer“. The role was in the database team and was more of a “Database Admin“ role. \n\nThis is where the story takes a dumb turn. I’ll never forgive myself for having everything and letting depression ruin me instead.\n\nAt the beginning of my internship I had 3 family deaths and I spiraled. I stopped trying at work, was barely doing things just to get by. I remember even missing a trip to a data center that my team was going on. I isolated myself. I even got a full time offer in the end and I never responded to the email. I wasn’t talking to anyone. 2nd year started and I started to attend but stopped eventuall. I should have dropped out but I couldn’t even bring myself to type up an email. I just failed and didn’t re-enroll. I moved in with my brother bc I wasn’t taking care of myself. I essentially took a year off, which consist of me getting help. After about a year of the fog dissipating, I finally felt ready to try again. I’m not re-enrolling in school bc I’m pretty sure my GPA tanked, and I realized DS isnt my passion, I REALLY REALLY enjoyed my DE apprenticeship and constantly using SQL in my database role.\n\n  \nAll that said, I have been job searching for about 8 months now. Which totals to 1 year and 8 months since my last “tech” role. This looks so so bad on paper. What would you guys do if you were me? How would you go about making yourself marketable again? I am applying for very low level roles bc I think that’s they only thing I qualify for right now; data entry w SQL, Data Reporting, Data Specialist, etc. \n\n  \nTLDR: I had my career going in a great direction towards DE and let depression ruin everythin.

I know there are journalist networks doing the same, typically (Panama papers etc).\n\nI’m thinking working in a organised and open way about examining the files. Dumping all the files in a database, keeping them raw, transforming the data in whatever best possible. The files being “open” enables the power of the collective to be added to the project.\n\nI have never organised or initiated anything like this. I have a project management, product management and analytics background but no open source.  I know graphanalytics was used across the massive Panama papers dataset, but never used that technology myself.\n\nI’d be happy to contribute in whatever way possible.\n\nIf you think it could help and I any way and have any resources (time, money, knowledge) and want to contribute - ship in! What would we need to get going? Could we get inspiration from the way “open source” projects are formed? Maybe the first step would just make the files a little easier for everyone to work with - downloaded and transformed, classified by llms etc? Code that does that needs to be open so that the raw data is traceable to the justice.gov file. \n\n \n\nThoughts?",

I decided to simplify this and determine bottlenecks from spark job metadata. It's kept intentionally simple and recognizes three crucial patterns - data explosion, large scan and shuffle\\_write. It also resolves sql hint, let's you see the query connected to the job without having to click through two pages of horribly designed ui, it also detects slow stages and other goodies.\n\nIn general, when I debug performance issues with spark jobs myself, I usually have to click through stages trying to find where we are shuffling hard and spilling all around. This simplifies this process. It's not fancy, it's simple terminal app, but it does its jobs.\n\nFeature requests and burns are all welcome.

This is very compute-intensive so I am thinking it is optimal to just pull data nightly and fed it into a data warehouse we would own.

        "content": "I’ve been digging into the recent news about Fundamental AI coming out of stealth with their Nexus model (a \"Large Tabular Model\" or LTM), and I have some doubts, I wanted to run by this sub.\n\ncontext: we have LLMs for text, but tabular data has always by tree-based models (XGBoost/LightGBM). Nexus claims to be the \"first foundation model for tabular data,\" trained on \"billions of public tables\" to act as an \"operating system for business decisions\" (e.g forecasting, fraud detection, churn).\n\nI have doubt regarding the data standardisation, unlike text, which has a general structure, business data schemas are the messy. \"Revenue\" in Company A might b \"Total\\_Sales\\_Q3\" in Company B. Basically relationships are implicit and messy.\n\nIf businesses don't follow open standards for storing data (which they don't), how can a pre-trained model like Nexus actually work \"zero-shot\" without a massive, manual ETL work?\n\nI've been trying to map where Nexus sits compared to what we already use:\n\n1. Nexus vs. Claude in Excel: Claude in Excel (Anthropic) is basically a super-analyst.  It’s a productivity tool. Nexus claims to be a predictive engine. It integrates into the data stack (AWS) to find non-linear patterns across rows/columns automatically. It’s trying to replace the manual modeling pipeline.\n2. Nexus vs. Deep Learning Architectures (TabNet / iLTM): TabNet (Google) is an architecture you train \"yourself\" on your specific data. It uses sequential attention for interpretability (feature selection).  iLTM (Integrated Large Tabular Model - Stanford/Berkeley) seems to be the academic answer to this. It uses a hypernetwork pre-trained on 1,800+ datasets to generate weights for a specific task. It tries to bridge the gap between GBDTs and Neural Nets. LaTable: This is for generating synthetic data (diffusion).\n\nQuestions for the community:\n\n1. Has anyone actually tested a \"Foundation Model\" for tabular data (like Nexus or the open-source iLTM) on messy, real-world dirty data?\n2. Can an LTM really learn the \"schema\" of a random SQL dump well enough to predict fraud without manual feature engineering?\n3. Is this actually a replacement for ETL/Feature Engineering, or just another black box that will fail when Column\\_X changes format?",

The role will be more corporate and pays roughly the same after the year-end bonus but will require being in-office twice a week.\n\nThe other option is a senior data engineering role at another smaller startup that just raised some capital. It’s better paid but will require being in-office three times a week. Overall, the leadership team is strong and everyone on the team seems very down-to-earth.\n\nWhat would you guys lean towards?

My current ctc is 4.5 lpa but in April I will get 6.5 lpa as hike so was thinking should I resign in April /may month but not sure which career to pursue. Also I did bte h in mechanical and mtech in mechatronics. If someone would help me to choose which career should I take that would be helpful.\nAlso I would require a career where I can earn more as my family is struggling financially and also if I take that role wanted to do some freelancing to earn some side money.",

I certainly did, so I created something to help scout out those unknown codebases. Here:\n\n[mitro54/DAIS: < DATA / AI SHELL >](https://github.com/mitro54/DAIS)\n\nHi,\n\nI created this open-source project/platform, Data/AI shell, or DAIS in short, to add capabilities to your favourite shell. At its core, it is a PTY Shell wrapper written in C++\n\nSome of the current features are:\n\n\\- The ability to add some extra info to your standard \"ls\" command, the \"ls\" formatting, and your terminal colors are fully customizable. It is able to scan and output thousands of folders information in an instant. It is capable of scanning and estimating how many rows there are in your text files, without causing any delays, for example estimating and outputting info about .csv file with 21.5 million rows happens as fast as your standard 'ls' output would.\n\n\\- The ability to query your databases with automatic recursive .env search\n\n\\- Ability to run the exact same functionalities in remote sessions through ssh. This works by deploying a safe remote agent transparently to your session.\n\n\\- Easy setup and will prompt you to automatically install missing dependencies if needed\n\n\\- Has a lot of configuration options to make it work in your environments, in your style\n\n\\- Tested rigorously for safety\n\nEverything else can be found in the README\n\nI will keep on updating and building this project along my B. Eng studies to become a Data/AI Engineer, as I notice more pain points or find issues. If you want to help, please do! Any suggestions and opinions of the project are welcome.\n\nSomething i've thought about for example is implementing the possibility to run OpenClaw or other type of agentic/llm system with it.",

Our sources include various Marketing APIs, MySQL, and SQL Server On Prem Source Systems. Currently, we use Metadata Driven Ingestion via Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load data directly into a dedicated SQL Server Bronze DB.\n\nOption A: Dedicated Bronze Database (SQL Server)\n\nThe Setup: Ingestion goes straight into SQL tables. Dev and Prod DWH reside on different servers. The Dev environment accesses the Prod Bronze DB via Linked Servers.\n\nWorkflow: Engineers have write access to Bronze for manual CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements. Silver/Gold are read-only and managed via CI/CD.\n\nOption B: ADLS Gen2 Data Lake (Parquet)\n\nThe Setup: Redirect the ADF metadata pipelines to write data as Parquet files to ADLS before loading into the DWH. Tho, this feels like significant engineering overhead for little benefit. I would need to manage/orchestrate two independent metadata pipelines to feed Dev and Prod Lake containers. But I will still need to somehow create a staging layer or db for both dev and prod so dbt can pick up from there as it cant natively connect to adls storage and ingest the data. So i need to use ADF again to go from the Data in the Lake to both environments seperately. \n\nAt 100GB, is the Data Lake approach over-engineered? If a source schema breaks the Prod load, it has to be fixed regardless of the storage layer. I just dont see the point of the Data Lake anymore. In case we wanna migrate in the future to Snowflake or smth a data lake would already been setup. Even tho even in that case I would simply create the Data Lake „quickly“ using ADFs copy activity and dump everything from the PROD Bronze DB into that Lake as a starting point. \n\nAny help is appreciated!",

However, when I do this, Spark does not register any partition information in Glue table metadata.\n\n\n\nAs I understand, when we use hive, during writes, spark updates table metadata in Glue such as partition information by invoking UpdatePartition API. And therefore, when we write new partitions in Hive, we can get EventBridge notifications from Glue for events such as BatchCreatePartition. Also, when we invoke GetPartitions, we can get partition information from Glue Tables.\n\n\n\nI understand Iceberg works based on metadata and has a feature for hidden partitioning but I am not sure if this is the sole reason Spark is not registering metadata info with Glue table. This is causing various issues such as not being able to detect data changes in tables, not being able to run Glue Data Quality checks on selected partitions, etc. \n\n\n\nIs there a simple way I can get this partition change and update information directly from Glue?\n\n\n\nOne of the bad ways to do this will be to create S3 notifications, subscribe to those and then run Glue Crawler on those events, which will create another S3 based Glue table with the correct partition information. And then do DQ checks on this new table. I do not like this approach at all because I will need to setup significant automation to achieve this.",

Very excited to share my project **spawn**, a DB migration/build system.\n\nFor now, it supports PostgreSQL via `psql` to create and apply migrations, as well as write golden file tests (I plan to support other db's down the line). It has some innovations that I think make it very useful relative to other options I've tried.\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/saward/spawn](https://github.com/saward/spawn)\n\n**Docs:** [https://docs.spawn.dev/](https://docs.spawn.dev/)\n\nShout out to minijinja ([https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/)) which has made a lot of the awesomeness possible!\n\nSome features (PostgreSQL via `psql` only for now):\n\n* Create SQL (for tests or data insertion) from JSON data sources\n* Store functions/views/data in separate files for easy organisation and editing\n* `git diff` shows exactly what changed in a function in new migrations\n* Easy writing of tests for functions/views/triggers\n* Env-specific variables, so migrations apply test data to dev/local DB targets only\n* Generate data from JSON files\n* Macros for easily generating repeatable SQL, and other cool tricks (e.g., view tear-down and re-create)\n\nI started this project around two years ago. I’ve finally been able to get it to an MVP state I’m happy with.\n\nI created spawn to solve my own personal pain points. The main one was, how to manage updates for things like views and functions? There's a few challenges (and spawn doesn't solve all), but the main one was creating and reviewing the migration. The typical (without spawn) approach is one of:\n\n1. Copy function into new migration and edit. This makes PR reviews hard because all you see is a big blob of new changes.\n2. Repeatable migrations. This breaks old migrations when building from scratch, if those migrations depend on DDL or DML from repeatable migrations.\n3. Sqitch rework. Works, but is a bit cumbersome overall with the DAG, and I hit limitations with sqitch's variables support (and needing Perl) for other things I wanted to do.\n\nSpawn is my attempt to solve this, along with an easy (single binary) way to write and run tests. You:\n\n* Store view or function in its own separate file.\n* Include it in your migration with a template (e.g., {% include \"functions/hello.sql\" %})\n* Build migration to see the final SQL, or apply to database.\n* Pin migration to forever lock it to the component as it is now. This is very similar to 'git commit', allowing the old migration to run the same as when it was first created, even if you later change functions/hello.sql.\n* Update the function later by editing functions/hello.sql in place and importing it into your new migration. Git diff shows exactly what changed in hello.sql.\n\nPlease check it out, let me know what you think, and hopefully it's as useful for you as it has been for me. Thanks!\n\n(AI disclosure: around 90% of the non-test code is artisanal code written by me. AI was used more once the core architecture was in place, and for assisting in generating docs)",

Then I figured out rotating headers but the data was inconsistently structured across different listing types and my parser kept breaking in ways I couldn't predict. Then I realised I hadn't thought about where to actually store anything. Then I had to learn a bit of scheduling to make it run automaticly. Every single step opened three more questions I didn't know existed an hour earlier. I finished something working after about two weeks and it was genuinely one of the best learning experiences I've had, but I think the reason \"just build projects\" feels useless as advice is that nobody tells you the project will completley fall apart four times before it works and that is the actual point. If someone had told me upfront that constant breakage is the mechanism and not a sign I'm doing it wrong I would have panicked so much less in week one.

        "content": "We (/u/anishathalye, /u/josejg, and /u/jonhoo) returned to MIT during IAP (January term) 2026 to teach a new iteration of The Missing Semester (https://missing.csail.mit.edu), a class covering topics that are missing from the standard computer science curriculum.\n\nOver the years, the three of us helped teach several classes at MIT, and over and over again we saw that students had limited knowledge of tools available to them. Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and IDEs. Common examples include manually renaming a symbol across many source code files, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (https://xkcd.com/1597/).\n\nAt least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier both during school and after graduation (most jobs do not formally teach these topics either).\n\nTo help mitigate this, the three of us developed a class, originally called Hacker Tools in 2019 and then renamed to Missing Semester in 2020 (some great past discussion here: https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/eyagda/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_mit/). Over the past several years, we’ve seen the course translated into over a dozen languages, inspire similar courses at other universities, and be adopted by several companies as part of their standard onboarding materials.\n\nBased on feedback and discussions here and elsewhere, along with our updated perspective from working in industry for several years, we have developed a new iteration of the course. The 2026 edition covers several new topics such as packaging/shipping code, code quality, agentic coding, and soft skills. Some things never change, though; we’re still using this hacky Python DSL for editing our multi-camera-angle lecture videos: https://github.com/missing-semester/videos.\n\nAs always, we’d love to hear any feedback from the community to help us improve the course content!\n\n—Anish, Jon, and Jose",

        "author": "DuztyLipz",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Alright, let me preface this by saying that I'm not a software engineer by profession, but I have been coding for \\~6-7 years. I came to an epiphany/connected the dots. This post may not fit everybody, but hopefully, this can get *someone* out of a rut. Apologies for non-technical refinement/terms in advance.\n\nSo, when I used to watch fundamentals tutorials or lurk Reddit, people would always say something to the effect of \"just build stuff\"... I always wondered why that was or why they would say that without the reason why. I had a tough time grasping object-oriented programming (non-sequitur: we gotta stop using the Animal -> Dog -> Labrador example for OOP... I think it confuses people), but I kept building with OOP--and with the help of others' code in The Odin Project and seeing how it was **actually applied**\\--I had the \"aha\" moment needed to understand OOPs purpose. Here's the kicker though: **there are actually terms for this and why building is so crucial**. Now, it's an adjacent field, but these terms also apply to how programmers think... The terms are: [mathematical maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity), ***mathematical insight***, and [mathematical intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition). It's crucial to tell you--or whom it may concern--exactly what they are.\n\n***Mathematical Maturity*** is basically someone's experience with math, *especially mathematical understanding that is not directly taught*. Mathematicians seriously have to grind math problems because being instructed by teachers only goes so far. You gain more maturity via repeated exposure. Grinding enough problems over and over again makes you reach ***mathematical insight***.\n\n***Mathematical Insight*** is where you have that \"Aha!\" moment, that \"oooooh, that's what that does\". This happens when you \"build stuff\" or solve problems. This happened with me stuck in \"OOP hell\"... After finally applying it in an appropriate way (instead of Animal -> Dog -> Labrador) and applied it to different things, I gained a deeper understanding of it that I could **never** get from a tutorial.  Mathematical insight can't be directly taught. You grind problems/build stuff to get that \"Aha!\" moment.\n\n***Mathematical Intuition*** is where you've grinded the concept so much, it's apart of your repertoire. You don't even need to think of \"how\" it works because you upped your mathematical maturity and insight through applying what you've learned, *instead of watching tutorials;* therein deepening your understanding. This also helps with you understanding the range of projects you can do. It's just a matter of \"how to logically structure \\[insert program\\]\".\n\nThat's basically it. \"Building stuff\" actually makes these programming concepts stick in your mind. The reason I posted this is two-fold: 1.) It would, hopefully, get someone out of a rut and 2.) Give those who say \"build stuff\" a few terms that can exactly describe how crucial it is... For anyone in the industry/do this professionally... What are your thoughts on this? All criticism is welcome",

Logic, loops, and terminal work are coming back naturally.\nI'm investing around 6-10 hours a day on this.\n\n​Working through Python/Go modules, but questioning if this is the \"safest\" bet for me.\n\n​My three questions:\n​I’ll be honest—I’m not a math pro. I like systems logic, but complex calculus or advanced statistics kind of turns me down a bit (I could still learn and refresh my memory, if necessary)\n\n1) Is Python backend development \"math-heavy\" in the real world, or is that only for AI/Data Science? Would Java be a safer \"low-math\" haven for me? \n\n2) Is it worth pivoting to Java now to avoid the high saturation of Python juniors, even if Java feels \"stricter\" and a bit more difficult to get into?\n\n3) Should I stick to the Boot.dev course, learn OOP and DSA in that course, and then switch? What do you suggest? They have Linux, SQL and git courses.\n\n​My Goal: > I want to reach a Junior Backend role (Chilean corporate or INTERNATIONAL remote) where I can actually grow, as soon as humanly possible.  (Of course aiming to work in a position that I like)\n\n​Thanks for any career advice. Just trying to build a stable future for my kid.\n\nTL;DR: 30yo, Chile. CS Degree in 2018.

        "title": "How to Learn JavaScript - From a Dev With 10 Years in JS",
        "author": "nikolaymakhonin",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I want to share how I think you should learn JavaScript most effectively. My opinion is based only on my own experience, keep that in mind - I've never taught programming to anyone.\n\nTreat these tips as a roadmap you can use to understand where to go and how, but go wherever YOU want.\n\nThese tips work for many other languages too (C++, C#, PHP, Python, Java, ...), except maybe functional languages - I have no experience there.\n\nMy background: professional developer, around 20 years in different areas, self-taught my whole life, no courses whatsoever. Lots of experience with C++, C#, Java, PHP and JavaScript. Right now my main thing is JavaScript and frontend.\n\n---\n\n## Theory\n\nI think the fastest way to learn a programming language is to study its building blocks one by one - the pieces programs are made of - while clearly separating the language itself from applying the language to anything: libraries, frameworks, web page manipulation, algorithms, architecture, all that stuff.\n\nThe order for learning JavaScript should be roughly this:\n\n1. Data and how it's stored and processed in a computer\n2. Simple data types, including arrays\n3. Arithmetic and logical operations and expressions\n4. Core language constructs: if, switch/case, for, while, etc.\n5. Functions\n6. More complex data types: objects, maps, collections, ...\n7. Async programming. Async functions.\n8. OOP and Classes\n9. Iterators/Generators\n10. ...\n\nWhen you look for textbooks, the table of contents should roughly match this order. This way you'll at least have a learning plan and a rough idea of where you are - what you already know, what you don't yet. And you can skim the TOC to see what the language can do in general. This obviously doesn't mean you should throw away other textbooks and not read them.\n\nGradually, as you study the language itself, you can also start learning how it's applied. Since there are many different applications and it's unclear what a person will end up doing, I can't give any advice here. The one thing universal for all JavaScript development directions is the language itself in its pure form.\n\nAfter JavaScript you can also learn TypeScript. Many companies require this skill, for example in React development. TypeScript just adds type annotations to JavaScript - increases code readability, simplifies development, catches many errors while you're still writing code. It's much easier to learn than JavaScript itself.\n\nFull JavaScript documentation: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\nIt makes sense to reinforce what you learn by solving short simple problems. If the problems are too hard and too long, you might not get enough satisfaction from them. They shouldn't be too easy either, or they'll become boring routine.\n\nPractice should be sequential just like theory. Free JavaScript problem sets: [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nThere are also sites like CodeWars and CodeCombat - they have difficulty levels, but they're not for sequential learning, they're for training programming skills for people who already know the language.\n\nThe format in these problem sets is the same: you write code in one window, press Test, your code gets checked. At first it can be hard to understand, especially why everything is set up so complicated - might be worth watching some YouTube videos on this, where people explain it in detail including why problem sets are structured this way. This knowledge will be useful in real work too, because this approach to development is used a lot in practice.\n\n---\n\n## Interest and Motivation\n\n**What feeds motivation:**\n\n- A sense of beauty in the language, roughly the same as the beauty of pure non-applied math.\n- Knowledge that will stay relevant for a long time. What you learn about JavaScript and TypeScript probably won't go obsolete in the coming decades. JS is way too firmly stuck in web development, because to this day it's the only language you can directly write browser programs in. And the knowledge you get from learning JS will help you learn other languages easier, since JS has procedural programming, object-oriented, and elements of functional programming. These concepts are very similar across many languages.\n- Solving small problems\n- Wanting to run an experiment\n- Wanting to make a pile of money\n- Wanting to build your own project (better keep it short and within your abilities)\n- Motivation goes up when you successfully reach a goal. If goals are long and hard to achieve, motivation drops. If goals are too simple, achieving them turns into boring routine. Stay in the middle with everything: choosing textbooks, courses, problems, projects, experiments, etc.\n\n**What kills motivation:**\n\n- Contempt. \"JavaScript is shit.\" You can find plenty of flaws in JavaScript, no doubt. You can just know about them, keep them in mind, without feeling any negative emotions about it. And it's worth remembering - what matters in evaluating a language isn't a list of its pros and cons, but whether you can solve complex problems quickly and simply using this language in its area. My answer - absolutely yes.\n- Perfectionism.\n- Forcing yourself to finish a project, study a boring topic, complete a dull course. Early on you might have tons of unfinished projects and skipped topics you lost interest in, and that's great. It means perfectionism isn't running the show.\n- Wanting to read a textbook in strict order. Not wanting to try other textbooks or other courses until you finish the current ones. There's no single track for everyone.\n- Trying to push through a hard topic when your brain has already given up. At first it will be hard, and you need to let your brain rest and digest more often. Rest is a very important part of learning. Rest when you want to, as much as you want, and come back to learning when you feel like it.\n- Obsessions. If you want to kill your interest in programming for a long time or forever, obsessions are perfect for that. They'll suck all the energy and interest out of you, and when you come to your senses it'll be too late.\n\n---\n\n## Other Tips\n\n- **Marathon.** If you want to learn the language fast and start earning, learning to program shouldn't turn into playing in a sandbox - otherwise you'll spend a bunch of time on fun stuff with pictures, and end up not even reaching beginner level. To learn programming you have to strain your brain, let it rest, then strain it again, getting stronger each time, absorbing more material, same as people build muscle. The brain doesn't restructure and train overnight. Learning programming is a marathon over a very long distance. This marathon doesn't have to be self-torture though - straining your brain can actually be pleasant, and thinking about moving toward your goal is even more pleasant.\n\n- **You don't need to learn everything.** There's a lot of information, but not all of it is relevant right now, and of course you don't need to memorize everything down to the last detail. Often it's enough to just remember that a language feature exists - place short bookmarks in your head or in your notes, like markers on a map, so you can recall when needed that this feature exists and study it in more detail. No point loading your brain with things you're not using right now and won't use often in the future. Following this will seriously cut down your learning time and unload your brain. In the end, you'll remember well whatever you use often in practice - and that's the ideal use of your memory.\n\n- **Goal and path to goal.** To learn the language fast, you also need to move in the right direction. And to move in the right direction, you need to understand the end goal, the intermediate steps toward it, at least a rough plan. The main goal for a beginner, in my opinion, should be getting a job as an intern or Junior developer, because the real programming learning happens during actual work, especially if there's a mentor at work. Knowing this goal, you can build a rough plan to get there - for example find out what specific skills and knowledge most popular job listings require.\n\n- **Mentor.** To move in the right direction you also need to understand what's worth spending time on and what's not. A beginner can't figure this out, because you'd already need a lot of programming experience to know all these nuances. So early on a mentor will be useful - a person who is an experienced programmer themselves and can suggest the right direction, what to do and how, do code review, point out mistakes, answer questions, etc. This is common practice, many companies hire outside mentors to guide beginners.\n\n- **English.** English is very important in programming, but not because programming languages themselves are in English, or because many docs and books are in English - that's all small stuff. The main thing is being able to communicate with clients, managers, and other programmers who don't speak your native language. This skill will seriously expand your job search options, and to much higher-paying jobs at that.\n\n- **AI as a mentor.** LLM can work as a mentor for beginners but its expertise not enough for middle level. It also gives good suggestions for online services and textbooks.\n\n- **Deep understanding of the language.** Being able to read practically any code, understand it, execute it in your head - this really helps with understanding other people's code, debugging, designing. With this skill you get more ideas, you can find better solutions by eliminating impossible ones, and so on. It also helps with learning, since many ideas and algorithms are easier to express as code. A programming language is also, to some degree, a language programmers communicate with each other in. Often in their conversations you'll hear - stop talking, show me the code. Understanding every little thing in code really simplifies design, debugging, keeping code clean and quality, finding best solutions. Worth striving for - seek out things you don't understand and dig into them.\n\n- **Patterns.** Most of programming isn't inventing something from scratch, not reinventing wheels, but reusing template code over and over. There are thousands of these patterns and there's no point learning them all. They get remembered on their own as you gain programming experience, read other people's code, and pick up their ideas. Good code patterns for different tasks can be found at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), though even there you sometimes find upvoted garbage code.\n\n- **Rubber duck method.** If you can't figure out what the bug is in your program, try going through it step by step, explaining EVERY detail so that even a rubber duck sitting next to you would understand it all. This same method is often used to make sure there are no bugs in a program - I use it every time after writing a chunk of code, reviewing it and executing it in my head.\n\n- **Step-by-step debugging.** Step-by-step debugging tools really help you understand your own code, find bugs, make sure your understanding of the code matches reality. During step-by-step debugging you can literally watch code execute step by step and look at variable values on each step. This really helps when learning the language, understanding how everything works inside. You can run step-by-step JavaScript debugging in the browser, in DevTools - just paste code into the console but write the word `debugger` before the code. I use this when I need to make sure there are no obvious algorithm errors in complex code.\n\n- **Research skills.** Research is a very important and inseparable part of developing anything. Pick up any task - pretty much any of them requires research, unless you already have experience doing the exact same task. Research is basically finding the best answer to questions like: what tool to use here, how to organize the code, what architecture to apply to this task, what are this tool's capabilities, how to solve this, etc. Research is basically a mini scientific paper, because it's done using the scientific method: gather information, generate ideas, test ideas, pick the best one.\n\n- **Self-learning skills.** You need to keep learning the entire time you work as a programmer, constantly raising your level. Even if a programmer manages to land in a niche where there's nothing left to learn - learned everything, just work - most likely that'll be boring low-paying work with higher competition and less interest, because you're doing the same thing all the time. The best and highest-paid specialists are those who can solve any problems, including the hardest and seemingly unsolvable ones. That is the programmer's job after all - solving problems brought by clients, which are often complex or unusual. And you can only become that kind of specialist with self-learning skills and the ability to do independent research.",

Me and another intern had to develop a full commercial project in 4 days  that was based on the one they already have, the employer sets the deadlines . Pulling 13 hour shifts and working on weekend became normal at this. I deployed  stuff for production for front, back, various microservices and new projects. I would love to learn to code myself more, i thought thats what internships were for, but every day we are set insane deadlines that are impossible to meet without ai and all nighters. Is that supposed to be normal for internships lol. Labor protections suck ass in my country. Honestly, every day i feel like as a junior this industry sucks ass and every day junior developers are more and more devalued due to ai. Funnily enough, this job overall is still better than what i had before (i worked at food delivery with a scooter and as a waiter before this, holy shit its bad)\n\njust some venting. cheers",

The final result will be an open source project that you can use in your portfolio. \n\nThe group will be run like a real life software company.  You’ll learn how to work in an agile environment, do code reviews, build pipelines, how to develop a real life product with a team, and more. \n\n**About you**:\n\nThe ideal candidate is someone who has little to no professional experience but is eager to learn and break into tech. Must be at least 18 years of age.  Must be willing to put in at least a few hours per week, and must be friendly and kind.\n\n**About me:** \n\nI am a senior software engineer who has some time on his hands after working for a very successful startup that was acquired last year.  I was self taught and leaned on others online heavily to learn early in my career and would like to pay it forward.\n\nLeave a comment or drop me a DM if you’d be interested in a program like this.

Here's what I'm currently doing:\n\nCoding along with courses: I never just watch. I type everything out and modify it to make sure I understand it. Helps in the moment but doesn't seem to stick long-term.\n\nAnki flashcards: For syntax and common patterns. Jury's still out on whether this is actually useful for programming. Feels weird flashcarding code.\n\nTalking through concepts out loud: When I finally understand something, like really grasp WHY a list comprehension works the way it does and not just how to type one, I talk through it out loud and record it in Willow Voice. The transcript goes into a concepts folder I can review. Explaining it out loud cements it way better than just reading about it, and I have notes in my own words to reference later. This has been the most useful method so far, honestly.\n\nSmall projects: Trying to apply each new concept in a tiny project instead of just doing textbook exercises. Made a basic CLI expense tracker last week to practice file I/O and it forced actual problem-solving versus following instructions.\n\nBut I still feel like I'm missing something.

I left this as well after reading online that Spring Boot jobs usually require experience and that it is hard for freshers to get hired.\nThen I thought app development might be a better option. I learned JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, but later found out that there are very few fresher-level jobs and most companies ask for experienced developers.\nAfter that, I decided to learn MERN stack. I learned Node.js and Express, but before moving further, I again came across information that MERN is overcrowded and many people are struggling to get jobs.\nNow, I have finally decided to stay focused and not switch again. I am currently learning Node.js, Express, AWS, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, and authentication, and I am committed to completing this stack.\nHowever, I still have a strong interest in Java Spring Boot. I keep learning it slowly on the side, but the thought that it is hard to get a Spring Boot job as a fresher still bothers me.\nI still want to learn springboot but i dont know what and how much i have to learn in it to get a job.\n\nMoreover, I have been labeled as mentally ill by some of my neighbors and relatives because I stayed mostly in my room for nearly a year, just learning and repeatedly changing my tech stack. This has been extremely painful.\nThey treat me as if I am mentally incapable. Relatives often laugh at me for not having a job and humiliate me repeatedly. What hurts even more is that most of them are uneducated, and their children are over 26 years old with education only up to the 10th grade. Despite this, they constantly judge and mock me for being unemployed.\nAfter facing this kind of treatment for such a long time, it has started affecting me deeply. I now sometimes feel that I am good for nothing.",

Freedom of choice, experiences, opportunities.\n\nThe problem is that I'm having a lot of difficulty being consistent with my studies.\n\nEven sleeping 6 or 10 hours a day, when I sit down at my laptop to study, I start to feel very sleepy. This only happens specifically when I'm studying, when I'm learning new things; it's like something very exhausting for my brain, even if it's a minimally difficult code for a beginner. I break it down into small parts to help me understand how everything works and progress, but even then it seems difficult.\n\nIt's like I'm living far below my potential. I want to be more disciplined, more obsessed, more ambitious. Sometimes I think it would be easier if I were like a machine that just executes, doesn't feel, doesn't get tired, doesn't doubt, just acts.\n\nThen I start to doubt my ability, that maybe I'm not capable, that maybe I won't be able to achieve what I want. And that frustrates me a lot, because at the same time I believe in myself and then the bad thoughts come, that if I'm going to live a miserable life, it would be better to just die and not be here anymore.\n\n\nHas anyone ever gone through something similar?\n\nHow did you resolve it?\n\nAny advice or experience regarding these two questions would be very welcome.\n\nThank you for reading this far.",

This is kindof a different related service on its own but handles the same data.\n**Database** - Currently PostgreSQL queried with Sequelize. \n\nThese will be deployed to two different Cloud Runs (serverless) services on GCP where the ingestion service is scheduled and then there's the app. Haven't decided yet about where the DB is going to be ultimately but maybe CloudSQL makes sense and that integrates well with Looker studio analytics tool.\n\nFor my use case TypeScript and a relational db makes more sense as there are many related tables and also data integrity of these business deals is important so schema validation needs to work well here.\n\nHowever, the amount of different columns in my tables is now around 30 and there might be more later so querying might become a bit performance expensive especially when there's eventually gonna be thousands of entries, if not tens of thousands.\n\nAlso as a sidenote, I am later contemplating a chatbot AI like feature in the app which could use some form of NL2Query solution to get requested deal information from inquiries eg. \"How many people are assigned for x particular deals from last month?\" \n\nEverything except the frontend is set up and works well already and the amount of users and data is not that large yet.\n\nI guess my question is whether rethinking the REST and moving into GraphQL would be better for this use case instead of just keeping things as is and using Elasticsearch if more effective inqueries are needed?\n\nThanks!",

The thing is, I dont mind a challenge, I dont learning something hard, its actually more fun that way but when it feels like everyone else has it easy and im the only struggling one, it becomes very discouraging. Coding seems easy to others and hard to me.\n\nIm learning through code academy and making a few projects of my own so far but still looking for additional resources.\n\nEdit: Appreciate all the positive comments (:",

        "title": "I am reading \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software second edition\" and I am confused by the adding of XOR gates on the input and output of the \"Add/subtract unit\"",
        "author": "MindlessAssistance52",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nSo I am at chapter 21 of the book, and the author has finished building a \"add/subtract unit\" part of the CPU. \n\nhttps://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter21/\n\nMy confusion is about the subtract part of the arithmetic unit. When we start a subtraction, we use the opcode \"10\", which forces a CI of 1 for the two's complement operation. (Which ends up giving something like A + B inverted + 1) This is done for the first pair of bytes for a multibyte number. Afterwards, the next pairs are treated using the Opcode of \"11\".\n\nThe actual CY In has no effect at this stage (Opcode 10), so the only things we are left with are the first part of the sum and a potential Carry out.\n\nPreviously, the author built something called a \"triple byte accumulator\" which was a precursor (https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter20/) where when doing a subtraction using two's complement, if you had a carry out generated during the operation, it would end up being used in the middle byte part, and if the middle byte sum ended up producing a carry out as well, it would end up being used in the high byte part of the operation of the 24 bit number.\n\nNow, the author, for some unknown reason to me, has introduced two \"XOR gates\" at the input and ouput of the arithmetic unit. He doesn't mention anything about them besides : \n\n> This is a little different from the circuits shown in the book in that the values of both CY In and CY Out are inverted for subtraction. (The entry in the lower-right corner of the table on page 322 should be inverted CY)\n\nIn the book, at the point where I am, nothing is mentioned as to why or what is done with those inverted signals.\n\nDuring addition (Opcodes of 00 or 01), those XOR gates have no effect whatsoever as if they did not exist. When subtraction/\"addition in two's complement\" is done, they do invert the Carry out signal of the adder ... but here is the strange thing:\n\nif my adder produces a Carry output of 1 , the XOR transforms it to 0 ... and when this tranformed signal is used in the next part of the operation for the next pair of bytes, the XOR gate at the input \"undoes\" the 0 so we end up having a raw bit of 1 ... as if nothing actually happened. The same logic happens if my carry output produces a 0, it is transformed to 1, and when it is fed back to the CY In, the XOR gates undoes the effect and we end up with a 0 again as the input to the adder.\n\nClearly, then, those gates are not affecting the function of the actual \"subtraction\" and everything is functioning as I would expect it to. My question then would be : why exactly is the author adding those two XOR gates?\n\nThe only reason I could think of is those inverted signals are going to serve some (unknown) use later on, but outside of that I can't really think of anything else.\n\nAny help or guidance would be much appreciated...",

Maybe one in Python and one in R? Bonus points if it's economics adjacent.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nP.S. To add some context, I've played around with linear and nonlinear regression before, as well as with very light data cleaning. On the other hand, I have no clue what an API is or what Git / version control might mean (beyond a few preliminary Google searches). As for survey design, I can imagine it might require an outsized amount of effort to incorporate into a project, so I'm not too hung up on including it if I can just teach myself the basic theory instead.",

        "content": "So I spent around 8 months grinding LSAT prep last year (hit a 172 on my final attempt), and after deciding not to pursue law for personal reasons I started learning Python about 6 weeks ago. The weird thing is, I keep noticing these parallels between logic games on the LSAT and writing conditional statements. When I'm building if/else chains or tracing through nested loops, it genuinley feels similar to solving a sequencing game where you have to track which constraints apply in what order. My brain seems to latch onto that kind of structured reasoning pretty fast.\n\n\n\nBut I'm also running into walls my LSAT brain completley can't help with. Syntax errors are brutal because I'll understand the logic perfectly and still forget a colon or mess up an indentation and the whole script breaks. LSAT trained me to reason on paper in the abstract, so the hands-on debugging side feels like a totally seperate skill that I haven't even started building yet. Has anyone transitioned from a logic-heavy non-tech background into programming? Im genuinely unsure if my prep gives me a real edge or if I'm basically starting from zero in terms of what actually matters here.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking for quite a while about designing a loop-centric programming language, and during my research I came across the theoretical LOOP language associated with Dennis Ritchie, who has always been one of my biggest inspirations.\n\nThe project I’m working on is called Gamma Loop. It’s a transpiled language, with the transpiler written entirely in C. The idea behind this choice is to keep the toolchain lightweight, portable, and fast, while still leveraging mature C compilers for optimisation and broad platform support. The goal is not to compete with mainstream languages, but to explore a minimal, loop-driven design that could be useful for specific niche or experimental applications.\n\nConceptually, I’m focusing on making iteration the central abstraction of the language. Rather than treating loops as just another control structure, the idea is to build the language around them as the primary computational mechanism. The syntax is intentionally minimal and structured, and I’m aiming for clarity over feature density.\n\nAt this stage, I’m mainly interested in feedback from a theoretical and language-design perspective:\n\n1.Does a loop-centric paradigm offer meaningful conceptual advantages?\n\n2.Would such a design be interesting from a computability or formal methods standpoint?\n\n\t\n\nI’d really appreciate any thoughts, criticism, or references.",

        "content": "Asking here in case anyone has come across a similar situation.   \nI am working with STM32 IDE v2 and stm32u585 processors. I have a project which is configured with the help of stm32 cube mx and has its own core/Drivers/.ioc files. It is like a ground for using the processor together with other external modules, like sensors, flash chip, LED drivers which are on the same PCB together with the MCU. I have two products using a processor of this family - one is with 64 pins and other with 100 pins. But they have basiccally the same hardware design and use the same pin mapping and peripherals as close as possible to one another. So both can use the same ground project and its configuration and picking different peripherals based on needs. The customer interface is defined separately, in a project that used to be called Application where MMI part is. It is a higher level project and does not need to know what hw there is. Before it was possible to have the ground project as a submodule to  a couple of application projects and it was building with a different IDE and MCU (another producer)   \nI have not found still how this option can work with STM32 IDE. If I create an app project in the IDE and add Ground project I get error about not finding a directory although I have added all necessary folders in the Include paths. I want the .ioc / core /drivers to be used drom the ground project and not create a new one. I linked the ground project to the app project but did not help.   \n Is there a way to use another STM32 project as a subproject (or ground) and change only the main project (Application). and in case the subproject changes to easily pull the updated one into several main projects.   \nI will appreciate any tips and advice. ",

Python is easy to get going with, but once you venture into backend code, frontend fundamentals and frameworks and hooking all this together, it starts to look like a very different ball game.  \n  \nIn my experience, syntax is not the issue of most of the beginners, rather how everything makes sense in an actual project. One day you find yourself learning Python the next day you are working with web frameworks, routing, APIs, and databases. When a person is guided by a haphazard combination of guides, they usually become confused as there is no definite way of the interrelation between the parts.  \n  \nOther learners that I interviewed indicated that a structured curriculum with real-life examples and project aided a lot in confidence and understanding. Some of them stated that they felt such a state of clarity during their time in Quastech IT Training and Placement institute, Thane, particularly when basics were interconnected with the building of actual applications.  \n  \nI have not yet done my research and have not set realistic expectations yet, before investing both time and money.  \n  \nTo students who have taken a full stack course in python - which aspect of it did you find most helpful when getting started: projects, backend fundamentals or frontend to backend connectivity?",

I’m seriously considering majoring in Systems Analysis and Development (similar to a Software Development degree).\n\nMy goal is to work with web development or mobile app development in the future.\n\nSo far, I’ve been studying on my own because I don’t want to start college completely lost. I’ve learned Python up to functions, studied some Git and GitHub basics, and I keep my exercises organized in a public repository. I’m trying to build discipline and consistency early.\n\nHowever, I keep seeing discussions about AI replacing developers, market saturation, and how competitive tech has become. That makes me wonder:\n\n* How does the market really look for someone starting in the next few years?\n* What should I focus on while in college to become employable?\n* Is building projects more important than certifications?\n* What would you recommend someone my age to prioritize right now?\n\nI’m willing to put in the work — I just want to make sure I’m moving in the right direction.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

That could be English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or a personal shorthand that just makes more sense to you.\n\nDefault (English):\n\n        let total = 0\n        for i in range(4):\n            total = total + i\n        print(total)\n\nSame program with a French mapping:\n\n        soit somme = 0\n        pour i dans intervalle(4):\n            somme = somme + i\n        afficher(somme)\n\nSame AST.

Things like Lehman's *Mathematics for Computer Science*, Knuth's *Concrete Mathematics*, and other \"intro\" materials are always recommended in this situation, but they seem to presuppose fairly bright, mathematically able folks - again, not me.

They've learned and come back with better execution. \n\nThe assumption has been it would backfire, Time zone gaps, miscommunication, quality issues, and lack of ownership would eventually make companies regret the move. \n\nBack then, that argument had weight. High-level technical work depends on speed, tight feedback loops, and shared context. \n\nIt wasn't easy to coordinate complex engineering across continents. \n\nBut over the last two decades, US companies have consistently invested in talent pipelines in places like India, the Philippines, and Brazil. \n\nWhat started as cost-cutting experiments turned into long-term infrastructure. The quality gap has narrowed. \n\nWith Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitHub, and real-time dashboards, accountability is no longer the barrier it once was. \n\nWork is visible and there are tons of tools in place for checks and balances before code gets deployed. \n\nAdd AI to that stack, code review tools, copilots, automated testing, and suddenly the difference in execution shrinks even more. \n\nOffshore teams are no longer turning out to be unreliable. They're writing code with AI and increasing velocity. \n\nProduct strategy and client-facing roles are still staying in the US, but a large portion of engineering execution, the high-paying core, is increasingly moving out. \n\nIf a company can get comparable output at a fraction of the cost, the incentive is obvious.

The funniest part is that the system supposed to replace those awful coders is built by the coders themselves.\n\nPerhaps it’s time us coders focused on replacing someone else's job instead of their own. I like the idea of replacing CEOs and managers by creating a solution that uses AI and an internal integration layer to make the best possible decisions. By combining all available company data, market data, and projections, it would make CEOs and managers mostly irrelevant (except, maybe, for some PR). This would ensure only founders or the board are needed, while the best executive decisions are made via an AI management layer.\n\nI think this is an inevitable part of management anyway, but I must admit I do like the idea of disrupting the people who can't wait to replace the people whose work they know nothing about.\n\nAnyway, I have over 15 years of development experience across multiple fields. If this sounds like something fun to build, if for nothing else, just to be able to start making posts about how all CEOs and managers will soon be replaced by AI, then get in touch.",

On the plus side I'm fully remote and the pay is fair if not spectacular so I could also just try to run out the clock and hope I outlast the company if they go under.",

It started with using it as a accessory with basic plan to current state where each developer has $3500 limit (which also they increase happily) of pay per use after the standard 500 requests are exhausted.\n\n  \nThe engineering leadership has explicitly asked engineers to **not write code manually** their stand is to perform every aspect of development via cursor only. Bug analysis, technical design ( hld or lld), code implementation, test case design , tests implementation everything is forced via cursor. The JIRA timelines are set as such that even if you want to go through code manually or want to write code manually you won't be able to and their answer is to use cursor to do analysis and everything. Cursor usage is tracked and people with highest usage are awarded ( literally).\n\n  \nI want to understand how to navigate this shift. Skills of understanding or writing code doesn't seem to matter now or learning different tools ( like docker etc etc )or tech stacks seems futile. When this ai wave started learning Rag, loRa , vector indexes and all made sense but now it only come down to how good you prompt and having basic understanding of software development cycles.\n\n  \nPlease suggest on how to upgrade to navigate this shift also is level of cursor adoption happening in all orgs?",

The upside is that I’ve gotten broad experience across the entire software lifecycle: building features, fixing bugs/hotfixes, writing tests, doing code reviews, managing CI/CD, handling releases (dev/prod + mobile builds), planning, etc.. I’ve learned a lot and have had a lot of ownership. We are trying to do everything according to best practices, if we can.\n\nThe downside is that I’m significantly underpaid for the scope of work, and the company has become increasingly chaotic. A few months ago I realized I should probably move on.\n\nRecruiter outreach has been decent (a few LinkedIn messages per week), and I’ve started applying and studying to fill in gaps. Still, I’ve been feeling oddly demotivated and worried that starting at a messy startup might hurt my long-term prospects.\n\nStill, I feel pretty demotivated and I’m not sure why. I’m hoping that my experience and time are on my side, and that sooner or later I’ll end up at a better company. I know, some people can't even get experience, so I'm glad for that at least.\n\n  \nOne thing I’m sure about is that at this startup I gained experience that I would have had no chance of getting at a large company, so I’m happy about that.\n\n**So the main question of this post:** are there people here who started at a “shitty” or low-quality company and later made it to FAANG or just built a solid career overall?\n\nWould appreciate hearing some success stories or perspective from people who’ve been in a similar spot.",

Faster than writing and I capture more of my actual thought process this way.\n- GitHub issues/PRs for code-specific decisions. I try to be thorough in PR descriptions because future-me always thanks present-me.\n- Todoist for daily task tracking. Just a dumping ground so nothing lives in my head.\n- A daily standup note in Obsidian. 3 bullets: what I did yesterday, what I'm doing today, blockers.

There are a variety of ways that this could play out, but I'm only interested in two:\n\n1. Pass the pip. If I grind out the project, I think there's a fair chance that I could make it. My team is already -2 headcount I don't think my manager wants to lose me. Doing so would likely make getting a promotion or swapping teams hard/ impossible so that I'd need to switch companies anyway, though. The main benefits would be that I could more easily come back to the company later (no black mark for failing the pip), and/ or more time to find another job.\n2. Fail the pip and take the severance. This should let me *barely* hit my RSU vest date, and would give me 60 days of severance to find a new job. Including the time spent on pip/ focus, I'd have 4-5 months to interview and find something new. Since I'm looking to jump anyway, this option is appealing (2 months of free pay), but I'd have a black mark that would make it difficult to rejoin the same company again in the future.\n\nWhat should I do in this situation?

I've been here a little over 6 months at this point. I spent my first 3 years out of college as the first employee at a tiny aerospace startup, then 1.5 years working on automated fruit sorting before getting laid off and being out of a job for 10ish months. When I got this job, I felt so grateful to be employed again. \n\nHowever, now at the six month mark, I'm struggling with something of an existential crisis. For the first time in my career, I don't feel any sort of connection to my work, and I'm working without any sort of drive or passion. My previous jobs, I felt like there were real stakes, not just numbers on an investor's sheet. \n\nI like the people I work with quite a bit, but at this company, like many others I'm sure, the LLM bug is *strong*. Frequently when you have a question, someone's answer is \"have you asked Claude?\" It's maddening to me. I cut my teeth on actual research and engineering, so when I had questions, I had to hit the books. Now I'm...supposed to ask a neural network-powered auto-summarizer. \n\nCombine these things with the constant drumbeat of people saying \"we're automating ourselves out of a job\" and it really is wearing me down. I genuinely disagree with that sentiment, I know there'll continue to be a need for software engineers. But all of those things put together has me really questioning my place and my career choice, whether or not I'm betraying my own ideals, etc. I started working on my master's at my last job, and I find myself wondering what the point of this degree will even be once it's done, just because of how everything looks and sounds right now. \n\nTo anyone out there with more experience than me, I'd really appreciate your advice on navigating this. I recognize that the LLM part in particular is a pretty sizable paradigm shift that we're all dealing with, but I have to imagine some of this sounds familiar to some greybeards out there. \n\nThanks so much for reading my ramble, hope to hear from you.\n\nSigned,\nA Lost Engineer",

I passed:\n-AWS Cloud Practitioner\n-AWS Solutions Architect Associate\n-CKA\n-KCNA\nI know it's not impressive.\n\nI built projects. Documented them.

Moved from Venezuela, trying to enter IT industry now. (I know, sounds crazy)\n\nI'm clearly not a junior, but not really a senior either. I tried CS in 2011, quit due Venezuela chaos, went self-taught while working to survive.\n\nApplied as Full Stack .NET Software Engineer (9 years .NET doing: CLI apps, Worker Services, Web APIs, Blazor Server/WASM, even a bit of IoT with ESP32). My main project has been online for 8 years straight, niche market, but no scaling budget (that's why I'm looking for job).\n\nIs it a mistake applying as Full Stack SE .NET? Should I stick to backend and mention Blazor as skill instead? My projects uses Blazor for FE but I see almost 0 offers for Blazor out there.\n\nI tried 30 applications last week, got 1 interview tomorrow for a small US company that needs a \"Senior C# SQL Developer\", remote, 2.5k/month (I'd happily take it as first professional job).\n\nThey want: Sr C#/SQL, Azure is a plus, good English required.\n\nEFSET says I'm C1/C2 but honestly I'm not sure, never took any courses in my life, yet I've spoken with some friends via discord and they understood me just fine so I guess I'm going to be fine here.\n\nI know the Azure basics (Key Vault, VMs, Azure SQL with Entra ID). No certs yet.\n\nBut I fear I'll fail the technical interview because it's been years since I solved any DSA/leetcode, never worked with real distributed systems in my life. I've built my apps with layered architecture, used EF Core, handled race conditions with semaphores, but never touched Kafka/RabbitMQ/CQRS in production and my projects never hit 1k users. Handled JWT for auth most times and my own auth system as I never hit so many users.\n\nSo... my question: Does a small company paying 2.5k remote really expect leetcode mastery? Or maybe just \"can you build features and not break things and pass the following basic DSA excercises\"?\n\nAlso: Should I switch to Backend only and keep Blazor as skill? Feel like I wasted 3 years learning Blazor instead of React/Angular since jobs are rare to find with Blazor. Maybe I get better or more offers with C# only and not look like a jack of all trades, master of none.\n\nI want to enter the industry and once inside, keep building my skills and finally try to apply for better positions after some years. I can live with 2.5k USD a month for some years.\n\nWhat should I expect in technical interview? What to refresh today?\n\nThank you for readng! I tried to summarize it all with AI, btw I'm trying to use AI to help me when I get stuck and it has been useful to be honest. I have no idea if mentioning the use of it is a problem when applying.",

I ask \\*how\\*\n\nI've grown a lot in this career, I know how to push back and assert myself. I've come to expect companies to ramp up pressure (even without deadlines, just constantly hammering with wanting something ASAP). I've come to expect tech debt to keep climbing unless I sneak it in here and there on other tickets.\n\nBut I guess I am tired of it?\n\nI'm trying to \"not care\" but I just won't? I want to do a good job and write good code. So abandoning that and putting out lackluster results both scares me and feels like a betrayal to my core needs as a person. Plus it feels so reckless when I know that pressure will just end up with my colleagues instead of me. Or I worry that I'll come off badly to the customer (despite assurances from my manager that I'm very good at what I do and that I'm valued). And I KNOW that companies play ball this way, with manipulating emotions for benefit. I KNOW it's fascist bs...I just don't know what to do anymore about it.\n\nI dunno... I've also never quit without prospects lined up. I'm interviewing, people contact me without me needing to reach out and that's cool... But to be brutally honest, I am not sure if I should stick in this career if I can't figure out how to \"not care\" enough to resolve this pressure problem.\n\nEsp with all this AI bullshit... I feel it has gotten esp worse with that. I've done my part to communicate the problems and have been grateful my colleagues express similar concerns... It feels good to reclaim some power and remind them (and me) that you don't have to accept this BS and that if you can push back on it then you absolutely can and should.\n\nBut it's hard despite that not to unsee the writing on the wall and not feel like I'm  wanted... Because if places were willing to ship slop and horrific tech debt into prod before, now they can just do it for free. And now one of our customers wants a discount if the engineers don't use AI in their daily workflow. Like... that's a sinking ship for sure, and I worry it's not the only place working that way.\n\nAnyone have some advice on this?\n\nOr am I in denial, and maybe dropping out is the best choice atm?\n\nTrying to identify maybe where I am seeing this in black and white, because there are plenty of people doing fine in this industry too, and I don't want to doompost because it may not be helpful. Most of the assignments I have had have been with larger private companies, which has me wondering if a smaller private company or government job would have less pressure and be a better fit?\n\nI am in Europe, and I have savings...so not really worried financially.

If I fail, I’ll return to job hunting. While studying, I still follow tech news and social media, where I see extreme views about AI/LLMs either denying they’re real or claiming there will be no jobs left.\n\nPersonally, I use it for learning, translating (even after writing this text, I told AI to fix grammar mistakes without changing my text), and of course coding small projects that I don’t really care about, like a habit tracker or my static Jekyll blog. I believe it’s a great tool that will make our jobs easier, and the only bad thing I think we programmers might face is being pushed toward more productivity. I know ai is a new trend too, while interviewing on school I got pushed to add LLM to random apps that have zero usability like LLM powered graduation system etc. So I see myself at center. But both sides of the internet disagree with me, and I’m confused.\n\n**The Anti-AI** side claims the AI boom will collapse and disappear, leaving only old AI generated artifacts behind. They reject LLMs entirely. I disagree. if companies can make money from it, it won’t just vanish. They call entire LLM products slop (yes %90 of them are) but they get frustrated even when someone uses AI voice with their own voice.  \n**The Pro-AI** side, on the other hand, says the AI bubble isn’t real and that if I don’t use AI everywhere, I’m doomed. They claim art and desk jobs are already dead. I don’t think that’s true either, at least for now. Many self-proclaimed “prompt engineers” don’t understand what good code actually looks like. It may work today on one machine, but that doesn’t mean it’s reliable everywhere.\n\n**TL;DR:** I’ve noticed social media is extremely polarized about AI. One side says it’s fake and will collapse, the other says it will replace all jobs and you’re doomed without it. I personally see AI as a useful tool that improves productivity, but not as something that will either disappear or completely replace human work.\n\nSo my question is: I believe these two separate groups are in huge echo chambers that only hear what they want, and I just can’t research and learn about AI technologies without entering those chambers of insanity. I would love to learn from people who are trying to share information instead of propaganda. I would really appreciate it if you could share what you read or watch.",

        "content": "Hey all, just wanted to get this off my chest and see if there’s any outside opinions. In November of last year I was transitioned from my original organization to a new one within the same company due to some shady stuff pulled by the C-Suite.\n\nMy previous team was all US based, but we were pulled into a new team which is a US/India split & now days start at 5:30am which I didn’t sign up for when I joined 3 years ago. Not to mention I was up for a promotion right before this transition and now I’m back to square 1.\n\nOn top of this, when transitioning we were promised we would be rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career. Our new engineering manager who has zero tech background has stonewalled this as she constantly needs “data” to validate it.\n\nThe existing codebase is an absolute nightmare and all they do is defect/bug fixes with no innovation at all. I haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months and just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect ticket which they pointed to 3 story points. Myself and one other member from my old team have practically begged our manager to allow us to start working on the new POC as we are doing nothing.\n\nI find myself getting so angry after giving years of my life to this place and basically getting demoted… but that’s corporate America I guess. I unfortunately have been applying to other jobs to no avail, but don’t know how much longer I can stick this out for my own sanity. Any advice or input would be appreciated, but either way thanks for hearing me out. Im tired fellas.",

I graduated back in 2017 with a B.S in CS. \n\nSo I am trying to seek best path forward to pivot my career to either Backend development or preferably machine learning. \n\nI have heard alot about online masters degrees like omscs but also heard about how they are only useful if you do internships. Due to financial commitments, I cant just quit my job so I need to work to pay the bills and study in my spare time. \n\nWhat are your advice in regards to ways to pivot my path? \n\nThinking out loud getting a masters degree seems like a good idea but my concerns are :   \n1. Does it actually make a difference without internships?  \n2. It requires 3 letters of recommendation and it has been so long I dont think any of my professors even remember me or are even teaching to be able to ask for letters recommendation specially since back then there were not many internships or school projects for me to actually have more meaningful interactions with them. I also have only maybe 1 or 2 manager recommendations I may be able to acquire from work. \n\n  \nAny advice is much appreciated. ",

        "content": "I’m a frontend engineer. I’ve been doing frontend for like 10 years now and feel very competent when it comes to actually developing software *on the frontend*. I’ve received lots of positive comments on my frontend code basically anywhere I worked, but it seems to not be that highly valued\n\nHowever, I’ve always felt like I struggled in my career. Although I was ostensibly hired as a frontend engineer, I often find that I’m assigned to sort of ancillary projects. For example, I worked at (big company) and I think I barely even touched the frontend code and spent the majority of my time doing operational stuff and infrastructure. I felt I spent **far** more time being what effectively amounted to a SRE, which I didn’t feel particularly competent at\n\nAt this company, I occasionally pointed out that there were some things that were more difficult or tedious than they needed to be. As an example, the i18n had tons of problems; if you didn’t add translations using a **very specific, multi day process**, then the entire site would crash. One day, someone on the team triggered this bug, causing a huge problem. I brought up to my manager that this kind of bug is not normal. I offered to perhaps fix it, and offered multiple “levels” of fixes, with the most minimal being a 2 line change that’s forward-facing so at least it wouldn’t happen *again*\n\nHe said I had no idea what I was doing, said I was lying on my resume, and told me whatever I learned in the past doesn’t matter here because this company is simply **better** than whatever companies I worked at before. He said he didn’t want to hear me talk about it again. He instructed me to “document the process” of adding a string to the i18n. It almost seemed like the frontend was so flimsy, they didn’t want anyone to touch it unless *absolutely necessary*.\n\nOn the same note with that i18n, I noticed that the plurals were… all just wrong. People would have strings like “10 user(s) online”. I told them that this doesn’t work in other languages, and they asked me to prove it was actually a problem. I went through the spanish translations and pointed out at least 20, and a couple extra in other languages. I proposed using a built-in \\`Intl\\` library, and they said I was way overcomplicating things and that I still haven’t proved there’s a problem because they “don’t speak any language other than english” and “didn’t understand what was wrong with the spanish translation”. I didn’t really know how to respond; I showed them in google translate using “el angel” and “los angeles”, but they kept insisting I was making problems where none existed\n\nWhenever I talk to anyone at work about anything, it feels like I’m expending “good will tokens”. Like even just asking a simple yes/no question will take a week of work to earn back. I reeeeeally don’t like talking to anyone I work with, at any company I’ve been at. I can’t tell if I’m doing something wrong that’s pissing people off, so I try to lay low and do nothing wrong. Whatever technical skills I have seem more or less worthless these days, honestly. Sure, give me a ticket and I’ll get it done very quickly with thorough unit/integration/e2e tests before the deadline… but… **something** is gonna go wrong after that and none of that will matter\n\nI’m just wondering, is this what it’s like for most people, or is it like… genuinely me that’s the problem?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey,\n\nI graduated with a CS degree two years ago, and have been working for 1.5 yrs now in an SME.\n\nThe first year was fairly typical. There were some web development projects for a client, where I was a junior dev in the team doing fullstack. Although there was some crunch, I got to learn a lot of skills hands-on.\n\nThe last few months however, the company has begun to lay off most devs. There's 3-4 devs on this product, and what concerns me is that we're now building it pretty much entirely with tools like Claude and Antigravity aiming to get it done fast. Granted, the lead is experienced and knows his fundamentals very well, and he did lot of the development himself before I came onto the project, so the project is likely not a lost cause.\n\nI'm mainly concerned about my own career growth. Don't get me wrong, I use Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity a lot when I'm stuck, and try to learn the concepts from there.\n\nBut I feel like I don't really learn as much about the fundamentals, languages and frameworks used, etc. when I just spit prompts to Antigravity to fix errors, build this or implement X feature - and for that to be the development process. I don't know if it'll be good for my career development in future. I kind of have to vibe-code for now though, since deadlines are tight and I'm expected to be 10x more productive with AI.\n\nThe working hour expectations are a secondary thing - there's been periods throughout of working on weekends, after hours, maybe public holidays. I think that's a give-or-take thing though, where I've got to set my own boundaries. Besides, my friends in other industries seem to have it worse.\n\nTherefore, I'm kind of considering looking for another software dev job where I have the leeway and time to do things more manually and learn skills better. Heck, pivoting and being a BA is something I've been interested in doing for a while now. But how widespread is kind of AI usage in other companies? If many companies are doing this, maybe I shouldn't rush into things.\n\nAny advice for me to proceed from here? I've also got a side project going on, if that helps.\n\nThanks!",

I started my CS degree in August 2021, and did pretty well in my classes until I had a mental health issue and resulted in me failing a bunch of classes. It forced me to use my summers to catch up on those classes so I never got the chance to do any internships. For me at that point I just wanted to graduate and get me degree. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my career but I liked programming ever since HS so I tried to focus on that. \n\nI took a bunch of electives around it like Full Stack in C# and doing a capstone where I made my own project with a couple other people. I hated it. I could never get over the OOP hump of just abstraction over abstraction. It never clicked with me. However, since my university's CS department was so behind in today's tech, our project was just a CRUD machine so I just got through it and passed the class. All of my classes were like that more or less. For my Mobile App dev class, our project was a Wordle Clone. For my Databases class, our project was a simple Flask and SQLite CRUD program. Looking back on all of my classes in CS, I never learned anything useful. Yeah, I have strong soft skills like problem solving and recognizing patterns, but I never learned any marketable skills. And I understand a CS degree isn't the same as SWE but what am I supposed to do now? \n\nFast forward two months after graduating and I have no impressive projects or career experience. I tried to teach myself React and Javascript since we were never exposed to that in school and I'm so lost. I keep hearing BUILD, BUILD, BUILD but I don't even know where to begin. All of my theoretical knowledge of SWE is just a soup of classes, data structures, and OOP but I can't apply it. Maybe I'm just used to having professors give me a structed course and steps to learn but I just can't teach myself. I don't even know what I want to learn. Front-end, back-end, app dev, full stack, the list goes on. \n\nI decided last month that I wanted to create a full-stack app using React/Typescript/Firebase that connects local musicians together through a social platform allowing them to find others who share the same musical taste as them. For example, if someone who doesn;t know about the local music scene around them they could create an account and list the instrument they play, experience, and what music they like. And then others could find them on this site and message them and arrange a meet. I thought this would be a cool idea and I could show recruiters or whoever. \n\nSince I had no experience building anything at that scale with Auth, Email Verification, Rate limiting I used Claude Code to help me design it. Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree but I still had no idea what I was actually coding. I could see a chunks of code and understand it how it does a specific function but going line by line I didn't know what it actually did. But after a couple weeks I got a MVP, rough documentation of the systems, and rigorously debugged and tested it. And it works. Yeah there's some rough spots and the CSS/design isn't the best but it works. The thing is from this project I just learned how to do system design and product management. I created a product and got an output but I never understood the middle part, the actual programming. And now I finally understand that I just hate programming and it isn't for me.  \n\n\nSo now I'm having a career crisis (I haven't even started my career yet) and scrambling to find out what I need to do. The data world seems interesting so I started to lookup what it means to be a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and AI/ML Engineer. From what I understand, everything past a Data Analyst is heavy programming so I don't want to do that. I know intermediate Python and basic SQL and little bit of Excel so maybe Data Analyst is something I should do? I messed around with Pandas and CSV files and I like how I can see trends from just mounds of data. I also kinda like Stats and Prob in college but idk. I would like to pivot to become a Data Analyst but idek where to begin. Do I get a cert like the IBM Data Analyst or is that a waste of time. I just want to learn.\n\n  \n",

Obviously the 30k more gross income is a plus as well.\n\nThe downside to the Insurance company is that I am a bit worried that I might become too set in my career, the titles in both startups are way better for career growth.\n\nI would appreciate any advice or outside perspectives.",

I think honestly it is because I went into college after high school without a plan and have based on halo scripting skills believed I could maybe make some habit out of it. \n\nFreshmen year was undeclared so really I went into it 2nd year (except for a intro to CS). I have learned basic C++ logic along with discrete, matrix I and calc I. By second semester I ran into data structures, webdev frontend and intro to AI (it was not just those 3 but those were the CS classes).My college offers core classes, and honestly it has gotten to a point that without them I probably lose it because it seems I am just sick and tired of the major and was incredibly burnt out. Reckon despite the grades I got being pretty good like As and Bs I still just sick of the major. First semester junior was not so bad but now in my second I got Backend Webdev, Programming Languages and Software Architecture and it has gotten to a point where I am really questioning if this major is worth anything.\n\nOther things to note, I have 3 minors (math is freebie I technically get that regardless) but I have one in History and Theology for the sake of not losing it. They are not at all a problem for me it is just for a break from code.

I keep hearing about how bad the job market is and well honestly I just believe I am in it to get the degree and then just get out there doing some form of job instead of just school.

HR just doesn't understand my slightly autistic ass, they don't care, they're blind to actual skills in my opinion. There's lot of shit on both sides of hiring and I fkin hate the state of things.\n\nFull disclosure: I am working on a product with slightly unconvential approach to getting hired, I want to validate if I am just weird alone in my ways or if some others do the same. I am not selling anything to be clear. I want to understand how you operate.\n\nI’m exploring whether there’s a better, more transparent way for tech job seekers to deal with this. I mean I've seen some hackers put together pretty elaborate automations to getting hired. Please brag what are your methods? If this is too long, just tell me what you think about first question\n\n* **Do you bookmark companies you’d love to work for and check their careers pages?** like on their domain/ATS page ... **(nope, yes manually, yes via automation, etc.)**\n* How often is timing an issue for you? do you learn you're not one of the first to apply and they tell you they already chose somebody? do you ever manage to apply seconds after job is posted?\n* When you apply, do you track applications yourself (Notion, spreadsheet, Airtable, notes, specific product for agnostic job tracking?), or do you rely on the job platform you applied on?\n* If you knew a company had a reputation for ghosting 70% of applicants, would you still apply? how valuable would you consider this?\n* Would it be useful to see aggregated stats like:\n   * median response time\n   * % of applicants who got any reply\n   * % who got feedback after interviews (not rants, just numbers)\n* **What’s the biggest BS in tech hiring right now? One thing that consistently makes you angry, tired, or cynical.**\n* If tools already exist that actually solve some of this cleanly, please tell me. If you think this is pointless or impossible, tell me that too. I’m more interested in brutal honesty than encouragement.\n\nThanks for reading.

I looked back at about a year of my food delivery transactions and grouped them by weekday and time. the highest order day was monday afternoon. \n\nHonestly, it’s probably not even hunger it’s just cognitive depletion. By 7 or 8pm after a full day of decisions, opening uber eats or DoorDash removes one more decision from the stack and that seems enough. \n\nSeeing it laid out visually made it seem like predictable burnout window instead of poor discipline.

He said a good portion of their summer interns get return offers at the end of their program and they absolutely intend to do the same going forward.\n\nI don't mind the work, and I don't mind doing that full-time if I do happen to get a return offer BUT I am still a programmer at heart and I would definitely prefer a job or internship that has me writing code, be it traditional SWE or agentic AI or traditional ML.\n\nIf I do get the role and I don't have any other offer, I will take it. I don't think I can be a choosy beggar in this market lol\n\nBut do you guys think it will hurt my chances for a more traditional role later on?

        "content": "I received a chat message and email from HR yesterday that I had been identified as a critical resource on my team and that they were going to send a survey to my supervisors, peers, and subordinates, asking for feedback on my performance. I was told repeatedly in the email that \"This is not negative!\". I was also told that I'm one of three people in the entire company that they've done this for. The \"goal\" according to them is to help ME and to.make things easier for ME. They will take the survey results and create a learning plan for me. \n\nEmbedded in this email where they kept repeatedly saying \"This is NOT a bad thing!\" was a small snippet that mentioned \"planning for my succession\". \n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is, how does this help ME? My team needs more resources, and that would help me a lot. The company could pay me more, but I'd take more resources over more money - anything that would help me to not work 80 hours per week. We have a very flat structure and there's no path upwards for me. Besides that, I don't think I'd want to go any higher in the supervisory chain. My next level would be director, but it would likely result in more responsibilities with no more pay.\n\nI'm not worried about the feedback of my subordinates or peers. I'm a bit worried about one C level guy who seems to want to hurt me for some reason. And maybe this feedback will help me become a better leader. But I'm not convinced that there's not some ulterior motive, as the company itself is pretty rotten \n\nEx: They fired a guy on Tuesday and HR held an online meeting with our office telling us why people getting fired was a \"good thing\". I'm sure the single dad who was already underpaid felt that way as they walked him to the door with his box of stuff.\n\nSo, should I worry about this? Is this good, bad, or neutral?",

        "content": "TL;DR: Interview went ok but got AI hype red flags. Technical interview coming up - what to expect for C#/SQL \"Senior\" questions? Main concern: they want references but my \"previous company\" was actually a personal project I ran with some US friends, not registered. What do I do?\n\nContext from [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r6n544/should_i_stick_to_backend_only_is_full_stack/): 10 years hobbyist .NET dev, first professional job attempt.\n\nThe Interview:\n\nHR said \"We're looking for a C#, SQL developer\" (no seniority mentioned, but I'm assuming maybe Senior? for 2.5k USD remote LATAM I really doubt it).\n\nThe guy was really persistent about AI adoption, at some point he just told me: \"We contacted you because all our deployments are on Azure and you have solid .NET background, but in the end after some time the language won't matter, AI will code everything in any lang, so we don't really worry about it... so are you currently using AI? how are you implementing it? do you know RAG?\"\n\nObviously I said yes even though I had no idea what RAG was. Now buying Udemy course to catch up. They have their own local models apparently.\n\nWhen I heard \"the language won't matter\" I saw a huge red flag, almost cancelled right there, but I need the job so I just went \"ok, alright, you're right\". I truly doubt anybody can debug \"any language\" without understanding it deeply.\n\nI'm taking this because it's my first option, but this caused me some noise tbh. I think this company fell into AI hype hard and doesn't understand it, trying to implement AI where is not needed (migrations, etc). But I can adapt.\n\nGood stuff: HR mentioned quarterly performance reviews (\"how do you feel, what to improve, etc\") which sounds decent despite bad Glassdoor reviews.\n\nNext steps he told me:\n\n* Psychometric tests (personality, english, basic logic) - done\n* Technical interview (no leetcode, no coding, just some \"advanced\" questions to determine my level) - this scares me tbh.\n* Reference check to validate CV history\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What kind of technical questions for C#/SQL should I expect? Company does software solutions/migrations for other companies, they have about 500 employees, Azure + .NET stack. They said basics of Azure is fine, not in-depth knowledge needed. How to prep? I feel like I don't know sh!t but also feel like impostor syndrome talking.\n2. About my references: They want contact from \"*previous company*\". But as I said in my previous post, this wasn't a company officially registered, it was a personal project I ran with some friends in the US for 7+ years. Even during the interview I said it but the guy didn't care or didn't listen carefully. My take is to be truly honest here in the next contact I get from them, I don't want to get the job lying, if I'm not a good fit, they should consider this and just don't hire me. Or if they hire me, maybe is because they don't care.\n\nAnyways, the problem is they're assuming I worked in a small company but it was never legally registered, not even as LLC. My friend did register an LLC but that was a year ago, not related to me at all. If they dig they'll see the LLC registration date doesn't match my 8 years timeline. So I guess I can't use that.\n\nThey said it's \"*to comply with regulations and just a formality*\" to confirm I worked there the time I said.\n\nBest I can do is give them number of my co-owners (they financed it, not tech guys, but can confirm project existed 7+ years). Profits were low, was side project for them, main income for me, now the project is closing as I was the only one maintaining it and basically is not even an extra income now.\n\nI can't just not talk about this because this project is where I learned almost everything I know now today. Yet I fail when it comes to Distributed Systems, I never used Kafka, nor RabbitMQ in my life, didn't even needed, I know the concepts but only that...\n\nSo, how deep do US companies dig on references? Just phone call/email or more in-depth? How do they check my background? I was in Venezuela for all those years, I have like 2 years in this new country (LATAM anyways), banking system is crap there in Venezuela so I used mostly Binance to hold money. But I know for sure this is not formal and looks terrible.\n\nReally lost here. If you think I should avoid this company to dodge legal troubles, let me know.\n\nEDIT: I'm trying to sell myself as a Mid Level, not Senior per se (although I don't mention it at all) because as I haven't worked in teams ever, I know I'm not a real senior. The project is 100% real, is online and I can talk about it all day long, I designed every single part of it and it's running smoothly so far, but almost no clients because it's very niche and scalating it would require a lot of money that I current don't have.",

After a few months, I began creating internal tools for the other APM's to automate workflows, over time i began doing this for other departments and have now turned my job into a hybrid role as a Solutions Engineer/APM (a title i gave myself). \n\n\n\nMost of these automated workflows work largely the same, React in the front end, Python/Flask back end and all this is hosted on AWS so everyone in the company has access. These tend to be more simple things like spreadsheet manipulation using pandas, or doing OCR analysis on documents and sending that info to our construction management software using their API. Also have been trying to implement the OpenAI API whenever i see fit, i feel like companies are looking for these skills more and more.\n\n  \nWhat i want to know is how can I use this experience to transition into the next stage of my career? I am planning on moving to the Boston area in about 1.5 to 2 years. Should I be looking for \"solutions engineer\" roles in that area and is this a growing job market? \n\nWould it be hard to transition into traditional SWE? I love the idea of doing full stack development for a startup, that sort of environment really excites me but i dont know if its feasible. I will also be graduating with an MS in CS at the end of this year so maybe that will help. I just want to be able to find a job out there.",

However, I am still looking around in case things don't work out. I used to be obsessed with wanting to do simulation development since I started college but for the past while, I've been open to exploring other fields to learn as much as I can.\n\nThere is someone that I networked with a long time ago that works at the same company I do and does XR work. They reached out to me recently saying there might be a position for me on their team, so I should send my resume and cover letter to him. I eagerly did and was excited about the potential opportunity to finally get the job I've wanted for a long time. I asked a few questions about the work including which part of the work site they worked in, and they said, \"Everything is 100% remote - WFH\".\n\nI would have been excited for the job to be remote a few years ago, but my mind has changed since then, and I feel like I would go insane if I stayed at home all the time. Two things that I really like about my current position and being in-person are:\n\n1. I've been dreading the thought of just staring at a computer screen for the rest of my career, but my current position is focused on hardware, so I get to be more hands-on and move around.\n2. I want to climb the corporate ladder, and because the team I work on is big (and there are just a lot of people at the work site in general), I'm always meeting new people and networking. I also believe you can connect with people more in person than over a teams call/chat behind a screen.\n\nI feel like if I were to work remotely, I would lose both of these things; I'd be stuck staring at a screen all day in my house, and I can't socialize with anyone except my team, which would be through teams calls and messages. I don't have any friends or coworkers that have similar experiences (working remotely vs in-person, climbing the ladder remotely, etc.), so I'm hoping people here have some insight to share. And, I'm not just concerned about this specific position, but any remote position in general. Am I limiting my mindset and there really are endless possibilities with remote jobs that I'm just not seeing? When I graduate, I plan to get involved in social activities like doing intramural sports, pursue hobbies like BJJ and learning instruments and languages, and travel.",
