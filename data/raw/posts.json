        "content": "I started working this job in mid 2019. Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.\n\nBeing new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.\n\nThe premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!\n\nFast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.\n\nEvery single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.\n\nMassive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nIn none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.\n\nChoosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...\n\nSure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.\n\nI understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".\n\nAnyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

Spent roughly 5 years at my current job, all with excellent reviews each year, survived the last round of layoffs, had my performance review which basically said don't make any thing and start putting process in place while the ceo just looked at me in disgust. So I'm thinking I'm pretty much on the way out as the company is planning to buy software that makes what I'm doing irrelevant (Has its own data warehouse, it's own way of loading data, etc).\n\nOur company is currently all on prem for work, so a big shared drive is our datalake, sql server is our database, and the best I've been able to do to improve/modernize things was to introduce Prefect for our orchestration, make my own libraries in python to make loading data easier, show the usages of PowerBI and Tableau and create a data warehouse that did what the company wanted to do, but now has decided was a waste of time.\n\nI've started go through the AWS Data Engineering Exam and Snowflake exams, and I have projects on Github that show the use of Amazon S3, Athena, and Glue, so I can at least point to those and say I have cloud experience that I've set up myself. I've been applying to jobs, but I usually get stopped where they are looking for cloud experience. \n\nI've been working with data for almost 20 years now, so I'm hoping my experience can help in terms of getting a job. Does anyone have any advice out there for how to get an in on cloud experience or what places look for with cloud experience? Would the certifications be enough?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.\n\nWhy am I potentially cooked?\n\nData stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. \n\nNow that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.\n\nI asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.\n\nI know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.\n\nI’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?\n\nTldr:\nAlmost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.\n\nPrecog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish. \nEach has tradeoffs depending on your scale, team size, and needs.

I work on this project with a senior dev with 10+YOE.\n\nA lot of my work on this project feels like I'm reinventing the wheel. My senior dev strives for minimizing dependencies to not be tied to any package which makes sense to some extent, but we are only really using a standard API library and pyodbc. I don't really deal with any business logic and have been basically recreating an ORM from the ground up. And at times I feel like I'm writing C code, like checking for return codes and validating errors at the start of every single method and not utilizing exceptions. \n\nI don't mean to knock this senior dev in any way, he has a ton of experience and I have learned a lot about writing clean code, but there are some things that throw me off from what I read online about Python best practices. From what I read, it seems like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Prefect are popular frameworks for creating ETL solutions in Python. \n\nFrom experienced Python developers: is this approach — sticking to vanilla Python, minimizing dependencies, and using very defensive coding patterns — considered reasonable for ETL work? Or would adopting some standard frameworks be more typical in professional projects?",

        "content": "I was running some tests on OneLake the other day and I noticed that its performance is 20-30% worse than ADLS. \n\nThey have these 2 weird APIs under the hood: Redirect and Proxy. Redirect is only available to Fabric engines and likely is some internal library for translating OneLake paths to ADLS paths. Proxy is for everything else (including 3rd party engines) and is probably just as it sounds some additional compute layer to hide direct access to ADLS.\n\nI also think that there may be some caching on Fabric side which is only working for Fabric engines...\n\nMy scenario - run a query from Snowflake or Spark k8s against an Iceberg table on ADLS and on OneLake. The performance is not the same! OneLake is always worse especially for tables with lots of files...\n\nSo here is my fear - OneLake is not ADLS. It is NOT operating as open storage. It is operating as a premium storage for Fabric and a sub optimal storage for everything else...\n\nJust use ADLS then.. Yes, we do. But every time I chat with our Microsoft reps they are pushing and pushing me to use OneLake. I am concerned that one day they will just deprecate ADLS in favour of OneLake.\n\nLook Fabric might be decent if you love Power BI, but our business runs on 2 clouds. We have transactional workloads on both, and no way are we going to egress all that data to one cloud or another for analytics. Hence we primarily run an open stack and some multi cloud software like Snowflake.\n\nWhat is wrong with ADLS? Why. do they keep pushing to OneLake? Is this is the next lock-in?",

I also find it frustrating that sometimes when I ask a question to different people (whom have been with the team for more than a year) only for them to give off different answers.\n\nOur documentation is so scattered its stored on individual or group OneNote, confluence, excel, azure dev ops, some obscure SharePoint, and sometimes pdfs that were just being shared or sometimes not even shared (for reasons beyond my understanding). On the bright side, they are pushing towards a more unified and reliable way of storing documentation. \n\nI get anxious answering to users / operations manager because honestly, I'm scared that what I'm saying is absolutely wrong or something I assumed, so every time I have to ask someone to verify what I'm saying.\n\nI also feel misled with my title of being a data engineer and doing specifically only investigation and escalation to other teams and it feels more like a support rather than a DE (and this is for the whole team, there will be no touching of pipelines / code or actual data).\n\nOn some positive note, I got my AZ-900 and AI-102 (planning for more) and I constantly try to better myself by taking advantage of the free learning sites of the company and now starting some side projects.\n\n  \nGiven of what I am experiencing, is this my cue to find another job ?

I mean, I've had some experience, like intermediate Python, SQL, building manual ETL pipelines, Docker containers, ML, and Streamlit UI. It's been great, but I wanted to up my game, so now I'm following a really enjoyable data engineering Zoom camp. I love it. But what I'm noticing is these tools, great as they may be, they're all higher level abstractions of like what would be core, straight up, no-frills, writing raw syntax to perform multiple different tasks, and when combined together become your powerful ETL or ELT pipelines. \n\nMy question is this, these tools are great. They save so much time, and they have these really nice built-in \"SWE-like\" features, like DBT has nice built-in tests and lineage enforcement, etc., and I love it. But what happens if I'm a brand new practitioner, and I'm learning these tools, and I'm using them religiously, and things start to fail or  or require debugging? Since I only knew the higher-level abstraction, does that become a risk for me because I never truly learned the core syntax that these higher-level abstractions are solving? \n\nAnd on that same matter, can the same be said about agentic AI and MCP servers? These are just higher-level abstractions of what was already a higher-level abstraction in some of these other tools like DBT or Kestra or DLT, etc. So what does that mean as these levels of higher abstraction become magnified and many people entering the workforce, if there is going to be a future workforce, don't ever truly learn the core principles or core syntax? What does that mean for us all if we're relying on higher abstractions and relying on agents to abstract those higher abstractions even further? What does that mean for our skill set in the long-term? Will we lose our skill set? Will we even be able to debug? What do all these AI labs think about that? Or is that what they're banking on? That everybody must rely on them 100%?",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am seeing A LOT of discussion on AI and I feel nervous b/c I haven't quite integrated AI too much in my workflow yet. To be quite frank, I don't know how just yet - I am supposed to be wrapping up a task and moving onto a brand new project. My current task that I've worked on for some time now has been really all over the place - basically, I'm an analytics engineer and I create the datasets that go into dashboards for stakeholders. I work in a slightly niche scientific domain where the parameters of what I need weren't well described and the only way I know I'm looking at the right thing is eyeballing and seeing which parameter is the one that makes the most sense per the stakeholders ask. The issue I am currently dealing with is our data warehouse went through an upgrade and not all the data I need is there - so I have to sometimes use data from the raw data files. And in those files, I have to go through 2 or 3 and find the parameter by eyeballing b/c I don't know the exact name of the field, but can tell what is the right one by looking at it. Also, how we actually want to use and transform those parameters is constantly changing per stakeholders request. There's just a lot of vagueness in this process that is difficult to be clear with a prompt. \n\nWriting code isn't really the hard part for me (with this work in particular) and so far, I use genAI (my work gives access to GPT-5) to help me debug if something is wrong or give me a better solution to what I'm doing, which it gives me a good answer I'd say 6/10 times. I'm seeing people discuss Claude to an extent they are no longer doing anything technical at all really, just prompting. Is this really is for people's work these days? I feel behind because I use AI very sparingly and haven't touched Claude yet. I'm planning to try it out but idk what is hype or real anymore, on LinkedIn people are teaching vibe coding courses and it's like being made to feel anybody can be an engineer now, no technical skills needed. Or the narrative if you're not using AI, you are going to become irrelevant. It's honestly making me nervous about how to move forward in my career or what to do anymore really. ",

        "author": "danielgafni",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "My name is Daniel, and I'm an ML Ops engineer at [Anam](https://anam.ai).\n\nAt [Anam](https://anam.ai), we are making a platform for building real-time interactive avatars. One of the key components powering our product is our own video generation model.\n\nWe train it on custom training datasets that require all sorts of pre-processing of video and audio data. We extract embeddings with ML models, use external APIs for annotation and data synthesis, and so on. \n\nWe encountered significant challenges with implementing efficient and versatile sample-level versioning (or caching) for these pipelines, which led us to develop and open-source [Metaxy](https://metaxy.io): the framework that solves metadata management and **sample-level versioning** for multimodal data pipelines.\n\n[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) sits in between high level orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io)) that usually operate at table level and low-level processing engines (such as [Ray](https://ray.io)), passing the exact set of samples that have to be (re) computed to the processing layer and *not a sample more*.\n\n\n## Background\n\nWhen a traditional (tabular) data pipeline gets re-executed, it typically doesn't cost much. Multimodal pipelines are a whole different beast. They require a few orders of magnitude more compute, data movement and AI tokens spent. Accidentally re-executed your Whisper voice transcription step on the whole dataset? Congratulations: $10k just wasted!\n\nThat's why with multimodal pipelines, implementing incremental approaches is a requirement rather than an option. And it turns out, it's damn complicated.\n\n## Introducing Metaxy\n\n[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) is the missing piece connecting traditional orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)) that usually operate at a high level (e.g., updating tables) with the sample-level world of multimodal pipelines.\n\nMetaxy has two features that make it unique:\n\n1. It is able to track partial data updates.\n\n2. It is agnostic to infrastructure and can be plugged into any data pipeline written in Python.\n\nMetaxy's versioning engine:\n\n- operates in batches, easily scaling to millions of rows at a time.\n\n- runs in a powerful remote database or locally with Polars or DuckDB.\n\n- is agnostic to dataframe engines or DBs.\n\n- is aware of *data fields*: Metaxy tracks a dictionary of versions for each sample.\n\nWe have been dogfooding Metaxy at Anam since December 2025. We are running millions of samples through Metaxy. All the current Metaxy functionality has been built for our data pipeline and is used there.\n\n### AI Disclaimer\n\nMetaxy has been developed with the help of AI tooling (mostly Claude Code). However, it should not be considered a vibe-coded project: the core design ideas are human, AI code has been ruthlessly reviewed, we run a very comprehensive test suite with 85% coverage, all the docs have been hand-written (seriously, I hate AI docs), and /u/danielgafni has been working with multimodal pipelines for three years before making Metaxy. A great deal of effort and passion went into Metaxy, especially into user-facing parts and the docs.\n\n## More on Metaxy\n\nRead our [blog post](https://anam.ai/blog/metaxy), [Dagster + Metaxy blog post](https://dagster.io/blog/building-real-time-interactive-avatars-with-metaxy), Metaxy [docs](https://docs.metaxy.io/), and `uv pip install metaxy`!\n\nWe are thrilled to help more users solve their metadata management problems with Metaxy. Please do not hesitate to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/anam-org/metaxy)!",

        "author": "samuelperezh",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for architectural advice on building a Silver layer in DLT. I am dealing with inventory data and need to handle historical tracking, \"sold\" logic based on disappearance, and storage cost optimization.\n\nHere's how the situation looks like:\n\n* **Source (Bronze):** I receive a **full snapshot** of the inventory every day (\\~60GB/day).\n* **History:** I have raw snapshots sitting in object storage starting from September 2025 (it's already at around 7TB).\n* **Goal (Silver):** I need an **SCD Type 2** table to track changes in attributes (price, status) and determine when a product is sold.\n\nThese are the challenges I'm having:\n\n1. **\"Sold\" Logic with Grace Period:** Since the source is a full snapshot, a missing product id implies it was sold. However, data quality issues mean products sometimes disappear for 1-2 days and then reappear.\n   * I need to implement a **3-day grace period**.\n   * If a product id is missing for >3 consecutive days, mark it as is\\_sold = True and set sold\\_date to the first day it went missing.\n   * If it reappears within 3 days, it should remain active (ignore the gap).\n2. **Backfill + Incremental:** I need to process the history (Sept 2025 to Today) sequentially to build the SCD2 history correctly, and then switch to daily incremental processing for new snapshots.\n3. **Storage Costs:** My cloud storage costs are high ($300+/mo) because I am retaining daily 60GB full snapshots in Bronze indefinitely. Once the data is processed into the SCD2 Silver layer, I want to aggressively clean up the Bronze table/files and keep only 7 days.\n\nI am looking at using dlt.create\\_auto\\_cdc\\_from\\_snapshot\\_flow. However, I'm unsure how to inject the **Grace Period** logic into the native CDC flow, as the native function tends to mark deletes immediately upon disappearance.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. **Pattern for Grace Period:** Is it better to stick with create\\_auto\\_cdc\\_from\\_snapshot\\_flow and try to manipulate the snapshot frame before passing it to the CDC engine like carrying forward missing rows for 3 days? Or should I write a custom apply\\_changes logic that manages a \"consecutive\\_missing\\_days\" counter manually?\n2. **Backfill Strategy:** For the initial run, should I create a logic that loops through all historical dates in order within the DLT definition? Or is there a better way to \"replay\" history into an SCD2 table?\n3. **Bronze Cleanup:** Since Silver will contain the full history (SCD2), is it safe/recommended to run a daily VACUUM and DELETE on the Bronze table to keep only the last 7 days of snapshots? I want to ensure this doesn't break the DLT lineage or backfill capabilities if I ever need to recompute from recent history.\n\nAny snippets or patterns for handling this problem on full snapshots would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "I’ve been digging into the recent news about Fundamental AI coming out of stealth with their Nexus model (a \"Large Tabular Model\" or LTM), and I have some doubts, I wanted to run by this sub.\n\ncontext: we have LLMs for text, but tabular data has always by tree-based models (XGBoost/LightGBM). Nexus claims to be the \"first foundation model for tabular data,\" trained on \"billions of public tables\" to act as an \"operating system for business decisions\" (e.g forecasting, fraud detection, churn).\n\nI have doubt regarding the data standardisation, unlike text, which has a general structure, business data schemas are the messy. \"Revenue\" in Company A might b \"Total\\_Sales\\_Q3\" in Company B. Basically relationships are implicit and messy.\n\nIf businesses don't follow open standards for storing data (which they don't), how can a pre-trained model like Nexus actually work \"zero-shot\" without a massive, manual ETL work?\n\nI've been trying to map where Nexus sits compared to what we already use:\n\n1. Nexus vs. Claude in Excel: Claude in Excel (Anthropic) is basically a super-analyst.  It’s a productivity tool. Nexus claims to be a predictive engine. It integrates into the data stack (AWS) to find non-linear patterns across rows/columns automatically. It’s trying to replace the manual modeling pipeline.\n2. Nexus vs. Deep Learning Architectures (TabNet / iLTM): TabNet (Google) is an architecture you train \"yourself\" on your specific data. It uses sequential attention for interpretability (feature selection).  iLTM (Integrated Large Tabular Model - Stanford/Berkeley) seems to be the academic answer to this. It uses a hypernetwork pre-trained on 1,800+ datasets to generate weights for a specific task. It tries to bridge the gap between GBDTs and Neural Nets. LaTable: This is for generating synthetic data (diffusion).\n\nQuestions for the community:\n\n1. Has anyone actually tested a \"Foundation Model\" for tabular data (like Nexus or the open-source iLTM) on messy, real-world dirty data?\n2. Can an LTM really learn the \"schema\" of a random SQL dump well enough to predict fraud without manual feature engineering?\n3. Is this actually a replacement for ETL/Feature Engineering, or just another black box that will fail when Column\\_X changes format?",

The role will be more corporate and pays roughly the same after the year-end bonus but will require being in-office twice a week.\n\nThe other option is a senior data engineering role at another smaller startup that just raised some capital. It’s better paid but will require being in-office three times a week. Overall, the leadership team is strong and everyone on the team seems very down-to-earth.\n\nWhat would you guys lean towards? Is getting into management in a tech context worth it at this point? Does it offer any advantages as far as AI-proofing?\n\nEdit: typos and context",

Now, these tables are hosted on premises and are being used in production. Meaning, data pull into blob is done only at night so as to not use up the capacity and bring production down (bad idea, i know but that's the situation here). I've been wondering, the capacity would break only if i do a pull during the day. What if i create an application that would incrementally keep loading the data into blob as and when it appends in the raw tables? And also, if there is any way that i can tap into the capacity metrics of the database to ensure that the pull happens only when the utilization is below 40 percent, then that would be brilliant too. Any SAP experts here, please help me out. This would change a lot of things for me.\n\nAs far as I've checked Debezium cannot be used. Now i can keep polling on the transaction tables, but that doesn't seem to help me in anyway. It could be counterproductive. Is there anything else i can use?\n\nThanks in advance",

I am thinking of creating a Python service within Azure Container Apps for the integration part and splitting it from the Analytics data. I am familiar with Python and my boss inherited the mess as well, so he is open to a different setup. Do you think this is a good approach or should I look elsewhere?",

We design complex ETL pipelines from source to target, often with multiple legacy systems flowing into one new purchased system. This is project work and we use a sort of middleware (no-code - other than SQL) to design the workflow transformations. This is E2E source to target system ETL.\n\nThey call us data engineers but I feel like we are missing some important concepts like modeling, modern stack and all that. \n\nI’m personally learning AWS and Python on the side. One thing that seems to be interesting is that when designing these ETL pipelines is that I still have to think like I’m coding it even though it’s on a GUI. Like when I’m practicing Python for transformation I find it easier to apply the logic. I’m not sure if that makes sense but it feels like knowing how to speak English understanding the concept and then using Python is like learning how to write it.\n\nAm I a data engineer?? If not what am I 🤣 this is all new for me and I’m looking for advice on where I can close gaps for exit ops in the future.\n\nThis is all very MDM focussed as well.",

I certainly did, so I created something to help scout out those unknown codebases. Here:\n\n[mitro54/DAIS: < DATA / AI SHELL >](https://github.com/mitro54/DAIS)\n\nHi,\n\nI created this open-source project/platform, Data/AI shell, or DAIS in short, to add capabilities to your favourite shell. At its core, it is a PTY Shell wrapper written in C++\n\nSome of the current features are:\n\n\\- The ability to add some extra info to your standard \"ls\" command, the \"ls\" formatting, and your terminal colors are fully customizable. It is able to scan and output thousands of folders information in an instant. It is capable of scanning and estimating how many rows there are in your text files, without causing any delays, for example estimating and outputting info about .csv file with 21.5 million rows happens as fast as your standard 'ls' output would.\n\n\\- The ability to query your databases with automatic recursive .env search\n\n\\- Ability to run the exact same functionalities in remote sessions through ssh. This works by deploying a safe remote agent transparently to your session.\n\n\\- Easy setup and will prompt you to automatically install missing dependencies if needed\n\n\\- Has a lot of configuration options to make it work in your environments, in your style\n\n\\- Tested rigorously for safety\n\nEverything else can be found in the README\n\nI will keep on updating and building this project along my B. Eng studies to become a Data/AI Engineer, as I notice more pain points or find issues. If you want to help, please do! Any suggestions and opinions of the project are welcome.\n\nSomething i've thought about for example is implementing the possibility to run OpenClaw or other type of agentic/llm system with it.",

        "content": "I am evaluating the ingestion strategy for a SQL Server DWH (using dbt with the sqladapter, currently we only using stored procedures and wanna set up a dev/prod environment for more robust reportings) with a volume of approximately 100GB. Our sources include various Marketing APIs, MySQL, and SQL Server On Prem Source Systems. Currently, we use Metadata Driven Ingestion via Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load data directly into a dedicated SQL Server Bronze DB.\n\nOption A: Dedicated Bronze Database (SQL Server)\n\nThe Setup: Ingestion goes straight into SQL tables. Dev and Prod DWH reside on different servers. The Dev environment accesses the Prod Bronze DB via Linked Servers.\n\nWorkflow: Engineers have write access to Bronze for manual CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements. Silver/Gold are read-only and managed via CI/CD.\n\nOption B: ADLS Gen2 Data Lake (Parquet)\n\nThe Setup: Redirect the ADF metadata pipelines to write data as Parquet files to ADLS before loading into the DWH. Tho, this feels like significant engineering overhead for little benefit. I would need to manage/orchestrate two independent metadata pipelines to feed Dev and Prod Lake containers. But I will still need to somehow create a staging layer or db for both dev and prod so dbt can pick up from there as it cant natively connect to adls storage and ingest the data. So i need to use ADF again to go from the Data in the Lake to both environments seperately. \n\nAt 100GB, is the Data Lake approach over-engineered? If a source schema breaks the Prod load, it has to be fixed regardless of the storage layer. I just dont see the point of the Data Lake anymore. In case we wanna migrate in the future to Snowflake or smth a data lake would already been setup. Even tho even in that case I would simply create the Data Lake „quickly“ using ADFs copy activity and dump everything from the PROD Bronze DB into that Lake as a starting point. \n\nAny help is appreciated!",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI need some professional ideas on how to stage data that has landed in our ADLS bronze container to our Azure SQL Server on VM (or Azure SQL Database) which is functioning as our Data Warehouse. We have two seperate environemnts dev and prod for our Data Warehouse to test changes before prod deployment end-to-end.\n\nWe are using DBT for transformation and I would like to either use smth like the \"dbt-external-tables\" package to query the ADLS storage (using Polybase under the hood I assume?). Define the Tables, columns and data types in the sources.yml and further stage those. I wouldnt need any schema migration tool like Flyway/SSDT I assume? I could just define new colums /tables  in dev and promote successfull branches from dev to prod? Does anyone have experience in this? Also would incremental inserts be possible with this if the Data Lake is structured as bronze/table/year/month/day/file.parquet\n\nOR using ADF to copy the data to both prod and dev environment metadata driven. So the tables and columns for each environment need to be in some sort of control tables. My idea here was to specify tables and columns in dev in dbt's sources.yml. And when promoting to prod a CI/CD step would update the prod control tables with the new columns coming from the merged dev branch, So ADF knows which tables/columns to import in both environments.  \nFor schema migrations from dev to prod I would consider either SSDT or Flyway. I see a better future using Flyway as I could rename columns in Flyway without dropping them compared to SSDT.   \nIn SSDT from what I read I would just specify the final DDL for each table and rest is taken care of through the diff in the BACPAC file.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "We’re currently running our data warehouse on SQL Server on an Azure VM and only have a single production environment. We want to move to a proper DEV/STAGING and PROD setup so we can test changes safely before promoting them to production.\n\nAt the same time, we’re also introducing Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) as a central landing zone for raw data. Instead of ingesting directly into SQL Server like we do today, data will first land in ADLS in partitioned Parquet format (for example `/bronze/<source>/<table>/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/`). From there, it would be loaded into SQL Server. This should give us better control, allow replay/backfills if needed, and make it easier to keep DEV and PROD consistent.\n\nHistorically, most of our transformations were implemented using stored procedures directly in SQL Server. As things have grown more complex, this has become difficult to maintain and version properly, so we want to move transformation logic into dbt to get proper version control, modularity, and lineage.\n\nThe main challenge we’re facing is around ingestion and schema management. dbt assumes that the source tables already exist in the warehouse, but in our case those bronze tables need to be created and updated first, including handling schema changes like new tables or columns.\n\nSince PROD will be locked down (engineers shouldn’t be able to write to it directly), we need a controlled way to manage and promote schema changes from DEV/STAGING to PROD. We also need a reliable way to ingest data from ADLS into both environments, either incrementally or as full reloads, without maintaining everything manually.\n\nRight now, we see two main options:\n\n**Option 1:**   \nUse a migration tool like Flyway? to manage bronze table schemas via version-controlled migrations. ADF would then load data from ADLS into those bronze tables in both DEV and PROD, ideally using a metadata-driven approach.\n\n**Option 2:**  \nUse external tables (there is apparently a dbt-external-source tables package that could handle that directly within the dbt repository) over ADLS and let dbt read directly from the data lake and materialize bronze or staging tables itself using incremental models. This would reduce the amount of ingestion logic in ADF, but we’re not sure how well this works with SQL Server on an Azure VM, especially around incremental loads, schema changes, and operational stability. Also given that the data is organized as `/bronze/<source>/<table>/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/` would that even work as a pointer?  \n\n\nAny help would be great!!",

        "author": "DuztyLipz",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Alright, let me preface this by saying that I'm not a software engineer by profession, but I have been coding for \\~6-7 years. I came to an epiphany/connected the dots. This post may not fit everybody, but hopefully, this can get *someone* out of a rut. Apologies for non-technical refinement/terms in advance.\n\nSo, when I used to watch fundamentals tutorials or lurk Reddit, people would always say something to the effect of \"just build stuff\"... I always wondered why that was or why they would say that without the reason why. I had a tough time grasping object-oriented programming (non-sequitur: we gotta stop using the Animal -> Dog -> Labrador example for OOP... I think it confuses people), but I kept building with OOP--and with the help of others' code in The Odin Project and seeing how it was **actually applied**\\--I had the \"aha\" moment needed to understand OOPs purpose. Here's the kicker though: **there are actually terms for this and why building is so crucial**. Now, it's an adjacent field, but these terms also apply to how programmers think... The terms are: [mathematical maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity), ***mathematical insight***, and [mathematical intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition). It's crucial to tell you--or whom it may concern--exactly what they are.\n\n***Mathematical Maturity*** is basically someone's experience with math, *especially mathematical understanding that is not directly taught*. Mathematicians seriously have to grind math problems because being instructed by teachers only goes so far. You gain more maturity via repeated exposure. Grinding enough problems over and over again makes you reach ***mathematical insight***.\n\n***Mathematical Insight*** is where you have that \"Aha!\" moment, that \"oooooh, that's what that does\". This happens when you \"build stuff\" or solve problems. This happened with me stuck in \"OOP hell\"... After finally applying it in an appropriate way (instead of Animal -> Dog -> Labrador) and applied it to different things, I gained a deeper understanding of it that I could **never** get from a tutorial.  Mathematical insight can't be directly taught. You grind problems/build stuff to get that \"Aha!\" moment.\n\n***Mathematical Intuition*** is where you've grinded the concept so much, it's apart of your repertoire. You don't even need to think of \"how\" it works because you upped your mathematical maturity and insight through applying what you've learned, *instead of watching tutorials;* therein deepening your understanding. This also helps with you understanding the range of projects you can do. It's just a matter of \"how to logically structure \\[insert program\\]\".\n\nThat's basically it. \"Building stuff\" actually makes these programming concepts stick in your mind. The reason I posted this is two-fold: 1.) It would, hopefully, get someone out of a rut and 2.) Give those who say \"build stuff\" a few terms that can exactly describe how crucial it is... For anyone in the industry/do this professionally... What are your thoughts on this? All criticism is welcome",

        "author": "normantas",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Preface. I have 4YOE as backend engineer. I use Azure with some tiny experience with React + TypeScript when I worked in teams that had some React components or a webpage. I have used RabbitMQ and Mass Transit with PostgreSQL.\n\nI still can't wrap my head around why use Message Brokers (MB). Sometimes I find their use. You have an API and a pods for long jobs. The ones that take at least few seconds. So let's say API takes in a massive file and does a request for a long calculation operation which queues a task to the Pods.\n\nWhere my issue falls is when the operation is short so giving it to a message broker does not seem to make sense. It feels a lot of times it is not worth to create the logic for message brokers.\n\nI was reading about making a URL shortener. One person said if you want metrics you will want to use a MB to log statistics and usage. Why not just push the request locally on same instance of a service just different process/thread. I do not thing logging statistics take that much resources? Would it not slow down giving the request and add costs for running 2 services instead of one? A lot of programs nowadays run on 1 thread and just use the async/await pattern as creating a new process is costly.\n\nThe primary values I find in message brokers:\n\n1. Separation of intents and simplifying services. So basically microservices. Though a lot of people are moving to \"modular monolith\" structure where you create a new service when it is needed.\n2. Orchestrating long running tasks.\n3. If you have few seperate services on same machine, some MB can read the RAM data and reuse it which lowers the memory usageand speeds up the process by not sending the data but just re-reading the same data from RAM.\n4. There is probably a case of improved Horizontal scaling.\n\nBoth can be done with an API (without the use case of RAM), though API adds some bloat but so do message brokers and not sure if managing something more complex is worth the investment. I guess also small benefit of some MB is sequentiality of tasks or in case the process fails, it stores the tasks. Though not all MB do that.\n\nIt just creates me  lot of confusion (as my writing is probably all over the places so the confusion is shown). To me it has tradeoffs though I see a lot of people putting MB where they can instead of evaluating if it is worth it.\n\nCan someone give me good project ideas, examples to master the value of MB? Message broker usage is so far and wide and sometimes I do not understand why not just have an API that is closed to external traffic?\n\nI'll give an example of a project I think could use MB: A web Crawler. There is a crawler that collects web pages. Fills the queue with URLs and the Workers consume the URLs and extract data. That is how I would do a basic crawlers for data collection. Data collection like metadata, Urls can take multiple DB queries and such so it can take up to 100ms on a massive page. Though I have to take into account if the Web Crawler can't do the same. If the added time for sending the request take a while. Why use workers? I just add more time to work by sending the request and waiting for it to be consumed.",

The combination of rigid deadlines and my tendency to procrastinate (classic ADHD paralysis) meant I fell behind and couldn't catch up.\n\n**My situation:**\n\n* **Long-term goal:** I want to get a University degree, but that is a long-term project for my current life situation. I want to start learning *now* so I’m prepared when I finally enroll.\n* **The struggle:** If a course is too \"go at your own pace,\" I lose focus. If it has high-pressure deadlines without face-to-face interaction, I burn out.\n* **What I’m looking for:** Are there specific resources, platforms, or study methods that provide \"soft structure\"? Perhaps something gamified, or communities that offer body-doubling/co-working sessions for beginners?\n\nFor those of you with ADHD who are now working as devs: How did you bridge the gap between \"wanting to learn\" and actually \"doing the work\" before you had the structure of a formal job or degree?\n\nThanks in advance!",

It’s basically an automated form where you enter your name, the station, select a specific part from a dropdown, and add a short description of the issue (after it’s fixed) so the next shift has proper documentation and certain parts can be monitored.\n\nI work with Excel on a surface level and thought this would be something like:\n\n“Delete a few unnecessary dropdowns, add some new ones, rename a few labels — done.”\n\nSince nobody else was interested, I said I’d give it a try. I made it clear that this would be somewhat experimental on my end. My boss was totally fine with that and said I could take as much time as I need. We currently use our own list, but it’s all free text, which makes filtering difficult. For example, one station is officially called “03st02,” but colleagues enter things like “3st2” or “3-2”… you get the idea.\n\nAnyway — I received the file and the password for the VBA project.\n\nAnd wow. I completely underestimated it.\n\nThe file basically contains a full program running in the background, constantly cross-checking every input. I can’t just remove, add, or rename anything without breaking everything else. And honestly, for our department’s needs, it feels way overengineered. The deeper I dive into the code, the more confusing (and unnecessary) it seems.\n\nI’ve told my boss that I don’t think adapting this file makes sense and that I’d rather build something new from scratch. He’s fine with that — no pressure.\n\nBut if I’m going to do this, I want to do it properly. So I need to actually learn VBA.\n\nCan you recommend some good beginner-level YouTube tutorials to get started? German or English is fine. I also wouldn’t mind paid courses if they’re really worth it.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAI-Usage for grammar etc",

Just putting nothing where I put the variable name. Is getline(cin, name) ; not correct? I am sorry if this is a simple answer, I looked stuff up but wasn't finding answers to my specific problem.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m planning a small, local delivery platform inspired by Wolt/UberEats, but starting very lean. The idea is to have three roles: customers who can browse products, add them to a cart and place orders, stores/restaurants that only see and manage their own orders and products, and in-house couriers who get assigned deliveries and update their status through a mobile-first interface (likely a PWA).\n\nI want to avoid reinventing basic e-commerce logic, but I also don’t want to be locked into a heavy platform that fights against delivery-style workflows. I’ve looked at Bagisto and similar full platforms, but they feel very e-commerce-centric. Lately I’ve been considering Laravel with LunarPHP (core + Filament admin) and building the store, courier and dispatch logic on top of that.\n\nDoes LunarPHP sound like a reasonable foundation for this kind of project, or would you recommend a different stack or approach? I’m mostly interested in starting with a clean architecture that can scale later.\n\nThanks!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking for quite a while about designing a loop-centric programming language, and during my research I came across the theoretical LOOP language associated with Dennis Ritchie, who has always been one of my biggest inspirations.\n\nThe project I’m working on is called Gamma Loop. It’s a transpiled language, with the transpiler written entirely in C. The idea behind this choice is to keep the toolchain lightweight, portable, and fast, while still leveraging mature C compilers for optimisation and broad platform support. The goal is not to compete with mainstream languages, but to explore a minimal, loop-driven design that could be useful for specific niche or experimental applications.\n\nConceptually, I’m focusing on making iteration the central abstraction of the language. Rather than treating loops as just another control structure, the idea is to build the language around them as the primary computational mechanism. The syntax is intentionally minimal and structured, and I’m aiming for clarity over feature density.\n\nAt this stage, I’m mainly interested in feedback from a theoretical and language-design perspective:\n\n1.Does a loop-centric paradigm offer meaningful conceptual advantages?\n\n2.Would such a design be interesting from a computability or formal methods standpoint?\n\n\t\n\nI’d really appreciate any thoughts, criticism, or references.",

I started by playing around in the console, recording the steps - then decided that I'd write the bootstrapping code for the project (set the context, create the storage account, create an identity for automation, create certs and keys, etc., etc...) using Powershell (I was familiar but not strong when I started). Then I decided I'd try using TDD for this - something that I know in theory but have never really practiced...\n\nSeveral months later, \\*just\\* the bootstrapping of the project is taking up all my spare time - admittedly, that's not a huge amount of spare time as there is a lot going on in my life at the moment. Granted, I've learnt an absolute shit-load about Powershell and Pester - and i'm still really enjoying it - but how do you stop this happening? Any hints and tips for limiting the rabbit-holes on personal projects like this?",

        "content": "I'm genuinely curious. \n\nYears ago, whenever a company announced it was offshoring engineering work, people would roll their eyes and say, \"Oh, when will they learn?\" Guess what. They've learned and come back with better execution. \n\nThe assumption has been it would backfire, Time zone gaps, miscommunication, quality issues, and lack of ownership would eventually make companies regret the move. \n\nBack then, that argument had weight. High-level technical work depends on speed, tight feedback loops, and shared context. \n\nIt wasn't easy to coordinate complex engineering across continents. \n\nBut over the last two decades, US companies have consistently invested in talent pipelines in places like India, the Philippines, and Brazil. \n\nWhat started as cost-cutting experiments turned into long-term infrastructure. The quality gap has narrowed. \n\nWith Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitHub, and real-time dashboards, accountability is no longer the barrier it once was. \n\nWork is visible and there are tons of tools in place for checks and balances before code gets deployed. \n\nAdd AI to that stack, code review tools, copilots, automated testing, and suddenly the difference in execution shrinks even more. \n\nOffshore teams are no longer turning out to be unreliable. They're writing code with AI and increasing velocity. \n\nProduct strategy and client-facing roles are still staying in the US, but a large portion of engineering execution, the high-paying core, is increasingly moving out. \n\nIf a company can get comparable output at a fraction of the cost, the incentive is obvious. How are US developers supposed to compete in that environment?",

I started as a CS major and completed one year, then took about a year and a half off for work that required me to be out of state for a small period of time, that also had impractical hours. I’m back in school now, but I feel like CS might not be for me.\n\nI thought I could handle coding, but I’m struggling. I’m behind in math after the break, which I will work on. Also struggling on programming, especially debugging and thinking through logic. It takes a lot of time and mental energy, and I’m not sure if I can improve. I only have about a year left before transferring to a university, so I feel pressure not to waste time or money.\n\nI feel like I’m more hands-on. I do well with clear instructions and practical tasks. I am considering something more hardware-based, IT, wiring, or a technical field that’s less focused on pure coding. Now, I can’t tell if this is self-doubt or a real realization. Should I push through, switch to something related but more practical, or explore a different path entirely? I never really knew what to do, but went on to choose CS due to its job outlook back in 2023. \n\nI really just need some honest advice.\n\nEdit: I may have not chosen the best words. When I say I’m more hands-on, I don’t mean I can only follow instructions. We all can do that. I just tend to perform better in practical, structured environments. My issue seems to be specifically with coding.",

The upside is that I’ve gotten broad experience across the entire software lifecycle: building features, fixing bugs/hotfixes, writing tests, doing code reviews, managing CI/CD, handling releases (dev/prod + mobile builds), planning, etc.. I’ve learned a lot and have had a lot of ownership. We are trying to do everything according to best practices, if we can.\n\nThe downside is that I’m significantly underpaid for the scope of work, and the company has become increasingly chaotic. A few months ago I realized I should probably move on.\n\nRecruiter outreach has been decent (a few LinkedIn messages per week), and I’ve started applying and studying to fill in gaps. Still, I’ve been feeling oddly demotivated and worried that starting at a messy startup might hurt my long-term prospects.\n\nStill, I feel pretty demotivated and I’m not sure why. I’m hoping that my experience and time are on my side, and that sooner or later I’ll end up at a better company. I know, some people can't even get experience, so I'm glad for that at least.\n\n  \nOne thing I’m sure about is that at this startup I gained experience that I would have had no chance of getting at a large company, so I’m happy about that.\n\n**So the main question of this post:** are there people here who started at a “shitty” or low-quality company and later made it to FAANG or just built a solid career overall?\n\nWould appreciate hearing some success stories or perspective from people who’ve been in a similar spot.",

I intend to pursue careers in areas such as project management/planning and consulting, not necessarily technical-heavy roles.\n\nEvery time I see posts of other students who realise they don’t like programming in CS in these subreddits, almost all the comments tell them to switch majors and that there’s no hope for them if they continue to pursue CS. I mean, aren’t there many other jobs or fields they can do as well with a degree in CS? We dont necessarily have to pursue SDE/SWE-esque roles and leetcode all day?\n\nI’ve personally done 3 internships before and none of them relate to coding so I’m just wondering what’s this sentiment about being told to switch majors if one is not good at programming. I disagree with that statement and IMO there’s so much to CS than just programming. Feel free to disagree and enlighten me if i’m wrong.",

I'll give you much better advice than the people commenting on your post. They don't know anything 🤣🤣\" No you won't. You won't say anything different from the other 100+ comments. Fuck off.\n\nI had to enable the hide all posts feature on my profile because of this sub. I would post something on a completely different sub and someone from this sub will then go over there and comment \"Did you hear back from xyz's assessment?\" referring to a post I made here like 2 years ago...like what the fuck is wrong with some of you? I had one guy send me his LinkedIn after sending me a few messages I never responded to a long time trying to become best friends through Reddit dms. Most of us on Reddit use this platform anonymously. We're not trying to show our real identity. The other issue I have with this is that some of you are currently in uni. Why don't you guys try to interact with CS people in your lectures, tutorials, labs, or the tech club at your uni? For all you know, you could be talking to some guy on this sub who's living on another continent who you will never meet in real life. At least interact with your community at uni/college.\n\nI should've made this post a long time ago but better late than never. The main thing to be careful is to watch out for the people trying expose your identity through something like \"send me your resume\".

        "content": "I got laid off 2 weeks and 2 days ago from Amazon (after getting my only 6 months of experience), and there's always been an underlying sense of insecurity about it. My old job as an SWE was genuinely like the only redeeming quality I have. I'm not cool, charismatic, skilled, or attractive like other people. I'm trying to change that, but no matter what I do, I just lack in comparison to other people online and IRL. Most of the people I live have tech jobs still – hell, I see a few still wearing their badges from my old company. I'm kind of tempted to try a career pivot and get a master's because of the whole AI thing, but I don't know if I can get into that great of a school (and in turn, I don't know how accomplished I could get to feel).\n\nI don't have a job like other people I know now. Outside of my team, almost all of the people I know at my old company still have their jobs. I also feel even more envious than usual of people that were able to get into really prestigious companies that I've gotten rejected from multiple times (namely Google and Apple). Every time I meet someone new, there's that inevitable circle of everyone saying what they do for a living. It honestly feels like I'm lying if I were to say I'm still a software engineer, so I usually end up caving and saying that I got laid off and am searching. I was debating whether to try to hang out with my friends, but I can't help but feel somewhat avoidant since I'd be the oddball.\n\nI know it's technically not my fault (it was a mass layoff of thousands of people, then half my old team including my manager), but as is, I still don't have a job anymore. Beyond getting another position (which I'm of course, working on), I don't really think there's a way to feel better. I wish I could rewind – maybe I could've made it to another company out of college that didn't do mass layoffs..",

The funniest part is that the system supposed to replace those awful coders is built by the coders themselves.\n\nPerhaps it’s time us coders focused on replacing someone else's job instead of their own. I like the idea of replacing CEOs and managers by creating a solution that uses AI and an internal integration layer to make the best possible decisions. By combining all available company data, market data, and projections, it would make CEOs and managers mostly irrelevant (except, maybe, for some PR). This would ensure only founders or the board are needed, while the best executive decisions are made via an AI management layer.\n\nI think this is an inevitable part of management anyway, but I must admit I do like the idea of disrupting the people who can't wait to replace the people whose work they know nothing about.\n\nAnyway, I have over 15 years of development experience across multiple fields. If this sounds like something fun to build, if for nothing else, just to be able to start making posts about how all CEOs and managers will soon be replaced by AI, then get in touch.",

It’s not just AI taking everyone’s jobs (maybe some of them, sure), but a lot of work is simply being outsourced to cheaper labor markets : Eastern Europe, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc.\n\nI’m pretty active on a bunch of subreddits, and the difference is obvious. You’ve got people in the US and Western Europe saying they’ve applied to 100+ jobs and can’t even land an interview. Meanwhile, people in places like India or the Philippines talk pretty casually about getting IT jobs, call center work, remote contracts  and earning high income ( relative to their country’s norm) .\n\nIf someone like Trump argues that protectionist policies are necessary to protect Western industries,  workers and western dominance , and points to China building its economy off the back of offshored manufacturing , then why isn’t this treated the same way? Offshoring these tech jobs might not look as dramatic as factories moving overseas, but it’s shifting income, skills, and long-term capacity to other countries. It should be treated as a threat to western dominance \n\nAnd the bigger picture is this: when you offshore work, you’re not just saving money in the short term. You’re helping build those countries skilled workforce. Over time, those countries  will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.\n\nIt just feels like we’re watching the same pattern repeat, only this time with tech and services instead of manufacturing. Maybe it’s a bit wild to say but I don’t think companies that offshore lots of their jobs like this should be allowed to operate in the country or at the very least they should face much higher taxation that makes offshoring unattractive ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.\n\nSoftware engineering used to feel like the golden path. High pay, tons of demand, solid job security. Then bootcamps blew up, CS enrollments exploded, and now it feels pretty saturated at the entry level. On top of that, AI tools are starting to automate parts of coding, which makes the future feel a bit uncertain.\n\nNow I’m wondering if machine learning is heading in the same direction.\n\nML pays a lot of money right now. The salaries are honestly a big part of why people are drawn to it. But I’m seeing more and more people pivot into ML, more courses, more degrees, more certifications, and some universities are even starting dedicated AI degrees now. It feels like everyone wants in. People from all kinds of backgrounds are moving into ML and AI too, math majors, engineering majors, stats, physics, and even people outside traditional tech paths, similar to how CS became the default choice for so many different majors a few years ago. At the same time, tools are getting better. With foundation models and high-level frameworks, you don’t always need to build things from scratch anymore.\n\nAs a counterpoint though, ML is definitely harder than traditional CS in a lot of ways. The math, the theory, reading research papers, running experiments. The learning curve feels steeper. It’s not something you can just pick up in a few months and be truly good at. So maybe that barrier keeps it from becoming as saturated as general software engineering?\n\nI’m personally interested in going into AI and robotics, specifically machine learning or computer vision at robotics companies. That’s the long term goal. I just don’t know if this is still a smart path or if it’s going to become overcrowded and unstable in the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nWould love to hear from people already in ML or robotics. Is it still worth it? Or are we heading toward the same oversaturation issues that SWE is facing?",

I've never gotten a formal onboarding into my SWE role and it's been rough trying to understand the codebase (product is older than me). I have been exploring an out (low pay here so I want to leave), but my resume is not getting hits and I am assuming it's because my bullet points aren't exactly \"wow, we should hire this guy,\" due to the nature of my career development here. I've changed the title of the first job to SDET instead of QA since that was the nature of my job.\n\nThe tech stack is pure Java (no Spring or anything), but it's rare to even have tasks where I'm actively implementing Java code; due to my nature of swapping from QA to SWE, I end up doing things like working on Jenkins stuff or writing Python to improve pipelines/QA tasks, etc.\n\nI've tried reaching out for more development-related tasks but it doesn't result in any learning opportunities (\"it'd be better to assign this to (other SWEs on team) and it'll be done faster\" or I'll genuinely have no idea how to even approach a task) and I'm usually shuffled off to do more automation/non-development work. On the offchance I do get a development related task and I have questions, I try to ask to further grow my understanding but what usually ends up happening is that they just end up implementing it for me, or the task gets broken apart and suddenly it's a 3 line PR from me, while the actual higher complexities of the original task is assigned elsewhere.\n\nI am working on the leetcode grind, I tend to solve most easies and can handle mediums generally (just rusty with some DSA). I do have a CS degree from a mid tier UC. I am just wondering if my career is fucked (I am <30 lol so this is probably an overexaggeration but with the current state of hiring I feel like I'm falling behind hard) or it's a skill issue by me (imposter syndrome? not smart enough to learn the codebase? others formally hired as SWE with similar YOE seem to be doing amazing) or any words of advice. It really feels like I should've left a couple of years ago, since now I feel stuck in a way where I just have multiple chunks of entry-level SWE experience, and I'm not sure how to proceed.",

The existing team has 3 more people...all non-tech. I was initially going to only work on the AI parts but that soon turned to handling all of BE. The product would be a web-app; there will be an AI agent and quite a few dynamic dashboards with user data. The AI Agent will provide insights and suggestions from the data among other things.\n\nThe issue is, they just revealed their plan for the frontend: WordPress + Elementor.

I’m effectively having to build a \"Custom Backend\" that does 95% of the heavy lifting, including the API bridges to make their WordPress site even function.\n\n**Their proposed workload for me is insane... I am the Backend Dev, Data Engineer, and AI Engineer. Their \"contribution\" is marketing and a drag-and-drop website.**\n\nI’m getting 20% equity to build 100% of the intellectual property...equity is the only form of payment.\n\nI have talked with them about the importance of a solid FE for the product...They are pushing everything to the \"custom backend\" because they don't know how to code. Am I overreacting, or is 20% equity for a solo dev building a complex AI data pipeline and a custom backend way too low? Especially when the \"frontend assistance\" is just a marketing site?\n\nTL;DR: Only dev on the team. Founders doing marketing/WordPress. I'm building a custom AI engine + data parsers for 20% equity. Does this sound like a fair split, or am I being used as cheap labor for their \"idea\"?\n\nI feel like I'm being taken advantage of and don't know how to navigate this discussion ",

Is 2.5k USD okay for \"Senior C# SQL Developer Remote Latam\"?\n\nContext: 10 years coding as hobbyist (not for companies). Got a couple projects in production making some extra cash monthly. Moved from Venezuela, trying to enter IT industry now. (I know, sounds crazy)\n\nI'm clearly not a junior, but not really a senior either. I tried CS in 2011, quit due Venezuela chaos, went self-taught while working to survive.\n\nApplied as Full Stack .NET Software Engineer (9 years .NET doing: CLI apps, Worker Services, Web APIs, Blazor Server/WASM, even a bit of IoT with ESP32). My main project has been online for 8 years straight, niche market, but no scaling budget (that's why I'm looking for job).\n\nIs it a mistake applying as Full Stack SE .NET? Should I stick to backend and mention Blazor as skill instead? My projects uses Blazor for FE but I see almost 0 offers for Blazor out there.\n\nI tried 30 applications last week, got 1 interview tomorrow for a small US company that needs a \"Senior C# SQL Developer\", remote, 2.5k/month (I'd happily take it as first professional job).\n\nThey want: Sr C#/SQL, Azure is a plus, good English required.\n\nEFSET says I'm C1/C2 but honestly I'm not sure, never took any courses in my life, yet I've spoken with some friends via discord and they understood me just fine so I guess I'm going to be fine here.\n\nI know the Azure basics (Key Vault, VMs, Azure SQL with Entra ID). No certs yet.\n\nBut I fear I'll fail the technical interview because it's been years since I solved any DSA/leetcode, never worked with real distributed systems in my life. I've built my apps with layered architecture, used EF Core, handled race conditions with semaphores, but never touched Kafka/RabbitMQ/CQRS in production and my projects never hit 1k users. Handled JWT for auth most times and my own auth system as I never hit so many users.\n\nSo... my question: Does a small company paying 2.5k remote really expect leetcode mastery? Or maybe just \"can you build features and not break things and pass the following basic DSA excercises\"?\n\nAlso: Should I switch to Backend only and keep Blazor as skill? Feel like I wasted 3 years learning Blazor instead of React/Angular since jobs are rare to find with Blazor. Maybe I get better or more offers with C# only and not look like a jack of all trades, master of none.\n\nI want to enter the industry and once inside, keep building my skills and finally try to apply for better positions after some years. I can live with 2.5k USD a month for some years.\n\nWhat should I expect in technical interview? What to refresh today?\n\nThank you for readng! I tried to summarize it all with AI, btw I'm trying to use AI to help me when I get stuck and it has been useful to be honest. I have no idea if mentioning the use of it is a problem when applying.",

I ask \\*how\\*\n\nI've grown a lot in this career, I know how to push back and assert myself. I've come to expect companies to ramp up pressure (even without deadlines, just constantly hammering with wanting something ASAP). I've come to expect tech debt to keep climbing unless I sneak it in here and there on other tickets.\n\nBut I guess I am tired of it?\n\nI'm trying to \"not care\" but I just won't? I want to do a good job and write good code. So abandoning that and putting out lackluster results both scares me and feels like a betrayal to my core needs as a person. Plus it feels so reckless when I know that pressure will just end up with my colleagues instead of me. Or I worry that I'll come off badly to the customer (despite assurances from my manager that I'm very good at what I do and that I'm valued). And I KNOW that companies play ball this way, with manipulating emotions for benefit. I KNOW it's fascist bs...I just don't know what to do anymore about it.\n\nI dunno... I've also never quit without prospects lined up. I'm interviewing, people contact me without me needing to reach out and that's cool... But to be brutally honest, I am not sure if I should stick in this career if I can't figure out how to \"not care\" enough to resolve this pressure problem.\n\nEsp with all this AI bullshit... I feel it has gotten esp worse with that. I've done my part to communicate the problems and have been grateful my colleagues express similar concerns... It feels good to reclaim some power and remind them (and me) that you don't have to accept this BS and that if you can push back on it then you absolutely can and should.\n\nBut it's hard despite that not to unsee the writing on the wall and not feel like I'm  wanted... Because if places were willing to ship slop and horrific tech debt into prod before, now they can just do it for free. And now one of our customers wants a discount if the engineers don't use AI in their daily workflow. Like... that's a sinking ship for sure, and I worry it's not the only place working that way.\n\nAnyone have some advice on this?\n\nOr am I in denial, and maybe dropping out is the best choice atm?\n\nTrying to identify maybe where I am seeing this in black and white, because there are plenty of people doing fine in this industry too, and I don't want to doompost because it may not be helpful. Most of the assignments I have had have been with larger private companies, which has me wondering if a smaller private company or government job would have less pressure and be a better fit?\n\nI am in Europe, and I have savings...so not really worried financially. But my mental health is far far far more urgent and suspect I've hit burnout (or will soon).",

And if I do pick up back end, could I transition to sec in the future? Would that be viable?\n\nJust as an added info: I'm not trying to \"get rich quick\" here.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey,\n\nI graduated with a CS degree two years ago, and have been working for 1.5 yrs now in an SME.\n\nThe first year was fairly typical. There were some web development projects for a client, where I was a junior dev in the team doing fullstack. Although there was some crunch, I got to learn a lot of skills hands-on.\n\nThe last few months however, the company has begun to lay off most devs. There's 3-4 devs on this product, and what concerns me is that we're now building it pretty much entirely with tools like Claude and Antigravity aiming to get it done fast. Granted, the lead is experienced and knows his fundamentals very well, and he did lot of the development himself before I came onto the project, so the project is likely not a lost cause.\n\nI'm mainly concerned about my own career growth. Don't get me wrong, I use Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity a lot when I'm stuck, and try to learn the concepts from there.\n\nBut I feel like I don't really learn as much about the fundamentals, languages and frameworks used, etc. when I just spit prompts to Antigravity to fix errors, build this or implement X feature - and for that to be the development process. I don't know if it'll be good for my career development in future. I kind of have to vibe-code for now though, since deadlines are tight and I'm expected to be 10x more productive with AI.\n\nThe working hour expectations are a secondary thing - there's been periods throughout of working on weekends, after hours, maybe public holidays. I think that's a give-or-take thing though, where I've got to set my own boundaries. Besides, my friends in other industries seem to have it worse.\n\nTherefore, I'm kind of considering looking for another software dev job where I have the leeway and time to do things more manually and learn skills better. Heck, pivoting and being a BA is something I've been interested in doing for a while now. But how widespread is kind of AI usage in other companies? If many companies are doing this, maybe I shouldn't rush into things.\n\nAny advice for me to proceed from here? I've also got a side project going on, if that helps.\n\nThanks!",

Here is my story.\n\n  \nI am a 23-year-old software developer from a third world country. I graduated from a top university with a good GPA (3.9/4) in 2024. I interned at two machine learning software companies before I graduated. I also took an interest in LeetCode problems and solved over 1000 of them. Now I work for a mid-tier trading firm as an Odoo developer with a not-so-great salary.\n\n  \nI was brought up in a family where math was considered very essential for a good career. As a result, I am good at math. My high school science fair projects were often applications of machine learning I discovered independently. I wrote a bunch of manuscripts on math topics throughout high school and college. This is all to say I am passionate about math, and being good at it is really a core part of my identity.\n\n  \nI feel like I have an advantage here. Not many people identify as a \"math person,\" whereas I prefer jobs where I can do more math. My educational background is good enough, and I have an okay history of work experience. The reality is I am earning less than $1/hr, and better-paying entry-level jobs are impossible to find these days. The worst part is I am not doing something as meaningful as I want. I despise this phase of mediocrity, but I don't know what to do about it. I feel like a failure because people (including me) expected I would be in a good position in life by now, but I am nowhere near there.\n\n  \nThe point of the post is that I am lost. Maybe I was wrong about my expectations, and I invested too much in a skill that is no longer as relevant. So I am curious what people suggest I should explore with my skill set. \n\nPS: Academia is not an obvious choice for me because it doesn't pay remotely well where I live, and I am applying for opportunities abroad, though that also seems a long shot. There are not many open positions for software developers other than web developers here so I am open (prefer) remote roles. ",

        "content": "Hi the following wall of text is just me whining about my luck running out, whoa is me, yada yada. But I would appreciate advice after reading between the lines.  \n  \nRecently I was turned down for a job specifically because they said I lacked a bachelor's degree. I have an associate's degree from a community college, and some 4 year university for a mechanical engineering before I ran out of money. I got an insanely lucky break at a small startup anyway for roughly 6 years, then a year at an enterprise position. Both of them remote which is insanely lucky because I live in south PA, hours away from most tech centers. I should have saved up and moved but I was making pretty below average pay so it never really added up. Plus family things kept me rooted where I am. I should have jumped ship from my job sooner but I thought all the experience would look better rather then job hopping. I also had a weird sense of loyalty since they took me on without a bachelors in the first place. The stupid part is I was trying to save up to return to college at that enterprise job but then I was laid off.   \n  \nThat was a year ago. I got an entry level helpdesk position at an old job for about half the pay I was making and I've been trapped here ever since. I got maybe 8 interviews total last year and half of them the companies disappeared overnight. The other half went with what unicorns I assume the market is oversaturated with now. At least that's what it felt like.\n\nAt this point I am at a loss of what to do. I've been up and down the existential nightmare of the AI hype and have safely arrived at the \"it's a tool nothing more\" stance but it feels like it's going to be another couple years before CEOs recognize this. I know most of this thread is in the same boat dealing with that aftermath. But what do I do in the meantime? I get small one off \"maintenance\" with my old company's software I play up a bit on my resume and I'm \"technically\" still registered with them but I feel like it's hurting more then helping. I only play it up because I was under the impression it's much harder to get hired in software if you haven't been doing it recently. If I say I've been doing 99% tech support for the past year that makes it sound like I'm not even an engineer anymore. I had a recruiter straight up ask me \"why'd you leave to do tech support instead\" like I did this on purpose. It's demeaning. It's not that I mind IT but I don't have the certs to move up in it, and I always wanted to build software for a living. It's part of the reason I started having trouble with my bachelor's degree originally, because I wanted to change trajectory and it ended up being too expensive to.\n\nI have a handful of active personal projects, including a rust library, a game engine, and a joint one with a dev friend I've been working on that's more of a SaaS. I feel like entrepreneurship might be my only hope at this point but I don't consider myself business brained, nor do I necessarily consider myself a designer. Even my system design is probably just mediocre at best. I feel gross using AI to churn out slop. I am trying to figure out a way to use it productively like i know peers of mine manage without feeling like I'm building on top of popsicle sticks. I think I'm better then AI but by how much i couldn't tell you.\n\nAnyway I know this is a bit of a sad sap ramble but really it comes down to income. I love software development, I've been doing it since I was a kid, but I also need money. I have mouths to feed and a mortgage and entry level jobs aren't cutting it. My credit card is almost maxed out and the interest is enough I can never pay it off. I'm hoping the answer isn't just to take up a trade like my dad and father in law did. I always felt like software is what I'm meant to do and it kills me that I can't make it happen anymore. If I could even just get some gigs like the good ol days I could hunker down until the economy corrects, but the gig market is basically dead from what I've found. And I haven't had a single bite on Fiver/Upwork. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation?",

You can do great in a few interviews and slip once, and you’re out. Then comes the worst part: “feedback.” Most companies either ghost or send a generic template like “Your profile was impressive…” with nothing you can actually improve. They never tell what actually went wrong.\n\nHow many of you have dealt with this recently or are in the middle of interviews right now? What did you hear back, if anything? What would real feedback look like to you?\n\nI'd love to learn your experience and maybe offer some insights on how to better yourself for future rounds.",

The big downside to the Insurance company offer is that I would have to move, since it isn't fully remote (still 4 days HO/week).\n\nThe upside that I see is way better W/L balance (38/week vs 48/week) as well as paid overtime for the insurance company (as many know, in startups you usually work more than the hours in the contract). Obviously the 30k more gross income is a plus as well.\n\nThe downside to the Insurance company is that I am a bit worried that I might become too set in my career, the titles in both startups are way better for career growth.\n\nI would appreciate any advice or outside perspectives.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve worked as full stack mobile dev for two years now. So far, it’s been good. No complaints. Plus, you can’t really afford to in this economy.\n\nI’m a self-taught developer. I have a bachelor’s degree but it’s not technical. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. I obtained a marketing degree because, to be honest, I didn’t know what I wanted to do at the time.\n\nI realize that technology moves fast, and going back to school will likely slow me down. Most of the stuff taught at school is theoretical. And, as far as the practical stuff goes, that will essentially be useless by the time one graduates.\n\nStill, I feel like there’s a big gap of knowledge that I’m missing. Especially foundational stuff like how operating systems work, how compilers work, and computer architecture. I also feel like I’m missing a lot of math as well.\n\nUltimately, I’d like to become a ai systems architect. One who knows not only how to strategically implement ai models, but also  how to create the models and teach them.\n\nIf i were to go back to school, I’s likely wouldn’t be able to just jump into a masters program. I’d need to end up taking a bridge program. I’d likely apply to a post bacc cs program, like OSU. And then, a few years down the road, if things go well, enroll in Georgia Tech and earn a masters program emphasized in machine learning.\n\nUltimately, im wondering if this is a good idea or just a waste of time and money. Considering how much material is out there, it might be better off just teaching myself these things. Yes, it’ll take longer and it’ll be unstructured, but, I’d be saving money, I’d be able to upgrade myself with hands-on on practical skills, I’d get more hands-on experience while making money, and let’s be honest, I’d be able to have more of a social life (which i could use right about now).\n\nBut, what fears me is the slight chance that not having any technical degree will prevent me from leveling up as an engineer. Obviously I know there are certain fields which almost certainly require an advanced technical degree like robotics or self-automation engineering and ml research. But I’m not too interested in those fields. What i am interested is backend development, cloud infrastructure, systems architecture, applied machine learning (maybe), and maybe dabble in cybersecurity.\n\nSorry for the long post, but it’s just something that’s been lingering in my mind these past couple weeks. And, yes, i do know how fortunate i am to still have a job. Thank you. Wish u guys all the best",

Ever since I did my second semester spring I have come to the belief that this major has become more taxing than interesting. I think honestly it is because I went into college after high school without a plan and have based on halo scripting skills believed I could maybe make some habit out of it. \n\nFreshmen year was undeclared so really I went into it 2nd year (except for a intro to CS). I have learned basic C++ logic along with discrete, matrix I and calc I. By second semester I ran into data structures, webdev frontend and intro to AI (it was not just those 3 but those were the CS classes).My college offers core classes, and honestly it has gotten to a point that without them I probably lose it because it seems I am just sick and tired of the major and was incredibly burnt out. Reckon despite the grades I got being pretty good like As and Bs I still just sick of the major. First semester junior was not so bad but now in my second I got Backend Webdev, Programming Languages and Software Architecture and it has gotten to a point where I am really questioning if this major is worth anything.\n\nOther things to note, I have 3 minors (math is freebie I technically get that regardless) but I have one in History and Theology for the sake of not losing it. They are not at all a problem for me it is just for a break from code. I also seem over the years been very good at being creative with code like stories and whatnot (Data structures we made a text based RPG and the story plot took me 5 minutes to make) along with webdev having like the vision for it.\n\nI just wanna know more or less, based on those out there in job fields already is just having a bachlor's degree worth it anymore. I keep hearing about how bad the job market is and well honestly I just believe I am in it to get the degree and then just get out there doing some form of job instead of just school. I also ask those who perhaps had a CS minor or no CS experience in college but a bachelors degree too",

        "content": "For context: I’m graduating my undergrad this April, and I don’t have any job lined up for me afterwards. I did a one-year internship at a non-top-tier company, but they told me that due to budget issues, they primarily hire coop students (since the company’s focus isn’t software). I have two part-time jobs so I think I’m fine for the most part in terms of finance, but this isn’t good for long-term.\n\nBack to the main-point: I feel very dumb. During my first two years, I’ve been doing everything properly and actually understanding my code and principles. Once I did my one-year internship and then started my final year of uni, I saw myself using AI a lot and even stopped doing stuff on the side.\n\nI feel very dumb because of this since I just don’t know what to do when someone asks me to do something. I feel like I stripped away all my knowledge  of coding because I know I have a method that can allow me to do it faster and easier.\n\nI told myself that I have a few goals aside from focusing on my final courses, and that is applying to jobs, practising leetcode, getting certifications, and working on side projects that are actually useful/impressive. But then comes my ‘undiagnosed adhd’ where I just can’t sit still without needing to randomly search up thoughts of “oh I wonder what the price of Apple stocks are now.”\n\nIdk it all feels like a mess and, while the pressure of being the only child of two immigrant parents is there, it’s hard for me to know what to do. I think I’m feeling too comfortable right now, and I feel dumb every time I try to get outside the bubble.\n\nI want some of your advice and tough love. I’m looking for something that I can drill into my head to keep me going.\n\nThanks everyone!",

        "content": "TL;DR: Interview went ok but got AI hype red flags. Technical interview coming up - what to expect for C#/SQL \"Senior\" questions? Main concern: they want references but my \"previous company\" was actually a personal project I ran with some US friends, not registered. What do I do?\n\nContext from [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r6n544/should_i_stick_to_backend_only_is_full_stack/): 10 years hobbyist .NET dev, first professional job attempt.\n\nThe Interview:\n\nHR said \"We're looking for a C#, SQL developer\" (no seniority mentioned, but I'm assuming maybe Senior? for 2.5k USD remote LATAM I really doubt it).\n\nThe guy was really persistent about AI adoption, at some point he just told me: \"We contacted you because all our deployments are on Azure and you have solid .NET background, but in the end after some time the language won't matter, AI will code everything in any lang, so we don't really worry about it... so are you currently using AI? how are you implementing it? do you know RAG?\"\n\nObviously I said yes even though I had no idea what RAG was. Now buying Udemy course to catch up. They have their own local models apparently.\n\nWhen I heard \"the language won't matter\" I saw a huge red flag, almost cancelled right there, but I need the job so I just went \"ok, alright, you're right\". I truly doubt anybody can debug \"any language\" without understanding it deeply.\n\nI'm taking this because it's my first option, but this caused me some noise tbh. I think this company fell into AI hype hard and doesn't understand it, trying to implement AI where is not needed (migrations, etc). But I can adapt.\n\nGood stuff: HR mentioned quarterly performance reviews (\"how do you feel, what to improve, etc\") which sounds decent despite bad Glassdoor reviews.\n\nNext steps he told me:\n\n* Psychometric tests (personality, english, basic logic) - done\n* Technical interview (no leetcode, no coding, just some \"advanced\" questions to determine my level) - this scares me tbh.\n* Reference check to validate CV history\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What kind of technical questions for C#/SQL should I expect? Company does software solutions/migrations for other companies, they have about 500 employees, Azure + .NET stack. They said basics of Azure is fine, not in-depth knowledge needed. How to prep? I feel like I don't know sh!t but also feel like impostor syndrome talking.\n2. About my references: They want contact from \"*previous company*\". But as I said in my previous post, this wasn't a company officially registered, it was a personal project I ran with some friends in the US for 7+ years. Even during the interview I said it but the guy didn't care or didn't listen carefully. My take is to be truly honest here in the next contact I get from them, I don't want to get the job lying, if I'm not a good fit, they should consider this and just don't hire me. Or if they hire me, maybe is because they don't care.\n\nAnyways, the problem is they're assuming I worked in a small company but it was never legally registered, not even as LLC. My friend did register an LLC but that was a year ago, not related to me at all. If they dig they'll see the LLC registration date doesn't match my 8 years timeline. So I guess I can't use that.\n\nThey said it's \"*to comply with regulations and just a formality*\" to confirm I worked there the time I said.\n\nBest I can do is give them number of my co-owners (they financed it, not tech guys, but can confirm project existed 7+ years). Profits were low, was side project for them, main income for me, now the project is closing as I was the only one maintaining it and basically is not even an extra income now.\n\nI can't just not talk about this because this project is where I learned almost everything I know now today. Yet I fail when it comes to Distributed Systems, I never used Kafka, nor RabbitMQ in my life, didn't even needed, I know the concepts but only that...\n\nSo, how deep do US companies dig on references? Just phone call/email or more in-depth? How do they check my background? I was in Venezuela for all those years, I have like 2 years in this new country (LATAM anyways), banking system is crap there in Venezuela so I used mostly Binance to hold money. But I know for sure this is not formal and looks terrible.\n\nReally lost here. If you think I should avoid this company to dodge legal troubles, let me know.\n\nEDIT: I'm trying to sell myself as a Mid Level, not Senior per se (although I don't mention it at all) because as I haven't worked in teams ever, I know I'm not a real senior. The project is 100% real, is online and I can talk about it all day long, I designed every single part of it and it's running smoothly so far, but almost no clients because it's very niche and scalating it would require a lot of money that I current don't have.",

If it were an important deliverable, I think it would be well specified, like all the things that come from clients or product managers, and if it's not important enough for that, I tend to think it's low value work, of interest only to my manager, who doesn't even want to jot down a few bullet points to make it a success.\n\nI really need a good strategy for dealing with this that isn't guessing, and then getting it wrong, or avoiding it...",

I sometimes even wonder what correlation the logic I learned in my school coursework has with everything I see here.\n\ni have tried learning through these club projects, but a problem comes up. I end up using ai, end up vibecoding. i work on something, but i don't know how to do it. i try to search youtube tutorials, they don't work out. so i end up plugging my prompt and using claude.\n\ni tell myself its because i dont have time to learn this one thing out of the thousands other things. and i keep telling myself that everytime, until its been 6 months already. I am 6 months into committing into all the things i listed before. and when i look back, i feel as if i have done nothing, or learnt anything. it's so demotivating.\n\ni have all these things i want to do, but i cant even do them because im so stuck in my thoughts and emotions, and there's just so much i dont know where to start. it doesn't help that my family is expecting me to score an internship this summer and get that duo degree because it’ll help getting in major companies.\n\ni just feel so behind because of the constantly changing industry and how fast ai is growing, that i dont know where to start. and with the recent development of interviews leaning more on vibecoding, i really don't know what i should focus on anymore.",

        "content": "I'd like to start by talking a bit about myself before I get into my main question. \n\nI'm currently 38yo and I'm on disability here in Ontario, Canada. I'm a dual red seal tradesman and worked as a union ironworker. I've worked on major infrastructure projects across the country and I loved every minute of it. I had a great career, benefits, a pension. The whole thing. \n\nThen one day everything changed. \n\nI started to see the light spectrum coming off of lights. needless to say it scared the hell out of me and I went to an optometrist not sure of what was happening. They did some tests and they told me that I had glaucoma. They also mentioned there was no doubt in their mind that I was seeing the light spectrum as I claimed in their words \"The pressure on your optic nerve is supposed to be 19 and lower, 12 is perfect. You're at 53 and my scale stops reading at 60. From that day forward it was a plethora of appointments and as of today I've undergone two incisional eye surgeries. My glaucoma was severe enough that they skipped laser treatment. \n\nThings have been stable and I'm currently on eye drops. I'm not blind but I am visually impaired. I have blind spots. I can see directly in front of me but I don't have very much peripheral vision at all. It's not just the sides of my vision that are affected it's a narrowing of the visual field so I also can't see my feet when I'm walking. \n\nIt cost me my career as I was no longer able to work safely \n\nI also lost my driver's license due to my vision. \n\nI had taken some programming courses in high school. we learned Visual Basic and I really enjoyed it. I didn't pursue programming at the time because I had my heart set on being an ironworker. \n\nBut now the situation has changed. \n\nI started taking CS50x online through Harvard and I've been really enjoying it so far. I've been looking at the local college here and thinking of going back to school. Being expected to survive on what the government is paying is awful. It doesn't pay enough to even afford simple things. I've been surviving off of food from the food bank. The idea of getting a job that will pay me enough to get off of disability and be able to stand on my own again is very appealing. \n\nBut I'm not sure what to do. \n\nThe local college offers a 3yr programming and analysis diploma with a co-op and they also offer a 3yr game development diploma. \n\nThe thing is, I'm still a tradesman, I'm a bit rough around the edges, I have knuckle tattoos, full sleeves and a small face tattoo. I've been arrested for a DUI in the past, I smoke and I swear a lot. I'm also a no bullshit and very blunt kind of person. Frankly, I don't think that I would survive in a big corporate office with an HR department. I have no interest in dealing with office politics or having to be around people putting on airs and then throwing their fellow employees under the bus to further their own career. \n\nI feel like I might be a bit better suited for a game development studio where I can be a bit more myself without having to tread as carefully as in the corporate world. \n\nHowever I'd be getting out of school in my early 40's. Am I too old to get into game development? What are the honest chances of breaking into the industry? I'd be fine with a small indie company. What is the office culture typically like? \n\nAlternatively I could take the programming and analysis course and hope for a smaller company doing more app based things or web dev. \n\nI'm not sure which path to take and I'm looking for some insight and advice from those in the field.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a bit stuck and could use advice on what direction to aim for next.\n\nI recently finished a PhD in theoretical CS / discrete math. The work was very proof-heavy, including complexity results (NP-hardness proofs) and designing algorithms with guarantees (approximation, optimal, etc). These have all resulted in publications in respected journals. During my PhD (and continuing recently) I’ve also been working at a startup as a software engineer doing algorithmic work (building and shipping algorithms in production), and I have about \\~2 years of experience there. Strongest languages are Python and C++.\n\nThe issue is that “regular” software engineering (typical product/CRUD work) feels boring overall to me. I’m much more motivated by algorithmic / math-heavy problems and roles where the core loop is: model a hard problem, implement/optimize, measure, iterate.\n\nI recently came across quant roles (quant dev / research engineer / quant researcher at trading firms). I don’t have a finance background, but the skill requirements look adjacent to what I do (math + coding + rigor), and it sounds more exciting than standard SWE.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\t•Is quant actually a realistic path from my background, and if so which track makes the most sense (quant dev vs research engineer vs researcher)?\n\n\t•What other job families should I be targeting if I want challenging algorithmic work (optimization, search/retrieval, systems/performance, etc.)?\n\n\t•What should I invest in over the next 1–3 months to increase callbacks and be interview-ready?\n\nHappy to share anonymized resume bullets if helpful.
