The data I maintain doesn't hit PnL directly, but it feeds algo trading, so if it's wrong or late, someone feels it.\n\nI use AI a lot. ChatGPT for thinking through edge cases, configs, refactors. Copilot CLI for scaffolding, repetitive edits, quick drafts. It's good. I'm definitely faster.\n\nWhat I don't get is the vibe at work lately.\n\nPeople are running around talking about how many agents they're running, how many tokens they burned, autopilot this, subagents that, some useless additions to READMEs that only add noise. It's like we've entered some weird productivity cosplay where the toolchain is the personality.\n\nIn practice, for most of my tasks, a good chat + targeted use of Copilot is enough. The hard part of my job is still chaining a bunch of moving pieces together in a way that's actually safe. Making sure data flows don't silently corrupt something downstream, that replays don't double count, that the whole thing is observable and doesn't explode at 3am. \n\nSo am I missing something? Are people actually getting real, production-grade leverage from full agent setups? Or is this just shiny-tool syndrome and everyone trying to look \"ahead of the curve\"?\n\nGenuinely curious how others are using AI in serious data systems without turning it into a religion. On top of that, I'm honestly fed up with LI/X posts from AI CEOs forecasting the total slaughter of software and data jobs in the next X months - like, am I too dumb to see how it actually replaces me or am I just stressing too much with no reason?",

Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. \n\nIt was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know?  Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. \n\nWhen I realized, my gut reaction was a \"no\".  The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. \n\nI started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?\n\nI ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing. \n\nGood luck to all on both sides of this. ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Keen for any thoughts or feedback.\n\nBackground - I’ve worked at my current employer, a mid-sized luxury retailer. We turn over about £200m annually. I’m the sole BI architect and have been for the last 5 years or so. I’ve been with the company for 11 years. I do everything - requirements, building out the data warehouse, building and maintaining the cubes, some SSRS development. In the last two years I’ve designed and built a new ELT framework for us to move away from SSIS and integrate to all of our various disparate systems - ERP, CRM, GA4, digital marketing platforms etc etc. Then I’ve cleaned all of this data, modelled it and built a PBI semantic model on top to bring everything together. That’s the first (and biggest) phase of replacing our existing estate.\n\nChallenge - I had a very good relationship with our previous CTO. Now a new CTO (a contractor) has joined and he seems to be completely ignoring me. We’ve barely had any interaction. He’s worked with GCP in the past and immediately has set up meetings with a google partner. In the first meeting they opened with ‘so we understand that you’ve got a very fractured data estate with no single source of truth’ which is just totally untrue. But this CTO seems to have no interest in engaging with me in the slightest and I’m hearing from other people that he just wants to ‘move us to bigquery’. We’re entirely on Microsoft for everything - not just BI - so this is an enormous piece of work without a clear benefit. In my opinion the issues we have are generally people based - not enough people and certainly not enough people translating data into something actionable or understandable. I’m open to the idea of moving some or part of our estate to GCP - but shouldn’t such a large move like this be considered in the context of ‘what problem are we trying to solve?’\n\nI’m feeling pretty upset - I’ve given a lot to this company over the years and this behaviour feels disrespectful and weird. I’m keen to hear from anyone if they’ve seen this behaviour in the past and how to approach it. At the moment my plan is to write a document outlining our current data estate for him to read and then talk him through. Obviously I’ll also update my CV.\n\nTLDR: new contract CTO has joined and is ignoring and sidelining me. He seems very intent on moving us to GCP despite not really understanding any of our actual challenges. Why is he doing this? Is this a strategy?",

The same manager who \\*\\*forgot\\*\\* my bonus twice, blocks vendor decisions, and copy-pastes my summaries. Going to the CTO directly feels like the only path that leads anywhere, but I know it's politically risky.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Anyone navigated a title conversation that should go through your manager but realistically can't? How did you handle it?\n\n2. If you got promoted past your manager, title first or reporting change at the same time?\n\n3. When your manager starts getting defensive or hostile because they feel their position threatened, how seriously do you take that?\n\n4. If the conversation doesn't land, how fast did you leave?\n\nNot trying to destroy the guy. He's not evil, just ... very ineffective and knows the corporate playbook.

But he needed it in test. And it occured to me that I have absolutely no idea how to give this to him, and that our entire system is SQL server on prem, SQL server Agent Jobs - all run directly in prod. The concept of test or dev for anything analytics facing is essentially non-existent and has always been this way it seems in the organisation. \n\n  \nNow, this made me question my assumptions of why this is. The SQL is versioned and the structure of the data is purely medallion. But no dev/test prod. I inquired AI about this seeming misalignment, and it gave me a long story of how data engineering evolved differently, for legacy systems its common to be directly in prod, but that modern data engineering is evolving in trying to apply these software engineering principles more forcefully. I can absolutely see the use case for it, but in my tenure, simply havent encountered it anywhere.\n\n  \nNow, I want my esteemed peers experiences. **How does this look like out there \"in the wild\". What are our opinions, the pros and cons, and the nature of how this trend is developing.** This is a rare black box for me, and would greatly appreciate some much needed nuance. \n\n  \nLove this forum!

That's not self healing, that's just regular healing with extra steps.\n\nI get that there's a spectrum here. Some tools do automatic retries with exponential backoff which is fine but that's just basic error handling not healing. Some claim to handle api changes automatically but I'm skeptical about how well that actually works when a vendor restructures their entire api endpoint. The part I care most about is when a saas vendor changes their api schema or deprecates an endpoint. That's what causes 80% of our breaks. If something could genuinely detect that and adapt without human intervention that would actually be worth paying for.",

Decided that this would be a fun challenge, to turn those JSONs into a usable star schema in a relational database.\n\n[Here is the repo.](https://github.com/Lastrevio112/MyAnimeListPipeline)\n\nI created an architecture similar to the medallion architecture by ingesting raw data from this API using Python into a \"raw\" (bronze) layer in DuckDB, then used Polars to flatten those JSONs and remove unnecessary columns, as well as seperate data into multiple tables and pushed it into the \"curated\" (silver) layer. Finally, I used DBT to turn the intermediary tables into a proper star schema in the datamart (gold) layer. I then used Streamlit to create dashboards that try to answer the question \"What makes an anime popular?\". I containarized everything in Docker, for practice.\n\nHere is the end result of that project, the front end in Streamlit: https://myanimelistpipeline.streamlit.app/\n\nI would appreciate any feedback on the architecture and/or the code on Github, as I'm still a beginner on many of those tools.

I've had the wrong focus for a long time and can talk a lot about that.\n\nThe thing is that you can be a technical expert in a specific stack, but if you can’t manage a seven-figure budget or explain the financial cost of your architecture, you’re just a technician. One bad architectural choice or an unmonitored cloud bill can turn you from an asset into a massive liability.\n\nReal seniority comes from becoming a \"load-bearing operator.\" This means owning the unit economics of your data, building for long-term stability instead of cleverness, and prioritizing the company's survival over technical ego.\n\nI just promoted a data engineer to senior. Worked with her for year until she really started prioritizing \"the other side of the job\".\n\nI hope this will help some of you.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "For instance, does a star schema actually reduce redundancy in comparison to putting everything in a flat table? Instead of the fact table containing dimension descriptions, it will just contain IDs with the primary key of the dimension table, the dimension table being the table which gives the ID-description mapping for that specific dimension. In other words, a star schema simply replaces the strings with IDs in a fact table. Adding to the fact that you now store the ID-string mapping in a seperate dimension table, you are actually using more storage, not less storage.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the purpose of database normalization is not to \"reduce redundancy\" or to use storage more efficiently, but to make updates and deletes easier. If a customer changes their email, you update one row instead of a million rows.\n\nThe only situation in which I can see a star schema being more space-efficient than a flat table, or in which a snowflake schema is more space-efficient than a star schema, are the cases in which the number of rows is so large that storing n integers + 1 string requires less space than storing n strings.

All my SQL transformations are part of said python scripts.\n\n\\- I develop/test my scripts on my laptop, then push them to my github repo, and pull them down on the VM where they are scheduled to run\n\n\\- Total data volume is low, in the 100,000s of rows\n\n\\- The SQL DB is really more of an expedient sandbox to get done what needs to get done. The main data table gets pulled in from S3 and then transformations happen in place to get it ready for reporting(I know this ain't proper)\n\n\\- Power BI dashboards and other reporting/ analysis is built off of the tables in Azure\n\nEverything works wonderfully and I've been very successful in the role,  but I know if this were a larger or faster growing company it would not cut it.

I stopped trying at work, was barely doing things just to get by. I remember even missing a trip to a data center that my team was going on. I isolated myself. I even got a full time offer in the end and I never responded to the email. I wasn’t talking to anyone. 2nd year started and I started to attend but stopped eventuall. I should have dropped out but I couldn’t even bring myself to type up an email. I just failed and didn’t re-enroll. I moved in with my brother bc I wasn’t taking care of myself. I essentially took a year off, which consist of me getting help. After about a year of the fog dissipating, I finally felt ready to try again. I’m not re-enrolling in school bc I’m pretty sure my GPA tanked, and I realized DS isnt my passion, I REALLY REALLY enjoyed my DE apprenticeship and constantly using SQL in my database role.\n\n  \nAll that said, I have been job searching for about 8 months now.

I decided to simplify this and determine bottlenecks from spark job metadata. It's kept intentionally simple and recognizes three crucial patterns - data explosion, large scan and shuffle\\_write. It also resolves sql hint, let's you see the query connected to the job without having to click through two pages of horribly designed ui, it also detects slow stages and other goodies.\n\nIn general, when I debug performance issues with spark jobs myself, I usually have to click through stages trying to find where we are shuffling hard and spilling all around. This simplifies this process. It's not fancy, it's simple terminal app, but it does its jobs.\n\nFeature requests and burns are all welcome.

        "content": "I’m 1 week in at a new org and I am pretty much a data team of one. \n\nI’ve immediately picked up their current architecture is inefficient. It is an aviation based company, and all data is pulled from a 3rd party SQL server and then fed into Power BI for reporting. When I say “data” I mean isolated (no cardinality) read-only views. This is very compute-intensive so I am thinking it is optimal to just pull data nightly and fed it into a data warehouse we would own. This would also play nice with our other smaller ERP/CRM softwares we need data from.\n\nThe data jobs are fairly small.. I would say like 20 tables/views with \\~5000 rows on average. The question is what data warehouse to use to optimize price and performance. I am thinking Azure SQL server as that looks to be $40-150/mo but wanted to come here to confirm if my suspicion is correct or there are any other tools I am overlooking. As for future scalability considerations… maybe 2x over the next year but even then they are small jobs. \n\nThanks :)",

        "author": "Winsaucerer",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi! Very excited to share my project **spawn**, a DB migration/build system.\n\nFor now, it supports PostgreSQL via `psql` to create and apply migrations, as well as write golden file tests (I plan to support other db's down the line). It has some innovations that I think make it very useful relative to other options I've tried.\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/saward/spawn](https://github.com/saward/spawn)\n\n**Docs:** [https://docs.spawn.dev/](https://docs.spawn.dev/)\n\nShout out to minijinja ([https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/)) which has made a lot of the awesomeness possible!\n\nSome features (PostgreSQL via `psql` only for now):\n\n* Create SQL (for tests or data insertion) from JSON data sources\n* Store functions/views/data in separate files for easy organisation and editing\n* `git diff` shows exactly what changed in a function in new migrations\n* Easy writing of tests for functions/views/triggers\n* Env-specific variables, so migrations apply test data to dev/local DB targets only\n* Generate data from JSON files\n* Macros for easily generating repeatable SQL, and other cool tricks (e.g., view tear-down and re-create)\n\nI started this project around two years ago. I’ve finally been able to get it to an MVP state I’m happy with.\n\nI created spawn to solve my own personal pain points. The main one was, how to manage updates for things like views and functions? There's a few challenges (and spawn doesn't solve all), but the main one was creating and reviewing the migration. The typical (without spawn) approach is one of:\n\n1. Copy function into new migration and edit. This makes PR reviews hard because all you see is a big blob of new changes.\n2. Repeatable migrations. This breaks old migrations when building from scratch, if those migrations depend on DDL or DML from repeatable migrations.\n3. Sqitch rework. Works, but is a bit cumbersome overall with the DAG, and I hit limitations with sqitch's variables support (and needing Perl) for other things I wanted to do.\n\nSpawn is my attempt to solve this, along with an easy (single binary) way to write and run tests. You:\n\n* Store view or function in its own separate file.\n* Include it in your migration with a template (e.g., {% include \"functions/hello.sql\" %})\n* Build migration to see the final SQL, or apply to database.\n* Pin migration to forever lock it to the component as it is now. This is very similar to 'git commit', allowing the old migration to run the same as when it was first created, even if you later change functions/hello.sql.\n* Update the function later by editing functions/hello.sql in place and importing it into your new migration. Git diff shows exactly what changed in hello.sql.\n\nPlease check it out, let me know what you think, and hopefully it's as useful for you as it has been for me. Thanks!\n\n(AI disclosure: around 90% of the non-test code is artisanal code written by me. AI was used more once the core architecture was in place, and for assisting in generating docs)",

Here’s some highlights of our systems and team. \n\n\\- Data is ingested mostly through Informatica (I know there are strong opinions about it in this community, but it’s what we have today) or integrations with S3 buckets. \n\n\\- We use a Medallion style architecture, with an extra layer. (Bronze, Silver 1/basic transformations, Silver 2/advanced transformations, Gold).\n\n\\- We have a small team, currently 2 people with plans to expand to 3 in the next 6 - 9 months. \n\n\\- We have a Dev Snowflake environment, but haven’t used it as much because the data from Dev source systems is not good. Would like to get Dev set up in the future, but it’s not ready today. \n\nBudget is limited. Don’t want to pay a bunch, especially since we’re a small team. \n\nThe goal is to have a location where we write our SQL or Python scripts, push those changes to Bitbucket for version control, review and approve those changes, and then push changes to Snowflake Prod. \n\nDoes anyone have recommendations on the best route to go for setting up version control?",

There's already a few examples including a simple Marimo example, as well as a Streamlit example that allow you to play around with your local data.\n\nYou can do test this directly with your `duckdb` without any extra dependencies.

        "author": "MitocondrialPoro",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hej all,\nI am running in to a metrics consistency problem in what felt like normal, decent architecture. But now it behaves more like a trains here in winter. Mostly works, until suddenly not.\n\nHere are the details.Data comes from:\n\n* Applications sending events to Kafka\n* Files landing in S3\n* A handful of databases (DB2, MySQL, Oracle)\n* A couple of SaaS systems\n\nFrom there:\n* NIghtly spark jobs on Databricks create curated tables\n* Some of these curated tables are pushed into Snowflake\n* We also have streaming jobs writing to both Databricks and Snowflake\n* Snowflake is shared across multiple tenants. Same account, separate warehouses, ACLs in place.\n\nOn architecture diagram this looks reasonable. In reality, documetnation is thin and mostcontrols are manual operational procedures. Management is crurently excited about “AI agents” than investing in proper orchestration or governance tooling, so we are working with what we have.\n\n**Problem**: A core metric, let’s call it DXI is calculated in Databricks using one curated table set, and in Snowflake suing another curated table set. Both sets are ultimately derived from the same upstream raw sources. Some pipelines flow through Kafka, others ingest directly from DB2 and land in Databricks before promotion to Snowflake. Sometimes the metric matches closely enough to be acceptable. Other times it diverges enough to raise eyebrows. There is no obvious pattern yet. \n\nWhat makes this awkward is that one of our corporate leaders explicitly suggested calculating the same KPI independently in both systems as a way to validate the architecture. It sounded clever at the time. Now it is escalating because the numbers do not match always and confidence in the architecture is getting shaky. \n\nThis architecture is around 7 years old. Built and modified by multiple people, many are no longer here. Tribal knowledge mostly evaporated over time. \n\n**Question**: Since I have inherited this situation, where should I start? Some options I am struggling with:\n\n* Valdiate transformation logic parity line by line across about 350+ pipelines that touch the raw data and see where things could be diverging? This will take me forever, and I am also not very well versed with some of the complex Spark stuff that is going on in Databricks.\n* The lineage tool we have seems to overly simplify the lineage by skipping steps between curated tables and raw sources and just points it as an arrow. It gives no concept of how this could have happened as there are many pipelines between those systems. This is probably the most frustrating part for me to deal with and I am this close to giving up hope on using it.\n* I do notice sporadic errors on the nightly runs of pipelines and there seems to be a correlation between those and when the KPI calculation diverges on following days. But the errors seem pretty widely spread out and don’t seem to have a discernible pattern. \n* In the process of trying to find the culprint, I have actually uncovered data loss due to type conversion on three places, which although not related the KPI directly, gives me the impression that there could be such issues lurking all over the place.\n\nI am trying to approach this systematically, not emotionally. At the moment it feels like chasing ghosts across two platforms. Would appreciate any input on how to structure the investigation..",

However, when I do this, Spark does not register any partition information in Glue table metadata.\n\n\n\nAs I understand, when we use hive, during writes, spark updates table metadata in Glue such as partition information by invoking UpdatePartition API. And therefore, when we write new partitions in Hive, we can get EventBridge notifications from Glue for events such as BatchCreatePartition. Also, when we invoke GetPartitions, we can get partition information from Glue Tables.\n\n\n\nI understand Iceberg works based on metadata and has a feature for hidden partitioning but I am not sure if this is the sole reason Spark is not registering metadata info with Glue table. This is causing various issues such as not being able to detect data changes in tables, not being able to run Glue Data Quality checks on selected partitions, etc. \n\n\n\nIs there a simple way I can get this partition change and update information directly from Glue?\n\n\n\nOne of the bad ways to do this will be to create S3 notifications, subscribe to those and then run Glue Crawler on those events, which will create another S3 based Glue table with the correct partition information. And then do DQ checks on this new table. I do not like this approach at all because I will need to setup significant automation to achieve this.",

Does Spark create one Python worker per concurrent task (for example, one per core), and does each Python worker consume memory from overhead? \n\n2. When reduce tasks read shuffle blocks from the map stage over the network, are those blocks temporarily stored in overhead memory or in heap memory? \n\n3. In practice, what usually causes overhead memory to get exhausted even when heap usage appears normal?",

Low cost in the sense that you reuse components (logic app, event hub, etc) through parameterization which are then populated upon execution from a metadata table in SQL.

I mean, isn’t snowflake going to ultimately use this hash keys which are unordered in my scenario?\n\nWhat’s the design pattern here? What am I missing? Thanks in advance.",

Seemed reasonable. I had no idea what I was about to walk into.\n\n\n\nThe first two hours were fine, I knew requests and BeautifulSoup from a tutorial. Then the site started blocking me and I had no idea why. Then I figured out rotating headers but the data was inconsistently structured across different listing types and my parser kept breaking in ways I couldn't predict. Then I realised I hadn't thought about where to actually store anything. Then I had to learn a bit of scheduling to make it run automaticly. Every single step opened three more questions I didn't know existed an hour earlier. I finished something working after about two weeks and it was genuinely one of the best learning experiences I've had, but I think the reason \"just build projects\" feels useless as advice is that nobody tells you the project will completley fall apart four times before it works and that is the actual point.

Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and IDEs. Common examples include manually renaming a symbol across many source code files, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (https://xkcd.com/1597/).\n\nAt least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier both during school and after graduation (most jobs do not formally teach these topics either).\n\nTo help mitigate this, the three of us developed a class, originally called Hacker Tools in 2019 and then renamed to Missing Semester in 2020 (some great past discussion here: https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/eyagda/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_mit/). Over the past several years, we’ve seen the course translated into over a dozen languages, inspire similar courses at other universities, and be adopted by several companies as part of their standard onboarding materials.\n\nBased on feedback and discussions here and elsewhere, along with our updated perspective from working in industry for several years, we have developed a new iteration of the course. The 2026 edition covers several new topics such as packaging/shipping code, code quality, agentic coding, and soft skills. Some things never change, though; we’re still using this hacky Python DSL for editing our multi-camera-angle lecture videos: https://github.com/missing-semester/videos.\n\nAs always, we’d love to hear any feedback from the community to help us improve the course content!\n\n—Anish, Jon, and Jose",

        "title": "How to Learn JavaScript - From a Dev With 10 Years in JS",
        "author": "nikolaymakhonin",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I want to share how I think you should learn JavaScript most effectively. My opinion is based only on my own experience, keep that in mind - I've never taught programming to anyone.\n\nTreat these tips as a roadmap you can use to understand where to go and how, but go wherever YOU want.\n\nThese tips work for many other languages too (C++, C#, PHP, Python, Java, ...), except maybe functional languages - I have no experience there.\n\nMy background: professional developer, around 20 years in different areas, self-taught my whole life, no courses whatsoever. Lots of experience with C++, C#, Java, PHP and JavaScript. Right now my main thing is JavaScript and frontend.\n\n---\n\n## Theory\n\nI think the fastest way to learn a programming language is to study its building blocks one by one - the pieces programs are made of - while clearly separating the language itself from applying the language to anything: libraries, frameworks, web page manipulation, algorithms, architecture, all that stuff.\n\nThe order for learning JavaScript should be roughly this:\n\n1. Data and how it's stored and processed in a computer\n2. Simple data types, including arrays\n3. Arithmetic and logical operations and expressions\n4. Core language constructs: if, switch/case, for, while, etc.\n5. Functions\n6. More complex data types: objects, maps, collections, ...\n7. Async programming. Async functions.\n8. OOP and Classes\n9. Iterators/Generators\n10. ...\n\nWhen you look for textbooks, the table of contents should roughly match this order. This way you'll at least have a learning plan and a rough idea of where you are - what you already know, what you don't yet. And you can skim the TOC to see what the language can do in general. This obviously doesn't mean you should throw away other textbooks and not read them.\n\nGradually, as you study the language itself, you can also start learning how it's applied. Since there are many different applications and it's unclear what a person will end up doing, I can't give any advice here. The one thing universal for all JavaScript development directions is the language itself in its pure form.\n\nAfter JavaScript you can also learn TypeScript. Many companies require this skill, for example in React development. TypeScript just adds type annotations to JavaScript - increases code readability, simplifies development, catches many errors while you're still writing code. It's much easier to learn than JavaScript itself.\n\nFull JavaScript documentation: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)\n\n---\n\n## Practice\n\nIt makes sense to reinforce what you learn by solving short simple problems. If the problems are too hard and too long, you might not get enough satisfaction from them. They shouldn't be too easy either, or they'll become boring routine.\n\nPractice should be sequential just like theory. Free JavaScript problem sets: [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)\n\nThere are also sites like CodeWars and CodeCombat - they have difficulty levels, but they're not for sequential learning, they're for training programming skills for people who already know the language.\n\nThe format in these problem sets is the same: you write code in one window, press Test, your code gets checked. At first it can be hard to understand, especially why everything is set up so complicated - might be worth watching some YouTube videos on this, where people explain it in detail including why problem sets are structured this way. This knowledge will be useful in real work too, because this approach to development is used a lot in practice.\n\n---\n\n## Interest and Motivation\n\n**What feeds motivation:**\n\n- A sense of beauty in the language, roughly the same as the beauty of pure non-applied math.\n- Knowledge that will stay relevant for a long time. What you learn about JavaScript and TypeScript probably won't go obsolete in the coming decades. JS is way too firmly stuck in web development, because to this day it's the only language you can directly write browser programs in. And the knowledge you get from learning JS will help you learn other languages easier, since JS has procedural programming, object-oriented, and elements of functional programming. These concepts are very similar across many languages.\n- Solving small problems\n- Wanting to run an experiment\n- Wanting to make a pile of money\n- Wanting to build your own project (better keep it short and within your abilities)\n- Motivation goes up when you successfully reach a goal. If goals are long and hard to achieve, motivation drops. If goals are too simple, achieving them turns into boring routine. Stay in the middle with everything: choosing textbooks, courses, problems, projects, experiments, etc.\n\n**What kills motivation:**\n\n- Contempt. \"JavaScript is shit.\" You can find plenty of flaws in JavaScript, no doubt. You can just know about them, keep them in mind, without feeling any negative emotions about it. And it's worth remembering - what matters in evaluating a language isn't a list of its pros and cons, but whether you can solve complex problems quickly and simply using this language in its area. My answer - absolutely yes.\n- Perfectionism.\n- Forcing yourself to finish a project, study a boring topic, complete a dull course. Early on you might have tons of unfinished projects and skipped topics you lost interest in, and that's great. It means perfectionism isn't running the show.\n- Wanting to read a textbook in strict order. Not wanting to try other textbooks or other courses until you finish the current ones. There's no single track for everyone.\n- Trying to push through a hard topic when your brain has already given up. At first it will be hard, and you need to let your brain rest and digest more often. Rest is a very important part of learning. Rest when you want to, as much as you want, and come back to learning when you feel like it.\n- Obsessions. If you want to kill your interest in programming for a long time or forever, obsessions are perfect for that. They'll suck all the energy and interest out of you, and when you come to your senses it'll be too late.\n\n---\n\n## Other Tips\n\n- **Marathon.** If you want to learn the language fast and start earning, learning to program shouldn't turn into playing in a sandbox - otherwise you'll spend a bunch of time on fun stuff with pictures, and end up not even reaching beginner level. To learn programming you have to strain your brain, let it rest, then strain it again, getting stronger each time, absorbing more material, same as people build muscle. The brain doesn't restructure and train overnight. Learning programming is a marathon over a very long distance. This marathon doesn't have to be self-torture though - straining your brain can actually be pleasant, and thinking about moving toward your goal is even more pleasant.\n\n- **You don't need to learn everything.** There's a lot of information, but not all of it is relevant right now, and of course you don't need to memorize everything down to the last detail. Often it's enough to just remember that a language feature exists - place short bookmarks in your head or in your notes, like markers on a map, so you can recall when needed that this feature exists and study it in more detail. No point loading your brain with things you're not using right now and won't use often in the future. Following this will seriously cut down your learning time and unload your brain. In the end, you'll remember well whatever you use often in practice - and that's the ideal use of your memory.\n\n- **Goal and path to goal.** To learn the language fast, you also need to move in the right direction. And to move in the right direction, you need to understand the end goal, the intermediate steps toward it, at least a rough plan. The main goal for a beginner, in my opinion, should be getting a job as an intern or Junior developer, because the real programming learning happens during actual work, especially if there's a mentor at work. Knowing this goal, you can build a rough plan to get there - for example find out what specific skills and knowledge most popular job listings require.\n\n- **Mentor.** To move in the right direction you also need to understand what's worth spending time on and what's not. A beginner can't figure this out, because you'd already need a lot of programming experience to know all these nuances. So early on a mentor will be useful - a person who is an experienced programmer themselves and can suggest the right direction, what to do and how, do code review, point out mistakes, answer questions, etc. This is common practice, many companies hire outside mentors to guide beginners.\n\n- **English.** English is very important in programming, but not because programming languages themselves are in English, or because many docs and books are in English - that's all small stuff. The main thing is being able to communicate with clients, managers, and other programmers who don't speak your native language. This skill will seriously expand your job search options, and to much higher-paying jobs at that.\n\n- **AI as a mentor.** LLM can work as a mentor for beginners but its expertise not enough for middle level. It also gives good suggestions for online services and textbooks.\n\n- **Deep understanding of the language.** Being able to read practically any code, understand it, execute it in your head - this really helps with understanding other people's code, debugging, designing. With this skill you get more ideas, you can find better solutions by eliminating impossible ones, and so on. It also helps with learning, since many ideas and algorithms are easier to express as code. A programming language is also, to some degree, a language programmers communicate with each other in. Often in their conversations you'll hear - stop talking, show me the code. Understanding every little thing in code really simplifies design, debugging, keeping code clean and quality, finding best solutions. Worth striving for - seek out things you don't understand and dig into them.\n\n- **Patterns.** Most of programming isn't inventing something from scratch, not reinventing wheels, but reusing template code over and over. There are thousands of these patterns and there's no point learning them all. They get remembered on their own as you gain programming experience, read other people's code, and pick up their ideas. Good code patterns for different tasks can be found at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), though even there you sometimes find upvoted garbage code.\n\n- **Rubber duck method.** If you can't figure out what the bug is in your program, try going through it step by step, explaining EVERY detail so that even a rubber duck sitting next to you would understand it all. This same method is often used to make sure there are no bugs in a program - I use it every time after writing a chunk of code, reviewing it and executing it in my head.\n\n- **Step-by-step debugging.** Step-by-step debugging tools really help you understand your own code, find bugs, make sure your understanding of the code matches reality. During step-by-step debugging you can literally watch code execute step by step and look at variable values on each step. This really helps when learning the language, understanding how everything works inside. You can run step-by-step JavaScript debugging in the browser, in DevTools - just paste code into the console but write the word `debugger` before the code. I use this when I need to make sure there are no obvious algorithm errors in complex code.\n\n- **Research skills.** Research is a very important and inseparable part of developing anything. Pick up any task - pretty much any of them requires research, unless you already have experience doing the exact same task. Research is basically finding the best answer to questions like: what tool to use here, how to organize the code, what architecture to apply to this task, what are this tool's capabilities, how to solve this, etc. Research is basically a mini scientific paper, because it's done using the scientific method: gather information, generate ideas, test ideas, pick the best one.\n\n- **Self-learning skills.** You need to keep learning the entire time you work as a programmer, constantly raising your level. Even if a programmer manages to land in a niche where there's nothing left to learn - learned everything, just work - most likely that'll be boring low-paying work with higher competition and less interest, because you're doing the same thing all the time. The best and highest-paid specialists are those who can solve any problems, including the hardest and seemingly unsolvable ones. That is the programmer's job after all - solving problems brought by clients, which are often complex or unusual. And you can only become that kind of specialist with self-learning skills and the ability to do independent research.",

I like systems logic, but complex calculus or advanced statistics kind of turns me down a bit (I could still learn and refresh my memory, if necessary)\n\n1) Is Python backend development \"math-heavy\" in the real world, or is that only for AI/Data Science? Would Java be a safer \"low-math\" haven for me? \n\n2) Is it worth pivoting to Java now to avoid the high saturation of Python juniors, even if Java feels \"stricter\" and a bit more difficult to get into?\n\n3) Should I stick to the Boot.dev course, learn OOP and DSA in that course, and then switch? What do you suggest? They have Linux, SQL and git courses.\n\n​My Goal: > I want to reach a Junior Backend role (Chilean corporate or INTERNATIONAL remote) where I can actually grow, as soon as humanly possible.  (Of course aiming to work in a position that I like)\n\n​Thanks for any career advice. Just trying to build a stable future for my kid.\n\nTL;DR: 30yo, Chile. CS Degree in 2018. Wasted 7 years in a dead-end, unrelated job. Now \"speedrunning\" a comeback via Boot.dev. I want a Backend role ASAP, but I'm worried about \"Math traps\" in Python and market saturation.\n",

But idk if those are actually good or just shortcuts that'll bite me later.\n\nI'm not a complete beginner to coding - did some python and javascript stuff before - but never built an actual mobile app. Would it be better to just dive into the native android stuff or should i look at some of these easier platforms first to get something working?\n\nWhat path would you guys recommend for someone who wants to actually learn properly but also not spend 6 months before having anything to show? Also any tools you recommend that can help me get a quick MVP built would be very helpful. Ty in advance!",

The transcript goes into a concepts folder I can review. Explaining it out loud cements it way better than just reading about it, and I have notes in my own words to reference later.

The final result will be an open source project that you can use in your portfolio. \n\nThe group will be run like a real life software company.  You’ll learn how to work in an agile environment, do code reviews, build pipelines, how to develop a real life product with a team, and more. \n\n**About you**:\n\nThe ideal candidate is someone who has little to no professional experience but is eager to learn and break into tech. Must be at least 18 years of age.  Must be willing to put in at least a few hours per week, and must be friendly and kind.\n\n**About me:** \n\nI am a senior software engineer who has some time on his hands after working for a very successful startup that was acquired last year.  I was self taught and leaned on others online heavily to learn early in my career and would like to pay it forward.\n\nLeave a comment or drop me a DM if you’d be interested in a program like this.

I’ve also been doing some LeetCode on the side since it helps with problem-solving and thinking more clearly. \n\nOver the past few months, I’ve built a few small projects (mostly CRUD apps) using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL. With each one, I try to improve how I structure things and actually understand what I’m doing, instead of just following random tutorials.\n\nI genuinely enjoy backend development and learning system design concepts like caching, replicas, load balancing, etc. (stuff from the system design primer on GitHub)\n\nThe problem is… I don’t really have any use for it.\n\nI don’t have a degree, I’m not aiming for a traditional path, and I live in a small town in Alabama where there’s basically zero demand for this kind of work. I even tried offering my city hall a dashboard/maintenance tracking system after noticing at town meetings that the five members sit there fumbling through giant stacks of papers. But when I presented them with the idea/MVP video, they said they wanted to keep doing things the way they always have and weren’t interested.\n\nEven in my personal life, I don’t really have anything to automate or problems to solve. So even though I enjoy learning this stuff, sometimes it feels like I’m just building things in a vacuum with no real direction.\n\nI’m about to start a job at a plant soon, and I worry I won’t still have it in me to spend hours a day self-studying APIs and coding while working 12 hour shifts haha.\n\nHas anyone else been in this position where you love learning something but don’t have a clear “why”? Did you eventually find a way to apply it, or did it stay more of a hobby/interest?",

Recently I started learning backend development and decided to build a purely backend focused project to actually understand how things work beyond tutorials.\n\nI built a CRUD API for a social media style application with users, posts, and votes tables. Creating the routes with FastAPI felt surprisingly straightforward at first. Authentication, however, was a completely different story. Integrating JWT took me a few days of going through videos, debugging, and trying to understand what was really happening under the hood. Eventually I got it working, which felt like a small breakthrough.\n\nFor the database, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy as the ORM to define my schemas. I also set up Alembic for migrations, which helped me understand how schema versioning works in real projects. That part made the project feel much more realistic.\n\nAfter finishing the core functionality, I realized that writing endpoints is only half the job. They need to be tested properly. So I created a tests directory and used pytest to cover different scenarios and edge cases. That was another learning curve, especially figuring out test databases and dependency overrides.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for me was Docker. I had never containerized an application before, and initially it felt overwhelming. But after spending time reading the docs and experimenting, I finally managed to dockerize the app. That moment felt like a genuine win.\n\nI know this is still a basic backend project and there is a lot more to learn, like proper deployment and scaling. I am thinking of adding a load simulation using Locust to test with 1000 plus virtual users just to explore performance aspects.\n\nIt may not be groundbreaking, but it feels like real progress to me. I am excited to keep improving it.\n\nAlso, if anyone can suggest free platforms where I can deploy this as a college student, I would really appreciate it.\n\nThanks for reading.",

However, in order to isolate my units from their dependencies using test doubles/mocks that behave appropriately, doesn't this necessitate some level of coupling to the implementation of the unit under test?\n\nThank you in advance!",

        "author": "Kudor888",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I would like to ask you to help me clarify a situation regarding two different coding philosophies. Tell me whether they don't in fact contradict and I am missing something, tell me whether these two books are just opinions and nothing science-based, or tell me whether they apply in different contexts, if one is wrong and the other is right, or if there is a way to combine them.\n\n\"A Philosophy of Software Design\" by John Ousterhout vs \"Grokking Simplicity\" by Eric Normand are highly recommended and praised books regarding how to write code. They both have very solid advice, but in some areas, they strongly contradict each other. I want to follow the advice in both books, because I see their point of view and I agree with them, but I am having a hard time doing it because in one of the most important aspects, function/method design, they have very different views.\n\nEven if they talk more in general, for the sake of making the problem simpler and for simpler exemplification, I will reduce their advice to functions. I use \"functions\", but I also refer to \"methods\".\n\n**A Philosophy of Software Design** suggests deep functions with simple interfaces. This means functions which hide a lot of complexity behind a simple-to-use interface. Many times in this book it is pointed out that functions with a lot of parameters increase a function's complexity, and thus increase the overall complexity of the program. The book is also against passing objects or data down through many functions, essentially creating parameters in functions whose only purpose is to pass data down. He suggests contexts or global objects for this. Also, small functions or functions which just call another function are recommended against in this book, as they do not result in deep modules, and create extra complexity through the increase in the number of functions and parameters that exist for developers to learn.\n\n**Grokking Simplicity** makes it very clear from the start that functions should be split into calculations (pure functions, with no side effects) and actions (functions which interact with the outside world). The main idea the book recommends is reducing as much as possible the number of actions inside a codebase by transforming actions into calculations or extracting calculations from actions. Extracting calculations from actions has the natural consequence of increasing the overall number of functions. Also, in order to create calculations, some implicit inputs need to be converted into explicit inputs, resulting in functions with multiple parameters. Because reading from / writing to a global variable is an implicit input/output, the book also suggests using functions which only pass parameters through many layers.\n\nAs you can see, the two idioms are very contradictory.",

When I’m faced with a blank file or an empty editor, I never know where to start, what to write first, or how to structure my thinking. It’s frustrating because I really want to build projects, create things, and deploy them… but I feel stuck when it’s time to actually begin.  \nIs this normal in the beginning? How did you get past that stage?\n\nSecond, I want to learn more than what we cover at school. I’m motivated to go deeper and improve faster, maybe explore other technologies, but I don’t know where to start. There are so many resources out there (YouTube, online courses, bootcamps, books, open source projects, etc.) that I feel overwhelmed and unsure what’s actually worth my time.  \nWhat would you recommend for a first-year student who wants to seriously improve?\n\nAnd finally, something that’s been on my mind a lot: AI.  \nTo be honest, it really scares me. It feels like it’s evolving incredibly fast, and I’m afraid it might drastically change the developer job market. I worry about investing years into this field if it’s going to be completely transformed. I’m not even sure how to fully explain the feeling, but it genuinely makes me anxious.\n\nHave any of you felt this way? How do you see the future of software development with AI?\n\nThanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to reply.",

        "author": "MindlessAssistance52",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nSo I am at chapter 21 of the book, and the author has finished building a \"add/subtract unit\" part of the CPU. \n\nhttps://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter21/\n\nMy confusion is about the subtract part of the arithmetic unit. When we start a subtraction, we use the opcode \"10\", which forces a CI of 1 for the two's complement operation. (Which ends up giving something like A + B inverted + 1) This is done for the first pair of bytes for a multibyte number. Afterwards, the next pairs are treated using the Opcode of \"11\".\n\nThe actual CY In has no effect at this stage (Opcode 10), so the only things we are left with are the first part of the sum and a potential Carry out.\n\nPreviously, the author built something called a \"triple byte accumulator\" which was a precursor (https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter20/) where when doing a subtraction using two's complement, if you had a carry out generated during the operation, it would end up being used in the middle byte part, and if the middle byte sum ended up producing a carry out as well, it would end up being used in the high byte part of the operation of the 24 bit number.\n\nNow, the author, for some unknown reason to me, has introduced two \"XOR gates\" at the input and ouput of the arithmetic unit. He doesn't mention anything about them besides : \n\n> This is a little different from the circuits shown in the book in that the values of both CY In and CY Out are inverted for subtraction. (The entry in the lower-right corner of the table on page 322 should be inverted CY)\n\nIn the book, at the point where I am, nothing is mentioned as to why or what is done with those inverted signals.\n\nDuring addition (Opcodes of 00 or 01), those XOR gates have no effect whatsoever as if they did not exist. When subtraction/\"addition in two's complement\" is done, they do invert the Carry out signal of the adder ... but here is the strange thing:\n\nif my adder produces a Carry output of 1 , the XOR transforms it to 0 ... and when this tranformed signal is used in the next part of the operation for the next pair of bytes, the XOR gate at the input \"undoes\" the 0 so we end up having a raw bit of 1 ... as if nothing actually happened. The same logic happens if my carry output produces a 0, it is transformed to 1, and when it is fed back to the CY In, the XOR gates undoes the effect and we end up with a 0 again as the input to the adder.\n\nClearly, then, those gates are not affecting the function of the actual \"subtraction\" and everything is functioning as I would expect it to. My question then would be : why exactly is the author adding those two XOR gates?\n\nThe only reason I could think of is those inverted signals are going to serve some (unknown) use later on, but outside of that I can't really think of anything else.\n\nAny help or guidance would be much appreciated...",

With all of that said, I've hit a speed bump on what I should be looking into for learning right now. \n\n1. Should I drop all of the Python stuff and additional programming fundamental content and focus purely on Java?\n\n2. Should I focus on Kotlin instead, and, if so, are there any independent resources on learning Kotlin from scratch? Or does it require knowledge of Java first before moving on to Kotlin?\n\nAgain, my only goal right now is to be able to develop Android apps, both their looks and their function. Thank you for any help, I'll take all I can get at this point. I'm just feeling overwhelmed.",

I'm looking into joining a certain university economics project, and I've been advised to get a handle on Python and R and to explore some of the following:\n\n* Linear regression\n* Data cleaning\n* APIs (for different purposes)\n* Web scraping\n* Machine learning models (NN, RF, etc.)\n* Causal inference methods (IV, DID, etc.)\n* Git or version control\n* Survey design\n\nI'm wondering if anyone might propose a project (or a set of smaller ones, if that's more appropriate) that I can work on and that would require the above (I figure that's the best way to motivate myself to learn them). Maybe one in Python and one in R? Bonus points if it's economics adjacent.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nP.S. To add some context, I've played around with linear and nonlinear regression before, as well as with very light data cleaning. On the other hand, I have no clue what an API is or what Git / version control might mean (beyond a few preliminary Google searches). As for survey design, I can imagine it might require an outsized amount of effort to incorporate into a project, so I'm not too hung up on including it if I can just teach myself the basic theory instead.",

        "content": "I need to build a complex application, and to give you some context, there are 3 interacting entities: a Type 1 Client, a Server, and a Type 2 Client.\n\nThe **Type 2 Client** will be web-based, mainly for querying and interacting with data coming from the server. The **Type 1 Client** is offline-first; it first captures and collects data, saves it in a local SQLite DB, and then an asynchronous service within the same Type 1 Client is responsible for sending the data from the local DB to the server.\n\nHere’s the thing: there is an application that will be in charge of transmitting a \"real-time\" data stream, but it won't be running all the time. Therefore, the Type 2 Client will be the one responsible for telling the Type 1 Client: \"start the transmission.\"\n\nThe first thing that came to mind was using **WebSockets**—that’s as far as I’ve gotten experimenting on my own. But since we don't know when the connection will be requested, an active channel must be kept open for when the action is required. The Type 1 Client is hidden behind **NAT/CG-NAT**, so it cannot receive an external call; it can only handle connections that it initiates first.\n\nThis is where I find my dilemma: with WebSockets, I would have an active connection at all times, consuming bandwidth on both the server and the Type 1 Client. With a few clients, it’s not a big deal, but when scaling to 10,000, you start to notice the difference. After doing some research, I found information about the **MQTT protocol**, which is widely used for consuming very few resources and scaling absurdly easily.\n\nWhat I’m looking for are opinions between one and the other. I’d like to see how those of you who are more experienced would approach a situation like this.",

        "author": "AviaryCork_11",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I spent around 8 months grinding LSAT prep last year (hit a 172 on my final attempt), and after deciding not to pursue law for personal reasons I started learning Python about 6 weeks ago. The weird thing is, I keep noticing these parallels between logic games on the LSAT and writing conditional statements. When I'm building if/else chains or tracing through nested loops, it genuinley feels similar to solving a sequencing game where you have to track which constraints apply in what order. My brain seems to latch onto that kind of structured reasoning pretty fast.\n\n\n\nBut I'm also running into walls my LSAT brain completley can't help with. Syntax errors are brutal because I'll understand the logic perfectly and still forget a colon or mess up an indentation and the whole script breaks. LSAT trained me to reason on paper in the abstract, so the hands-on debugging side feels like a totally seperate skill that I haven't even started building yet. Has anyone transitioned from a logic-heavy non-tech background into programming? Im genuinely unsure if my prep gives me a real edge or if I'm basically starting from zero in terms of what actually matters here.",

While this is legally protected in theory the reality is taking such a leave shakes confidence in your management's faith in you to deliver. \n\nWhen I returned from FMLA I was pressured through covert means into leaving the company because, of course, letting me go for the reasons I took my FMLA directly would've been illegal.\n\nFast forward to my current position I made the mistake of casually mentioning to my manager in a 1:1 the medical conditions I deal with that caused me to take FMLA at my last job. Now every other week he asks me if im okay. His confidence in me is shaken and its probably the beginning of the end.\n\nWith how cooked the current job market is there is no mercy in this industry.

Those ideas get turned into Jira tickets, and engineers mostly just pump them out.\n\nMeanwhile, the PMO team and executives get most of the credit and promotions (even in Big Tech it seems).",

I'm not sure if I'm being too cynical here, but I'm giving my role five years before I'm either made obsolete or if still needed, in an extremely minor capacity. \n\nWhat are folks' timelines, and backup plans to prepare for that inevitable reality? Looking forward to thoughts and opinions. Thanks in advance!",

CEO randomly emails entire 1k+ person company telling us to take a Friday off to spend time with family.\n\nCon's of current company:\n\n* Career/skill growth is important to me and I feel like I know way too little; no support from management (I talk to my manager maybe once every 2-3 months)\n* 1 coworker (4 YOE junior SWE) and 1 lead SWE (10 YOE)\n   * lead SWE refuses to do anything differently from what he learned 10 yrs ago. I'm talking about stored procedure hell, 500+ line dynamic SQL queries, HTML in DB tables, etc. No problem, they're database focused with deep DB expertise, I can be open minded. Except he's never even heard about query statistics nor query plans. E.g. we have a GET request that scans a table over 5000-10000 times. I don't mean 5000-10000 pages/rows that get scanned; I mean the table itself gets accessed 5000-10000 times.\n   * They used to collaborate by sending code files over Teams. I set up Git in our workflow and it still gets a lot of resistance. Reason? \"I don't really like working with command lines\".\n   * No modern software practices -- no testing, no CI/CD, etc.\n\nTo be clear, when I say \"leaving\", I mean applying to other jobs. I don't mean leaving without another job. The point of this post is to decide if it's worth the effort to study hard for interviews in this current job market.",

It started with using it as a accessory with basic plan to current state where each developer has $3500 limit (which also they increase happily) of pay per use after the standard 500 requests are exhausted.\n\n  \nThe engineering leadership has explicitly asked engineers to **not write code manually** their stand is to perform every aspect of development via cursor only. Bug analysis, technical design ( hld or lld), code implementation, test case design , tests implementation everything is forced via cursor. The JIRA timelines are set as such that even if you want to go through code manually or want to write code manually you won't be able to and their answer is to use cursor to do analysis and everything. Cursor usage is tracked and people with highest usage are awarded ( literally).\n\n  \nI want to understand how to navigate this shift. Skills of understanding or writing code doesn't seem to matter now or learning different tools ( like docker etc etc )or tech stacks seems futile. When this ai wave started learning Rag, loRa , vector indexes and all made sense but now it only come down to how good you prompt and having basic understanding of software development cycles.\n\n  \nPlease suggest on how to upgrade to navigate this shift also is level of cursor adoption happening in all orgs?",

        "content": "About me: I work at the banana factory. 2.5 YoE. Have been wanting to hop for a mid-level promo, but have stuck on my current team due to the competitive job market.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was notified that I'm being put on a pip/ focus by my manager. There are a variety of ways that this could play out, but I'm only interested in two:\n\n1. Pass the pip. If I grind out the project, I think there's a fair chance that I could make it. My team is already -2 headcount I don't think my manager wants to lose me. Doing so would likely make getting a promotion or swapping teams hard/ impossible so that I'd need to switch companies anyway, though. The main benefits would be that I could more easily come back to the company later (no black mark for failing the pip), and/ or more time to find another job.\n2. Fail the pip and take the severance. This should let me *barely* hit my RSU vest date, and would give me 60 days of severance to find a new job. Including the time spent on pip/ focus, I'd have 4-5 months to interview and find something new. Since I'm looking to jump anyway, this option is appealing (2 months of free pay), but I'd have a black mark that would make it difficult to rejoin the same company again in the future.\n\nWhat should I do in this situation? I've also heard that taking FMLA can be beneficial during focus, but I'm not sure exactly how, as I'm not on a visa.",

        "author": "TheKaritha",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**EDIT:** I think I wasn’t clear in my question.  \nI’m not asking whether AI is a bubble or not. I’m asking for names of non-fanatical researchers and engineers to listen to or read.  \nMost of the replies just prove my point. Even when I try to ask for resources, I end up being pulled into one side of the debate.  \n  \n\\---\n\nI’m a newly graduated computer engineer. After a few months without a job, I decided to prepare for a government engineering exam for a stable, well-paid position. If I fail, I’ll return to job hunting. While studying, I still follow tech news and social media, where I see extreme views about AI/LLMs either denying they’re real or claiming there will be no jobs left.\n\nPersonally, I use it for learning, translating (even after writing this text, I told AI to fix grammar mistakes without changing my text), and of course coding small projects that I don’t really care about, like a habit tracker or my static Jekyll blog. I believe it’s a great tool that will make our jobs easier, and the only bad thing I think we programmers might face is being pushed toward more productivity. I know ai is a new trend too, while interviewing on school I got pushed to add LLM to random apps that have zero usability like LLM powered graduation system etc. So I see myself at center. But both sides of the internet disagree with me, and I’m confused.\n\n**The Anti-AI** side claims the AI boom will collapse and disappear, leaving only old AI generated artifacts behind. They reject LLMs entirely. I disagree. if companies can make money from it, it won’t just vanish. They call entire LLM products slop (yes %90 of them are) but they get frustrated even when someone uses AI voice with their own voice.  \n**The Pro-AI** side, on the other hand, says the AI bubble isn’t real and that if I don’t use AI everywhere, I’m doomed. They claim art and desk jobs are already dead. I don’t think that’s true either, at least for now. Many self-proclaimed “prompt engineers” don’t understand what good code actually looks like. It may work today on one machine, but that doesn’t mean it’s reliable everywhere.\n\n**TL;DR:** I’ve noticed social media is extremely polarized about AI. One side says it’s fake and will collapse, the other says it will replace all jobs and you’re doomed without it. I personally see AI as a useful tool that improves productivity, but not as something that will either disappear or completely replace human work.\n\nSo my question is: I believe these two separate groups are in huge echo chambers that only hear what they want, and I just can’t research and learn about AI technologies without entering those chambers of insanity. I would love to learn from people who are trying to share information instead of propaganda. I would really appreciate it if you could share what you read or watch.",

Started part-time making roughly $30k/year equivalent ( converted to dollars for better understanding, don't take as exact numbers). I was just happy to get experience.\n\nAfter a year I converted to full-time at about $65k. I didn’t negotiate, since PM somehow made it clear that there may not be a full time place for me. I just worked hard, got good feedback. Then this year I expected to be reindexed closer to my peers — $100k+, which is normal for my level in my comp. Easiest promotion I thought, since compensation system tries to equal salaries for the same Grade + Position.\n\nInstead I got bumped to \\~$80k. Manager said that’s all he could get from the project budget. Later I talked to another guy who also started as a student. Same numbers. We earn exactly the same. Then it clicked. We’re still classified in the system under a “Graduate” compensation track. Our peers are under the standard “Software Engineer” track. \n\nWe do same work. we have same expectations. BUT paid differently, just Because 1.5 years ago we were students.\n\nThat killed my motivation completely. Anyone else run into this?",

I also got 3 referrals that haven't led anywhere (1 was a rejection). This was my resume, which I've been running through ChatGPT and rewriting multiple times, but I seemingly can't get it right:\n\n[Imgur](https://imgur.com/xWSfwDo)\n\nI suspect that it might be my resume since my projects aren't the strongest and I didn't do much tangibly impactful things for my work beyond what I've written, and I've heard of people getting better response rates. But there wasn't much else I could do for the latter since I didn't have a job anymore, and I'm also not sure if the job market being tight is playing a role in my response rate. Does anyone happen to have any advice (or feedback on my resume)? I feel like this situation's really starting to bog down on me, and I just can't stop thinking about how I'm falling behind other people and how it could be the end of my career as I know it.",

We often are linked to articles or x threads from AI influencers (often employees at these AI companies) showing their setups with 10 parallel agents and 1500 plugins and told to emulate their workflow.\n\nI will be the first to admit that Claude code is incredibly useful and has definitely changes the way i write code, however I am skeptical of how much these crazy setups actually work (i’ve tried a few and they never do, the ai isn’t good enough unsupervised and context switching is draining), and i don’t think the 2x, 5x, 10x productivity gains leadership expects from us are actually possible at this point in time. It feels like snake oil salesmen selling snake oil but this time its workflows that consume 100$ of claude tokens daily.\n\nI’m wondering what other people’s thoughts are on the topic of how much AI accelerates your ability to do dev work.",

Just a dumping ground so nothing lives in my head.\n- A daily standup note in Obsidian. 3 bullets: what I did yesterday, what I'm doing today, blockers. Takes 2 minutes, saves me from blanking in standup.\n\nThe voice capture part was honestly the missing piece.

My previous jobs, I felt like there were real stakes, not just numbers on an investor's sheet. \n\nI like the people I work with quite a bit, but at this company, like many others I'm sure, the LLM bug is *strong*. Frequently when you have a question, someone's answer is \"have you asked Claude?\" It's maddening to me. I cut my teeth on actual research and engineering, so when I had questions, I had to hit the books. Now I'm...supposed to ask a neural network-powered auto-summarizer. \n\nCombine these things with the constant drumbeat of people saying \"we're automating ourselves out of a job\" and it really is wearing me down. I genuinely disagree with that sentiment, I know there'll continue to be a need for software engineers. But all of those things put together has me really questioning my place and my career choice, whether or not I'm betraying my own ideals, etc. I started working on my master's at my last job, and I find myself wondering what the point of this degree will even be once it's done, just because of how everything looks and sounds right now. \n\nTo anyone out there with more experience than me, I'd really appreciate your advice on navigating this. I recognize that the LLM part in particular is a pretty sizable paradigm shift that we're all dealing with, but I have to imagine some of this sounds familiar to some greybeards out there. \n\nThanks so much for reading my ramble, hope to hear from you.\n\nSigned,\nA Lost Engineer",

I got offered an awesome job in NYC two weeks ago but it was VERBALLY, it has now been two weeks since they offered the role. Now they DID say the process can take 1-2 weeks exec approval.\n\nThe HR called me this past Thursday and said that due to the holiday weekend, there is delays and also there are many roles that need to be approved so that is why the delay is happening. She was hoping by Tuesday latest that we will get approvals and be able to send through he offer letter. It is now EOD Monday, and I am a ball of anxiety because I was so excited about this offer.\n\nHas this happened to anyone? Did the offer still come through? Am I freaking out for no reason? I have a good job (haven’t put in notice yet ) that I am DYING to leave. Any thoughts help!",

In November of last year I was transitioned from my original organization to a new one within the same company due to some shady stuff pulled by the C-Suite.\n\nMy previous team was all US based, but we were pulled into a new team which is a US/India split & now days start at 5:30am which I didn’t sign up for when I joined 3 years ago. Not to mention I was up for a promotion right before this transition and now I’m back to square 1.\n\nOn top of this, when transitioning we were promised we would be rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career. Our new engineering manager who has zero tech background has stonewalled this as she constantly needs “data” to validate it.\n\nThe existing codebase is an absolute nightmare and all they do is defect/bug fixes with no innovation at all. I haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months and just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect ticket which they pointed to 3 story points. Myself and one other member from my old team have practically begged our manager to allow us to start working on the new POC as we are doing nothing.\n\nI find myself getting so angry after giving years of my life to this place and basically getting demoted… but that’s corporate America I guess. I unfortunately have been applying to other jobs to no avail, but don’t know how much longer I can stick this out for my own sanity.

        "content": "I’m a frontend engineer. I’ve been doing frontend for like 10 years now and feel very competent when it comes to actually developing software *on the frontend*. I’ve received lots of positive comments on my frontend code basically anywhere I worked, but it seems to not be that highly valued\n\nHowever, I’ve always felt like I struggled in my career. Although I was ostensibly hired as a frontend engineer, I often find that I’m assigned to sort of ancillary projects. For example, I worked at (big company) and I think I barely even touched the frontend code and spent the majority of my time doing operational stuff and infrastructure. I felt I spent **far** more time being what effectively amounted to a SRE, which I didn’t feel particularly competent at\n\nAt this company, I occasionally pointed out that there were some things that were more difficult or tedious than they needed to be. As an example, the i18n had tons of problems; if you didn’t add translations using a **very specific, multi day process**, then the entire site would crash. One day, someone on the team triggered this bug, causing a huge problem. I brought up to my manager that this kind of bug is not normal. I offered to perhaps fix it, and offered multiple “levels” of fixes, with the most minimal being a 2 line change that’s forward-facing so at least it wouldn’t happen *again*\n\nHe said I had no idea what I was doing, said I was lying on my resume, and told me whatever I learned in the past doesn’t matter here because this company is simply **better** than whatever companies I worked at before. He said he didn’t want to hear me talk about it again. He instructed me to “document the process” of adding a string to the i18n. It almost seemed like the frontend was so flimsy, they didn’t want anyone to touch it unless *absolutely necessary*.\n\nOn the same note with that i18n, I noticed that the plurals were… all just wrong. People would have strings like “10 user(s) online”. I told them that this doesn’t work in other languages, and they asked me to prove it was actually a problem. I went through the spanish translations and pointed out at least 20, and a couple extra in other languages. I proposed using a built-in \\`Intl\\` library, and they said I was way overcomplicating things and that I still haven’t proved there’s a problem because they “don’t speak any language other than english” and “didn’t understand what was wrong with the spanish translation”. I didn’t really know how to respond; I showed them in google translate using “el angel” and “los angeles”, but they kept insisting I was making problems where none existed\n\nWhenever I talk to anyone at work about anything, it feels like I’m expending “good will tokens”. Like even just asking a simple yes/no question will take a week of work to earn back. I reeeeeally don’t like talking to anyone I work with, at any company I’ve been at. I can’t tell if I’m doing something wrong that’s pissing people off, so I try to lay low and do nothing wrong. Whatever technical skills I have seem more or less worthless these days, honestly. Sure, give me a ticket and I’ll get it done very quickly with thorough unit/integration/e2e tests before the deadline… but… **something** is gonna go wrong after that and none of that will matter\n\nI’m just wondering, is this what it’s like for most people, or is it like… genuinely me that’s the problem?",

All of a sudden your coding speed is irrelevant. The only things that matter is your ability to break problems down to first principles, review and evaluate the plan and output and to catch issues early.\n\nEssentially AI has replaced the role of the junior from 2 years ago. Are juniors going to adapt to this and begin learning systems engineering earlier or are they going to be left behind?  A engineer who is unable to plan and design is useless now. If they don’t verify and fix small bugs with the ai then I end up spending more time in code reviewing than if I was to build the feature myself.\n\nSeniors now spend less time reviewing boilerplate and more time iterating on system design, which means juniors must be proactive in planning, reasoning, and taking ownership.",

If you couple that with the fact that there's almost no opportunity for wage growth or promotions, it's going to be very tough on me as a manager.\n\nThere's a lot more going on with this company than this issue, as you may see from my other posts, but my current thinking is that I'm going to stabilize the office as much as I can and then head for the exit. I hope that's as soon as possible, but I know the market isn't great. \n\nAm I thinking correctly?",

While the job itself seems somewhat interesting on paper, I would like to transition towards the cooler parts of autonomous vehicles: computer vision, AI/ML, etc… I took a few ML courses in my Masters but struggled to get a role directly related to ML so I took the software role instead. I didn’t have a strong desire to work in defense, but I only managed to get offers from defense companies.\n\nBy working at this company for a year or so will I be pigeonholing myself? I’m afraid that the more time that passes from when I finished my Masters will make transitioning or leaving the defense industry harder. On top of that, I’m afraid that defense contractor work will be too slow and ultimately prevent me from learning as much at the beginning of my career.\n\nUltimately, I’m starting wonder if I sold myself short choosing this first job and would have been better off searching for a different job.\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice or stories from anyone who made a similar or notable switch between different roles.",

        "author": "iGanti_",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I just graduated from a state university in December, 2025. I started my CS degree in August 2021, and did pretty well in my classes until I had a mental health issue and resulted in me failing a bunch of classes. It forced me to use my summers to catch up on those classes so I never got the chance to do any internships. For me at that point I just wanted to graduate and get me degree. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my career but I liked programming ever since HS so I tried to focus on that. \n\nI took a bunch of electives around it like Full Stack in C# and doing a capstone where I made my own project with a couple other people. I hated it. I could never get over the OOP hump of just abstraction over abstraction. It never clicked with me. However, since my university's CS department was so behind in today's tech, our project was just a CRUD machine so I just got through it and passed the class. All of my classes were like that more or less. For my Mobile App dev class, our project was a Wordle Clone. For my Databases class, our project was a simple Flask and SQLite CRUD program. Looking back on all of my classes in CS, I never learned anything useful. Yeah, I have strong soft skills like problem solving and recognizing patterns, but I never learned any marketable skills. And I understand a CS degree isn't the same as SWE but what am I supposed to do now? \n\nFast forward two months after graduating and I have no impressive projects or career experience. I tried to teach myself React and Javascript since we were never exposed to that in school and I'm so lost. I keep hearing BUILD, BUILD, BUILD but I don't even know where to begin. All of my theoretical knowledge of SWE is just a soup of classes, data structures, and OOP but I can't apply it. Maybe I'm just used to having professors give me a structed course and steps to learn but I just can't teach myself. I don't even know what I want to learn. Front-end, back-end, app dev, full stack, the list goes on. \n\nI decided last month that I wanted to create a full-stack app using React/Typescript/Firebase that connects local musicians together through a social platform allowing them to find others who share the same musical taste as them. For example, if someone who doesn;t know about the local music scene around them they could create an account and list the instrument they play, experience, and what music they like. And then others could find them on this site and message them and arrange a meet. I thought this would be a cool idea and I could show recruiters or whoever. \n\nSince I had no experience building anything at that scale with Auth, Email Verification, Rate limiting I used Claude Code to help me design it. Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree but I still had no idea what I was actually coding. I could see a chunks of code and understand it how it does a specific function but going line by line I didn't know what it actually did. But after a couple weeks I got a MVP, rough documentation of the systems, and rigorously debugged and tested it. And it works. Yeah there's some rough spots and the CSS/design isn't the best but it works. The thing is from this project I just learned how to do system design and product management. I created a product and got an output but I never understood the middle part, the actual programming. And now I finally understand that I just hate programming and it isn't for me.  \n\n\nSo now I'm having a career crisis (I haven't even started my career yet) and scrambling to find out what I need to do. The data world seems interesting so I started to lookup what it means to be a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and AI/ML Engineer. From what I understand, everything past a Data Analyst is heavy programming so I don't want to do that. I know intermediate Python and basic SQL and little bit of Excel so maybe Data Analyst is something I should do? I messed around with Pandas and CSV files and I like how I can see trends from just mounds of data. I also kinda like Stats and Prob in college but idk. I would like to pivot to become a Data Analyst but idek where to begin. Do I get a cert like the IBM Data Analyst or is that a waste of time. I just want to learn.\n\n  \n",

        "content": "In my 4th semester, I was introduced to Java for the first time and I genuinely loved OOP. I ended up building an app in Java for both Android and desktop, and that’s when I realized I actually enjoy building software.\n\nBeing the nerd I am, I started digging into whether Java is enough to build real-world apps and land a dev job. That’s when I found out Kotlin is basically the go-to for Android now, so I switched and started learning it.\n\nFast forward: I’ve built a few apps with Kotlin. I understand a decent amount, but I’m definitely not an expert yet. Still learning, still breaking things, still enjoying the process.\n\nWhat’s messing with my head is this:\n\nI’ve used AI agents to implement features in my apps that I haven’t fully learned yet, and they work surprisingly well. Almost too well. It made me wonder—should I really spend years learning all this deeply if tools can already do a lot of the heavy lifting?\n\nSo I’m a bit confused about direction right now:\n\n* Should I double down on Kotlin and Android dev?\n* Does Kotlin/Android actually have a solid future career-wise?\n* Is it realistic to aim for a job with this path?\n* Or am I setting myself up to learn skills that’ll be half-automated by the time I’m job-ready?\n\nI enjoy building apps a lot, and I like understanding how things work under the hood. I just don’t want to end up grinding for years on something that doesn’t have a future.\n\nBtw here is one of my projects i recently worked on ,let me know what level i am on !\n\n[\\->Project](https://github.com/AleemKanyu/AquaLevel/releases/tag/v1.5.0)",

Turns out in the current job that it's the ceiling number, the maximum I could possibly get if I did an absolutely perfect job.\n\nJust looking to gather some data on other folks' experiences, so I that I can understand where this is on the line from \"totally the norm and my previous job was a unicorn\" to \"seriously shady, my previous job was the norm\".",

He said a good portion of their summer interns get return offers at the end of their program and they absolutely intend to do the same going forward.\n\nI don't mind the work, and I don't mind doing that full-time if I do happen to get a return offer BUT I am still a programmer at heart and I would definitely prefer a job or internship that has me writing code, be it traditional SWE or agentic AI or traditional ML.\n\nIf I do get the role and I don't have any other offer, I will take it. I don't think I can be a choosy beggar in this market lol\n\nBut do you guys think it will hurt my chances for a more traditional role later on?

By 7 or 8pm after a full day of decisions, opening uber eats or DoorDash removes one more decision from the stack and that seems enough. \n\nSeeing it laid out visually made it seem like predictable burnout window instead of poor discipline.

Lots of companies ask upfront what are my yearly salary expectations and upon googling a bit, I found mixed results for my experience tbh, so I figured Id ask on reddit where theres always real people willing to share real data.\n\nIm currently an iOS dev with a little bit over 5years of experience.\n\nFor whatever reason, the internet suggested from 50k all the way to like 90k so I wonder what a more realistic salary expectation might be.\n\nMost offers im getting are from Berlin.\n\nThanks!\n\nPd: I dont think this qualifies as salary sharing (because of the sub rule). Otherwise please let me know!",

        "author": "MaleficentCherry7116",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I received a chat message and email from HR yesterday that I had been identified as a critical resource on my team and that they were going to send a survey to my supervisors, peers, and subordinates, asking for feedback on my performance. I was told repeatedly in the email that \"This is not negative!\". I was also told that I'm one of three people in the entire company that they've done this for. The \"goal\" according to them is to help ME and to.make things easier for ME. They will take the survey results and create a learning plan for me. \n\nEmbedded in this email where they kept repeatedly saying \"This is NOT a bad thing!\" was a small snippet that mentioned \"planning for my succession\". \n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is, how does this help ME? My team needs more resources, and that would help me a lot. The company could pay me more, but I'd take more resources over more money - anything that would help me to not work 80 hours per week. We have a very flat structure and there's no path upwards for me. Besides that, I don't think I'd want to go any higher in the supervisory chain. My next level would be director, but it would likely result in more responsibilities with no more pay.\n\nI'm not worried about the feedback of my subordinates or peers. I'm a bit worried about one C level guy who seems to want to hurt me for some reason. And maybe this feedback will help me become a better leader. But I'm not convinced that there's not some ulterior motive, as the company itself is pretty rotten \n\nEx: They fired a guy on Tuesday and HR held an online meeting with our office telling us why people getting fired was a \"good thing\". I'm sure the single dad who was already underpaid felt that way as they walked him to the door with his box of stuff.\n\nSo, should I worry about this? Is this good, bad, or neutral?",

My day-to-day work is mostly focused on domain-specific LLMs—specifically fine-tuning, building RAG systems, and evals.\n\nAs I’m looking at the job market (especially FAANG), almost every MLE, Applied Scientist, Research Scientist role mentions \"Agents.\" The term feels incredibly broad, and coming from academia, I don't currently use it on my resume. I know the underlying tech, but I'm not sure what the industry standard is for an \"agent\" right now.\n\nI’d love some advice:\n\n* **What does \"Agents\" mean in industry right now?** Are they looking for tool-use/function calling, multi-agent frameworks (AutoGen/CrewAI), or just complex RAG pipelines?\n* **What should I build?** What kind of projects should I focus on so I can legitimately add \"Agents\" to my resume?\n* **Resources?** Any recommendations for courses, repos, or reading material to get up to speed on production-ready agents?\n\nAppreciate any guidance!",
