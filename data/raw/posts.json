        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my situation and get some honest perspective from this community.\n\nI’m a data engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience building and maintaining production pipelines. Most of my work has been around Spark (batch + streaming), Kafka, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS and GCP), and large-scale data systems used by real business teams. I’ve worked on real-time event processing, data migrations, and high-volume pipelines, not just toy projects.\n\nDespite that, the current job hunt has been brutal.\n\nI’ve been applying consistently for months. I do get callbacks, recruiter screens, and even technical rounds. But I keep getting rejected late in the process or after hiring manager rounds. Sometimes the feedback is vague. Sometimes there’s no feedback at all. Roles get paused. Headcount disappears. Or they suddenly want an exact internal tech match even though the JD said otherwise.\n\nWhat’s making this harder is the pressure outside work. I’m managing rent, education costs, and visa timelines, so the uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I know I’m capable, I know I’ve delivered in real production environments, but this market makes you question everything.\n\nI’m trying to understand a few things:\n\n\t•\tIs this level of rejection normal right now even for experienced data engineers?\n\n\t•\tAre companies strongly preferring very narrow stack matches over fundamentals?\n\n\t•\tIs the market simply oversaturated, or am I missing something obvious in how I’m interviewing or positioning myself?\n\n\t•\tFor those who recently landed roles, what actually made the difference?\n\nI’m not looking for sympathy. I genuinely want to improve and adapt. If the answer is “wait it out,” I can accept that. If the answer is “your approach is wrong,” I want to fix it.\n\nAppreciate any real advice, especially from people actively hiring or who recently went through the same thing.\n\nThanks for reading.",

We've got way more servers than we need and we're keeping data for 30 days when most of it gets used in the first few hours, basically everything is over provisioned.\n\nI've tried to bring up optimizing this like 5 times and everyone just says \"what if we need that capacity later\" or \"what if something breaks when we change it\". Meanwhile, we're losing money on servers that barely do anything most of the time. I finally convinced them to add gravitee to at least get visibility into what we're actually using and it confirmed what I suspected, we're wasting so much capacity. The funniest part of it is we started using kafka for pretty simple stuff like sending notifications between services and now it's this massive thing nobody wants to touch\n\nAnyone else dealing with this? Big kafka setup is such an overkill for what a lot of teams need but once you have it you're stuck with it",

I wonder if we are too vested into Snowflake and would like to understand pros/cons from the community. The majority of the processing and transformations are done in Snowflake. I anticipate we deal with 5TB of data when we add up all the raw sources we pull today.\n\nQuick overview of inputs/outputs:\n\nEL with minor transformations like appending a timestamp or converting from csv to json. This is done with AWS Fargate running a batch job daily and pulling from the raw sources. Data is written to raw tables within a schema in Snowflake, dedicated to be the 'stage'. But we aren't using internal or external stages.\n\nWhen it hits the raw tables, we call it Bronze. We use Snowflake streams and tasks to ingest and process data into Silver tables. Task has logic to do transformations.\n\nFrom there, we generate Snowflake views scoped to our customers. Generally views are created to meet usecases or limit the access.\n\nMajority of our customers are BI users that use either tableau or power bi. We have some app teams that pull from us but not as common as BI teams.\n\nI have seen teams not use any snowflake features and just handle all transformations outside of snowflake. But idk if I can truly do a medallion architecture model if not all stages of data sit in Snowflake. \n\nCost is probably an obvious concern. Wonder if alternatives will generate more savings.\n\nThanks in advance and curious to see responses.",

        "author": "paxmlank",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "tl;dr: no point stands out to me as the obvious place to use it, but I feel that every project uses it so I feel like I'm missing something.\n\nI'm working on a private hobby project that's primarily just for learning new things, some that I never really got to work on in my 5 YOE. One of these things I've learned is to \"make the MVP first and ask questions later\", so I'm mainly trying to do just that for this latest version, but I'm still stirring up some questions within myself as I read on various things.\n\nOne of these other questions is when/how to implement Pydantic/dataclasses. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about it, just thought it was a \"better\" Typing module (which I also don't know much about, just am familiar with type hints).\n\nI know that people use Pydantic to validate user input, but I know that its author says it's not a validation library, but a parsing one. One issue I have is that the data I collect largely are from undocumented APIs or are scraped from the web. They all fit what is conceptually the same thing, but sources will provide a different subset of \"essential fields\".\n\nMy current workflow is to collect the data from the sources and save it in an object with extraction metadata, preserving the response *exactly* was it was provided. Because the data come in various shapes, I coerce everything into JSONL format. Then I use a config-based approach where I coerce different field names into a \"canonical field name\" (e.g., `{\"firstname\", \"first_name\", \"1stname\", etc.} -> \"C_FIRST_NAME\"`). Lastly, some data are missing (rows and fields), but the data are consistent so I build out all that I'm expecting for my application/analyses; this is done partly in Python before loading into the database then partly in SQL/dbt after loading.\n\nInitially, I thought of using Pydantic for the data as it's ingested, but I just want to preserve whatever I get as it's the source of truth. Then I thought about parsing the response into objects and using it for that (for example, I extract data about a Pokemon team so I make a Team class with a list of Pokemon, where each Pokemon has a Move/etc.), but I don't really need that much? I feel like I can just keep the data in the database with the schema that I coerce it to and the application currently just runs by running calculations in the database. Maybe I'd use it for defining a later ML model?\n\nI then figured I'd somehow use it to define the various getters in my extraction library so that I can codify how they will behave (e.g., expects a Source of either an Endpoint or a Connection, outputs a JSON with X outer keys, etc.), but figured I don't really have a good grasp of Pydantic here.\n\nAfter reading on it some more, I figured I could use it *after* I flatten everything into JSONL and use it while I try to add semantics to the values I see, but as I'm using Claude Code at points, it's guiding me toward using it *before/during* flattening, and that just seems forced. Tbf, it's shit at times.\n\nTo reiterate, all of my sources are undocumented APIs or from webscraping. I have some control over the output from the extraction step, but I feel that I shouldn't do that in extracting. Any validation comes from having the data in a dataframe while massaging it or after loading it into the database to build it out for the desired data product.\n\nI'd appreciate any further direction.",

        "author": "Remarkable_Result596",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi All,\n\n​Looking for a bit of advice on a career struggle. I like my job quite a lot—it has given me learning opportunities that I don’t think would have materialized elsewhere—but I’ve hit some roadblocks.\n\nThe Context\n\n​I’m 26 and based in the EU. I have a Master’s in Economics/Statistics and about 4 years of experience in Data (strictly Data Engineering for the last 2).\n​My current role has been very rewarding because I’ve had the initiative to really expand my stack. I’m the \"Databricks guy\" (Admin, Unity Catalog, PySpark, ...) within my team, but lately, I’ve been primarily focused on building out a hybrid data architecture. Specifically, I’ve been focusing on the on-premise side:\n\n​Infrastructure: Setting up an on-prem Dagster deployment on Kubernetes. Also django based apps, POCing tools like OpenMetadata.\n\n​Modern Data Stack (On-prem): Experimenting with DuckDB, Polars, dbt, and dlthub to make our local setup click with our cloud environments (Azure/GCP/Fabric, onprem even).\n\n​Upcoming: A project for real-time streaming with Debezium and Kafka. I’d mostly be a consumer here, but it’s a setup I really want to see through. Definitely have a room impact the architecture there and downstream.\n​\nThe Problem\n\n​Even though I value the \"builder\" autonomy, two things are weighing on me:\n\n​The Salary Ceiling: I’m somewhat bound by my starting salary. I recently learned that a new hire in a lower position is earning about 10% more than me. It’s not a massive gap, but it’s frustrating given the difference in impact. My manager kind of acknowledges my value but says getting HR to approve a 30-50% \"market adjustment\" is unlikely.\n\n​The 6-Month Notice: This is the biggest blocker. I get reach-outs for roles paying 50-100% more and I’ve usually done well in initial stages, but as soon as the 6-month notice period comes up, I’m effectively disqualified. I probably can't move unless I resign first.\n\n​The Dilemma\n\n​I definitely don’t think I’m an expert in everything and believe there is still a whole lot of unique learning to squeeze out of my current role, and I would love to see this through. I’m torn on whether to:\n​Keep learning: Stay for another year to \"tie it all together\" and get the streaming/Kafka experience on my CV.\n​Risk it: Resign without a plan just to free myself from the 6-month notice period and become \"employable\" again.\n​Do you think it's worth sticking it out for the environment and the upcoming projects, or am I just letting myself be underpaid while my tenure in the market is still fresh?\n\n\n​TL;DR: 4 YoE DE with a heavy focus on on-prem MDS and Databricks. I have great autonomy, but I’m underpaid compared to new hires and \"trapped\" by a 6-month notice period. Should I stay for the learning or quit to find a role that pays market rate?\n\n\nEDIT:\nThanks for all the feedback. I think quitting materialized as the best move I can make given the circumstances. After looking into it, the 6-month notice period on a standard employment contract seems to be a significant gray area. Under local law, contract terms generally cannot be worse for the employee than what is written in the national statutes (which would normally be 1 month for my length of service). However, custom arrangements are possible, and there is a chance the company’s version is legally valid, meaning I might be stuck with it.\n\n​My plan: I am not making any moves yet. I am going to consult with the National Labor Inspectorate and a legal expert to get a formal opinion. I need to know if this clause is actually enforceable or if it would be thrown out of court.\n\n​If the 6 months is likely valid: I will probably resign immediately to \"start the clock\" so I can be free to look for a new job sooner.\n\n​If it is likely invalid: I will start applying for jobs like a normal human being, knowing I can legally leave much earlier.\n\n​I don’t want to risk a lawsuit or a permanent mark on my official employment record for \"abandoning work\" without being 100% sure where I stand.",

Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR questions if you don't want the backstory.**\n\n# Backstory:\n\nHowdy... not entirely sure this is the right subreddit for this (between here and the BI sub) but figured I'd start here.\n\nOk so... I'm a tech lead for our engineers working on our core product in a startup. I am NOT on the data engineering or BI side of things, but my involvement in BI matters is growing, and this is me sanity-checking what I see.\n\nOur data stack is I think ok for a startup. We source our data, which is mostly our main Postgres DB plus with a few other third party tracking sources, with 5X into our staging tables in BigQuery. Then we use dbt to bucket our data into dimensions, fact tables, and what are called \"reporting tables\" which are the highest 1-to-1 tables that are used in whatever presentation layer we use (which is Looker). Our ingestion/bootstrap logic all exists in a GitHub repo.\n\nThis entire system was originally designed and put together by a very experienced senior data engineer when we were in a scaling phase. Unfortunately, they were laid-off some time ago cuz of runway issues before they could completely finish everything. Since that time, our management has continually pushed for additional and additional reporting, but we haven’t replaced that position. And it's getting worse.\n\nToday, we have ONE business analyst (not on the eng team) with no tech skills, having learned SQL basics from ChatGPT. They create reports as best as they can, but idk how correct they are in querying stuff from the BI layer (frankly I don't care tbh, not the eng team's concern)\n\nAnyway, the business comes to us with a regular set of new reporting requirements for tables, but many of these do not make sense. At all.\n\nFor example: *\"I’d like a list of all cars, but also like a column for how much spaghetti people eat per day, and then a column of every fish in the sea, and we need a dashboard for the fish-spaghetti-car metric per month \"*. That kind of bullshit\n\nSince we still have a reduced team post-layoffs, product management has started working on sprint stories for any product improvement we do such as *“Create a reporting table for the spaghetti bullshit above\"* despite the underlying data structure being ambiguous or incorrect (and not being a spaghetti company). Which I think is pretty fucking weird that they're telling us what the actual implementation should be.\n\nWe, as software engineers, are comfortable designing application schemas and writing database queries against Postgres (and the PG layer is well formed imo). We, however, are not professionals in business intelligence, and we are facing more and more questions about dimensional design, report structure, which are questions we feel uncomfortable answering.\n\nThe most aggravating part of this process is the business will attempt almost anything rather than considering adding another senior BI or data engineering person to the staff. They have attempted to draw general engineering talent into doing business intelligence tasks when that isn’t their technical niche. They have attempted to use short-term or lower-quality consultants. Many times, they have simply pressed onward with what we understand to be an iffy model.\n\nIncreasingly I spend my time fighting off requests against our team or explaining to others why some of those requests are simply nonsensical (in a polite manner of course) but I feel I'm slowly losing that fight over time, and my head of Product/Eng is not helping me here.\n\nI always knew the business was crazy when just dealing with product AC, but I've realized they really go fucking bonkers when you talk to them about anything related to a dashboard.\n\n# My questions to ya'll\n\n*(skip to here if you didn't want to read my sob story above)*\n\nMy questions are about whether we have a common concept of \"good\" data modeling and who really is responsible. The engineering department is picking up all of this slack, and BI isn’t really our expertise. So...\n\n* When is the time for the BI/data modeling necessarily a full-time endeavor and not something that should be accomplished as part of the product engineering team, if at all? Are there any heuristics that you have observed for smaller startups?\n* Is there ever value in planning or building \"bad\" or ugly reporting tables to meet current business requirements, or is it almost always harmful?\n* If leadership wants speed and they do not have data modeling knowledge, what data governance patterns work well for you?\n* How do you communicate concepts of dimensional modeling to non-technical business audiences in a way that leads to lasting behavior change? (If at all lol)\n* Finally, if leadership is flatly unwilling to engage experienced BI/DE talent, then what is the least worst alternative you've encountered?\n\nI'm way outside my lane here as a non-DE so any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

        "author": "shashanksati",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been building [SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB), for most of this year and I wanted to share what we’re working on and get genuine feedback from people who are interested in databases and distributed systems.\n\n*Sevendb is a distributed cache with pub/sub capabilities and configurable fsync.*\n\n# What problem we’re trying to solve\n\nA lot of modern applications need \\*\\*live data\\*\\*:\n\n* dashboards that should update instantly\n* tickers and feeds\n* systems reacting to rapidly changing state\n\nToday, most systems handle this by **polling-** clients repeatedly asking the database “*has*\n\n*this changed yet?*”. That wastes CPU, bandwidth, and introduces latency and complexity.\n\nTriggers do help a lot here , but as soon as multiple machine and low latency applications enter , they get dicey\n\nscaling databases horizontally introduces another set of problems:\n\n* nondeterministic behavior under failures\n* subtle bugs during retries, reconnects, crashes, and leader changes\n* difficulty reasoning about correctness\n\nSevenDB is our attempt to tackle both of these issues together.\n\n# What SevenDB does\n\nAt a high level, SevenDB is:\n\n**1. Reactive by design**\n\nInstead of clients polling, clients can \\*subscribe\\* to values or queries.\n\nWhen the underlying data changes, updates are pushed automatically.\n\nThink:\n\n\\* “Tell me whenever this value changes” instead of \"polling every few milliseconds\"\n\nThis reduces wasted work(compute , network and even latency) and makes real-time systems simpler and cheaper to run.\n\n**2. Deterministic execution**\n\nThe same sequence of logical operations always produces the same state.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n*  crash recovery becomes predictable\n*  retries don’t cause weird edge cases\n*  multi-replica behavior stays consistent\n*  bugs become reproducible instead of probabilistic nightmares\n\nWe explicitly test determinism by running randomized workloads hundreds of times across scenarios like:\n\n*  crash before send / after send\n*  reconnects (OK, stale, invalid)\n*  WAL rotation and pruning\n\n\\* 3-node replica symmetry with elections\n\nIf behavior diverges, that’s a bug.\n\n\\*\\*3. Raft-based replication\\*\\*\n\nWe use Raft for consensus and replication, but layer deterministic execution on top so that replicas don’t just \\*agree\\*—they behave identically.\n\nThe goal is to make distributed behavior boring and predictable.\n\n# Interesting part\n\nWe're an in-memory KV store , One of the fun challenges in SevenDB was making emissions fully deterministic. We do that by pushing them into the state machine itself. No async “surprises,” no node deciding to emit something on its own. If the Raft log commits the command, the state machine produces the exact same emission on every node. Determinism by construction.\n\nBut this compromises speed significantly , so what we do to get the best of both worlds is:\n\nOn the durability side: a SET is considered successful only after the Raft cluster commits it—meaning it’s replicated into the in-memory WAL buffers of a quorum. Not necessarily flushed to disk when the client sees “OK.”\n\nWhy keep it like this? Because we’re taking a deliberate bet that plays extremely well in practice:\n\n• **Redundancy buys durability** In Raft mode, our real durability is replication. Once a command is in the memory of a majority, you can lose a minority of nodes and the data is still intact. The chance of most of your cluster dying before a disk flush happens is tiny in realistic deployments.\n\n• **Fsync is the throughput killer** Physical disk syncs (fsync) are orders slower than memory or network replication. Forcing the leader to fsync every write would tank performance. I prototyped batching and timed windows, and they helped—but not enough to justify making fsync part of the hot path. (There is a durable flag planned: if a client appends durable to a SET, it will wait for disk flush. Still experimental.)\n\n• **Disk issues shouldn’t stall a cluster** If one node's storage is slow or semi-dying, synchronous fsyncs would make the whole system crawl. By relying on quorum-memory replication, the cluster stays healthy as long as most nodes are healthy.\n\nSo the tradeoff is small: yes, there’s a narrow window where a simultaneous majority crash could lose in-flight commands. But the payoff is huge: predictable performance, high availability, and a deterministic state machine where emissions behave exactly the same on every node.\n\nIn distributed systems, you often bet on the failure mode you’re willing to accept. This is ours.\n\nit helped us achieve these benchmarks\n\n    SevenDB benchmark — GETSET\n    Target: localhost:7379, conns=16, workers=16, keyspace=100000, valueSize=16B, mix=GET:50/SET:50\n    Warmup: 5s, Duration: 30s\n    Ops: total=3695354 success=3695354 failed=0\n    Throughput: 123178 ops/s\n    Latency (ms): p50=0.111 p95=0.226 p99=0.349 max=15.663\n    Reactive latency (ms): p50=0.145 p95=0.358 p99=0.988 max=7.979 (interval=100ms)\n\n# Why I'm posting here\n\nI started this as a potential contribution to dicedb, they are archived for now and had other commitments , so i started something of my own, then this became my master's work and now I am confused on where to go with this, I really love this idea but there's a lot we gotta see apart from just fantacising some work of yours\n\nWe’re early, and this is where we’d really value outside perspective.\n\nSome questions we’re wrestling with:\n\n*  Does “reactive + deterministic” solve a real pain point for you, or does it sound academic?\n*  What would stop you from trying a new database like this?\n*  Is this more compelling as a niche system (dashboards, infra tooling, stateful backends), or something broader?\n*  What would convince you to trust it enough to use it?\n\nBlunt criticism or any advice is more than welcome. I'd much rather hear “this is pointless” now than discover it later.\n\nHappy to clarify internals, benchmarks, or design decisions if anyone’s curious.",

So I do not have experience in all these usages that you refer to. My question is, what is the actual usable output from all of these. For example, we load data from various to Snowflake using COPY INTO, use  SQL to create a Star schema model. The \"usable Output\" we get in this scenario are various analytics dashboards and reports created using Qlikview etc.\n\n\\[Question 1\\] Similarly, what is the output of a ML pipeline in data bricks ?\n\nI read all these posts about Data Engineering that talk about Snowflake vs Databricks, PySpark vs SQL, loading data to Parquet files, BI vs ML workloads - I want to understand what is the usable output from all these activities that you do ?\n\nWhat is a Machine Learning output? Is it something like a Predictive Information, a Classification etc. ?\n\nI saw a thread about loading images. What type of outputs do you get out of this? Are these uses for Ops applications or for Reporting purposes?\n\nFor example, could an ML output from a Databricks Spark application be the suggestion of what movie to watch next on netflix ? Or perhaps to build an LLM such as ChatGPT ? And if so, are all these done by a Data Engineer or an  ML Engineer?\n\n\\[Question 2\\] Are all these outputs achieved using unstructured data in its unstructured form - or do you eventually need to model it into a schema to be able to get necessary outputs? How do you account of duplications, and non-uniqueness and relational connections between data entities if used in unstructured formats?\n\njust curious to understand the modern usage, by a traditional warehouse Data Engineer?",

The only type of cleaning being done is some deduplication logic (very manual) and some type casting. This means a lot of the data that goes into reports and downstream products aren’t uniform and must be fixed/transformed at the report level.\n\nAll these tiny problems are handled in scripts when new tables are created in silver or gold layers. So the scripts can get very long, complex, and contain duplicate logic.\n\nSo..\n\n\\- at what point do you see it necessary to actually do data cleaning? In my opinion it should already be implemented but I want to hear other perspectives.\n\n\\- what kind of “cleaning” do you deem absolutely necessary/bare minimum for most use cases?\n\n\\- i understand and completely onboard with the thought of “don’t fix it if it’s not broken” but when does it reach a breaking point?\n\n\\- in your opinion, what part of this is up to the data engineer to decide vs. analysts?\n\nWe are using spark and delta lake to store data.\n\nEdit: clarified question 3",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Greetings. I am trying to train an OCR system on huge datasets, namely:\n\n* [OCR Cyrillic Printed 1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DonkeySmall/OCR-Cyrillic-Printed-1)\n* [Synthetic Cyrillic Large](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pumb-ai/synthetic-cyrillic-large)\n* [Cyrillic Handwriting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/cyrillic-handwriting-dataset)\n\nThey contain millions of images, and are all in different formats - `WebDataset`, `zip` with folders, etc. I will be experimenting with different hyperparameters locally on my M2 Mac, and then training on a [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai) server. \n\nThe thing is, I don't have enough space to fit even one of these datasets at a time on my personal laptop, and I don't want to use permanent storage on the server. The reason is that I want to rent the server for as short of a time as possible. If I have to instantiate server instances multiple times (e.g. in case of starting all over), I will waste several hours every time to download the datasets. Therefore, I think that streaming the datasets is a flexible option that would solve my problems both locally on my laptop, and on the server.   \nHowever, two of the datasets are available on Hugging Face, and one - only on Kaggle, where I can't stream it from. Furthermore, I expect to hit rate limits when streaming the datasets from Hugging Face.   \n  \nHaving said all of this, I consider just uploading the data to Google Cloud Buckets, and use the `Google Cloud Connector for PyTorch` to efficiently stream the datasets. This way I get a dataset-agnostic way of streaming the data. The interface directly inherits from PyTorch `Dataset`:\n\n    from dataflux_pytorch import dataflux_iterable_dataset \n    PREFIX = \"simple-demo-dataset\" \n    iterable_dataset = dataflux_iterable_dataset.DataFluxIterableDataset(\n        project_name=PROJECT_ID, \n        bucket_name=BUCKET_NAME,\n        config=dataflux_mapstyle_dataset.Config(prefix=PREFIX)\n    )\n\n>The `iterable_dataset` now represents an iterable over data samples.\n\nI have two questions:  \n1. Are my assumptions correct and is it worth uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets (assuming I pick locations close to my working location and my server location, enable hierarchical storage, use prefixes, etc.). Or I should just stream the Hugging Face datasets, download the Kaggle dataset, and call it a day?   \n2. If uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets is worth it, how do I store the datasets to GCP Buckets in the first place? [This](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcs-connector-for-pytorch/blob/main/demo/simple-walkthrough/Getting%20Started%20with%20Dataflux%20Dataset%20for%20PyTorch%20with%20Google%20Cloud%20Storage.ipynb) and [this](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcs-connector-for-pytorch/blob/main/demo/image_segmentation/README.md) tutorials only work with images, not with image-string pairs.

The default \"Properties\" (for the NTFS ?) are easiest to search, but you can't tag all file types or directories.\n\nI use XYPlorer as my file explorer and I like it as a general file browser. I liked the flexibility of the tags, but didn't like how running a script in Command Line to bulk rename hundreds of image files would break the tag link since the tags are all recorded in a tag.dat file (which I'm not opposed to writing something to also change it in there, but I also didn't think it was a very flexible tag data storage method. \n\nI'm gathering people's experiences in hopes of finding something I can invest time into when it comes to tagging my media and being able to access it. \n\nThings I'm looking for:\n1. Ease of access (I figure I can write a script to handle the tag hierarchy and categories as needed)\n2. Tag flexibility (like bulk renaming a tag)\n3. Ease of tag-ability (while I liked Adobe Bridge to edit tags, it didn't flow the best for me)\n4. Data versatility (if I can access the data for different visuals at some point or export it into an Excel format)\n5. Kind of an extra would be doing the opposite of point 4  (adding tags from an Excel spreadsheet)\n\nQuestions I have:\n1. Is it more efficient for my uses for tags to be in one main file (like how XYPlorer stores it's tags) or sidecar files (which I liked the concept, but not how TagSpaces did it, and I'm worried about a search function scouring all the sidecar files)?\n2. Are there other solutions that exist now that I haven't experienced?\n\nMy solution that stands now is to figure out the way XYPlorer can natively batch rename files and just go with all tags being in the plain text file. I would love to know if anyone has encountered other options. \n\nThank you! \n\nEDIT: Or maybe a SQL situation. ",

I made improvements to the app and released new version. The app is now available to download from Microsoft store and Linux Snap store.\n\n**What My Project Does:**\n\nTidyBit is a File Organizer app. It helps organize messy collection of files in folders such as Downloads, Desktop or from External drives. The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders.\n\n*The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.*\n\nThis is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules.\n\nThe app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.\n\nAdd new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nMost other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store. The app is also available to download as an executable file for windows and portable Linux App Image format on GitHub releases.\n\nCheck the app: [TidyBit Github Repository](https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit)",

When I did get a call back I’d be two interviews in and just be dropped. I assumed by fate was sealed until I finally applied for a job that I was pretty sure I didn’t have the skills for. The only difference is this time I took command during my interview. I didn’t sit there any let them run it I simply said hey I know this is weird but instead of telling you my skills and answering all the typical questions can I just show you? They just kinda looked around and said sure. \n\n Before I officially applied I did deep research on the company. Looked into trends and markets and made a sample project. Long story short I made a backend and front end for a billing systems. I saw that they had recently acquired a billing company. \n\n After my presentation and showing off my project they smiled and said we will call you. Not even 30 minutes later they called and said that I would not be doing the other two interviews and sent me an offer letter. I was honestly so confused and happy?\n\nI was always told that projects were never the way to go and to just do the interviews and meet and greets. I guess I’m not sure exactly where this post is going but for all the people out there that do better by showing your skills I say go for it. ",

I’d be targeting internal roles like QA/test automation, internal tools, ops, data/reporting, or technical support engineer, &  not junior SWE or webdev as a starting point.\n\nGiven age, AI, and market saturation, is this still a realistic approach, or is the degree mostly a time sink at this point? If you were late 30s and starting now, would you use a degree this way, or skip it entirely and go another route (IT, trades, ops, etc.)?\n\nAppreciate honest takes from people already in the field.",

While it’s not as difficult as other situations, I still want to keep improving to reach better roles. And I’ve been there too. Day after day trying to figure out what to build to improve, and even so I believe the previous advice still applies.\n\nSo, what is that project that interest me so much and made me change my mind? Just a self-hosting e-book library. Sorry if I disappointed someone (I'm not). I got a Kindle a few weeks ago and since I also like home-labs and self-hosting I looked for an app, but every one feels like artificial and not personal, and as a book lover, I want my library to feel personal, something that I truly own, so I decided to build one.\n\nYou may think, what can an e-book library teach? Well, is not about the specific case of my app, but more of the concept/problem itself that needs to be implemented or solved that can be applied for many contexts. For example: what if an user have 5000 books? How should I store the covers vs basic metadata (cache vs database)? How can I process all that books in seconds (concurrency & parallelism to improve performance)? How can I avoid the rate limits of an external api? How do I keep the database in sync if the user manually deletes a file? What if I implement an internal ddbb back up tool? Can I pass all the books from kindle to the library directly?\n\nAnd even if I knew about some of that questions before, applying it yourself will always teach you more that just theory.\n\nSome people will think that thinking about all that stuff early in the project may be over-engineering, but who cares, is your project you can do whatever you can with it according to your objectives, not someone else ideas. \n\nSo thanks to everyone who has always given that advice, and for those who are in the situation I mentioned, it’s better to build a project that seems simple on the surface, but where you really dive deep than creating something that looks good on paper but you’re not invested in.",

I would consider NeoVim but I feel like it is troublesome to learn and I also have Arch which I recently switched to.\n\n  \nI would really appreciate your opinions on what you have been using if you were in a similar case as mine.\n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

Later on we might replace the simple math to using UniDepth.\n\nthis is how I plan to currently build my first prototype, I do wanna try and bring to like Waymo / Tesla's End-to-End approach where we have a model that can still drive between lessons by doing path planning. i mean i have thought of somehow bring the whole model of  the floor to a virtual env and try to RL the model to handle like crowds. not sure if i have enough compute / data / not that good of a programmer to do that.\n\nany feedback welcome! please help me out for anything that you think I might got wrong / can improve.",

My main issue is how we learn stuff and the testing model. In classes like Calculus, electronics, or physics, you can add more, it feels like we just memorize algorithms to solve questions. I can learn the 'why' from external sources, for example books or Prof.Leonard for calculus but at uni, if you solve 100 past years questions or questions from books, you still can get a good grade, without truly knowing the material. This means that you cannot solve a different kind of problem that involves the integral that you learned 1 week ago and passed the exam, because you didn't understand what you doing, just memorize algorithm.\n\nI have many friends, even when they got a good grade, they still lack an understanding. I don't want to be same but what's point?  \nAm I right to feel this way or I'm being ignorant?  \nSorry for long post and bad english.\n\n**TL;DR:** University exams feel like testing memorized solution patterns  rather than deep conceptual understanding.

I've tried pro sports, making music, running a photography business, content creation, landscaping, serving, along with a ton of other things to which I've had varying success in.\n\nBut nothing really seems to give satisfaction like programming, now I'm new to programming, I only really have been \"doing\" it since like the last few months.\n\nTwo main things I've coded.\n\n\\- A league of legends cool down app (it basically tracks when an enemy uses key spells in the game, the tracking is manual you have to tap the button to start it)\n\n\\- A program that trains a specific skill in League of Legends called kiting, which is basically clicking your mouse fast in a specific sequence.\n\nI think the fun part of programming is you can just make things, it's like Lego but you have no limits and growing up I always loved Lego.\n\nAnother aspect I like is while I am very good at content creation, I've had close to 500 million views on social media from content I've made. Content creation doesn't really scratch the same itch.\n\nIt's like with content creation you make things that people watch but how impactful is that? Half of the stuff we watch we don't even remember ....but with coding you make things that people USE.\n\nAnd that's what I think is so cool.\n\nPart of me worries that because I'm bad at math I'll never really \"get\" programming, I also worry I'm not smart enough for it...but I enjoy it.\n\nAnyway I don't know if this post is something that people will love, or not, but I just wanted to share it. It's late here, 4am and I've been really struggling last few days with figuring out what I enjoy.\n\nI've been trying to be a \"content creator\" for the last few weeks, and while I'm really good at it, I don't think I enjoy it. It feels really fake and tbh, a large portion of content out there is entirely fake anyway.\n\nI still don't really understand where I fit in with life, but I like the idea of making stuff people use and I see myself for the next while making programs or apps that solve simple problems in peoples lives.

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m a second year IT student, and I’m reaching out because I’m at a crossroads. I’m looking for some serious advice on how to push myself forward when I feel like I’m stuck at a standstill. To give you some context: I’ve never considered myself a natural at tech. I didn’t do any advanced prep before starting my degree, and honestly, I struggled through my first year. I managed to pass, but looking back, I realize I was just surviving, not actually learning.\nThis year, due to personal circumstances, I had to switch to online classes. It’s been a disaster for my learning style. My professor primarily uploads modules and assessments without live sessions, leaving me to teach myself through YouTube and documentation. Here is the predicament: In trying to teach myself, I realized I’ve forgotten a lot from my first year. Even the most basic concepts have slipped away. I’ve decided to \"start from scratch\" while still trying to keep up with my current 2nd year workload. I’m currently grinding through Java learning strings, characters, loops, and operators while simultaneously staring down a mountain of Networking and SQL coursework including C++ and other programming languages that we’ve studied in my first year that I have to run through again, I feel completely overwhelmed. My progress feels incredibly slow. I see others online who seem to grasp these concepts effortlessly, and I can’t help but feel a deep sense of envy and doubt. I’m questioning if I’m even making progress or if I’m just not cut out for this. I’m not planning on changing my course I genuinely want to be good at this but the anxiety that I’ll never \"get it\" is starting to take over. I know going back to face-to-face classes eventually will help, but I also know that won't fix the fact that I'm currently starting from zero.\n\nHas anyone else felt like they were \"starting over\" in the middle of their degree? How do you deal with the slow progress and the feeling that you'll never catch up?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice on how to manage this workload or how to change my mindset so I can stop feeling like a failure.\n",

So far, most of what I’ve learned has been frontend-related (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some React concepts). The problem is… I’ve slowly realized that I really don’t enjoy frontend work.\n\nI don’t like dealing with UI, layout, styling, or making things “look nice.” I find it frustrating and draining. What I do enjoy is logic, problem-solving, data handling, and figuring out how things work behind the scenes. Deep down, I feel more drawn to backend development.\n\nNow I’m stuck mentally because: I’ve already invested around a year in TOP I don’t want to feel like I “wasted” that time I’m thinking of shifting toward backend-focused learning (maybe Python, APIs, databases, etc.)\n\nSo my questions are:\n\nIs this a normal realization?\n\nIs my frontend knowledge from TOP still useful if I move to backend?\n\nWould switching to backend now be a mistake, or is it better than forcing myself to continue frontend?\n\nIf you were in my position, what would you do?\n\nI’d really appreciate honest advice, especially from people who disliked frontend but found their place elsewhere.\n\nThanks!\n\nTL;DR: 1 year into TOP, realized I hate frontend and prefer backend logic.

I guess I have some questions on it as a whole, firstly: for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class? Coming from python I keep  defaulting to a dictionary, but there it's extremely simple to initialize one with whatever key value pairs I need, whereas in c# the statement is so complex I wonder if it's because objects with more than just a string-number or string-string pairs are meant to be classes. Also, I read that classes are faster in execution.\n\nSecondly, I guess I've been struggling to explain the need for all the explicit type declarations and other things that to a beginner seem more complicated than they need to be. Like, it was very complicated in VS to just figure out how to run the script I created, having to choose a debugger and running console commands to get there. What do you do if you want to test a snippet of one script in isolation? Also, I had a class script in the same namespace as the main one, but its class wasn't being recognized. Eventually I noticed the class script was in a different subfolder of the project, so I moved it and it worked fine. But what's the point of a namespace if the file still needs to be in the same directory... \n\nI imagine all these details are for good reasons, so wanted to ask some experts haha",

Because of that, I’m wondering whether deeply learning JavaScript and full-stack development is still worth it in the long run.\n\nOn top of that, one of my relatives suggested a different path. They believe that learning Python and moving into areas like GenAI, machine learning, or understanding how models and agents work (even at a high level) could make it easier to get a job compared to being “just another full-stack developer,” since the market seems saturated.\n\nSo now I’m confused about a few things:\n\n* Should I continue focusing on full-stack development and deeply learn JavaScript?\n* Should I start learning Python and pivot toward GenAI / ML?\n* Is it realistic to rely on AI tools without understanding the fundamentals deeply?\n* As a fresher, which path is more future-proof?\n\nI’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through this or are already working in the industry.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello guys,\n\nI'm spending my Christmas week brushing up on my C and I decided to go back to source material : ie Kernighan & Ritchie. Probably one of the best programming book I've read so far. Clear and concise (most of the time...).\n\nAnd even if there are sometimes sometimes some example that require you to spend a few minutes studying the code, you usually have been provided with the tools to understand them.\n\nHowever I'm having trouble understanding one line of their code example for function pointers. Here's the code :\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    \n    #define MAXLINE 5000     /* max #lines to be sorted */\n    char *lineptr[MAXLINES]  /* pointer to text lines */\n    \n    int readlines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);\n    void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);\n    \n    void qsort(void *lineptr[], int left, int right,\n                  int (*comp)(void *, void *));\n    int numcomp(char *, char *);\n    \n    /* sort input lines */\n    main (int argc, char *argv[])\n    {\n      int nlines;          /* number of input lines read */\n      int numeric;         /* 1 if numeric sort */\n    \n      if(argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], \"-n\") == 0)\n        numeric = 1;\n      if((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) >= 0){\n        qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1,\n          (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));\n        writelines(lineptr, nlines);\n        return 0;\n      } else {\n        printf(\"input too big to sort\\n\");\n        return 1;\n      }\n    }\n\nand here is the line I'm having trouble with :\n\n    qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1,\n          (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));\n\nI understand that the last argument to qsort is a function pointer allowing you to customize the behaviour of the sorting algorithm. That pointer needs to point to a function that take 2 pointers to void as argument and returns an int.  \nI also understand that this part : **(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp)** is used to chose between the function **numcmp** and **strcmp** depending on if the **numeric** flag is set to 0 or not.\n\nThe book tells us that using a function name like this (without parentheses) in a expression evaluates to the addresses of the functions, a bit like using & for variable name or using the name of an array.  \nAnd so far, when passing a pointer as an argument to a function, we've been able to write **function(&variable);** as in **scanf(\"%d\", &count);**\n\nSo what's going on with **(int (\\*)(void\\*,void\\*))** just before ? Is that type casting because the functions **numcmp** and **strcmp** are declared to take pointer to char as arguments?  \nI think it is, but the book say nothing about it and the syntax is cryptic at best. I hope one of you guys could shed some lights on it.\n\nMerry Christmas and all the best to you all. ",

This summer, I got interested in software development and started self-studying Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I really enjoyed it and decided to pursue a tech career.\n\nI got admitted to UNT for a traditional Computer Science degree, but financially it’s not feasible for me. Collin College offers a Bachelor of Applied Technology in Software Development, which is more workforce-focused than a CS degree. The program covers software development fundamentals, includes a capstone project, and has lighter math requirements. Essentially, it gives the skills needed for a software development career.\n\nMy main concern is if employers will view this degree the same as a traditional CS degree? I’ve read that a CS degree is considered the “gold standard,” but I’ve also heard otherwise. I’m lucky to be able to pursue school debt-free with VA benefits and family support, so I’m trying to make the most practical choice.\n\nWould appreciate feedback or advice. Do you think this degree will open the same doors as a CS degree?",

        "content": "<rant>\n\nTo business owners and leaders everywhere:\n\nKeeping on call shifts is such an antiquated 1980s way of doing things in the tech world. Yet business leaders just don’t get it and still cling to that philosophy as “something that works”, so they can save a buck.\n\nIt’s called hiring a night shift, people. \n\nIf you’re going to take on customers with 24/7 operations, guess what that means for your overhead? Yup, you’re going to have to pay to staff your company to be able to handle 24/7 operations, not just expect your day shift people to handle it all at night and still come in and work a full shift the next day on fumes. \n\nHire an IRC and set it up. Staff it with good technical people. \n\nExpecting day shift people to be machines and handle night shift stuff with barely any extra pay or using “duties as assigned” as your excuse not to pay extra for it, is the fastest way to lose staff and lose your company and end up drowning in lawsuits.\n\nIf you’re gonna refuse to do that, then you better be prepared to pay out the nose to your day shift folks to expect them to wake up in the middle of the night or interrupt a family moment to fix someone’s stupidity. Stop cheaping out and expecting not to have to pay extra for it, then whining about turnover. \n\n<\\rant>",

After some brief chatting, they asked me to complete a take-home assignment to go ahead with the recruitment process. This is the link to said take home challenge: [https://bitbucket.org/brain0xlab/challenge/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/brain0xlab/challenge/src/master/)\n\nIt all seemed a bit suspcious and I wanted to check the repo out before cloning it and opening it myself.\n\nThis repository contains a vscode auto run task: [https://bitbucket.org/brain0xlab/challenge/src/master/.vscode/tasks.json](https://bitbucket.org/brain0xlab/challenge/src/master/.vscode/tasks.json) <- This is a HUGE red flag.\n\nThis task, through several layers of indirection, effectively downloads a stringified obfuscated JS script disguised as a json file from this link: [https://api.npoint.io/3b0e9f7bfcd85cc9e77d](https://api.npoint.io/3b0e9f7bfcd85cc9e77d)\n\nThe JSON is downloaded via a \"env.js\" file downloaded from here (WARNING: malware script host): https://vscode-settings-bootstrap\\[dot\\]vercel\\[dot\\]app/settings/env?flag=306 (replace the dots with actual dots)\n\nYou'll likely need to use curl -L or something to actually download it. This vscode-settings-bootstrap is likely hosted by the malware creators as this is the website hosting the actual malware stuff primarily. npoint is sort of just a general service.\n\nNotice how the env.js file downloads the malware script containing json from npoint, extracts the obfuscated js from the cookie field and runs it.\n\nI have not managed to gather more information about the malware script itself. I know it reads a bunch of system information, reads credentials from filesystem (e.g ssh private keys) and tries to upload them to some domain. I sorta gave up figuring out what domain it is since the script does A LOT of useless work to waste cpu cycles and my virtualbox was simply taking too long to get to the meaty part.\n\nI have reported the linked in profile and bitbucket repo.",

Bought a small cheap house in 2004 so my mortgage is now less than rent on a 1 bedroom apartment. Invested myself. Stock market has gone crazy since 2012. The 2000s were a dead decade and the market was flat. I went through 2 major bear markets. I got laid off or had a contract end 7 times in my 25 year \"career\". I dont really consider this a career.\n\nI was self taught. I got a useless political science degree in the 1990s. I was waiting tables. I took a coding bootcamp back in 2000. Took 1000s of resumes to get a job. I offered to work 80 hours/week to get my first job and did. Since the economy blew up right when I was starting out in tech. I am in the DC area so government contracting saved me.\n\nI don't think bootcamp will work today. I went back to school at night and got a Masters in Software Engineering while I was working.\n\nGlad I saved my money. I get crippling back pain there are few remote jobs. I have issues with my feet and will need another surgery on both of my feet. Using screens this long has caused really dry eye. I use eye drops all day long. So glad I saved my money. My dad got laid off about my age in the early 2000s and he was out of work for over 3 years. Its tough as you get older. He was in telecom and it was more dead in the 2000s than tech is today.\n\nNot sure what I am going to do. Travel is a problem for medical issues. I don't want to discuss my medical issues. Trying to start a diet. Increase my walking ,but that is tough to do in the cold. I live in Northern Virginia. Going to read more. Might see if there are any lonely housewives around I can keep busy. I am kidding.",

I'd appreciate any insights. I'm leaning towards selling 90% and holding 10%, but if there are better strategies I can consider, open to hearing from folks about that, too. \n\nP.S.

I'm 38 now so I'm not young anymore but I still have to work since I can't retire.\n\nI've always considered myself as average intelligence for a software engineer with a very strong work ethic. This often got me noticed and promoted at the companies I've worked for. Technically, there are usually a few engineers on the team that are better than me.\n\nInterviews were never easy back then for me but I always felt like the jobs were given to me since my experience was great. I would typically talk about my projects and then do some whiteboarding problem where it felt like I was working alongside the interviewer. I think I've had probably 8 interviews in my entire life and got a no offer on 3 of them until recently.\n\nEver since my layoffs, I've failed probably 5 interviews in the first or second round. The furthest I got was 5 rounds(they wanted a few more rounds and I could tell they were not super enthusiastic about me). The interviews seem a lot more toxic recently with interviewers asking me questions like \"what value can you bring if AI can do those things?\" With all these things, I stopped looking for a tech job completely and found a  part-time retail job.\n\nI'm fortunate enough to have a small savings and the part-time retail job is slowing down my burn. I'm trying to break away from tech right now and find any career worth getting into where I can afford a family in the future ($20/hr in retail is very hard to make work for a single person). I have a year or two to figure something out.\n\nI spend some of my free time at the library just reading to get ideas on where I can go but I feel so lost. Here are some options I'm thinking about:\n\n**1. Grind leetcode, study AI/design, work on interview skills and keep interviewing until I find a tech job.**\n\n*Pros:*  \n*- Clear objectives*  \n*- Good pay*  \n*- Job is interesting for the most part*\n\n*Cons:*  \n*- Layoffs still on the table*  \n*- Extremely difficult to get an offer (I dont even know what to study since questions are so random)*  \n*- I really do not want to grind leetcode anymore*\n\n**2. Change careers**\n\n*Pros:*  \n*- Fresh start and something that aligns better with my values*  \n*- Maybe better work-life balance than eng (tradeoff with lower pay is fine)*\n\n*Cons:*  \n*- Have to do some soul-searching to find next career*  \n*- Probably difficult to switch careers*  \n*- Most jobs are probably slower and less mentally stimulating*\n\n**3. Start a business**\n\n*Pros:*  \n*- Be your own boss (kinda not really)*  \n*- No leetcode*\n\n*Cons:*  \n*- Hard grind that requires all your focus and dedication*   \n*- I prefer more stability*\n\nWith those 3 options, I'm leaning towards changing careers. The starting a business is something I think about a lot but it's not something I can just pull out of nowhere. The thought of going back into tech gives me anxiety through the roof. Unfortunately, I dont know what careers I can change into. The general field people around reddit have been proposing are the HVAC/therapist/nursing variety.\n\nI'm feeling lost right now and just wanted to air some thoughts out. Thanks for reading. Would love any thoughts or stories/experiences on how people are navigating this.",

When I was interning, there was another entry developer that stayed on for around two years but left due to no promotion (they said he kinda sucked delivery wise).\n\nI am told I do good work and meet expectations, I expect a promotion this year after a year of work post grad. But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. We have little to no documentation. So anytime I am introduced to new tech or systems, my seniors really do hand hold me, to which I am appreciative of. I am not the type that asks the same questions over and over, I just need to see it once throughly and I can replicate what they've taught me.\n\nThe problem is, after a year of this siloed style of work, I am getting burnt out. I can not stand coding. There have been multiple occasions for multiple projects where I have stayed at work alone and extremely late, staying until 8-10pm, just typing away at my computer. Recently I have been tasked with developing an entire web app alone. It's functionality seems simple but no application meant for production is ever simple. We are understaffed, so there is nobody else to divy up project tasks with. I've asked if we have any plans to get more entry hires on the team and it is always met with a soft no, the company is on a hiring freeze, economy yada yada.\n\nI talk with my friends from uni who are all working. Their teams practice agile and scrum philosophies, and their coding tasks are divided up for multipe team members. They love their jobs. Their eyes bulge when I tell them about my work load and my work effort. I always feel unfortunate when I hear about how lucky they have been, but really, it sounds like those types of tech teams are the standard and I am the unlucky one to have landed in an underdeveloped team. Senior developers can afford to ignore a team dynamic like this and still be successful in it.\n\nIn my eyes, saying that this is too much work is basically telling them I am not up for the job and I might as well quit honestly. I know I can handle it, I mean I am meeting their latest expectation for an entire web application on my own, but I do not want to handle this anymore. It used to make me so happy to run an application and see the results of my hard work in action, but I genuinely can't even stand opening visual studio anymore.\n\nWith how bad the job market is, I am scared to walk away. But I know if I continue to eat my feelings about this, I might turn impulsive and quit without any plan for my career or cut ties in a bad way. I don't want to fall into a slump.",

However, my team’s scope of work has become smaller recently, supporting UX Design Systems for our product. I did this type of work earlier in my career and I’m not that excited about it. I’m also fighting for scope with a peer manager. My product area is pretty high pressure with 50-60 hour work weeks, but it’s predictable and stable. It’s highly unlikely I’ll be promoted any time soon.\n\nGiven this situation I’m thinking about changing teams and moving into a more exploratory team that works on AI applied to concept product features and tries to get AI features into production. This seems more interesting, but I’d have to give up my manager role and go back to being an IC. I know several people on this new team, including the new manager and they all seem great. However, concept product features seem risky in a time when companies are trying to monetize as much as possible. There’s also no guarantee that I’ll be able to be a manager again on this new team.\n\nMore context, I’m 46 and hope to stay working in tech until I’m 55.

I already go in and prepare myself that my lunch will only last 5 minutes. What can I actually say to end the meeting without creating an awkward situation? How can I set the tone in advance so that it doesn't come to that painful moment when everyone asks, “Well... anything else?”",

        "content": "I came across a detailed guide shared by people who have cleared ML Engineer interviews at different companies and found it helpful to share. The process varies by company, but the core skills are consistent across big tech and startups.\n\nAbout the ML Engineer Interview Process:\n\nML Engineer interviews typically include 4 to 6 rounds a virtual screen which has coding + ML basics, followed by onsite or virtual loops with coding. Expect 45 to 60 min sessions, often with live coding in a shared doc or whiteboard for design. Companies like Meta and Google emphasize productionizing models, while others focus on specific domains.\n\nPREPARATION:\n\n● Python is the main language that I use for programming.\n\n● Additionally, I am very good at the most common Machine Learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit learn, TensorFlow etc.\n\n● The basic machine learning concepts are that I know supervised and unsupervised learning methods.\n\n● I can evaluate models using several metrics.\n\n● I understand overfitting versus underfitting and the relationship between bias and variance.\n\n● I also understand the differences between regression and classification models.\n\n\n\nMy preparation was based on these courses:\n\n1.) Coursera AI of Everyone/ Deeplearning AI: Machine Learning Engineering for Production by Andrew Ng Concentrates on turning ML systems into real world applications, covering data pipelines, deployment, monitoring, and scaling necessary for ML Engineer positions, putting an emphasis on the real-world systems.\n\n2.) Fast ai: Practical Deep Learning A Hands on, code first method to building state of the art models quickly, very good for gaining practical intuition and confidence in implementing deep learning solutions from scratch.\n\n3.) Stanford CS229/CS230: Gives rigorous, university level depth in machine learning theory and deep learning that is excellent for the understanding of derivations and advanced topics that may come up in technical discussions.\n\n4.) LogicMojo AI & ML Interview Preparation Course: Focused specifically on machine learning interview preparation, with practice problems, ML system design patterns, and commonly asked interview questions. It helps for project development for interviews.\n\n\n\nMOVING ONTO THE PRACTICE AFTER THEORY:\n\nPractice coding without an IDE use Google Docs or plain editor to simulate interviews. Focus on implementing ML algorithms from scratch or debugging production issues.\n\nGreat platforms for practice:\n\n● LeetCode - ML tagged + general coding\n\n● Kaggle competitions for end to end projects\n\n● [Interviewing.io](http://Interviewing.io) or Pramp for mocks\n\n\n\nFAQs Asked:\n\n1. Basic machine learning\n2. Model evaluation & metrics\n3. Feature engineering & selection\n4. Recommendation systems.\n5. Convolutional neural networks for vision, normal language transformation transformers for NLP.\n6. Scaling ML distributed training, data parallelism\n7. Production issues\n8. ML system design\n9. Coding: Implement linear regression, k-means, decision trees from scratch; PyTorch or TF basics\n\nThis GitHub repo on Machine Learning Interviews is a solid checklist covering fundamentals to production topics.\n\n\n\nDURING THE INTERVIEW ASK YOURSELF:\n\n1. Do you feel confident explaining ML concepts clearly?\n2. Can you clarify problem requirements and ask good questions?\n3. Are you capable of delineating the whole Machine Learning system by talking about data, features, models, evaluation, deployment, and trade-offs?\n4. Is your code neat, effective, and without any error?\n5. Have you thought about real world constraints?\n6. Can you draw from past projects and experiences effectively?\n\nAll the best! ML roles are in high demand and consistent practice on projects, mocks, and designs will get you there. If you are targeting specific companies, tailor to their products. Good luck",

What I’m thinking more about is long-term growth and learning.\n\nI chose the startup because I saw a lot of potential in the leadership team, both in their technical depth and in how they think about building the company. I’d love to hear how others have evaluated this tradeoff earlier in their careers and what’s mattered most for their growth.",

I’m comfortable with low-latency concepts (OS, architecture) as well (though still learning a lot I enjoy rust and recently enjoying C++ too), so I have a mixed skill set.\n\nI’m now reflecting on direction: I’m drawn to QR and QD roles, but QR often requires a PhD. I was advised I could succeed in QT with some improvements, but I feel more aligned with research or dev work.\n\nGiven different skill sets required, what path should I focus on? Can I reapply next year despite rejections this year? I’d appreciate on how to best position myself going forward.",

        "author": "kovanroad",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm currently working with a manager who is very senior in our organization, very experienced, intelligent, etc., but he has a few traits that can be challenging. I'd like try o figure out ways to deal with these / overcome rather than give up / leave, for now.\n\nI myself am a senior, experienced engineer, we both have decades of experience, relatively successful careers.\n\nThe challenge with working with him, though, is that its like \\_he\\_ has a difficult time working autonomously. \n\nAs examples... he'll write a library for some good in principle idea of his, generally with an ambitious and elaborate implementation, a few ok unit tests, etc... then ask me to integrate some applications with that library. Fair enough. After I do that, he'll look at the integrated application+library combo, say it's not working as expected... and that its basically my job to diagnose/troubleshoot the whole combination. If I ask, well, has this library functionality been tested, has it \\_ever worked\\_, generally the answer is no. Now, sure, it is \\_possible\\_ for me to take over and figure out what's wrong with his library, but it's kind of inefficient, since its all fresh in his head, and I'm coming at it from it uninitiated, so maybe it's a few days work just to figure out how it's \\_supposed\\_ to work., etc.\n\nOther examples are, there are tasks assigned to me, I do them, send a PR, he approves the PR, I put the PR in a weekly status update, the ticket gets updated and closed... then a few weeks later, he'll be like \"what happened with ticket 1234? did that get ever get done? was it lost, i don't see it when running the app\". I do some basic looking around... turns out the app has been rolled back to an older version by someone else in the team. It's frustrating, though, because that would be pretty trivial for him to look into via either email, the ticket system, looking at the app version, asking other people in the team, etc etc... but he chats straight to me like drop everything, work got lost, etc.. which can be disruptive.\n\nOverall, I feel like, if I had junior-ish developer reporting to me that started out like this, that would be ok, but I'd be focusing strongly on getting them up to speed, self-sufficient, and past this stage over the first year or two, and if they didn't, I'd consider that to be a problem. Along the way, I'd be asking questions like \"What have you tried so far to diagnose this?\", \"Do you have everything you need to solve this kind of issue yourself in future, etc.\".\n\nOverall, it just feels like he is intelligent, but also kind of \"needy\", lacking in attention to detail, and ultimately that's going to stop us both from being able to do our best work, but it's kind of difficult dealing with this as the report rather than the manager in this situation. Ideas welcome!\n\n",

What ended up actually happening was that silently, about 1/3 of the employees were actually given c-shares/equity in the company.  It wasn't just by title (ie, managers and above).  It seemed to be almost arbitrary, perhaps based on some hidden merit or perceived importance to the company.  I only found out about it because of work I do with our legal team, so clearly this wasn't made public to the entire company.\n\nI am not sure how to feel about this.  Obviously, a privately held company can operate and do whatever they feel is best.  However, when one of the core values of the company is transparency and honesty, I find it disappointing and troubling that they would handle things in this way, creating two tiers of \"value\" amongst the employees.",

And some recent layoffs got me thinking about what if I had been let go. \n\nAnyways recently started learning python and planning to do some back end small projects to get the hang of it since I kind of enjoy web related stuff more, plus some leetcode practice. \n\nBut my question is when switching will I need to start over as Jr dev back end? Or maybe I could adapt my CV to land some mid level dev? Will my current experience be any useful for getting interviews or should I just try to start anew? \n\nDon't know if it matters but I'm still young it's just my second job, so I don't mind as much starting over, although if possible I guess I would like to at least for it to be a side grade.

I want to eventually transition into a full software developer role, but I don't know what I should start studying next. I'm not very good with UI/UX, so preferably I'd like to go into backend development.\n\nWhat I know:\n\n\n\nPython (libraries: Selenium, Pandas, FreeSimpleGUI)\n\nCisco Networking and Information Security (Was going to get a CCNA but I landed this job and it paid better than network jobs in my area)\n\n  \nWhat I used to know:\n\nC++ and C# (Was taught in college, totally forgot most of it but I still got the fundamentals down).\n\nHTML, CSS and SQL.\n\nMy projects:\n\n\n\nWeb scraping information from the company website & collecting that info in Excel.\n\nExtracting data from Word documents and PDF files then sorting and counting specific items, strings, data, that pop up.\n\n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.

        "content": "I did an unpaid internship early in my associates degree program and there was, quite literally, little to no mentorship. I get that the goal is to be productive and independent, but are there people here who had more accompanying and supportive mentorships when they didn’t know much? Is this just the price of entry? I’m just feeling discouraged moving forward into other internships and I’m not looking for a repeat of what happened. Especially in an unpaid environment. I didn’t get to make a single significant contribution to the code base or get any project done of any kind. I’m going for round 2, but what positive indicators should I look for in an internship I need to have 20/20 vision here and not end up knee deep in water. Thank you!",

Being an older student, I can’t really tolerate lounging around after I graduate to find a job at a lazy pace. I have to acquire one quickly or shift gears immediately. That said, I would appreciate some feedback on what getting your first job was like. Some ideas are:\n\n\\- stats (internship, GPA, other relevant)\n\n\\- how many applications it took and how long? Did you network or just slam out applications until you got an interview? Or something different?\n\n\\- interview details (technical, behavioral, networking?)\n\n\\- what year was this for you?\n\nReally looking for some in depth data here to help me realize if I’m cooked or just incredibly anxious and in a great spot.
