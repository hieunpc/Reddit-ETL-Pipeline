Right now I’m:\n\n* Learning Python properly (doing daily problems)\n* Building small personal projects in PySpark using Databricks to get stronger\n\nI keep seeing postings and talks about modern data platforms where Go (and later Rust) is used a lot for pipelines, Kafka tools, fast ingestion services, etc. \n\nMy questions as a complete beginner in this area:\n\n1. Is Go actually becoming a “must-have” or a strong “nice-to-have” for data engineers in the next few years, or can I get really far (and get good jobs) by just mastering Python + PySpark + SQL + Airflow/dbt?\n2. If it is worth learning, I can find hundreds of tutorials for Go basics, but almost nothing that teaches how to work with data in Go – reading/writing CSVs, Parquet, Avro, Kafka producers/consumers, streaming, back-pressure, etc. How did you learn the real “data engineering in Go” part?\n3. For someone still building their first PySpark projects, when is the realistic time to start Go without getting overwhelmed?\n\nI don’t want to distract myself too early, but I also don’t want to miss the train if Go is the next big thing for higher-paying / more interesting data platform roles.\n\nAny advice from people who started in Python/Spark and later added Go (or decided not to) would be super helpful. Thank you!",

        "author": "Dry-Woodpecker9626",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI have an extremely normalised dataset. Way more than I personally like. Imagine something like:\n\nmovie → version → presentation → external\\_ids\n\nBut none of the child tables store the movie\\_id. Everything is connected through these relationship tables, and you have to hop 3–4 tables to get anything meaningful.\n\nHere’s a small example:\n\n* movies(movie\\_id)\n* versions(version\\_id)\n* presentations(pres\\_id)\n* external\\_ids(ext\\_id)  \n\nRelationship goes\n\nMovie → version → presentation → external\\_id\n\nI am trying to achieve a denormalised version of this table, like smaller data marts, which makes my life easier for sharing the data downstream. This is just one of the examples; my goal is to create smaller such data marts, so it is easier for me to join on this ID later to get the data I need for downstream consumers\n\nA normal full query is fine —  \nExample\n\n    SELECT \n    m.movie_id,\n    v.version_id, \n    p.pres_id, \n    e.value\n    FROM movies m\n    JOIN movie_to_version mv ON m.movie_id = mv.movie_id\n    JOIN versions v ON mv.version_id = v.version_id\n    JOIN version_to_pres vp ON v.version_id = vp.version_id\n    JOIN presentations p ON vp.pres_id = p.pres_id\n    JOIN pres_to_external pe ON p.pres_id = pe.pres_id\n    JOIN external_ids e ON pe.ext_id = e.ext_id;\n\n  \n\n\nThe actual pain is incremental loading. Like, let’s say something small changes in external\\_ids. The row with ext\\_id = 999 has been updated.\n\nI’d have to basically walk backwards:\n\next → pres → version → movie\n\nThis is just a sample example, in reality, I have more complex cascading joins, I am currently looking at in future around 100 tables to join, not all together, just in all, to create smaller denormalised tables, which I can later use as an intermediate silver layer to create my final gold layer.\n\nAlso, I need to send incremental changes updated to the downstream database as well, that's another pain in the ass.\n\nI’ve thought about:\n\n– just doing the reverse join logic inside every dimension (sounds nasty)  \n– maintaining some lineage table like child\\_id → movie\\_id  \n– or prebuilding a flattened table that basically stores all the hops, so the downstream tables don’t have to deal with the graph\n\nBut honestly, I don’t know if I’m overcomplicating it or missing some obvious pattern. We’re on Spark + S3 + Glue Iceberg.\n\nAnyway, has anyone dealt with really normalised, multi-hop relationship models in Spark and managed to make incremental ETL sane?\n\n",

So I built a real time streaming pipeline on it.\n\nIt ingests live flight data from the OpenSky API (open source and free to use) and pushes it through this data stack: Kafka, Iceberg, DuckDB, Dagster, and Metabase, all running on Kubernetes via Minikube. \n\nHere is the GitHub repo: https://github.com/vijaychhatbar/flight-club-data/tree/main\n\nI’ve tried to orchestrate the infrastructure through Taskfile - which uses helmfile approach to deploy all services on minikube. Technically, it should also work on any K8s flavour. All the charts are custom made which can be tailored as per our needs. I found this deployment process to be extremely elegant for managing any K8s apps. :) \n\nAt a high level, a producer service calls the OpenSky REST API every ~30 seconds, publishes the raw JSON (converted to Avro) into Kafka, and a consumer writes that stream into Apache Iceberg tables which also has schema registry for evolution.\n\nI never used dagster before, so I tried to use it to make transformation tables. Also, it uses DuckDB for fast analytic queries. A better approach would be to use dbt on it - but that is something for later.\n\nI’ve then used a custom Dockerfile for Metabase to add DuckDB support as the official ones don’t have native DuckDB connection. Technically, you can query directly Iceberg realtime table - which I did to make realtime dashboard in Metabase.\n\nI hope this project might be helpful for people who want to learn or tinker with a realistic, end‑to‑end streaming + data lake setup on their own hardware, rather than just hello-world examples. \n\nLet me know your thoughts on this.

Recently, we had a dispute with the org dba because he uses SSIS and refused to implement ci/cd, as the entire process right now is manual and frankly very cumbersome . In fact when I brought it up he said that doesn’t exist for SSIS and then I had to say that it existed since 2012 with the project deployment model.  This surprised the dba’s boss and it’s fair to say that the dba probably does not like me right now. I will say that I have brought this up to him privately before and he ignored me so my boss decided for us to meet with his boss. I did not try to create drama but make a suggestion to make the prod deployment process smoother.\n\nAnyway that happened and now there are discussions for me to maybe just get my own database since the dba doesn’t want to improve systems.  I  am aware of data engineers sometimes managing databases also but wanted to know what that is like.  Does it make the job significantly harder or easier? now you understand more and have end to end control so that sounds like a benefit but it is more work.  Anything that I should watch out for while managing a database aside from grants users only the needed permissions?\n\nAlso one interesting thing to me would be what roles do you have in your database if you have one?

People need to be able to ask natural language questions and get answers based on a variety of data sources.\n\nWe use snowflake, and this month the snowflake hosted MCP server became general access. Today I started playing around, created a 'semantic view', a 'cortex analyst', and a 'cortex agent', and was able to get it all up and running in a day or so on small piece of our data. It seems reasonably good and I like the organization of the semantic view especially, but I'm skeptical that it ever gets to a point where the answers it provides are 100% trustworthy.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions or experience using snowflake for this stuff? Or experience doing production text to SQL type things for internal tools? Main concern right now is that AI  will inevitably be wrong a decent percent of the time and is just not going to mix well with people who don't know how to verify its answers or sense when it's making shit up.",

So that is why I rely on reddit for technical questions like this.  I think enough time has elapsed since it happened, so I'm hoping the reason has become common knowledge by now.  (.. although the explanation is not known to me yet).\n\n  \nWhy did Microsoft kill their Spark on Kubernetes (HDInsight on AKS)?  I had once tested the preview and it seemed like a very exciting innovation.  Now it is a year later and I'm waiting five mins for a sluggish \"custom Spark pool\" to be initialized on Fabric, and I can't help but think that Microsoft BI folks have really lost their way!\n\n  \nI totally understand that Microsoft can get higher margins by pushing their \"Fabric\" SaaS at the expense of their PaaS services like HDI.  However I think that building HDI on AKS was a great opportunity to innovate with containerized Spark.  Once finished, it may have been an even more compelling and cost-effective than Spark on Databricks!  And eventually they could have shared the technology with their downstream SaaS products like Fabric, for the sake of their lower-code users as well!\n\nDoes anyone understand this?  Was it just a cost-cutting measure because they didn't see a path to profitability?  ",

Until now all sources are structured data\n\n**- Size:** <10MB for everything and about 10-12K (maybe 15k 'til end of the year) lines  summing all tables\n\n**- Current Approach:** gather everything on Power BI, making ingestion (full load), \"storage\", schemas and else there.\n\n**- Main bottleneck:** it takes 1+ hour to refresh both fact tables\n\n**- Desired Outcome:** to use a data ingestion tool for the API calls (at least twice a month), to use a transformation tool, a proper storage (Postgre SQL for example) and then display the info on PBI\n\nWhat would you recommend? I'm considering a data ingestion tool (erathos) + databricks for this project, but I'm afraid it may be too much for few data and also somewhat costly in the long term.\n\n  \n**Project 2:**\n\n**- The source:** An ERP's API (REST) where I extract 4/5 dim tables and 1 fact table + 2 other PDF sources (requiring RAG). So both structured and unstructured data\n\n**- Size:** data size is unknown yet but I suppose that there'll be 100k+ lines summing all tables, considering their current excel sheets\n\n**- Current Approach:** there is no approach yet, but I'd do the same as project 1 with what I know so far\n\n**- Desired Outcome:** same as project 1\n\nWhat would you recommend? I'm considering the same idea for project 1.\n\n  \nSorry if it's a little confusing... if it needs more context let me know.",

        "author": "Crazy-Sir5935",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\n  \nN00b alert! \n\nWe are planning to do a proof of concept and one of the things we want to improve is that currently, we just ingest data directly from our source systems into our staging tables (without decoupling). For reference, we load data on a daily basis, operate in a heavily regulated sector and some of our source systems endpoint only provide batch/full loads (as they do tend to offer CDC on their end points but it only tracks 50% of the attributes making it kind of useless).\n\nIn our new setup we are considering the following:\n\n1. Every extraction gets saved in the source/extraction format (thus JSON or .parquet).\n2. The extracted files get stored for atleast 3 months before being moved to cold storage (JSON is not that efficient so i guess that will save us some money).\n3. Everything gets transformed to .parquet\n4. .parquet files will be stored forever (this is relative but you know what i mean).\n5. We will make a folder structure for each staging table based on year, month, day etc.\n\n  \nSo now you understand that we will work with .parquet files. \n\nWe were considering the new method of append only/snapshot tables (maybe combine it with  SC2) as then we could easily load the whole thing again if we mess up and fill in the valid from/valid to dates on basis of a loop. \n\nYet, a couple of our endpoints cause us to have some limitations. Let's consider the following example:\n\n1. The source system table logs hours a person logs on a project.\n2. The data goes back to 2015 and has approximately \\~12 mln. records.\n3. A person can adjust hours going a year back from now (or other columns in the table in the source system).\n4. The system has audit fields so we could only take changed rows but this only works for 5 out of 20 columns thereby forcing us to do batch loads on a daily basis for a full year back (as we need to be sure to be 100% correct).\n5. The result is that, after the initial extraction, each day we have a file with logging hours for the last 365 days.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. We looked at the snapshot method, but even not looking at the files, this would result in 12 mln records per day added? I'm surely no expert but even with partitioning, this doesn't sound very durable after a year?\n2. Considering SCD2 for a staging table in this case. How can we approach a scenario in which we would need to rebuild the entire table? As most daily loads consider the last 365 days and approximately 1 million rows, this would be hell of a loop (and i don't want to know how long it's going to take). Would it in this case make sense to make delta parquet's specifically for this scenario so you end up with like 1000 rows a file and making such a scenario easier?\n\nWe need to be able to pull out 1 PK and see the changes in time for that specific PK without seeing thousands of duplicate rows, that's why we need SCD2 (as f.e. iceberg only shows the  whole table in a point of time).  \n\nThanks in advance for reading this mess.

Got a verbal offer for a Data Engineer II role doing Python/PySpark, Databricks, ADF pipelines, ingestion, and medallion architecture, but the role sits fully in the data/analytics org, not engineering, and pays $105–115K (I currently make ~$180K TC in NYC).\nTrying to figure out whether this DE role meaningfully helps me pivot into SWE/back-end engineering longterm, or if it’s better to stay in my current job, finish MCIT, build projects, and target SWE directly. Looking for input from DEs/SWEs on how transferable this work is, whether the comp is normal for NYC, and what questions I should ask before deciding.\n\n\nHey everyone, I’m looking for some candid input from folks in data engineering and software engineering.\n\nI’m currently in a strategy/operations role at a tech company while working through the MCIT program (Penn’s CS master’s for career switchers). My long term goal is to be a SWE. I recently interviewed for a Data Engineer II position at a healthcare tech company, and im trying to evaluate whether this role would be a good stepping stone to SWE or if I should just leverage my degree and build projects to make the switch. \n\nI’d appreciate any honest advice or experience people have.\n\nHere are the key details:\n\nBackground / motivation\n* I’ve worked strategy consulting and it has led to a good paying career but I don’t care about strategy in all honesty. I dislike the politics to get promoted, work is quite boring where im learning nothing new\n* I like consulting in the fact that I had to learn a new industry everyday, but TBH I couldn’t deal with 15-16hr workdays just to learn more\n* I love the technical side and building things which is why I considered SWE about a year and a half ago (I just expected the market to be better by then lolz)  \n\nComp\n* Base salary: $105–115K (Remote but I live in NYC)\n* Other factors are TBD as I haven’t gotten the formal letter yet, just verbal and what the job description outlines\n* I currently make 155k base and TC ~180k so it would be a pay cut for this role\n\nTeam / Org Structure\n* The role sits in the data - analytics org, not the software engineering org\n* DEs partner with analytics engineers, ML/data consumers, data scientists\n* I would not be in the analytics engineering track or an analyst, but they would be my stakeholders\n* No direct SWE involvement as far as I can tell\n\nTech + Responsibilities\n* Mostly Python + PySpark on Databricks\n* AWS and Azure\n* Both streaming and batch pipelines\n* Medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers)\n* ADF wiring + pipeline orchestration\n* File ingestion + transformations + schema enforcement\n* Some framework or pipeline component building, but unclear how deep the engineering side goes\n* Not much SQL involved, which surprised me, but they emphasized if they were asking for SQL it would be for more analysts vs engineers\n\n\nMy goals / questions:\nMy ultimate target is a technical heavy role that still pays well, like SWE or backend, but I’m also open to becoming a stronger DE if it meaningfully raises my chances of SWE transitioning.\n\nAny insights on the following would be helpful:\n1. Does this sound like a DE role with strong engineering exposure that can help facilitate a SWE transition? \n2. How transferable is this experience toward SWE or backend engineering later?\n3. For those who started in DE and moved into SWE, what allowed that transition?\n4. Is $105–115K base realistic for NYC in a mid-level DE role, or does that seem low?\n5. Would you take this role if your long-term goal leaned more toward SWE?\n6. Anything I should ask the hiring manager or my internal referrer to get more clarity?\nI’m not trying to bash the role or Data engineering, I’m genuinely trying to understand if this would meaningfully advance my pivot or if im better off staying in my current role and continuing to work on transitioning directly. Any honest input from experienced DEs or SWEs would really help. Thanks!",

On top of that, being new means I don't have the experience to be able to accurately tell whether something is hard or easy, which made things even more obviously dumb.\n\nAnd NOW I finally realize that, all I had to do was first cover the base case scenarios (like learning how to build a basic page that navigates around other pages) and then come up with something that I want to build, and start stumbling around 99% of the time trying to figure out how to build it. Obviously that would mean spending more time googling, reading articles, stackoverflow etc. than actually writing code. Duh! It's the first time I do most of the things required.\n\nSo you think at this point \"okay bro, now you know how people learn by building projects and connecting the dots to make functional software, congrats\".

Because that's what following the 10th tutorial in a row is about: Consuming the solution to problems someone else stumbled onto, in order to feel like you're making progress fast.\n\nI'm such an idiot.

Are there other fields I could realistically switch to at this stage? Should I try to push through the degree and improve my skills/grades, or would it make more sense to change majors or pursue a different career path? I’m also open to short-term actions I could take now — for example: internships, vocational courses, coding bootcamps, portfolio-building for art, career counseling, or other options I might not know about.\n\nAny practical advice, personal experiences, or resources (websites, books, programs) would be greatly appreciated.

I keep making mistakes that, to me at least, feel *so logical* at the time. Sometimes I even check in code with comments in Git that, in hindsight, are clearly wrong.\n\nWhen I get an assignment, I try to tackle it, but I often end up stuck. After finally figuring it out (usually with loads of help), I feel mad at myself because the solution ends up being “so easy” once you see it. This makes me question whether I’m actually a valuable addition to the team.\n\nI know I’m learning, and I know mistakes are part of the process—but it’s hard not to feel like I’m constantly failing, even when I put in a lot of effort. I feel like im not even able anymore to solve problems. When I get a assignment im scared to just try it and play around because I dont wanna see stupid or I dont wanna add stupid things to the codebase (even tho its a feature branch)\n\nHas anyone else felt like this as a junior dev? How do you cope with these feelings and start trusting your own abilities more?",

Code reviews they give me are very helpful, I learn a lot from it.\n\nBut I feel like everything takes too much time, that any coworker would do better and faster and I feel everyone is watching, one day they will call me to the office and tell me they notice how slow and dumb I am and fire me. Now I have task with another context switch (different repo, different structure, different everything - I switched from django app and database to no-sql models and indexing and I have to perform some complicated filtering (bug was discovered by me and coworker made a point which gave me the right direction).\nAnd I feel dumb. I probably have solution already (I know how to solve that bug, coworker just told me I should perform this in the different place of the service chain which makes sense to me now) and I am working on it, but I just feel dumb.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey,  \nI’ve been building my REST API and recently stumbled upon a design problem. I’m working on an app for managing a car repair shop. I currently have a few routes, such as:\n\n* `/api/clients`\n* `/api/cars`\n* `/api/car`\n* `/api/jobs-histories` (where we store each car’s repair history)\n\nRecently, my frontend developer asked me to create an endpoint that would allow him to **send a client and a car in a single request**, and also to **fetch a client and their car in a single request**. Now I’m wondering how to handle this in a RESTful way.\n\nI’ve considered several options, but none of them seem ideal:\n\n1. Allow passing a car object to the `/clients` route so that both objects are created together. But this feels wrong because the operation is supposed to create only a client, not a client and a car.\n2. Introduce a new route like `/api/registration`. But the name feels misleading, and creating a new representation for every such scenario seems odd.\n3. Add some kind of action endpoint like `/api/client/with-car`, but this looks like an anti-pattern since verbs should not appear in REST endpoints.\n4. Create a generic actions/transactions endpoint like `/api/actions` or `/api/transactions` and put things like `/api/actions/client-with-car` under it. But this also feels like an anti-pattern.\n\nDo you have any tips on which approach I should take? What is the correct way to solve this in a RESTful manner?\n\n\n\n  \nUPDATE:\n\nHey guys, I think I’ve found a way to address this. Thanks for all the answers.\n\nThe frontend needed this additional query mostly for convenience and to reduce latency in the app plus to make operation easier for frontend. After thinking about it, I realized that the first solution isn’t as bad as I initially thought. It’s actually quite reasonable: the **Client** is an aggregate root and it owns the **Car**, so creating both in a single request is acceptable(car as optional param)\n\nI can also later support an `include` query parameter that allows the caller to decide whether they want the client returned with the car or not. This makes the route much more flexible and makes the entire API more expressive, because we’re not creating artificial endpoints for every possible data representation.\n\nI think that API should describe **business entities**, not implementation details (like different representations of the same thing). So I’ll go with the first solution.\n\nThanks for all the answers!",

Anyway, for personal interest I have started this course and at the same time i began university (computer science, i am 35 now), and i’m finding it extremely difficult. in particular , drawing the circuit is not an easy task at all, you have to know boolean algebra pretty well, and manipulate boolean expressions, or use karnaugh maps. all things that are not explained in the course and you have to learn yourself and takes quite a lot of time. writing hdl is trivial, but those damn circuits.… i read old posts where people were able to complete this in no time, while i struggled a lot just to do the first module and I had to look up for the solutions of many circuits. i am kinda depressed. i think my problem was i was looking for some easy procedure or algorithm to solve the implementations, but there is not since this is a NP problem. the procedure i follow is usually to start from the truth table and then using the Disjunctive Normal Form. Of course this is not needed for AND, NOT and OR but still these basic three where not trivial either for me . Anyway, this is just a rant. I am kinda liking the course so far, but I wouldn‘t probably recommend it to beginners even if one doesn't need to know code, it is still very challenging, probably more than a basic code course",

I just finished building my first app, developed the design myself and used symfony to build the app (i'm lacking in backend dev...) and most of the code was written by AI. I give directions, i know what feature to describe and how to technically build it using the rights terms, the right prompts and asking for the right things. But not typing the code myself makes me feel like i'm heading straight into a wall. I want to learn hard, started to learn vue js by myself and how to use components. But in the end i always reach for AI as to dev a feature faster. I'm afraid i won't make it far in the pro world if it keeps going.

        "author": "Dizzy-Complaint-8871",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Naming has become a real challenge for me. It’s easy when I’m following a YouTube tutorial and building mock projects, but in real production projects it gets difficult. In the beginning it’s manageable, but as the project grows, naming things becomes harder.\n\nFor example, I have various formatters. A formatter takes a database object—basically a Django model instance—and formats it. It’s similar to a serializer, though I have specific reasons to create my own instead of using the built-in Python or Django REST Framework serializers. The language or framework isn’t the main point here; I’m mentioning them only for clarity.\n\nSo I create one formatter that returns some structured data. Then I need another formatter that returns about 80% of the same data, but with slight additions or removals. There might be an order formatter, then another order formatter with user data, another one without the “order received” date, and so on. None of this reflects my actual project—it’s not e-commerce but an internal tool I can’t discuss in detail—but it does involve many formatters for different use cases. Depending on the role, I may need to send different versions of order data with certain fields blank. This is only the formatter situation.\n\nThen there are formatters that include user roles, order formatters that also include product details, and other combinations. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to separate order and product formatters, but in rare cases I need a product formatter with only an order number or something similar, so I end up creating another formatter because the original one didn’t include it.\n\nBeyond formatters, naming functions, classes, methods, getters, and setters also becomes difficult. I know that when naming becomes hard, it may indicate that the code isn’t following the Single Responsibility Principle. But I’m not always sure how to handle this.\n\nFor example, I might be building an interface that lets users update their data. An admin can update emails, phone numbers, and roles, but a regular user can only update their name. This leads to functions like `update_user_with_role`, `update_user_normal`, `update_user_with_email`, and so on.\n\nMost of my projects have role-based access control, and different roles can view or update different fields. Sometimes even the displayed values differ. For example, if an admin views an order, they might see quantity 100, but a vendor might see quantity 70 because the order is split between two vendors. That means writing multiple getters, different database queries, and various ways of manipulating the data. This leads to many functions and a lot of naming decisions.\n\nInside a single function, I often deal with dictionaries (like objects in JavaScript). I might fetch raw data from the database, give it a long descriptive name, remove some parts, process it again, and so on. I end up naming the same dictionary multiple times in different forms, and the names become long and messy. I’m unsure what the right approach is here.\n\nTutorials usually cover only obvious examples aimed at beginners. They say things like “If you calculate tax, call it `calculate_tax`,” which is obvious. But my real-world cases aren’t that simple. If discounts depend on user roles, sure, the logic should be inside the function, but I still need to express it clearly. I also don’t want to get stuck overthinking names because that delays the project.\n\nName collisions happen a lot. For example, I once wrote a function called `get_user` to fetch a user by ID. Later I needed to fetch users by email, username, and other fields. I ended up writing multiple versions, and the original vague name became a problem because it was created early in the project. I eventually renamed it, but it was painful. That’s why I want a better approach from the start so I don’t spend hours worrying about names.\n\nSometimes it feels easier to write the logic itself. I never use meaningless names like `a` or `x1`, but I do end up writing temporary or placeholder names like “this\\_has\\_to\\_be\\_renamed”. Then I move on to the next function and write “this\\_is\\_not\\_right\\_first\\_has\\_to\\_be\\_renamed”, and so on. These names aren’t helpful, but they let me continue writing code without getting stuck on naming.\n\nSo I’m looking for any guide, project, or glossary I can refer to—something with common naming patterns. For instance, I used words like “collection” or “group” earlier, but “batch” made more sense in my context. I’ve used AI suggestions often; sometimes they help, sometimes they produce vague names because they don’t have the full context.\n\nI’m not sure if there is any practical guide, but if there is, please share it. Or share any tips that can help me improve. Naming shouldn’t be something that holds me back; I’d rather focus on the logic instead. Thank you.",

        "content": "I recently wrote an image blurring algorithm that uses a basic approach that I learned in my computational physics course in college. Basically, pixels in an image are selected at random, and its RGB values are averaged with the RBG values of all pixels immediately round it. When this happens, the selected pixel (\"pixel\" is an object I created) is also set to \"processed\" meaning this pixel has already been worked on, don't perform the averaging operation on it again. This implies that the random selector method I'm using can choose any pixel it wants to while running, so multiple pixels get selected multiple times. This is inefficient. How could I also exclude them from the set of values the random method can select? I was thinking about putting all the pixel values in a linked list and then knocking them out that way with a checkinlist(pixel) method, but maybe a hash table would be better?",

A few of them felt like they relied a bit too much on trial and error, so I turned that curiosity into a small side project. I built a browser extension that reads the puzzle when you open it, figures out the pattern, and then gives hints or can even solve it automatically. Right now it only works with the “Zip” puzzle, but I’m planning to expand it as I go.\n\nWhile building this, I ended up learning way more than I expected. I got a much better understanding of how Chrome extensions are structured, how to use content scripts to interact with a page, and how to scrape and interpret the DOM in a way that doesn’t break when the site loads things dynamically. I also had to figure out how to design simple pattern-recognition logic, handle communication between different parts of the extension, and work through a bunch of timing issues that I’d never really run into before. Publishing it taught me how the Chrome Web Store process works too. Overall, it was a fun reminder that small projects are often the best way to learn things you didn’t even know you needed.\n\nIf anyone wants to take a look or offer feedback, here’s the extension on the Chrome Web Store:\n\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkedin-puzzle-cracker/immohpcmpcbpfbepgkjacopkajnllpak",

        "content": "Hello everyone. I'm a junior in college studying civil engineering, a degree in which you don't need to know anything about anything when it comes to coding. Despite that, I've started learning Python with Harvard's free online CS50 course. This is because:\n\n1) I find it personally interesting  \n2) I'd like to have a marketable skill that sets me apart from my peers  \n3) I'd like to be able to work on projects for some side income\n\nI chose Python because it's quite beginner-friendly and has applications in data processing, scraping, automation, among others.\n\nI don't think that I'm interested in achieving mastery of the language. I want to reach a level where I can write code well and be able to market my skills as a freelancer. I'm expecting this to take at least 1.5-2 years of learning and practice with coding projects.  \n  \nIt's honestly a dream of mine to be able to travel the world in my 20s, and to be able to have a source of income (even if it's not much) from doing remote work cleaning data (or something similar) would be even better. This is on top of the benefit that I think I'd receive in my career from having this skill. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Look, I know developers are crucial and can't be easily replaced by robots. But do y'all think that a couple years of actively learning Python will make me competitive against AI that can write fast, free code? I'm not trying to offend anyone, but it's just that at this point I clearly don't know how good AI's code is or what I could be capable of after 2 years.  \n  \n2) Assuming I stick to a niche like web scraping or automation, do y'all think I could get paid well by doing projects for people as a freelancer? Say, $50+/hr?\n\nThank you for your response. ",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I often take advice too literally and get confused on how I should specifically structure my agenda when learning formal math, programming, and computer science.\n\n  \nI've made a lot of poor assumptions and ended up in a bottleneck where I'm not really improving in any of these three sectors  listed within computational mathematics/CS or software engineering.\n\n Because software engineering is usually an asynchronous isolated discipline it's hard to figure out what I am doing wrong and what other people are doing right, especially since people like to summarize and avoid being pedantic, but I don't always know what people mean by their advice.\n\n\n\n  \nSometimes I wish I could watch other people develop software or solve algorithmic in real time, read their notes and their learning journey in a biographical timeline. When I try to ask other students they might say \"I learnt from a young age from parents or other tutors\", or that \"they made projects that they liked and just coded a lot\",  I don't really get to observe the specifics of what they're doing the way you can study someone when they're playing a sport or some other visible activity. \n\n I was told mathematics was the main foundation behind computer science that is mainly unchanging compared to programming languages, libraries and toolkits which change constantly, I thought it would be best if I invested most of my time into studying math while taking 'intro to CS' and intro to 'x programming language tutorials', just trying to focus on passing my CS degree and computational mathematics first before exploring a specific software engineering discipline.\n\nI thought that once I understood the mathematics understanding how to translate concepts into code would be as straightforward as making functions for arithmetic operations or other ideas people intuitively understand.  But if you brought a mathematician with no programming experience in a structured course they would not understand how to program an addition function in python or C++ either.\n\nI should not have focused so much on math and expected the information to immediately convert to programming skill or at least make the implementation side obvious. In my intro to DSA class we didn’t even use discrete math or linear algebra, so there was no reason to take all 3 classes at the same time with no way to tie the classes together, but the curriculum made me do this. \n\n\n\nEventually in my classes I reached a point where I was told despite how much I tried to study the math and computer science concepts in pseudocode, I couldn't implement anything, i couldn't code. I was confused as I tried to engage as much as I could in my intro to x language-intermediate x language classes, asking questions, going to office hours(which in intermediate java for example was usually swamped because we were given 'real projects'/'toy projects' as assignments after going over a small topic in class, and the professor told us to figure it out)\n\nWhen I asked how I should have learnt to code I was told to mainly \"make more personal projects from scratch\" and just to \"code more\"\n\n  \nI wasn't sure where that meant for me to start.  While I knew I was hardly software engineer material, I thought I was at least making enough progress to code the computer science concepts in my classes but I wasn't, especially since we didn't focus on literal technical problems but toy projects/ \"real world scenarios\" using the algorithm in ways that we couldn't directly google because it was a unique scenario project, and we didn't actually code in class because we were told \"I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science.\" \n\nShould I do leetcode and seek computational problems to solve? I tried that and I was no more prepared for the mini software assignments given in class. \n\nShould I choose a specific field of software engineering and just start learning the tools through example projects before branching off into my own  project ideas? A lot of the programming  libraries/tools were too niche and abstract,  taking away time trying to study a specific library itself rather than the programming/ software engineering principles I was trying to gain from practicing programming with those tools to apply to my classes.\n\nI tried to read books on software design, but the books talked more about general project cycle principles such as readable  and  reusable code, good documentation, but computer architecture talked about low level concepts such as the ALU of which studying wasn't helping me program any better at the time nor did I fully understand.\n\n  \nI started trying to program projects from my imagination, especially since I was told \"don't use tutorials, code from scratch, employers don't care about clone/derivate projects\" which always ended up with me taking a bunch of notes on the documentation trying to study what enumeration is  or watching a bunch of mini tutorials on different classes in a toolkit I thought might be relevant to my project for weeks on end, with no actual progress on the project being made, just dismembered pieces of code in test files which I definitely can't put on my resume either. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But mainly because - **I just fucking love to code**.\n\nI started out with Bootstrap, lot of template editing + debugging, moved onto CMSes like Wordpress and HubSpot, and got a fair understanding of React/JS frameworks on the way. This was mainly for brand websites, so little to no web app development (although I've helped clients with app interfaces and debugging on the way).  \n  \nWhile web dev hasn't been a primary focus, and probably never will be, I'm weirdly obsessed with good web experiences. Mixing design with dev is my therapy-replacement, and I want to be better at it. \n\nI'd think of myself as an intermediate web developer, even though I've spent less than enough time on it. I'm an engineer-turned-marketer, so I have a fair understanding of programming concepts as well. I just want to be better - and I'm having a hard time figuring out where to start.\n\nI like threeJS and GSAP, although the learning curve feels a little intimidating. I feel like Scrimba and Boot.Dev(maybe more backend?) might be a good place to start. I'm prone to picking things up then dropping them quickly - so I'd ideally not want to put in a lot of money as a subscription (the currency exchange rate makes the $ a little painful). \n\nWhere do I begin?",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’m a CS student from Korea and I think I’m having a mini-crisis, so I’m just gonna dump everything here.🙃  \n  \nI’m about to take my final exams for my last semester, and honestly… I feel like I learned nothing this year. We did databases, OS, Python, C — but none of it feels like it actually stayed in my brain. I love learning new things, but when it comes to applying them in real work, I’m pretty terrible.  \n  \nBefore this, I worked full-time doing photo editing and product upload stuff. My actual skills were fine, but I was \\*slow\\*, and I got yelled at a lot because of it. And being slow is basically a crime in real jobs. So now I’m worried — if I struggled with that, how am I supposed to survive in IT, where deadlines are everything?  \n  \nSo yeah. I’m low-key scared I might just be bad at programming.\n\nDuring winter break (3 months), I’m planning to self-study like crazy to catch up. Stuff like:\n\n  \n\\- reviewing C (loops, ifs, pointers, arrays — basically everything I should already know but don’t 😭)  \n  \n\\- rewriting C logic in Python to understand better  \n  \n\\- studying English  \n  \n\\- using AI tools to learn more  \n  \n\\- and drawing again, because I used to draw before getting into design\n\n  \nI checked my old drawings recently and realized I’ve never finished a single one — everything is just rough sketches I abandoned. So my goal is simply: finish one drawing. Doesn’t matter if it’s good. Just finish something for once.\n\n\n\nIf I still have time, I want to build small personal projects.  \nLike maybe a simple random item drop generator for a game or something.  \nIf anyone has ideas for super beginner-friendly projects that only use loops + if-statements, I’d really appreciate it.👏  \n  \nAlso… for the self-taught programmers out there:  \nHow did you actually learn?  \nWhat worked? What didn’t? How did you stay consistent when you felt like you sucked at everything?😶  \n  \nThanks for reading all this.  \nTyping it out honestly made me feel a bit better.🫠😉",

        "content": "Every school break, I finally get the chance to dive into programming the way I want to. I make real progress, I build things, I feel motivated as hell. But the moment school starts again, everything falls apart. I barely touch code, I lose consistency, and by the time the next break arrives, I feel like I have to relearn half the stuff I already knew.\n\nIt’s frustrating because I actually love programming and the math behind it — it’s the one thing that really clicks for me — but the school system forces me to spend most of my time studying subjects I honestly don’t care about. Biology, geography, or whatever. They’re fine, but they don’t move me toward the future I actually want. They suck all life out of me.\n\nHere’s where I feel stuck:\nThe safer option basically involves me staying in the more academic track. But there’s also a more practical track with a computer science option that seems like it would fit me better. I’m tempted by it… but people around me keep telling me not to go there. They say “that’s where the loud teens who got expelled went,” or “the curriculum isn’t good,” but the thing is — they don’t actually know. It’s all rumors, and I can’t tell if switching would help me or completely screw me long-term. I can still do university after this track, but people say it's difficult because the academic track teaches you how to process stupidly large amounts of information and study. I think I'm fine if I catch up on all the math myself.\n\nAt the same time, I keep hearing that the programming market is oversaturated, everyone wants to code now, etc. So I’m also second-guessing myself there. Am I wasting my time? Or should I push through because I’m genuinely passionate about this?\n\nHonestly, I just want one full year of being able to truly focus on programming so I can grow without losing everything the second school starts again. But that obviously isn’t happening anytime soon.\n\nI’m really confused and stuck between all these choices — school tracks, university prep, trying to stay consistent, trying not to fall behind.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this?\nHow do you stay consistent during the school year?\nDoes switching to a more practical track hurt your future?\nIs the job market actually that bad, or is it just fearmongering?\n\nAny real advice or experiences would help a lot. I’m tired of feeling like I’m stuck between five different paths and none of them let me focus on what I actually love.",

        "content": "I’ve been learning Python myself and got frustrated with two extremes: either you get full solutions from AI and learn nothing, or you get stuck with very little guidance. So I built a small adaptive learning system on top of an LLM that tries to sit in the middle.\n\nThe system does three things very strictly:\n\n* Error-driven feedback: When you ask for help with your code, the AI prints your code with line numbers and only points to “Line X – syntax error / structure error / logic error / input error”. No full solutions unless you explicitly ask after you’ve tried to fix it.\n* Maximum 2 new concepts per lesson: Each learning unit is allowed to introduce at most two new commands or ideas. If a lesson needs more than that, it’s automatically split into smaller sub-lessons. The idea is to manage cognitive load instead of throwing everything at you at once.\n* Reflection and tracking: After each session, there’s a short reflection (what was hard, what worked, what to focus on next), and the system tracks goals, progress, and repeated error types.\n\nRight now it’s wired for Python (loops, input, error handling, functions, lists, etc.), but the structure is generic: goals (G##), lessons (L## / W## / T##), a command tracker, error plan, progress tracking, learning log. You could in principle swap the content and use the same engine for other things (language learning, math, etc.).\n\nThe whole thing is:\n\n* A GitHub template repo\n* No personal data included\n* Documented so you can understand and change the rules\n\nRepo:  \n[https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-](https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-)\n\nI’d love feedback on:\n\n* Whether this kind of “error-only” feedback actually helps learning\n* How you would extend or simplify it for beginners\n* Any ideas for good Python goals/lessons that fit the “max 2 new concepts” rule",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello, everyone.\n\nI need your help picking a book to expand my knowledge in fundamentals of computer science.\n\nI am a mechanical engineering major, and about 3 years ago I decided to switch careers and learn programming. Thing is, while doing this, I focused more on hands on knowledge that will help me find a job, not fundamentals. I started with Harward's CS50 course for some basics, then learned Java and Spring, basics of SQL and Git, and then a bit of data structures and algorithms. After about 8-9 months, I landed a job and started working.\n\nCurrently, I am feeling that I missed a lot of fundamental topics and I would like to cover the blank spots before I can further improve. I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.\n\nI feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.\n\nHence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.\n\nThanks for reading and your help.",

The cuts, which have accelerated through November, are affecting roles from middle management to customer support across Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Intel, and other tech giants.\n\nThe layoffs represent a shift from traditional cost-cutting to a fundamental restructuring of how tech companies operate. In November alone, Verizon announced plans to cut more than 13,000 employees, while HP disclosed it may eliminate between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs by 2028. Apple trimmed sales positions managing business, education, and government accounts, and Amazon cut approximately 14,000 corporate workers in October, including more than 1,800 engineers.\n\nThis doesn't mean AI will take over jobs, I just means AI will more jobs that require physical human interaction in fields like agriculture, plumbing, welding, waste collection etc which will be a goldmine. \n",

I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n\\-TC: Years 1-4: 248k -> 276k -> 303k -> 330k (Includes estimate of guaranteed refreshers)\n\n\\-High level role with mostly design + telling other devs what to create, less coding\n\n\\-4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins. On call for overseas folks 8-10PM. + Occasional travel overseas to india.\n\n\\-highly rated on glassdoor, low layoffs compared to peers\n\n\\-incredibly smart EE folks with buncha guys PhD from MIT in Physics\n\n\\-I studied EE in college but pivoted to FE dev and now this is almost going back to my roots.\n\nInterview:\n\n\\-I didn't even expect a call back, the position seemed out of my league, but behold, i did. Told recruiter my background in FE dev, not a pro UIUX designer but i know the concepts and i work with them. Said he'll get back to me and the next week they want me for a GIGA HARDCORE FINAL ROUND with 6 directors/vps/staff engineers. \n\n6 1:1's PLUS a presentation to all 6.\n\nOh my god I’ve never got grilled on UX design this hard in my life. \n\nOne of the directors (PhD from MIT) asked me: Say aliens are invading earth. You need to design a control panel for a missile defense system that is user friendly to the operators. Button? Console; command line etc? What’s the design like, how about communication? How do u communicate to others, alarm system? Should there be a mute button? If the operator is in a hurry and needs split second decision how do u ensure the cleanest UI design? Security?\n\nAnother director (ex-AWS) asked: Say u have a data center with servers and switches that transmit data, but data can be failed / low quality / bad transmission, design a gui for this.\n\nVP asked me: Say there’s a bar graph. X axis is quality and Y is number of items. Title of graph is “amount of items of various qualities over the past 24 hours”. Now, we don’t like this presentation and instead want the X axis to be time. But we still want to show the data for quality/# , so we’re adding another data point. How do we display the graph now?\n\nStaff FE dev grilled me on js fundamentals such as closures and promises. I fumbled on a few questions but managed to get most, explaining thought process.\n\nCrazy interviews, hiring manager told me as a closing thought \"This position is challenging to fill\" and i had that thought RACING in my head 24/7. what could it mean? Did he like me and i'm a contender? Or did it mean \"this is a tough role to pass\"; i asked chatGPT and it said \"THIS IS A HUGE GREEN SIGNAL\" i was like lolwut really? ok then!\n\nWeek later recruiter emails me \"I wanted to connect with you regarding feedback and next steps\" im like NEXT STEPS?? GG? lets fkin goooooooooo. and boom offer.\n\nCraziest part is i couldn't prepare for these UI questions, came leftfield, i just winged it and somehow i had enough intuition to pass them. Recruiter told me many candidates were able to pass coding, but struggled/froze on the Design Mission Control System design question. I guess i have some semblance of talent in UI design?\n\n\\----\n\nSome FE coding questions I had this year:\n\n**Discord -** tech screen - failed\n\nCreate a UI for a formula parser that has fields a, b, c. You can type numbers in the field and the output of the fields would be those numbers, but you can also type letters in the fields and they would add up the numbers stored. For example in field A if you type 3 the output of field A is 3. \n\nThen if you type A in field B the output of B is 3. In field C if you type in AB you get 6 (3+3) the reqs were so ambiguous so it took me awhile to understand the problem. NO AI, write on own IDE with screenshare.\n\n**Crunchyroll** \\- tech screen - passed\n\nCreate a react app that renders a collection of anime titles and its image, from json data;\n\nfor(var i=0; i<5; i++) setTimeOut console.log(i) \"trick\" question whats the output and why?\n\n**Crunchyroll -** final coding round - failed\n\nPolyfill the \"getElementsByClassName\" function. Aced system design though, the interviewer was impressed.\n\n**Walmart -** tech screen - ghosted\n\nWrite a \"deepclone\" function that copies an object with variable depth and contains anything, including other objects, arrays etc.\n\n**Oracle -** tech screen - failed (passed question but they chose another candidate with more backend exp)\n\nCreate a react app that displays a credit card, with buttons to switch which cc to view, cc data comes from json. Clicking on cc will replace the text with X's- X's correspond to how many words there are, so FIRST LASTNAME will be XXXX XXXX.\n\n**Anduril -** tech screen - failed \n\nYou know in your IDE the directory structure, with folders and files? Given a pic/mock of that, Build it.\n\n**Amazon -** https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1iudddy/rainforest_loop_experience_frontend_l5_12_yoe/\n\n\\---\n\nClosing thought: It's rough out there for Front End devs. There are fewer positions than before, but way more AI/ML positions. However, FE dev compensation is still competitive, u just needa know so much.\n\nI'm not incredibly smart or talented, most other engineers are more brilliant than I. The biggest source of my success is the resilience to failure. The amount of rejections and failures is so high  but every time, i write down what went wrong, study it, and gain knowledge, so over time every failure builds up to more and more knowledge.",

        "content": "I’m in my 40s, currently working as an SDE2/Senior-level engineer at a big tech company. Compensation is solid and the work is technically interesting. The flip side is the usual big-tech stress: reorganizations, shifting priorities, constant pace, and the general feeling of volatility.\n\nI’m considering an offer for a “Principal”-level role in local government IT. The job is stable, unionized, slower paced, and has a predictable schedule. The work looks more enterprise/ERP-focused and nowhere near as chaotic as big tech.\n\nMy concerns are:\n\nWhether I’m actually ready for a Principal role: I’ve operated at a mid-to-senior IC level, but I haven’t formally held a Principal title before. I’m worried about stepping into Principal-level expectations in a new domain and whether I’ll be able to perform at the level the role requires.\n\nGetting pigeonholed: Government IT tends to have slower-moving tech and more specialized enterprise systems. I’m concerned that if I spend years there, my skills might narrow and limit future private-sector options.\n\nLong-term compensation ceiling: Government positions have fixed salary steps and a hard cap. Once you hit the top step, raises are basically cost-of-living adjustments. In private tech, there’s still room for higher comp and growth.\n\nI’m trying to balance a more stable and predictable lifestyle with the risks of taking on a bigger role, potentially narrowing my skillset, and reducing long-term earning potential.\n\nIf anyone has moved between private tech and government IT, especially mid-career or at a senior level, I’d really appreciate hearing how it affected your career, confidence, and quality of life.",

Despite all the talk of ethics and codes of conduct, corruption runs deep in IT – from C-suite kickbacks on mega-contracts to freebies for devs. ​\n\n**Recent examples I came across** \n\n* A few months back, an internal audit flagged a conflict: the eCommerce vendor for our marketing team was owned by the eCom director’s husband. We scrambled to switch vendors and migrate services overnight.\n* In another case, the country  IT head got fired after auditors discovered his wife was a key partner in the firm building our new data centre.\n\n**How It Plays Out at Every Level**\n\n* **Top Brass**: Execs skim a “small percentage” from huge outsourcing deals with ISVs and preferred partners. Kickbacks may hit spouse accounts as “consulting fees,” or come as all-expenses-paid Vegas/Hawaii retreats, plus holiday hampers and gift cards. \n* **Middle Management (VPs/Directors)**: They steer SOWs and contracts to “preferred vendors” – think brother-in-law’s startup – for their cut. \n* **Lower Levels (Managers/Devs)**: Free conference passes with airfare, SWAG-stuffed goodie bags, vendor open bars, and hackathon gift cards are routine “*appreciation*.”\n\nThis stuff feels like par for the course in IT, even as companies preach zero tolerance. \n\nWhat’s the wildest (or most common) corruption you’ve spotted?",

I'm not even entry level.\n\nFor context, I’m a senior full-stack engineer with \\~7 years at a Fortune 200 company. I got incredibly lucky with an internship that converted to full-time, so I've never interviewed anywhere lol (the internship didn't have a traditional interview process. I didn't even answer a single technical question.)\n\nRequired to be in another state by fall 2026, which means I need to start looking ASAP. Problem is...I'm in my late 20s and have literally zero job hunting experience.\n\n* **My first question:** How important are portfolio projects for senior-level roles? \n\nI've got a few (including a personal site) and I'm working on wrapping up a bigger Rust project, but I'm worried I'm just wasting my time if employers don't actually care about this stuff outside of entry-level.\n\nI'm also worried staying at one company for 7 years might've hurt me. I'm significantly underpaid for my experience and degree (MS in CS + certs) right now, and I'm paranoid that long tenure looks like I'm either stuck or coasting. I keep hearing conflicting takes: some say it's a red flag for stagnation, others say it doesn't matter.\n\n* **My second question:** Anyone know how this actually plays out in the job market? I'm pretty ignorant about this stuff. Can't change it now, but good to know for the future.\n\n\n\n**TDLR:** What should a senior dev actually focus on when entering the market for the first time?

        "content": "I'm Canadian. I have a BSc in Psychology. This is my first time posting in a CS subreddit so please let me know if this is not the right place for this question.\n\nI've been thinking of switching into CS and finally decided to apply to schools with lots of Co-op opportunities. So far I've applied to bachelor's in UToronto (waiting), Waterloo (i may not meet eligibility requirements as a graduate), UBC (waiting; 20-month 2nd degree program) and UOttawa (got in).\n\n  \nI prefer getting another bachelors since the schools I've picked comes with a good (rigorous) curriculum and a very good selection of co-op options as well as decent hiring rates post-studies. I want a strong, guided foundation even though I've done a little bit of everything by myself out of curiosity and interest (C++ in university courses, Python in high school, JS, html, CSS, AI/ML, Data Science).\n\n  \nHowever my parents think it would be better to get a CS masters directly instead of \"wasting time\" doing another bachelors. The problem is well-reputed schools in Canada don't seem to offer masters without cs or related undergrad. The schools that do offer this option seems pointless to me because the market is already saturated and I feel like I would just be doing it for the sake of having just any CS related education. Plus they don't seem to offer any of the benefits that bachelors does (Co-op for eg).\n\n  \nClearly I'm biased towards doing a bachelors but I don't want to be close minded. I wanna know if I should consider masters as an actual option right away. My main focus is that my education shouldn't look like a drawback to potential employers, and there should be a better chance of employment. \n\n(Also I've read multiple times that strong portfolio and CS-based projects makes you a good candidate and that you don't need formal education but I honestly don't think I can be impressive enough pull that off. I'm willing to put in the work but I also need some structured learning before I can build my portfolio. Plus CS degree is a part of the mandatory requirements for a lot of job listings that I see so I don't want to be ineligible or automatically screened out for good opportunities)\n\nSo what should I do? CS Masters without Bachelors or CS bachelors.\n\n  \n**TLDR**; Are the chances of landing a job with a CS masters without CS bachelors the same as having a CS bachelors? I know landing a job in general would be hard but which offers me a better chance?",

        "content": "I've been pretty active on both sides of the hiring/interviewing gauntlet for the last few months, and just wanted to share the following thoughts on what I believe are some huge misconceptions around compensation (that candidates, recruiters, companies, and other have).\n\n1. Engineers are not commodities.  We are non-fungible and there are HUGE differences in the amount of value we can bring, even when you try to classify us into strata like junior, middle, senior, staff, etc.  Engineers are more like real estate.  There can be huge differences in pricing for a 1500 sqft abode, depending on factors like location, build, amenities, etc.\n2. Not every company can make the same use of a talented engineer.  Just because you are worth $500k at Citadel does not mean Walgreens can realistically get as much value out of you.\n\nThese 2 realities result in interesting dynamics, where one company may pay their junior engineers more than another company on the same street pays their principal engineers.  Both may be acting rationally.  It also results in some interesting dynamics where a junior engineer may thumb their nose at opportunities that may be a huge step up in title and responsibilities, and they are acting rationally too.\n\n3. The above should make you question the concept of \"market pay\".  It is not a meaningful measure.  However, if you want to use it, do not use job posting data to figure out \"market pay\".  A job posting is an \\*unfilled\\* role.  There are 2 good sources of \"market pay\".  1. Current pay of employed engineers in a similar role and setting. and 2. Recent offers that are accepted by engineers for a similar role and setting.  The latter is a better/more effective measure for evaluating a new role as a candidate / determining how to budget for a role you are trying to hire for.",

I casually searched for around 5-6 months, really only applying to things that looked interesting, or any interesting recruiter reach out.\n\nMy Results:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png](https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png)\n\n\n\n*Note: these are a bit general numbers. This happened over a few months, so might be +/- one or two things I forgot about*\n\nIn general, I was pretty selective. I had a few dozen recruiter's message me, but only took 10 or so calls. Most were from in office startups that I had no interest in, or non tech companies which I wasn't really interested in.\n\nSome notes on my search\n\n\\- I make around 220k base at my current position, so any job needed to match that number (TC-wise anyway)  \n\\- I preferred remote, but for large public tech companies, was open to moving. But any startup needed to be remote (Unless something like OpenAI, etc, which of course didn't happen)  \n\\- Needed to be at least a tech forward company  \n\\- I only responded to first party recruiters  \n\\- I refuse to do take-home assessments  \n\\- I didn't do any interview prep for any of these, so my failure rate was a bit high\n\n\\--\n\nIn terms of general hiring vibes, I'd say the biggest difference was in the recruiter/HM screens, much more selective there, probably due to how easy it is to AI generate a reasonable looking resume now. I've pretty much never been rejected at that stage, but did end up getting rejected a couple times from HM's after the recruiter screens.\n\nLikewise, a few companies also wanted to do take home assessments before even going to the normal techs screens. I immediately dropped out from those (I hate take homes personally)\n\nOther than that, the general feeling was pretty similar from other times I've been on the market.",

        "content": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI joined a start up about 8 months ago and it hasn’t been going well. I’ve been having a lot of trouble with different teams and the codebase, and I’m looking for an outside perspective on whether this is common or if I’m contributing to problem.\n\nSome background:\n\n-\tI have 3 YoE, mid level SWE, this is my first tech company. \n-\tThe company has this product with multiple teams working on different parts of it.\n-\tMy role requires me to work on the product in other team’s domain and set up integrations. \n-\tThe company has about 500 employees and is doing quite well. \n\nFrom the start, I was having a difficult time working with the team that maintains the core code of the product since the manager on that team can be pretty aggressive and difficult to work with (not just my experience, have heard from multiple people about this). The code isn’t that great either, hard to reason about, plenty of side effects, hard to test, and PR reviews tend to focus on superficial code styling vs catching issues and forward thinking (another opinion shared by others). From what I see, there isn’t a big initiative to fix or improve things but rather keep patching on top of it, and a lot of people dislike that team’s work as they have to use it and deal with the problems.\n\nThis has made it so that the features I have worked on have been quite messy and buggy, where I’m constantly at odds trying to do my work in the best way but constantly have to implement workarounds or just do more work outside of scope so it doesn’t completely break. I’m always waking up to messages to fix things or staying up late to debug (not just my work), there are features that have had the same bug for months that I haven’t been allowed to fix. I have started to slow down, constantly review my work, afraid that I’ll cause another issue and have to deal with 20 slack messages the next day. All of this has taken a toll on me where I’m regularly stressed and frustrated by what’s going on and what I’m doing.\n\nI used to be very excited but nowadays I’m quite drained by the experience, I don’t work on side projects anymore and have started to stop caring about what I work on. I understand that start ups have problems but I don’t mind usual start up problems, I’m used to working a lot and moving quickly. My manager is great and we talk often, he agrees that things are messed up and says I’m doing fine, but I certainly don’t feel that way. I’ve noticed that I have reverted back to a junior mindset of slowing down my pace, staying silent in meetings, and constantly checking in with my manager because I can’t trust the work I do to not fail, yet it still does.\n\nIs this a normal thing? I am very open to feedback and everyone I talk to says that I’m doing well and things are messy, but I seriously feel like I haven’t progressed in any way since I’ve started working here and have gotten worse.\n\nTL;DR: Mid-level SWE (3 YoE, first tech company) at a ~500-person startup, 8 months in. My work depends on a messy, hard-to-test codebase owned by a difficult manager, so my work ends up buggy, I’m constantly firefighting, and I’m losing confidence and motivation even though my own manager says I’m doing fine. Is this just normal chaos or am I the issue?",

Hated my boss, hated just feeling like I wasn't doing any fulfilling, hated that someone said I was going to be a lifer.. Fast forward too 2018, I took the leap, after doing some code academy and attempting to teach myself the basics of code, I applied and was accepted to do a 12 week immersive web dev program in Boston (General Assembly). Right before going to this program, my girlfriend at the time was a dental hygienist, she was making small talk with a client and he mentioned he was a software engineer. She mentioned how i was going to be going to an immersive program in Boston, he gave her his number for me to contact him, i did, we met up for coffee and talked goals and web dev in general. Fast forward to the 10th week of my program, I get a call from that guy and he asked if I wanted interview. I interviewed it was your typical interview but I feel like they were pretty relaxed about it because they knew how green I was. I mean shit, i'm pretty sure the tech challenge they let me use my own personal project I developed through the program.. Anyways they hired me probably believing they could mold me into what they wanted, although there wasnt much molding, there was a lot of extremely late nights of me trying to figure things out because I knew absolutely NOTHING. Long story short there were grueling years of teaching myself a lot but also kind of only teaching myself stuff that would get me through a specific task. I feel like I never really took a step back and really dove into soft skills or design concepts or why you would use a certain pattern for certain scenarios..\n\nNow, 8 years later I'm still at my current company and over the past 3 my company as a whole does not feel secure. I've survived big layoffs, clients leaving, entire company not getting raises, etc. I have a family now, I own a house, and I need security.. I've had one job interview over the past year and I completely botched it. The technical interview I froze, it was plain javascript and I couldn't solve it.. I was so embarrassed and couldn't believe it. Now I feel like if it was nextjs and my companies codebase? I wouldn't have had any issues what so ever because i've been working here for so long and I feel like my knowledge of nextjs is very good but thats not going to cut it if I want a new job, which obviously I do with more security.. Just getting an interview almost seems impossible though, then I'm dreading the whole interview process because quite frankly I feel like my soft skills, tech terminology, and overall understanding of frontend development is lacking and I'm so used to my companies codebase I feel like im going to be a deer in headlights during an interview process.\n\nI just need some advice on how I should go about getting a new job, do I zoom out and go back to strengthening my soft skills of javascript, do I use some platforms like TheGreatFrontend? What are some concepts companies are absolutely looking for that I should either learn or freshen up on? Any advice would be helpful. Please try your best not to tear me apart, I'm a anxiety filled mess at the moment with the thought of losing my job, I have 2 month old baby, a house, and an income needed for us to live.",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Earlier today I posted about feeling discouraged because it seems like, no matter how much I improve, AI will eventually do everything better and faster. The latest Anthropic model announcement pushed me further in that direction, especially after seeing developers say they barely write code now and reading some pretty dramatic predictions about software engineering not existing in a few years from actual Anthropic developers (yes I realize they stand to gain a ton by having people believing this, but I don't know if I have the luxury to hand wave it away).\n\nI am having a hard time seeing a long-term future in this field, which might be influenced by the fact that I am not currently working in it. Still, if I truly believe there is no future for me in this industry, then I need to plan for that possibility. Right now I am thinking that if I do not land a software job by summer 2026, I will go back to school for another engineering discipline, most likely power or mining.\n\nUntil that point (maybe just so I can say that I tried, or because I want to feel less horrible about the student debt I accrued getting this degree), I'm gonna be grinding a ton, trying to land something. If that doesn't work out, then I'm likely gone for good from the industry at this time next year.\n\nI would appreciate any advice from people who have dealt with this kind of uncertainty or who have thoughts on whether setting a timeline like this makes sense. Obviously I cant sit around and hope for the best forever, especially when the clouds on the horizon look darker and darker.",

My total compensation is around 115k at 24 years old, and I currently am 8 months on the job. I have 3 years of experience, working in a university position as a data engineer before this role for 2 years.\n\nSo within the stack I'm using, it's mainly PL/SQL and T-SQL - which I guess is fine because that's what I'm using to access big data and work with our internal customers. I do ETL work and requests given by customers using SQL, and of course manage loads every month with on-call/production support.\n\nThe pay is great and I also live at home with my parents, so I am indeed getting comfortable. I'm not in any relationship and I don't really wish to be at all any time soon. The only thing I'm wondering though is how badly I'm hindering my career by staying here skills wise. The data engineering space seems like it is changing a lot, and our tech in our current team doesn't use any of the new tech that's in the current climate.\n\nWhen I first entered this team, I was hoping to use a more modern tech stack, it looks like thought it's a bit limited to just Oracle. I'm fine with the work and I am learning everyday so I'm not complaining about what I have currently. But I do want to progress my career a bit more with more skills. There isn't any Python, Airflow, Spark, AWS, Kafka or any other modern orchestration tools, a bit of a gap in what others would be using.\n\nI'm aware that this is a good position, but I do want to progress as a data engineer and become higher impact in the future for maybe a different company or even a startup.\n\n**If I stay here for too long, would that make me a bit unmarketable for more current positions with more modern stacks?**\n\n**Do I stay 1–2 years and risk locking myself into legacy SQL work, or move now while I’m still early?**\n\n**Is it smarter to grind this job for money or take a risk and pivot sooner?**\n\nIn terms of urgency, I was considering moving out to a different company within 6 to 8 months but just want some advice.\n\nI really want to move to a city as well and move out as well, but with this current position I'm just conflicted on what the move should be. Some have suggested to switch internally within the company, which I could consider. Others have suggested to start applying for other roles in other areas. I want to know some thoughts.\n\ntldr; current position is only Oracle. Worried that it isn't up to date to current climate. What do I do.",

In my University program I focused on ML the most, also both my graduation projects for Bachelor and Master were in the same field.\n\nI know landing a first full-time job is a bit hard so I would like to know what employers actually look for in my case, I am interested in working as a junior ML engineer and/or junior data scientist.  \nI feel like since most of my work in my uni was in python, I have lost my skills in other languages due to lack of practice, should I work on that or just double down on python since it's the most used language in those areas?\n\nWhat I have in mind right now is doing an Azure course which is very popular where I live (Germany). But I would like to ask if something else is more worthy of my time. Would it matter if I write a personal project just for this job search? How big should such a project be for it to actually matter in the application review?",

I accepted it and I was excited, but this semester has been rough. I have an 11 month old (fyi they know this) and I also had to cram alot of hours in this semester because some weren’t available in the previous summer. I’m pretty much going to fail my Statistics class. I was so focused on my other CS classes and Statistics has always been hard for me to wrap my head around, so it was unintentionally put last with my attention. I always thought I could improve it, but even with a final exam coming up, I don’t think it’ll drastically improve my grade. \n\nI’m afraid my offer will be rescinded because of this and I’ve already set a start date weeks ago, as well as searched for an apartment and notifying my current apartment to break lease. What should I do? Do you think I could lose my internship as well? And how should I tell them this information as well as my family?",

Would they like the passion or shy away because of its focus in games?\n\nI have a couple projects I have worked on through school and outside of school that I have in my current portfolio that I hope would make me stand out as a new grad in the field.

Thing is, while doing this, I focused more on hands on knowledge that will help me find a job, not fundamentals. I started with Harward's CS50 course for some basics, then learned Java and Spring, basics of SQL and Git, and then a bit of data structures and algorithms. After about 8-9 months, I landed a job and started working.\n\nCurrently, I am feeling that I missed a lot of fundamental topics and I would like to cover the blank spots before I can further improve. I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.\n\nI feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.\n\nHence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.\n\nThanks for reading and your help.",

However recently I've realised it may not be the best idea. I am mainly focused on computer science and that field, and upon doing more research and speaking to teachers I've realised that my side project that I want to work on/am working on (i.e. a full fleshed out or at least a working prototype game) stands out a LOT more than a generic EPQ to universities/degrees in software engineering.\n\nMy main issue is that I have struggled with and still struggle a bit with starting and continuing on working on self-driven projects.

I only have a few hard math classes left for my associates, and then I’ll transfer. My main dream was to become a video game developer, however after doing research especially on this subreddit and other CS subs, I’ve heard it’s not really stable and not really worth it if I’ll just struggle finding a job only to be laid off. I know the industry is very oversaturated, I’ve read all the doom and gloom on here and it’s very disheartening. But I have a few years left until I graduate and hopefully the market will be better by then. I was looking into doing something like cloud engineering, and I’ve started learning python and I am going to start learning AWS as well since my classes are mostly online. I want to start building my portfolio with these skills as soon as I get good with them because I want to be able to find a job in a few years. I was also interested in AI ML but people said it would be best to get a masters degree, but it’s hard and expensive enough working full time and trying to get a bachelors. I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how I should start or what I should do, or possible career paths that have the best viability for the future. Thank you",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "\n\n I work at a startup and I have been with the company for two and half years. I was steh first employee. When I joined, my salary was normal or slightly above average for a junior. After my first year I received a raise of around 16 percent. It was fine, although my performance ratings were strong.\n\nFor my second year, the company delayed raises and bonuses for six months. During these six months I suggested taking on a team lead role because I had enough experience and leadership ability to handle it. They agreed, and the CEO told me that my compensation package would be adjusted at the end of the year based on the new responsibilities.\n\nWe are now approaching December and I want to negotiate properly this time. Last year the CEO simply told me the percentage on a Zoom call and I accepted immediately. This year the situation is more ambiguous and I want to handle it in a more strategic way.\n\nHere is the context. I am expecting at least a 50 percent increase because my responsibilities as a team lead are significant and I know my contribution is central to the product. My target would be around a 75 percent increase. I know senior engineers in the company making five to six times my current salary, and even though I understand this is a startup, I also know we are not short on funds at the moment. The CEO comes from a corporate background, so he tends to think about raises in the corporate range. On a personal level, I am introverted and not naturally comfortable pushing back or negotiating in the meeting.\n\nMy questions are the following.\nShould I anchor him before the meeting with an email laying out expectations? Should I frame it entirely in terms of business value, responsibilities, and the role change? If the CEO says he is offering 50 percent, how do I confidently say that I believe more is appropriate without sounding confrontational? If he offers 80 percent, is it reasonable to still push for more given the expanded scope of work? How would you structure this conversation so that the negotiation is firm but professional?\n\nAny structured advice, negotiation tactics, or examples of phrasing would help a lot.",

A few things I’m confused about:\n\n# 1. Are bootcamps worth it (in the UK tech market)?\n\nShould I consider doing a short bootcamp in:\n\n* Data Science\n* Data Engineering\n* Software Testing (QA)\n* Cloud / DevOps\n* Full Stack\n\nDo employers in the UK actually value bootcamps, or is it better to self-learn and build projects?\n\n# 2. Should I switch domains for faster employability?\n\nI’m getting mixed opinions online. Some say Android roles are limited in the UK compared to backend/data roles.\n\nGiven the market right now, should I:\n\n* Continue with Android?\n* Transition into Data Engineering / Data Science / Web Developer?\n* Pick something like Cloud, QA, or DevOps?\n\nMy main goal is **to get into the job market ASAP** — even if that means shifting domains.\n\n# 3. What’s the best way to approach job hunting in the UK as a newcomer?\n\n* Should I start applying while still abroad?\n* Do recruiters in the UK respond better once you have a local address?\n* Any recommended websites other than LinkedIn and Indeed?\n* Any specific certifications that help (AWS, Azure, Google)?\n\n# 4. How competitive is the UK job market for tech right now?\n\nI keep hearing it’s slow and competitive post-2023. I want to know the realistic ground situation for Android roles vs other tech roles.\n\nIf anyone has gone through a similar journey (moving from Asia → UK tech), I’d really appreciate your advice, mistakes to avoid, and what path you’d recommend. Your advice will be highly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I graduated high school but that's it for formal education. No CS background, but I've been teaching myself to code as a hobby and absolutely fell in love with Rust (Python's cool too, but Rust feels like home). Most of my coding experience is in Java, though, simply because that's what past CS classes have taught me.\n\nWhat I'm looking for: A legit online bachelor's program that's affordable (cheaper than Winona State if possible), fully asynchronous but still structured, and won't destroy me while I work part-time (20 hrs/week). I'm super comfortable learning on my own. If anything, I actually prefer it.\n\nCareer-wise, I don't want to manage people or be in meetings all day. I just want to be the person who gets told \"build this thing\" and then gets to sit down and actually build it. Ideally, I'd like to learn the skills required to contribute to some of the open source community-built projects I've used over the years in my free time.\n\nI'm realistic about my past academic struggles, so I need a program that won't punish me forever for those Winona State grades. Midwest schools would be nice, but I'm open to any US program that fits the bill.\n\nWhat programs have worked well for people in similar situations? I care way more about actually learning and getting a job than about big-name schools. Thanks in advance!",

I always thought I could improve it, but even with a final exam coming up, I don’t think it’ll drastically improve my grade. \n\nI’m afraid my offer will be rescinded because of this and I’ve already set a start date weeks ago, as well as searched for an apartment and notifying my current apartment to break lease. What should I do? Do you think I could lose my internship as well? And how should I tell them this information as well as my family?",

I'm a Software engineer, and I was thinking of taking some courses to complement my possibly lacking skills in this current market.\n\nI'm interested in learning skills for Data Engineering, Data Science, or Machine Learning. However when I was looking through Coursera, I saw lots of related courses, ones for beginners, others intermediate, some from google, amazon, etc. some that take 3 months, 6 months.\n\nMy priority right now is to get skills that matter  and that I'd like to have, without having to learn things that take years if possible, in the meantime I get a better job.\n\nI work mainly with Python, which seems to be widely used in data science and ML, also I have 1 YoE and studied a CS related career, so I don't have to learn from zero lots of CS concepts.\n\nIs my pool of choices reasonable nowadays, and is it feasible to take more than one course at the same time?\n\nAre these things I'm interested in relevant to the market?\n\nShould I better seek other courses that I'm not that interested in, like cloud related courses, SaaS, etc.?\n\nWhat are your recommendations?\n\nThank you!",

They seem to have the legal aspect covered through some really shady practices and absolutely needs to be reviewed. ",

For the latter, I need to make an ERD, implement it in SQLite, and answer questions on design and implementation.\n\nNow I will be presenting these in the coming weeks, and I’m really nervous about explaining my choices. Admittedly, I understand most of the material in theory, but I’m worried I’ll slip up with a question I wasn’t expecting, or fumble in an area I wasn’t prepared for.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for moments like this?
