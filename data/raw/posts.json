        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work with datasets that are not huge (GBs to low TBs), but the pipeline still needs to be reliable. I used to overbuild: Kafka, Spark, 12 moving parts, and then spend my life debugging glue. Now I follow a boring checklist to decide what to use and what to skip.\n\nIf you’re building a pipeline and you’re not sure if you need all the distributed toys, here’s the decision framework I wish I had earlier.\n\n1. Start with the SLA, not the tech\n\nAsk:\n\n* How fresh does the data need to be (minutes, hours, daily)?\n\n* What’s the cost of being late/wrong?\n\n* Who is the consumer (dashboards, ML training, finance reporting)?\n\n\nIf it’s daily reporting, you probably don’t need streaming anything.\n\n2. Prefer one “source of truth” storage layer\n\nPick one place where curated data lives and is readable by everything:\n\n* warehouse/lakehouse/object storage, whatever you have Then make everything downstream read from that, not from each other.\n\n\n3. Batch first, streaming only when it pays rent\n\nStreaming has a permanent complexity tax:\n\n* ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills. If your business doesn’t care about real-time, don’t buy that tax.\n\n4. Idempotency is the difference between reliable and haunted\n\nEvery job should be safe to rerun.\n\n* partitioned outputs\n\n* overwrite-by-partition or merge strategy\n\n* deterministic keys If you can’t rerun without fear, you don’t have a pipeline, you have a ritual.\n\n5. Backfills are the real workload\n\nDesign the pipeline so backfilling a week/month is normal:\n\n* parameterized date ranges\n\n* clear versioning of transforms\n\n* separate “raw” vs “modeled” layers\n\n6. Observability: do the minimum that prevents silent failure\n\nAt least:\n\n* row counts or volume checks\n\n* freshness checks\n\n* schema drift alerts\n\n* job duration tracking You don’t need perfect observability, you need “it broke and I noticed.”\n\n7. Don’t treat orchestration as optional\nEven for small pipelines, a scheduler/orchestrator avoids “cron spaghetti.” Airflow/Dagster/Prefect/etc. is fine, but the point is:\n\n* retries\n\n* dependencies\n\n* visibility\n\n* parameterized runs\n\n8. Optimize last\n\nMost pipelines are slow because of bad joins, bad file layout, or moving too much data, not because you didn’t use Spark. Fix the basics first:\n\n* partitioning\n\n* columnar formats\n\n* pushing filters down\n\n* avoiding accidental cartesian joins\n\nMy rule of thumb\n\nIf you can meet your SLA with:\n\n* a scheduler\n\n* Python/SQL transforms\n\n* object storage/warehouse and a couple checks\nthen adding a distributed stack is usually just extra failure modes.\n\nCurious what other people use as their “don’t overbuild” guardrails. What’s your personal line where you say “ok, now we actually need streaming/Spark/Kafka”?",

        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\n  \nFeeling a bit demoralized today and wondering if anyone else has come to a similar realization and how they dealt with it. Approximately 6 months ago I left a Sr. DE job on a team of 5 to join a startup as their sole data engineer. \n\n  \nThe last job I was at for 4.5 years and helped them create reliable pipelines for \\~15 sources and build out a full QC process that all DEs followed, created code standards + CI/CD that linted our code and also handled most of the infrastructure for our pipelines. During this time I was promoted multiple times and always had positive feedback.\n\n  \nCut to my current job where I have been told that I am not providing enough detail in my updates and that I am not specific enough about what went wrong when fixing bugs or encountering technical challenges. And - the real crux of the issue - I failed to deliver on a project after 6 months and they have of course wanted to discuss why the project failed. For context the project was to create a real time analytics pipeline that would update client reporting tables. I spent a lot of time on the infrastructure to capture the changes and started running into major challenges when trying to reliably consume the data and backfill data.\n\nWe talked through all of the challenges that I encountered and they said that the main theme of the project they picked up on was that I wasn't really \"engineering\" in that they felt I was just picking an approach and then discovering the challenges later.\n\n  \nCircling back to why I feel like maybe I'm just a mid-level engineer, in every other role I've been in I've always had someone more senior than me that understood the role. I'm wondering if I'm not actually senior material and can't actually do this role solo. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my ramble and let me know if you've found yourself in a similar position.  ",

        "content": "Curious how other teams are handling this, because I have seen a few versions of the same problem now.\n\nPattern looks like this:\n\n* Warehouse or DB holds the “real” data\n* Business / ops / support teams need to fix records, update statuses, maybe override a few fields\n* Nobody wants to give them direct access in Snowflake/BigQuery/Postgres or let them loose in dbt models\n\nI have seen a bunch of approaches over the years:\n\n* old-school: read-only views + “send us a ticket to change anything”\n* Excel round-trips that someone on the data team turns into SQL\n* custom internal web apps that a dev built once and now everyone is scared to touch\n* more recently: low-code / internal tool builders like Retool, Appsmith, UI Bakery, Superblocks, etc, sitting in front of the warehouse or APIs\n\nRight now I am leaning toward the “small internal app in front of the data” approach. We are experimenting with a builder instead of rolling everything from scratch, partly to avoid becoming a full-time CRUD developer.\n\nUI Bakery is one of the tools we are trying at the moment because it can sit on-prem, talk to our DB and some OpenAPI-described services, and still give non-technical users a UI with roles/permissions. Too early to call it perfect, but it feels less scary than handing out SQL editors.\n\nCurious what the rest of you are doing:\n\n* Do you let business users touch warehouse data at all, or is everything ticket-driven?\n* If you built a portal / upload tool / internal UI, did you go custom code or something like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery / similar?\n* Any “we thought this would be fine, then someone updated 50k rows by mistake” stories you are willing to share?\n\nTrying to find a balance between safety, governance and not spending my whole week building yet another admin panel.",

Did relevant projects, learned a lot, but no luck. I was comfortable working with python, docker, a few frameworks like Airflow, Spark, Dagster, DBT etc. and of course git and Java + a few tools that nobody uses in DE from the job that I was doing.\n\nDid about 100 applications, spending a fair bit of time tweaking applications to match every job that I applied to. Did not apply for stuff that I wasn't interested in. Got pretty much nothing.\n\nI did however also applied to a few software dev roles too. Ended up landing one and got incredibly lowballed but I was so tired of my previous job, I had to take it like an idiot.\n\nWell, started the new job and the work was pretty fun. But colour me surprised, the thing that pushed me out from the previous job wasn't the culture or the work just being boring, it was the cycle. I'm only 26 and honestly, I can't imagine working 9-5 until I turn 50 or 60. \n\nI'm drafting up some ideas, learning and researching what's required to create products on my own. Once I'm confident enough in an idea and the progress, I'll probably quit. Or get fired because I'm distracted. Staying for a few for months because of financial constraints.\n\nAnybody else have similar experiences? I find it so weird that I was so interested in DE just a year ago, still confident that I can perform well in it, but completely lost interest to put in the effort because in the end I know I'll just get paid peanuts for the actual amount of work I'll do (pay in my country is garbage). \n\nThe only thing that might change this would be life changing compensation, but obviously that requires much more prep that I don't know if I have the time for (or the ability for that matter). Even that wouldn't be a sustainable way out of this dumb rotten week cycle we humans invented for ourselves. Work like a mchine for 5 days and be tired for the rest of the day after work? Recover from that shit for 2 days and then get back to it again? Fuck. That.\n\nThanks for listening to my rant, please share your own thoughts, because obviously there's lots of people who enjoy what they do and have much more \"work endurance\" than me. Also curious to see if there's more people who feel the same way as me too.",

I love the \"ideation\" and architecture part—designing the pipelines, thinking through the data flows, and making things work automatically. But I sometimes worry I’m doing a lot of useful things, but not building a clean and recognizable profile.\n\n\\- What term would you use to describe this type of role? I'm not sure if I'm closer to data engineering or analytics...\n\n\\- Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\n\n\\- What would you discover next if you were in my shoes? I want to switch from band-aid solutions to more reliable, scalable procedures. At this point, what would you learn first: DBT, cloud architecture, orchestration tools like Airflow, or something else?\n\nMy current stack is Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Automate, and some legacy VBA.\n\nI genuinely love this job—it's a world away from my previous life in humanities—but I want to make sure I’m steering the ship in the right direction.

I want to do more strategic and managerial role and I feel I am more keen towards a role which has business impact as well as connection to my technical experience so far.\n\nI am thinking of couple of things -\n\n1. May be I can do an MBA which opens wide variety of domain and opportunities for me and may be I can do more of a consulting role ?\n\n2. Or may be learn more new technologies and skills to add in my CV and move to a lead data engineer role . But again this still means I will have to do a coding. Don't think this will give me exposure to business side of things.\n\n  \nCould you please suggest what should I consider as my next steps so that I can achieve a career transition effectively? ",

        "author": "Defiant_Month_497",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Just wanted to share my experience with Snowflake Openflow.\n\n  \nThe client i work for relies heavily on CDC replication for their data ingestion to snowflake. We mainly bring in data from SQL server and oracle database to our snowflake data lake.\n\nOur client is using many different ETL tools mainly Firvetran's HVR, IICS and AWS DMS and in some cases snowpipe when they want to ingest data from s3 to snowflake.\n\n  \nWhen snowflake announced openflow which supports CDC replication we were excited. Out of the box it was supporting SQL Server CDC replication and Oracle connector was soon to be released. We were very excited as our client wanted to move away from IICS and HVR due to licensing costs.\n\n  \nWe immediately started working on a POC when the openflow was available in private preview.\n\nPOC Area: - CDC based replication from SQL Server to snowflake.\n\n  \nIts fairly very easy to setup the connectors and start using it. We were able to configure the connectors and start ingesting the data within couple of hours and mind you none of us had used apache nifi before.\n\n  \nPros: - \n\n1. easy to setup and use.\n\n2. Replication latency is pretty low. Plus it can be configured as well to fit your use case.\n\n  \nCons: - \n\n1. Cannot configure target snowflake schema : - biggest downside we have found out yet. We were using the default workflow for SQL server CDC and there is no option to ingest the data into desired snowflake schema. By default Openflow is creating a schema in snowflake database with the source SQL Server schema name. We were pulling the data from SQL server schema \"DBO\" and Openflow was creating the same schema inside our snowflake database.\n\nWe updated almost all the processors inside the workflow to use the custom schema name, for most part it worked. we were able to create tables and journal tables etc inside our custom schema in snowflake. But there is one processor which merges journal tables to permanent table which was not supporting to use custom schema name. Somehow it was still using \"<DB\\_NAME>.DBO\". DB name is configurable in this processor but not the schema name.\n\n  \nWe connected with the snowflake internal team regarding the same and the guy said they working on it after receiving complaints from lots of other clients. \n\nLater he suggested us to not configure/updated the workflow which comes with database connectors. If we do update it, it's gonna be considered as a custom workflow and it will be locked out of future updates.\n\nSo, customizing the pipeline is out of the picture.\n\n2. Environment variables and JVM variables: - there is no one stop UI to manage all these variables inside the workflow. You need to navigate to each processor to manage these variables. \n\n  \n3. Error logs: - not a fan of how openflow manages error logs, its very janky to navigate  and use.\n\n  \nthese were the stuff we found out in the last couple of weeks. We have stopped our POC midway due to con 1. And we and the client are totally dissappointed with how openflow is working as of now.\n\n",

        "content": "I’ve written about my job on this sub before but I really am at a loss at times and come here to vent frequently. I am fine with hearing it’s a me problem, I really am. But I don’t know how to work faster when everything feels so chaotic upstream of me. I am not eating well, working 8+ hours and finding myself really sleepy (taking 2 naps a day these days) that are signs of burnout I’ve been experiencing especially over the last few months. \n\nI’ve been given feedback about not being as fast as the team anticipates on projects. Currently, I’ve been focusing on migrating old projects to a new architecture we plan to use by early next year. I really started being 100% dedicated to this work as of October/November of this year, which gives me 2-3 months to migrate my old projects to this new architecture. \n\nIn theory it sounds easy to my higher up: all I have to do is copy + paste and tweak my old code to new architecture and that’s it. Except it’s not that easy:\n\n1. In current architecture, I built several views that depend on each other. When deploying on this architecture, nobody made me aware (bc nobody seems to know) that changing things in upstream views causes deployment failures until I started working on this and my only workaround is to delete downstream views -> push -> confirm deployment successful -> make changes to upstream views-> push -> confirm deployment -> bring back deleted views -> push -> confirm deployment. This has caused a lot of delays and plenty failures that made me have to go to SWE team to fix that sometimes took the whole day to resolve \n\n2. Naming conventions and the way the data is stored have changed in new architecture with no documentation about this, leaving me to figure out using “eyeball” technique to see where new data is stored and changing my code accordingly \n\n3. Data in old architecture is not always coming through new architecture and I have to just figure this out by checking discrepancies and opening tickets for missing data that doesn’t get resolved no matter how much I ping people to look into it or fix it (I also don’t blame them because I feel other people are inundated too)\n\n4. Validation is a nightmare, I’ll have 30+ discrepancies and after checking code and data is there, I have to go through these records one by one to see why it’s not there by comparing tables. It turns out that some records are not meant to be in the new architecture, which I was not told until later when I did validation and had to compare what info from our schema tables was missing between the two. I have to look for specific clues between the old and new dataset for indication whether something is valid or not so I can document there is a reason for discrepancy  \n\n5. Documenting all of this and more is a task of its own \n\n6. Ongoing enhancements are expected to be added to some projects \n\nI have one project that is comprised of 10 SQL views. The expectation was this would take 2 weeks but it took me a month: 1. creating the views and aligning them to new data model 2. dealing with random/unanticipated failures because of how these views are connected that I can only ask the SWE team to because they can tell me what things in my code that used to be compatible with this new architecture aren’t anymore 3. Validating data and having discrepancies no matter how many times I’ve fixed any errors because some things are “discrepancy by nature” of this new model which I either document and write an explanation of why it’s valid or a something I have to open a ticket for 4. The new way we’re modelling data sometimes doesn’t work for existing projects and I have to add more lines of code to work around that \n\nThis is not new of the culture of my team. They give me several projects at a time thinking it will take 2 weeks. It takes longer for me and I have been told I have a consistent issue with slowness that makes me feel it’s a me issue. I explain to management my process, I started documenting all issues way more, but nobody gives me constructive advice on what I can do differently to work “faster” and it makes me feel like a failure. \n\nOne of the advices I was given was “ask for help” but whenever I do, nobody is able to help. When there were holidays, I asked overseas employees to help me investigate a discrepancy an came back to see nobody was able to do it no matter how many people I pinged and explained the issue in detail. \n\nAs a side note, some of the code I’m migrating now was a nightmare to develop in the first place - it was projects I inherited with no documentation, no idea what the project outcome should look like or what “acceptance criteria” deems the project complete or not. The code was 1000 lines and took several minutes to run with poor performance issues. Like a million full joins, sub queries within subqueries. I was once asked to add something to a where clause in this query and unknowingly broke something that I didn’t realize was a break bc I have no idea what the end result is supposed to look like. I was told to reverse it immediately and asked the SWE team who told me we can’t simply reverse our daily pipeline. The colleague who asked me to made the change became furious and this is where negative feedback about me started. I later worked hard to re-develop this whole project, breaking down the code into separate parts in order to join these separate views together at the end to make cleaner, optimized code. The team did like that work, but even then, issues would arise - upstream pipeline would fail, I have to interrupt my 10 projects to manually get a dataset, upload it through our transformation tool, export and manually put back into S3 that takes 30+ minutes. Later, it turns out that simple joins to create the end table aren’t enough per requirements because of unanticipated quirks with the data that requires a full join and 2 additional CTEs to get right. \n\nBasically, I’m just really tired. The business requirements are really ambiguous and a work in progress, our data is in different constantly changing formats and we have failures or changes of me upstream of I have to keep track of while working through other projects and stop everything to fix it. Of note, most of my team members are not strong technically but do have domain knowledge, yet I feel domain knowledge is not enough because the way we do things technically feels very poor as well. Sorry to make everybody read all this, I don’t have any other friends who work in data who I can vent to about this. ",

        "author": "ukmurmuk",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Some principles I have been thinking about productive modern data engineering culture, sharing this here to see different perspectives about my outlook.\n\nFirst, I want to begin by making an assertion that in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodity. The expensive part is in reviewing & testing the code. But, as long as the pipelines are batch, the processing is not in a regulated environment, and the output is not directly affecting the core business, cost of mistakes are REALLY low. In most cases you can simply rerun the pipeline and replace the bad data, and if you design the pipeline well, processing cost should be very low.\n\nSo, here are my principles:\n\n•\t⁠Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthless. It slows down development, and it doesn’t really check the true output (product of complex interactions of functions and input data). It adds friction when expanding/optimizing the pipeline. It’s better to do WAP (Write-Audit-Publish) patterns to catch issues in production and block the pipeline if the output is not within expectations rather than trying to catch them locally with tests. (edit: write your e2e tests, DQ checks, and schema contracts. Unit test coverage shouldn’t give you any excuse to not have the other three, and if having the other three nullifies the value of unit tests, then the unit tests are worthless) \n\n•\t⁠Dependencies has to be explicit. If table A is dependent on table B, this dependency has to be explicitly defined in orchestration layer to ensure that issue in table A blocks the pipeline and doesn’t propagate to table B. It might be alluring to separate the DAGs to avoid alerts or other human conveniences, but it’s not a reliable design. \n\n•\t⁠With defensive pipelines (comprehensive data quality check suites, defensive DAGs, etc), teams can churn out codes faster and ship features faster rather than wasting time adjusting unit tests/waiting for human reviews. Really, nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for review. \n\n•\t⁠the biggest bottleneck in data engineering is not the labor of producing code, but the frictions of design/convention disagreements, arguments in code reviews, bad data modeling, and inefficient use of tables/pipelines. This phenomenon is inevitable when you have a big team, hence I argue in most cases, it’s more sensible to have a very lean data engineering team. I would even go further to the point that it makes more sense to have a single REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineers. Even if this really good one costs 5x than the average one, it’s more worth the money: allowing faster shipping volume and better ROI.\n\nSo, what do you think? Are these principles BS?",

My application requires the results before proceeding.\nI tested Apache Flink a little and it seems like in order to get it to return the latest sliding window results in real time I need to build on top of standard Flink and I fear that if I implement that, it might just end up being even slower than Rising Wave.\nSo I would like to ask you if you know what other tools I could try.

        "content": "I've been tasked with modernizing our ETL. We handle healthcare data so first of all, we want to keep everything on prem, so it limits some of our options right off the bat.\n\nCurrently, we are using a Makefile to call a massive list of SQL files and run them with psql. Dependencies are maintained by hand.\n\nI've just started seeing what it might take to move to DBT to handle the build, and while it looks very promising, the initial tests are still creating some hassles. We have a LOT large datasets. So DBT has been struggling to run some of the seeds because it seems to get memory intensive and it looks like maybe psql was the better option for atleast those portions. I am also still struggling a bit with the naming conventions for selectors vs schema/table names vs folder/file names. We have a number of schemas that handle data identically across different applications, so table names that match seem to be an issue, even if they're in different schemas. I am also having a hard time with the premise that seeds are 1 to 1 for the csv to table. We have for example a LOT of historical data that has changed systems over time, but we don't want to lose that historic data, so we've used psql copy in the past to solve this issue very easily. This looks against the dbt rules.\n\nSo this has me wanting to ask, are there better tools out there that I should be looking at? My goal is to consolidate services so that managing our containers doesn't become a full time gig in and of itself.\n\n  \nPart of the goal of modernization is to attach a semantic layer, which psql alone doesn't facilitate. Unit testing across the data in an easier to run and monitor environment, field level lineage, and even eventually pointing things like langchain are some of our goals. The fact is, our process is extremely old and dated, and modernizing will simply give us better options. What is your advice? I fully recognize I may not know DBT enough yet and all my problems are very solveable. I'm trying to avoid work arounds as much as possible because I'd hate to spend all of my time fitting a square peg into a round hole.",

Sometimes dabbling a bit in azure but no data pipeline work. I have been in this role for 1,5y and before this for 3 years I worked part time in more technical roles which included c#, git, azure devops, ssis, ssrs, qlik sense.\n\nI have been offered a position to move to our central analytics & bi team, they basically serve all the smaller units in our org (like the one I am in) and help with BI stuff. Not sure how many units there are but this is a large company with very regulated industries (like nuclear power). This role would introduce fabric to my daily tools and sql and python based on the conversation I had with the manager. The role listing also mentions that knowledge of etl/elt and ci/cd processes is required. But it also mentions on-prem gateways and fabric tenant admin.\n\nIn addition to this, I have been offered a position at a very good consulting company. It’s a data engineer position but it starts with a 4 week bootcamp to get me going in the DE skills (they mention tools like dbt, databricks, snowflake, fabric, python, sql etc) and then I start with customer projects. The caveat is that I get a \\~10% net pay cut. But they offer a ton of possibilities for growth, internal academies and they pay for certifications etc. I currently have none.\n\nI have to do my decision next week and I’m not sure what to choose. I know DE can open architect roles in the future but I have no idea what in-house fabric can do for me if I want to progress. From what I have read this subreddit I have gathered that Fabric isn’t that liked but I’m hoping if someone can give neutral opinions. Right now the situation is that I’m really bored with my job. I dislike the dashboard building, it’s boring. And talking with business why my numbers dont match their excel is well… also boring. I like the modelling part and the back end side but I also enjoy optimizing and trying different solutions and understanding how much our reporting costs us (computationally).\n\nFor context: based in EU, no kids, less than 3y of part time experience and now 1,5y full time\n\nEdit: I chose the Fabric role :)",

        "content": "Teams meetings with transcription enabled. One hour of discussion quickly turns into 10k+ words of unstructured text.\n\nExtracting decisions, action items, and open questions manually doesn’t scale. The common approach is to push the full transcript into a large cloud model and hope for a usable summary.\n\nThat approach breaks down for a few reasons.\n\nLarge transcripts often exceed context windows. Even when they fit, you’re dependent on external infrastructure, which can be problematic for sensitive meetings. Most importantly, you lose determinism: the same input can produce different outputs.\n\nI ended up treating the transcript like any other batch-processing problem.\n\nInstead of processing the full text in one go, the transcript is handled incrementally:\n\n- split into manageable chunks\n- each chunk summarized independently using a stable structure\n- clean intermediate results written out\n- a final aggregation pass over those intermediates to produce the high-level summary\n\nIn practical terms:\n\n- the model never sees the full transcript at once\n- context is controlled explicitly by the pipeline, not by a prompt window\n- intermediate structure is preserved instead of flattened\n- the final output is based on accumulated, cleaned data rather than raw text\n\nThis reframing changes the requirements completely.\n\nOne interesting side effect of this approach was realizing that model size stopped being a deciding factor altogether. Once the task is constrained and the workflow is explicit, even relatively small models perform reliably enough for this kind of summarization.\n\nOnce handled this way, transcript size stops being a concern. A small local model is sufficient, because it’s just one interchangeable component in a controlled pipeline. The value comes from explicit inputs, deterministic steps, and reproducible outputs, not from model size.\n\nThis runs entirely locally on a modest machine, no GPU, no cloud services.\n\nI’m curious how others here approach large meeting transcripts or similar unstructured text when the goal is a clean, deterministic result rather than maximal model capability.",

I want to add per-row annotations (llm-as-a-judge scores), ideally without touching the original text data. \n\nSo for a given dataset, I want to add a new column. This seemed like a perfect use case for Iceberg. Iceberg does let you evolve the table schema, including adding a column. BUT you can only add a column with a default value.

So despite being based on parquet, a column-oriented format, I need to re-write the entire source text data (gigabytes of data) just to add \\~1mb of annotations. This feels wildly inefficient.\n\nI considered just storing the column in its own table and then joining them. This does work but the joins are annoying to work with, and I suspect query engines do not optimize well a \"join on row\\_number\" operation.\n\nI've been exploring using little-known features of parquet like the file\\_path field to store column data in external files. But literally zero parquet clients support this.\n\nI'm running out of ideas for how to work with this data efficiently. It's bad enough that I am considering building my own table format if I can’t find a solution. Anyone have suggestions?",

Now I can do logical replication on PostgreSQL and GCP provides data stream and I can capture those changes on BigQuery. Challenge is I can't setup logical replication on read replicas, Datastream will replicate changes from Master Instance but that can be deal breaker as it is operational instance and can suffer some performance issue due to sharing it with analytical workload. Another challenge is number of replication slots and managing them. If I have many tables on one PostgreSql server then I am limited by setting up this replication to Analytical Store.\n\n  \nIt would be great to understand how are people managing this ingestion in general at scale ?",

        "content": "Working on one of my first bigger data projects as a junior and I’m a bit stuck.\n\nThe source system stores timestamps in CST (no DST); the target tables must be UTC.\n\nI extract data using a rolling 7–14 day window, filtered by a business date (midnight-to-midnight in CST) as these are essentially log tables. This is necessary because there’s no last-modified field in the source tables and yet records can be updated up to 7–14 days after creation.\n\nThe target tables are partitioned by the business date, and I overwrite partitions on each run. This works in theory when extracting full days, but timezone conversion complicates things. When converting CST to UTC, some records shift into the next day, meaning a “full day” CST extract can become partial days in UTC, potentially overwriting partitions with incomplete data.\n\nI’m avoiding MERGE because there’s no reliable primary key and analysts want to keep duplicates (some are valid), so partition overwrites seem like the best option. Essentially I just want to clone the source tables into BigQuery.\n\nOne idea is to extract data as UTC midnight-to-midnight, but the only apparent option in the source is extracting as GMT Monrovia (which I think maps to UTC). This is what I’m edging towards, but not sure if extracting data in a different timezone to what it’s natively stored as is a recommended approach?\n\nCan someone please sanity check my approach and let me know if it’s a bad idea, or if I’m missing anything?",

Then have a secondary glue job that reads new parquet files and writes them to Iceberg tables. This can be done every 2 mins? Can I setup something like a microbatch glue job approach here for this? What I don't like about this is there are two components here and there is a batch/polling approach to check for changes and write to Iceberg. \n\nGlue streaming - Glue streaming job that reads the kafka topics then directly writes to Iceberg. A lot more boilerplate code compared to the configuration code above. Also not near real time, job needs to be scheduled. Need to see how to handle failures more visibly. \n\nWhile near real time would be ideal, 2-3 mins delay is ok for landing in bronze. Ordering is important. The same data also will need to be cleaned for insertion in silver tables, transformed and loaded via rest apis to another service (hopefully in another 2-3 mins). Also thinking to handle idempotency in the silver layer or does that need to be handled in bronze?\n\nOne thing to consider also is compaction optimizations.

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m looking to pivot in my career, I’m a DBA though due to potential career growth and the demands that come with it (On-call, constant production support etc,), I’m thinking of a shift towards more data engineer type roles. I have some previous experience with Python and plan on quickly up-skilling and implementing as much as I can within my current role through automation, using AWS SDK etc as well as making projects in my own time. My current role now involves managing Aurora as part of it, there’s also ‘ownership of data’ and everything that brings amongst our AWS deployments.\n\nI guess my current role is transitioning away from standard DBA things though I want to make more deliberate movements towards data engineering largely for financial reasons. I’m currently on about £75k, I have no plans to move at the moment but with the job market things can change and tomorrow my company could decide I am no longer needed. I’d like to do what I can to be in a position where I could pivot if needed without taking too much of a hit salary wise.\n\nObviously I’ve not given too much information,  but can you give an idea of the skills I ought to prioritise, things to focus on etc based on the above and if possible given an idea as to how well versed I need to be with them. e.g. with AWS is it a case of simply using EKS, MKS and being able to write functional python code or does it need to be super performant. Also is it realistic and achievable to pivot from DBA to Data Engineer on a salary of around £75k without too much of a reduction or am I being unrealistic?",

Plus, it handles big datasets without hogging memory.\n\nIt's still in beta, I'm testing it out, but overall it's running reliably. Yeah, I built it with LLM help would've taken me half a year otherwise. But linters, tests, and checks are all there.\n\nIt also plays nice natively with PyArrow data. Right now, I'm prepping a test repo with examples using Dagster + ConnectorX + iceberg-loader. Should end up as a fast open-source data loader since everything runs on Arrow.\n\nWould love if any devs take a look with their experienced eye and suggest improvements or feedback.\n\nhttps://github.com/vndvtech/iceberg-loader",

Should I stick with RDS MySQL for handling transactional workloads, like upserting data from APIs, while using Snowflake for BI and analysis? Currently, we're being billed around $550/month for RDS MySQL, and I want to know if switching to Snowflake will help reduce costs and overcome bottlenecks like slow queries and concurrency issues.\n\nAlternatively, I’ve been thinking about using Lambda functions to move data to S3 and then pull it into Snowflake for analysis and Power BI reports.

        "author": "poopdood696969",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m running into a Snowflake permissions issue that I can’t quite reason through, and I’m hoping someone can tell me if this is expected or if I’m missing something obvious.\n\nContext: we’re on Snowflake, tables are built with dbt and orchestrated by Dagster. Tables are materialized using DBT (so the compiled dbt code is usingcreate-or-replace semantics). This has been the case for a long time and hasn’t changed recently.\n\nWe effectively have two roles involved:\n\n* a read-only reporting role (SELECT access)\n* a write-capable role that exists mainly so Terraform can create/provision tables (INSERT / TRUNCATE, etc.)\n\nImportant detail: Terraform is *not* managing grants yet. It’s only being explored. No Snowflake grants are being applied via Terraform at this point.\n\nHistorically, the reporting role had database-level grants:\n\n* usage on the database\n* usage on all schemas and future schemas\n* select on all tables\n* select on future tables\n* select on all views\n* select on future views\n\nThis worked fine. The assumption was that when dbt recreates a table, Snowflake re-applies SELECT via future grants.\n\nThe only change made recently was adding schema-level future grants for the write-capable role (insert/truncate on future tables in the schema). No pipeline code changed. No dbt config changed. No materialization logic changed.\n\nImmediately after that, we started seeing this behavior:\n\n* when dbt/Dagster recreates a table, the write role’s privileges come back\n* the reporting role’s SELECT does not\n\nThis was very obvious and repeatable.\n\nWhat’s strange is that the database-level future SELECT grants for the reporting role still exist. There are no revoke statements in query history. Ownership isn’t changing. Schemas are not managed access. Transient vs permanent tables doesn’t seem to matter.\n\nThe only thing that fixes it is adding schema-level future SELECT for the reporting role. Once that’s in place, recreated tables keep SELECT access as expected.\n\nSo now everything works, but I’m left scratching my head about why:\n\n* database-level future SELECT used to be sufficient\n* introducing schema-level future grants for another role caused this to surface\n* schema-level future SELECT is now required for reporting access to survive table recreation\n\nI’m fine standardizing on schema-level future grants everywhere, but I’d really like to understand what’s actually happening under the hood. Is Snowflake effectively applying future grants based on the most specific scope available? Are database-level future grants just not something people rely on in practice for dbt-heavy environments?\n\nCurious if anyone else has seen this or has a better mental model for how Snowflake applies future grants when tables are recreated.",

I assumed the career path was basically just moving from junior to senior backend roles, building APIs and scaling web services. It felt like the industry was 90% CRUD apps and centered around the same few \"cliché\" frontend and backend frameworks.\n\nRecently, I started looking into Quant Finance, and it has been a total eye-opener. It is a completely different world where the problems aren't about HTTP requests or CSS; they are about high-frequency execution, mathematical modeling, and processing massive amounts of data in real-time. It made me realize how many deep technical niches we completely ignore because they aren't as \"loud\" as web development.\n\nI wanted to share this because if you are starting to feel a bit burnt out or bored with standard web stacks, I really encourage you to look at these non-obvious fields. Whether it is Quant, Embedded Systems, or Bio-informatics, there are rabbit holes out there that are way more technically challenging than the standard paths. I spent years thinking I had seen most of what the industry had to offer, but I am finding out I was barely scratching the surface of what we can actually do with code.",

Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing \"execute\" and watching your drone do all the hard work.\n\nUnlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.\n\nFarming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.\n\nProgramming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.\n\nWhile it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.\n\nIf you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.\n\nAlthough the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the \"File Watcher\" setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.\n\nHope you like the coding game concept! :)\n\nYou can find it here:   \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The\\_Farmer\\_Was\\_Replaced/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160?utm_source=RD)",

Felt that I got in by sheer luck. \n\nAcademically, I’m not smart. I was generally a B-student back in CS college. But I did enjoy SWE mods like networks, distributed systems, or even learning algorithms. \n\nOver the past 3 years, my job has been rather chill and I don’t read outside of work. I didn’t learn much while doing frontend for 2 years - my code looks more or less the same because frontend frameworks are very abstracted at my company.\n\nNow that I’m in my 3rd year without promotion, I’ve been looking for jobs. I’m terrible at Leetcode, not good at systems design, my problem-solving skills aren’t great either so I’ve been failing interviews here and there. Sometimes I get frontend interviews, which will test JavaScript or React or even HTML/CSS, where each language/framework has a lot of concepts to learn about. \n\nI feel that there’s endless to study for and I’m fighting against a bar that is high but I can’t even see where it is.\n\nIt’s been demoralising. I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. \n\nI have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. \nBut it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.\n\nAs an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.\n\nI think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using. \n\nBut now I feel so exhausted just by the thought of studying. It feels endless. I feel that I’m a terrible engineer and that I’m paying the price of not working hard for the past few years. \n",

People who don't program won't know the difference, and experienced programmers genuinely won't give a shit (and might in fact think your code is inferior, since it's less readable now).\n\nBut most importantly, memorizing lots of tricks won't make you a good programmer. You know what makes you a good programmer? Understanding fundamentals and learning creative problem solving, that's what you really need.\n\nPlease, for the love of God, stop following pop-coding \"coaches\". Their advice is often useless, and can waste your time by making you focus on the wrong things. As far as they're concerned, they WANT you to waste your time on them because it gives them more watchtime.

I’m currently working as a working student at a software company, and most of my day-to-day work is focused on implementing features and writing code. While this is valuable experience, I don’t really get the opportunity to deeply learn or reflect on the underlying concepts and mechanics of the web. The problem I see here is that there are things I dont even know about and I would I need a good overview about the things that they even exist, like a book for example. Of course, I could just google individual topics, but the problem is that I don’t always know *what* I should even be googling. That’s why a well-structured roadmap, book, or resource where the relevant information is collected and explained in a coherent way would be extremely helpful.\n\nBecause of that, I want to be very clear: I’m **not** looking for tutorials on JavaScript, CSS, HTML syntax, or how to use frameworks like React, Vue, etc. I already work with those technologies on a daily basis.\n\nWhat I’m interested in are topics like:\n\n* Authentication & authorization (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.)\n* Cookies, storage, and state management\n* Caching strategies (browser, CDN, server-side)\n* HTTP fundamentals and request/response lifecycle\n* Security concepts (CORS, CSP, CSRF, XSS, same-origin policy)\n* How browsers and servers actually interact\n* General web architecture and system design concepts\n\nI want to better understand *why* things work the way they do, not just *how* to implement them in a specific stack.\n\nIf you know any resources that explain these concepts well (beginner-friendly but not superficial is ideal), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I've been using freeCodeCamp since 2023 and I loved its structure: learn a concept -> guided project -> unguided project. That format works great for me and I learned a lot of stuff that I still remember.\n\nThe big problem is: FCC removed its video content. Staying focused on long lectures is a huge problem for me, because of that I can't learn on freeCodeCamp anymore.\n\nSo now I’m looking at alternatives:\n\n* Scrimba: seems interactive and video-based, which I need, but from what I've understood there are no projects where you actually get to write *everything* on your own and it's really shallow in terms of libraries and general depth\n* The Odin Project: To me personally it seems impossible to learn here, because there's lots and lots of text which is just a big no-no for my small clip thinking brain (thank you, tiktok).\n* freeCodeCamp: still amazing structure, but now mostly text-only which also makes it hard. The bite sized video lectures were perfect, but they're not there anymore.\n\nI’m not a total beginner. I know vanilla JS pretty well (up until DOM stuff from FCC), but once frameworks, Node libs, databases, backend tools, etc. enter the game, I stops working. So I'm searching for a deeper dive into the full ecosystem:\n\n* JavaScript & TypeScript\n* Node.js + Basic libraries like os, fs, http\n* React + Tailwind\n* Git, Linux, Docker\n* SQL\n* possibly Kubernetes and CI/CD\n\nIdeally, the platform should:\n\n* go really deep, not just scratching on the surface-level\n* include project-based practice (guided and unguided are nice)\n* offer both frontend and backend (can be in two different places) or full-stack\n* videos would help a **lot** (<- underline that twice)\n* certificates are a huge plus but not required, if it's a good course then certs aren't important at all\n\nBudget isn’t the deciding factor. I just want the most effective structure for actually retaining and practicing the material.\n\nFor people who’ve used these platforms or any other platforms: which one fits this learning style best?\n\nThanks in advance!",

But about six months ago, I gave it another shot and started grinding through the exercises.\n\nI recently finished the first three chapters, and it honestly blew my mind. It gave me a whole new perspective on programming. But here's the catch: before the book, I wrote spaghetti code that \"just worked.\" Now... I’m painfully aware that I’m writing garbage, but I don't know where to start fixing it. (Honestly, I want to fire myself after realizing how terrible my code is.)\n\nThat's the problem.

Since I was 18 or so I became interested in systems programming, gui apps, games and physics engines, etc. I've been reading reddit and other forums and I've been watching YT videos about programming, and I have doubts about which path to take. I'm planning to start learning DSA, and basic things and to do the advent of code from several years. I'm between this options:\n\n\\- **Use C**: it's very low but the toolchain...\n\n**- Use C++20/23:** quite complex but again the toolchain...\n\n**- Use Rust:** excellent toolchain but more difficult to find \"beginner\" books etc., about it. Not impossible and I like the memory safety things.\n\n**- Use C#:** good documentation and toolchain but maybe I will feel I want something lower.\n\nDo you have any advice about what would give me the best experience? What about other paths? I don't want to rush and I will do it in my free time.\n\n**P.S.:** before telling me to do things, I've been doing little programs these days, mostly with rust and I made a webpage with react.\n\n**TLDR:** for someone with basic knowledge of programming that is interested in animations using libraries, simulations, gui apps, engines, etc., which of the languages do you think will bring me the best experience? Any other alternative?",

I want to choose C or C++ over python. What I've found looking at a lot C++ vs Python first questions on this reddit is that, Python makes it easier to pick up programming in general, but if you're willing to take the harder start then it's way more beneficial to your long term understanding of coding to learn C/C++ first because your brain solidifies good traits that are really hard to relearn from python.\n\nIf any one has any comments on this specific parity that'd be cool. The formatting of Python also seems to be a cheat that isn't as healthy as having your base reference in C/C++'s symbolic referencing over indentation.\n\nMy real question because it does seem C style is better for long term than python first and I intend to learn both, is it best to learn C or C++? It appears C and Python are around the same learning time and C++ is way longer than learning C. Should I do C first then Python to get the benefits of understanding C style code with Python's greater utility and universal usage, or should I tough it out and do C++ , which I guess is extended C, then Python? So essentially my perspective is C is much shorter and faster to learn, but C++ has much more use case, despite the fact they both equally prime you for more \"close to the metal\" thought than high abstract languages like python, what's more worth it first?\n\nThank you\n\nTLDR; I think the first impression and perspective solidifying advantages of C and C++ beats the ease of introduction with Python for first language, thoughts?

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\nHi everyone, I’m looking for honest advice and different perspectives on a possible career change (or career expansion).\n\nI have a degree in International Business, but after graduating I worked in roles unrelated to my degree, so I don’t have professional experience directly connected to it. At the same time, I’ve become genuinely interested in learning programming / software engineering — not only as a potential career switch, but also as a new skill I could combine with my business background in the future and as a strong plus on my resume.\n\nHere’s my situation and my doubts:\n\n• I can’t realistically commit to a full-time traditional university (time + cost).\n• A bootcamp appeals to me because of the structure, guidance, accountability, and also the opportunity to meet people and network.\n• English is not my first language, and although I use it daily, I want to keep improving. Being in an environment where I’m pushed to communicate more in English feels like a plus.\n\nSo far, I’ve started learning on my own:\n\t•\tfreeCodeCamp\n\t•\tPlanning to try The Odin Project next\n\nI’m realistic about expectations:\n\t•\tI know a bootcamp won’t guarantee a job\n\t•\tI know the market is competitive\n\t•\tI understand I may not get hired right away\n\nMy goal is to build real skills, start with solid foundations, and keep studying long-term. Even if I initially apply for jobs related to my original career\n\nOne important factor is that I currently have the option to stop working for about 6 months, since my husband can support me during that time. That’s why I’m seriously considering an intensive learning path like a bootcamp, so I can fully focus during that period.\n\nI looked into Hack Reactor, but my experience has been concerning:\n\t•\tI was told about a full scholarship. I applied and 3 weeks later they informed it wasn’t available for now. \n\t•\tI pass the CCAT test, contacted them to know about the next steps. Someone told me they will contact me but is been almost a month a haven’t heard for them. \n\nBecause of that, I’m unsure whether Hack Reactor — or bootcamps in general — are still an option right now.\n\nSo my main questions are:\n\t1.\tBootcamp vs community college vs online university — what would you recommend in 2026 for someone in my position?\n\t2.\tIs a bootcamp still worth it mainly for structure, foundations, and momentum?\n\t3.\tAre online universities that people often recommend on Reddit actually a good option?\n\t4.\tIf you were in my situation — limited time/money, strong motivation, and a non-tech degree — what path would you choose?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences.

We are currently have modules regarding databases, advanced programming and api development with a client app. The problem is that the database lectures was so theoritical but for the assignments we had to create 2 DB systems with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, without learning any of these languages during lectures. I hardly managed to do the assignments since it was the first time I had to write postgre and mongo and they assessments required to apply advanced knowledge to code the systems. On the API module it was the same. The professor focused on teaching material regarding how to complete the weekly assignments but the final one was doable since the most of the part covered from the weekly tasks. On advanced programming we had to use c# that we used in the previous years but we had to create a cross platform app with blazor and we never saw examples during lectures on how to set up a blazor app and I felt overwhelmed from the amount of reseach I had to do myself. The following semester we have an IoT's module and the prof told us we will create an IoT device in a simulator with python for the final assessment. We never touched python before. The other module is about game development and they changed the curriculum to use unreal engine with c++ instead of unity, we never wrote c++ before. The last module is about penetration testing and the module guide says that we will have to write bash scripts and python to simulate some attacks on our Uni's servers. What do you recommend me to study during our next semester's gap in order to cope with the assessments and not get frustrated again?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm trying to understand why I can pass arrays into functions by declaring a pointer parameter. I've done this several times to pass arrays of different lengths into general purpose functions (along with their lengths) for software that I've written, but although I thought I had a grasp on the inner workings, I've found I'm unable to fully explain what's going on.\n\nHere's my understanding, using a simple example. \n\n    #include <iostream>\n    \n    using std::cout;\n    \n    float averageScores(float* scores, int length) \n    {\n        float sum;\n       \n        for (int i=0; i<length; i++)\n        {\n            sum = sum + scores[i];\n        }\n        float average = sum/length;\n        return average;\n    }\n    \n    \n    int main()\n    {\n        float testScores [] = {81.2, 90, 91.8, 76.3, 78.4};\n        int numScores = sizeof(testScores)/sizeof(testScores[0]);\n        float classAverage = averageScores(testScores, numScores);\n        cout<<classAverage;\n        return 0;\n    } \n\nMight not be the most efficient way to do this but you get the idea. What I've done is passed an array of test scores into a function that calculates their average. However, to my understanding, when I declare an array variable, it's actually interpreted as something like &testScores\\[0\\], or the memory location of the first float variable in testScores. \n\nFirst question: the entire array is stored at that memory location, correct? So if the memory location is something like 0x5ffe60, that's where the entire array is stored?\n\nNow, in my function I have declared the parameters float\\* scores and int length. float\\* scores is a pointer. So, this to me seems like creating a pointer to a memory address, similar to the classic example folks usually show when discussing pointers:\n\nint x = 6;  \nint \\*pX = \\&x;\n\nWhere pX is a pointer to the memory location at which the value of x is stored. So, similarly, it seems that \n\nfloat \\*scores = &testScores\\[0\\].\n\nNow, my ultimate question: given that C++ is particular about variable types matching, does this mean that &x and &testScores\\[0\\] are \"pointer types?\" Like, \\* and & are just inverses of the same variable type, and that's why I can write a function that expects a pointer and pass it a memory address.\n\nSo both \\*scores and &testScores\\[0\\] are float\\* numbers? \n\nI think I'm missing something because my explanation feels inconsistent. If anyone could clarify what I have right and wrong about this, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

You meet new people, work with different teams, and learn new things beyond regular classroom coding. Hackathons improve not just coding skills, but also communication, collaboration, and networking. You also get to know about new platforms, tools, and technologies, which is really helpful. What makes hackathons exciting is the experience of solving a real-world problem within a limited time — whether it’s a 24-hour or 36-hour hackathon. Thinking of an idea, building a solution from scratch, and implementing it under pressure is challenging but incredibly fun and rewarding.\n\nOverall, the experience is top-notch and honestly enjoyable.

        "content": "Hello everyone! Been lurking around, haven't posted though.\n\nI've been wondering about my career and its direction for about a year at least and I felt that's it would be good to share and ask for advice and opinions.\n\nSome background.\n\nI'm a programmer with about ten years of experience. I come from a math background. Never completed my uni studies but I was fortunate enough to build somegood foundations that helped a ton in programming. \n\nProgramming for me was also my only hobby for most of the last decade. Read many books, tried many tools and languages. Had tons of fun on many late nights home.\n\nRecent two years the excitement dropped off and I've been enjoying non programing stuff a lot. I've organically ended up doing team lead/tech lead stuff for the last five years and I've accustomed to that. My job is primarily reviewing, mentoring, planning and estimating effort.\n\nDue to the recent advancements in AI I've started feeling the heat. It seems to me that much of the toolset that used to make us competent as programmers is fading away. Now, as a team lead/tech lead I feel that I do a good job exactly because I've spent so many hours fiddling with stuff from many different angles. But in the age of AI I have much less consifidence in my ability to reasons about those genai system that I think we'll be dealing with in the upcoming years.\n\nI've tried to move to areas of game development and design, graphics programming but I gave up after a while. I did not feel the urge to pursue and do what it takes to jump to another field. \n\nRight now I'm asked to design systems based on AI which, I don't feel equipped to do.\n\nAnd even though I know that I'm through a burnout for about three years now, I appreciatey job. I appreciate how it has transformed my life and I've seen able to do and own things I never would have if I did not spend so much time studying cs and programming. \n\nThis is why I decided to create a self made curriculum of data science, machine learning, deep learning and finally genai in order get myself familiarize with those concepts. This is something that's I evaluate to take at least a year. I think that if I am to continue managing development teams and since I seems to a place in our toolset, I think it makes sense. I feel it would boost my abilities and therefore my confidence in order to continue doing a good job.\n\nI don't feel like I'm going to definitely lose my job to AI. But I feel like that if I don't expand my knowledge in any way, I leave it to chance. I don't know if I'm maybe too pessimistic about this, but my gut call is saying that it's to re evaluate some things and it's time to be proactive again.\n\nThought I'd share with you, I expect that many might have somewhat similar thoughts, with all this ai madness going around constantly. Would really like to read your experiences and point of view. ",

A simplified example:\n\n`SomeClass::unit_under_test()\n{\n    this->f();  // changes the state of this   \n    // ...    \n}`\n\nI've used C++ syntax since that's the language I'm using, but the question itself is not specific to C++. For those unfamiliar, `this` refers to the current object of the class that you are in scope of.\n\nMy question is: how do you properly test `unit_under_test`? \n\nI am not really that interested in testing `f()`, because there is a separate unit test for that. I also can't mock it without making changes to source code, because there is no way to link in a mock for `f()` that will end up getting called here instead of the actual member function.\n\nYou could also imagine that `f()` could be fairly complex. It could itself call a bunch of other functions that do various things and which should themselves be unit tested. Digging into the implementation of those functions starts to feel like it's getting outside the scope of the test of just this function.\n\nSo, it seems hard to know how best to test this kind of thing, and I wanted to know what others' thoughts are.",

        "content": "HarfBuzz experts,\n\nI’m trying to use HarfBuzz 8.3.0 with FreeType 2.13.2 and LVGL 9.2 on a bare-metal embedded target and I’m running into hard faults during Indic (GSUB) shaping. I want to check whether this is a known limitation or something wrong in my build/integration.\n\nTarget:NXP [i.MX](http://i.MX) RT1064 (1 MB internal SRAM + 4 MB Flash) on bare-metal\n\nToolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc with newlib-nano\n\nDisplay: 16x128 LED matrix\n\nUI: LVGL with a custom HarfBuzz text shaping hook\n\nStack: size - 64kB ; stack region: SRAM\\_DTC\n\nHeap: size - 128kB ; heap region: SRAM\\_OC2\n\nLibraries:\n\nFreeType 2.13.2 (static) + HarfBuzz 8.3.0 (static, Meson build)\n\nFont: NotoSansDevanagari, AnjaliOldLipi and so on as a C array\n\nAll threads, atomics, glib, ICU, getenv, etc. are disabled. No pthreads, no OS services.\n\nI have two build setups with very different behavior.\n\nCase 1 (non-cyclic build):\n\nI build FreeType without HarfBuzz, then build HarfBuzz with FreeType, and do NOT rebuild FreeType again with HarfBuzz enabled.\n\nResult: English text works and Indic gives me hard fault at GSUB.\n\nCase 2 (cyclic build, as described in FreeType docs):\n\nBuild FreeType without HarfBuzz.\n\nBuild HarfBuzz with FreeType enabled.\n\nRebuild FreeType with HarfBuzz enabled.\n\nResult: English and Indic text breaks, hard fault or hb\\_font\\_destroy gives error.\n\nThe fault consistently appears somewhere in the GSUB path. The backtrace usually goes through hb\\_shape(), hb\\_shape\\_full(), hb\\_shape\\_plan\\_execute(), hb\\_ot\\_shape(), and apply\\_forward() in GSUB. In some runs the crash appears closer to hb\\_font\\_destroy(), in others during hb\\_shape(), so I suspect memory corruption or an assumption violation rather than a single bad call.\n\nImportant observation:\n\nWhen FreeType is NOT rebuilt with HarfBuzz, English works but Indic fails.\n\nWhen FreeType IS rebuilt with HarfBuzz, both English and Indic fail and I get a hard fault.\n\nOccasionally, I also get an access violation and I found this:\n\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation)\n\nMy understanding (please correct me if wrong):\n\nHarfBuzz does all shaping (GSUB/GPOS, Indic, Arabic, etc.) and FreeType loads glyphs and rasterizes them. The FreeType ↔ HarfBuzz cyclic dependency mainly exists for auto-hinting improvements, not for shaping correctness.\n\nSince my display is a very low-resolution 16x128 LED matrix, hinting quality is not very important, but correct glyph order is.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Is HarfBuzz GSUB shaping expected to work on bare-metal targets with no OS and newlib-nano?\n2. Is rebuilding FreeType with HarfBuzz actually required if shaping is already done by HarfBuzz?\n3. Are there GSUB code paths that assume stack size, libc behavior, or memory features that may not exist on embedded targets?\n4. How much stack and heap would be required for proper Indic rendering?\n\nI have attached an image from the IDE incase anyone wants to check.If you happen to know someone who might be familiar with this issue, I’d really appreciate it if you could share this with them. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEven a confirmation that this configuration is unsupported would be very helpful. Thanks a lot for any pointers you can share.

Despite that, my role remained secure because of the technical depth, domain knowledge, and familiarity I have with the projects and their complexity. That context and continuity turned out to matter.\n\n\n\nWith the increasing hostility and constant uncertainty around H-1B, I eventually stopped trying to plan a future here. I asked my employer whether transferring me to an international office was an option, either in the Netherlands or Canada.\n\n\n\nThey agreed.\n\n\n\nSo I’ll be moving to the Netherlands soon, keeping the same job, just no longer in the US. A close friend did the same thing a few months ago and moved her role to Canada.\n\n\n\nWhat’s frustrating is that this feels entirely avoidable. The US doesn’t just lose a worker in situations like this, it loses a highly skilled contributor and the taxes that come with that. The work doesn’t disappear. It simply moves elsewhere.\n\n\n\nAfter a decade of building, leading, and contributing here, it’s hard not to see this as a self-inflicted loss. I’m not leaving because I wanted to. I’m leaving because staying stopped making sense.\n\n\n\nJust sharing my experience.",

I’ve been working in developer tools and infrastructure for most of my career and a lot of places I was applying to wanted much deeper experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. I had worked with all of those at the previous two jobs I had in the 6 years prior to this search, but hadn’t really dug in deep on them and it showed in those early screens.\n\n  \n\n\nI also got several rejections in the final rounds towards the end where the feedback was that I did very well but someone else just had a bit more relevant experience so they were getting the offer. I even had one recruiter say that the hiring manager tried to get headcount approved to extend offers to me and the other candidate but got denied and I was the second choice.\n\n  \n\n\nHere’s the details of the two offers I did get:\n\n  \n\n\n**Seed stage startup**\n\n* Salary: $190k\n* Target bonus: 10%\n* Equity: $88k in options\n* Remote\n\n\n\n**Meta**\n\n* IC5\n* Salary: $215k\n* Target bonus: 15%\n* RSUs: $710k over 4 years\n* TC: ~$425k\n* Hybrid 3x/week\n\n\n\n[Sankey source](https://sankeymatic.com/build/?i=IIBxBsEsFMBMAIDaA2AHAXXgOQPbwE7QDOIOAdkdAFCgQwKIDsArJgErQBW0AxgC5wqAeiHwAhkSIBXALaQyAc3Hhw8HADN4fABbRxPHtBACEYsFB5i%2BkckQLEp4E%2DHnxLKogBp4UkLCt6kJpkvMREYvgAnjTm9EgATBjwAMJiKvAA7qKEPPhSkAL4MXRwCZgA8mRQIeKSYTLQZHzFUKWIAIyYABJipuCEvZEuTdD4AG4wGaXqOPhaugQ44NS0rQzx7Lx5BaP2JOSwgqtxHZgAkmQFkGlavNqX7otSZLBUVD19A7BD8oUT0FMEDM5jo9PglnpTvAONx%2BIIqBxcvlCntSC82ht4ABxbQ4IgmN6I7YohqSMQKUoNJDtZAAFkwAHUCtpYIQMgitsjdqTwhSEFSUElUuksvYkTsikSuXMeeTKZDaUkcXiCVKJfBZXyNZD2vToVxeKrOerNfKkHrKtU9BJKJIGk0OeKSWE5fydedLtYbgIePdII9wc9XlRhapRTlibsoQAVMQAaz0uKpNsgCjI9uaocy2WNKI6AE5NrCCVnw7mo8xOvALldvXcHjdAy8Q2kwzmnVGAMyM5msgEtkXtyNzJgVKrya11O2NTOt7Ni4fU1jY3H4%2BGxhPwJOToip9MzsrwJk6PvsjeJnDJyR7jPUouGwTnreXnc3g%2BITEAMXkjZwQaoT7brUu5preULHiybLiOoKJiAYRjWIoajqOooyEtAcG6Agf58FoeAyEMIR8Bksxxne%2BrFoIHCYaUOF4RqhHQMRpHkbgqK2NQVA1l6qg%2Bn6AZ%2Di8CTIPecKvNx1y8fW%2Dq%2DkG1J6t%2BZCyc2El1r6DaqE2DDtAADJgypruJnqSbc6kyZpgkMMugEvsBb4OqpUlmQJcngb2bJccZan8cp2ljlawH1DObyWhOgXTk0SDdhRD6vKFNQ2kFkWIHqEGnlQ8U7kluEpR6tZOT5Fn%2Dpl4VEGB0WKb5byVUVQkdMuMKxVQNVPHVmJpVBYgwbscGGMY8hKBoqFFC1WnkeUKFoaNlnkdGGEyBqVi%2BgNbxzWIC0yEt2gDeNk1FBle3kcA8HGIIE3DeRAAivBWsGABcjVifAADEyTJDpH06VQd1sYQ%2BwUHoz2MLSwPA99pZDtKL0AEbMDwtLxIw30dQCL35vmqDqIwnbfcdfXOM9H2fp%2BH3feduyEzpPD5qTd2OaZhWtQglO0swtPTXJlOMLAtPXTwt0vR9CO0yjGTQbBJ2IYNh3PYcYg0%2DmuOxKUlOfV9D0Yb6tFSLhfD4YxzH4GRqufd9arOmSWpUibtMlYlEW4c9nbxNDnY6Ujd0GQTyDc8g0DqzZV4gfukVOy7btI7uABeehi%2B0%2BbxF9W7wLpqBfZt%2BAKK4qjtPEVAECnedaCnqD59D8CJ1Q0NKDwSyzC9KGN%2Bo%2Bd8PgYgUCAEQHlgVBkDghyZIX%2BfaPAbP5yQcE7SwZezIccxJ6Cyb57X4D189qAb5v%2Bc4J3PAFEM7RUOoq9izwUjjFY596DpAB0zD5%2DIuj4AU6jggtfARBSzRuHXczPejADFZqF3vveAt9WZUHAGISIdFZ49R1peKw%2Dp86cCkPiIIMDn5ZwoNgFBaDrDqEiI0WAdge72DGKMSgCg24gBHmQqwH9lpkFrjICATFiB63gCELu%2BJIFiGhtAcAdgV5rzVqTLckAB5kO2gobQUBZG4VvtPeAMwmjqDgnocIFAAC0lBn7N3gFaCee8kK3yLoQKB1gKHRz0O0XS%2BdNppgwSnUmUCBHgCUsmMAGF8B2AAJrj0gDHFOyB85TFTNoXCtJXH8MEWMNIUhrTeIiP4%2DO6hHDgBADkSAu5yDwACfAUgu5rB5PcTgdkmRoARKiTE9xRSrh5LEAgtIe4wHjy1smBBaTIC%2BNwgI4E1B4DQwGHGUgvwK5fXieARJKjZibVwgAck8DfBZ%2BcsnQHUJAAAHvABZqz4DSBQts3ZqzF7QCGpQXCYh4ChKGW0tw9yEDpyYtcjMNgKDtwTJEeZ%2Dp8n5ygOgmQ0M0jt0MKkmQOAKHwGOKUbRt8dK6R0swbwcKb66niCDKgEKoW%2DWIGiSgYCb5Ip0p2fMKLb66WYLSLFkK9Dm25C6K2ehtHtDvp2ZAyBvAUpBtS7FdLNZYTUDreiBEuFMRIkbQlH12ioGRfAVFnZUCJBxnylIc4ywdjmKitO8R8ztC5WihFOk86qrtlOMqB5UXMHzMwZAnZyU3zdgik1tLqxeQKhpJm8rb7WvZfEA18R44%2BxpVCr2pR4U2vzLSA17RGAIvvqq0W4seqSx2kNXYqK7HxFtTG5AGND6qo5kJBVMrs0Gp0nqzsvLXWB1fKBS14DaT5kVQGukjBQmqses4eF7Qq3lsVcwF1UKk3worS2qVaBEghr0OTLV8LkAVrlai41iRS6qrxghcNRKkXsodanZgCbXV8wFqOn2DqdKs3aIeqFHxlBfB%2BCMcYkxpj11BIsZY3qb60jzagaNn6PqJEVqqtaG0to7UzagTs1rz0XtQAW119K5h%2DTRIcBAqLkDxE7O2h1aBkDWqAA)\n\nEDIT: Explaining my terrible labels: \n\n* Withdrew after accepting offer: I used this for the companies I withdrew from once I accepted Meta's offer.\n* Rejected: means the company rejected me at some point\n* Ghosted: the recruiter stopped responding to me without an outright rejection\n* Call w/ recruiter: Only used this if it was the first step before anything else after either applying or getting their email or LinkedIn message.

Discovery (HBO Max) then Bloomberg, and now fall internship return offer from AWS.\n\nRight now:\n\n\\- I am signed with Bloomberg for full-time SWE (NYC) 191K cash (no stocks bc private)\n\n\\- I also have a return offer at AWS (going to be on SageMaker/BedRock which is pretty good space at AWS to be in bc doesnt get affected from lay offs in the present not sure if that would change) TC is 205k from what I heard (NYC)\n\n\\- I previously interned on SageMaker, so my background is more ML infra and I enjoy working on MLE problems so had lot of fun especially when I got to do some low level ML stuff. I had a great 3 months and got strong incline and got told I was the best intern they had and built good connections with the team i would return to, but I guess wlb is the big con\n\n\\- I reneged a Warner Bros. Discovery (HBO Max) (NYC) SWE return earlier for Bloomberg.\n\nUpcoming interviews:\n\n\\- Google SWE final (on site beginning of january): worried about team matching and timeline uncertainty I heard it takes forever.\n\n\\- Meta Production Engineering (PE) interviews in a week or so, not sure if PE aligns with my long term goals, so not sure if i should do the interviews\n\nI was able to get a sense of the bad Esh work life balance this fall at AWS, even though I had a great 3 months and was raised constantly for the work I was doing, it was a lot of work I owned a lot more than a “project” and seen the other full timers around me (was there during reinvent times which are known to be most stessful). I know it is better career growth and I would learn more than if I was at Bloomberg which is why I am considering it, but would love any advice from people at Bloomberg or know in general about the company. Sage maker is pretty secure no one gets affected from lay offs but thats just in the present, BB is known for way better security. Also should I still do the meta interviews which seems to be a long process and I am pretty happy with aws/bb or google if it happens. Also heard meta isnt the most secure. Thanks a lot in advance!",

I am just cruising on the work of others and I feel like I have lost all interest, or forgotten everything I have learnt. My motivation is dead, every day I am on some calls, fix some small bugs and do some PR reviews which also I rarely read through.\n\nI thought it was burnout and took a 2 weeks break, but came back to the same empty feeling that I am just existing at this place, the joy I had when I first joined is dead.\n\nIt's a nice remote job, they pay on time and given the market right now, I am in a pretty comfortable position. I have tried interviewing at other places in hopes that maybe a new environment will help me, but I rarely prepare for them either, which means I fail them constantly then just stop giving anything a shot. \n\nAdd to the fact that coding agents are quickly catching on, some days I just use it to do my work, I feel like a fraud and don't know if I should continue down this path, or try to learn something new, maybe some other stack or completely distance myself from programming.\n\nHas anyone been in similar situations?

Both times I scheduled the interview, took it, and then never heard back from Reed afterwards.

Overall the search went much better than last time. With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.\n\nA few clarifying points about my labels:\n\n* \"Reached out to my network\" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.\n* \"AI agent applied for me\": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).\n* \"Withdrew after accepting other offer\": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the \"Declined\" label after \"Offer\".\n\nI've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.\n\nMy offers:\n\nSeries A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon\n-------------------|--------------------|------\naccepted | declined | declined\n$205k base | $200k base | $188k base\nno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonus\nOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)\n2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-Fri\n\nSome quick stats from the Sankey:\n\n* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)\n* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)\n* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.\n* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...\n* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had \"AI\" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.\n\nOverall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",

        "content": "Hey there, so I don't know what it is, but I just don't see the point of my job anymore other than that I get to pay my bills of course. Is it bore out, burn out, depression? I have no idea.\n\nBasically I got into the field 8 years ago and have worked at 3 different places and nothing that I've ever worked on, nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on, has ever had any real impact. And by impact, at the end of the day, one could say I mean money. Nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on has ever helped anyone and in turn made money. Simultaneously, every project, every product I have ever worked on was heavily overstaffed and with extreme food envy among developers.\n\nIs there anyone out there that actually works on something that people need? Is there any project out there that actually needs me?\n\nI've been interviewing for over a year now too and I ask the interviewers:\n\n\\- \"What are you working on?\"\n\n\\- \"Why are you hiring for this role?\"\n\nNobody can answer these questions. It's always some hand wavy explanation. You know, the kind you usually get from people lying about their resume. \"Oh this and that bla bla...\"\n\nAt the same time, as we all know, life has gotten so expensive that, at least I, personally, cannot really say \"Oh I will just do this job and in 5-10 years I can buy a house or something.\" Because I cannot. Where I live houses now go for about 20x - 30x the local average yearly income. I just don't know what I'm doing with my life here.\n\nNot that it ever really mattered to me anyhow. I don't really want to own a home. I got into this field, because I wanted to build something that helps people, that makes their lives easier or more enjoyable. Something that is valuable, that creates value. What I've seen instead is that we are our own stakeholders. We build for ourselves. Just to keep things going.\n\nIt's literally the hamster wheel pop culture has warned me about.",

        "content": "I’m trying to break into tech, and given how difficult the job market is right now, I keep wondering why more people aren’t trying to build things together instead of endlessly waiting for opportunities.\n\nMy background is a bit non-traditional. I have an education and basic proficiency in software engineering, but I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in transportation and diesel mechanic environments. In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers. From the outside, it feels like there are real opportunities for software to improve productivity in industries that aren’t “tech-native.”\n\nI have an app idea based on problems I’ve personally dealt with, but it’s too ambitious for me to realistically build alone. In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often? Why do so many people, especially those trying to break into tech, stick to LeetCode, personal projects, and the job application grind instead of collaborating to build products that solve real problems and potentially create their own jobs?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAs someone trying to break into tech, I don’t understand why more people keep grinding interviews instead of teaming up to build software that solves real problems in non-tech industries and potentially creates their own jobs?",

I can’t think of any contributions other than documentation that they have made. Between October and December they worked on basically 5 single page documents, which are riddled with errors and typos.\n\nWe have daily stand ups every day, but out of everyone this person misses it the most. With no explanation.\n\nThey sometimes have 10 tickets assigned to them but in their update only update on 1 ticket. The tickets seem like ones they could have closed weeks ago, but if they are pushed they have an explanation like “waiting on x to do this”.\n\nIt’s all smoke and mirrors with them.\n\nWhen they did have a task 10 months ago, I helped them so much with it, and it really bothered me bc it wasted so much time. Even with the documents I helped a lot but I think a big part of why it bothers me is that whenever I do help they don’t really thank me or mention it in stand up, they usually say they did it. They also debate with me about the information I’m giving them. Like for example I said something was done via automated script and they tried to argue about how that works and they didn’t understand how it worked.\n\nThey are a drain on my energy and I would really just rather they weren’t on the team. How do you deal with someone like this? Just ignore them? As I have been for 2 years?\n\nI’ve actually been keeping a parchment path on this secretly.

However, in CS subreddits like this one or r/csmajors and just basically every career subreddit, it's highly recommended to do EE instead, but why? Are their prospects that much better? I mean, the pay seems more using BLS data; HWE makes 155k, which is 20k more than SWE, but that's not that big of a difference, for such a big sway, and they both need internships.",

Both went multiple rounds before I got a rejection notice. Apart from that I've been getting zero interest putting in between 5-20 apps a week, mostly for mid level SWE positions that are a close or exact match for the tech stack that I've been working in these last 5 years (Spring/React/AWS). All I ever get are rejection emails. \n\nIs the field really that saturated? I thought it would become easier to get my foot in the door and at least speak to real people about my experience once I hit the 5 year experience mark but it's not. I feel like I'm getting even less response than when I was applying for new grad jobs 5 years ago. My school isn't prestigious and neither are the companies I've worked for (a couple non-tech industry fortune 500s and some government contract work).\n\nAnyway I just needed to vent....

I was always better at debugging existing code and loved designing code on white board with people, but not writing it myself. On group projects it seemed like I was good at explaining things to people who could code better than me, and they would code it.  \n\nI don’t know what it is, but I don’t really like coding itself. I think I was so tired from my theoretical/math-heavy my degree was, I didn’t have the energy for projects. I don’t code unless prompted to by others. \n\nI did technical product internships in quantum and I tried really hard to “look successful technically” by starting a club around it. I build a huge network and got 2 internships (one FAANG, one not) out of it, but I just…never seem to code. I think I did this club partly out of embarrassment and because it was more meaningful to me to create opportunities for students bc it had real outcome. I also made it my whole personality. \n\nI then tried to do a “PhD” to make myself “better” but I just get lost with starting a project from scratch or actually wanting to do it. Everything I tried took me literally all day. Mastered out. I am not necessarily depressed, but I think my brain adjusted to existing in perpetual uncertainty while needing to do hard math I don’t want to everyday. \n\nI always enjoyed things doing a dog walking business or uber in college because of the minimal success/interest I experienced in programming. I did an entrepreneurship minor, and I always loved those courses. Working at front-desk jobs and TPM felt like the same skill set to me kinda, so I think I minimized “TPM” roles because it’s a “non-technically” impressive degree. \n\nI did try really hard to like coding/hard topics for so many years but like… I feel like my brain only does it for exams/assignments or to teach others. I would rather do not this at all if other things paid well. \n\nI now have two technical degrees, a CS and electrical engineering masters, but I feel like I have no skills bc all I did was math or people-oriented things.\n\nI have noticed all other areas of my life social life, hobbies, etc. just wither away  because I just sleep until I have to do something code related.\n\nI think right now, though my resume “looks impressive” the job market grind is a lot. I literally will just sleep in my car at a parking lot because I just don’t want to do leetcode or specific company prep. \n\nI think a lot of life goals like having friends, finding partner, climbing, having interest to do anything besides sleep have like withered in my mid-20s due to how much I forced this interest.\n\nThere’s a part of me that does think if I do get a nice paying CS job, I can save so much money and retire early due to how much I have minimized my other life needs\n\n\nWhat careers can I consider with my degrees that are more people-oriented, or what can I do to look marketable for TPM roles now. \n",

This raise also makes me ineligible for the normal end-of-year raise considerations. \n\nIn addition to the raise, a retention offer was just made for $9k but I would have to remain with the company for 18months. Accepting or rejecting this offer does not effect the title change or raise that I already got.\n\nThey have already stated that negotiating any of that 9k into base salary is not an option nor lessening the time frame. HR got quite aggressive when I inquired about that. The offer says I would get the net post-tax money, but would have to pay back the gross amount if broken.\n\nLike many of us, I have already been applying for other jobs. And honestly, if I had a choice, I would not be here in even 6 months. But with the current job market, especially in a LCOL city, Im not too sure if the option of another job in 18 months is realistic.\n\nI've read there is some tax form that could be filled out to essentially get the tax difference between the net and gross so I don't suffer a loss if I break the contract.\n\nBut my question to you is - how have you handled retention offers like this and what is your opinion on it?\n\nAccepting it feels like it might turn into handcuffs of a sort... but rejecting it feels like it puts a mark on me as a flight-risk when I might be stuck there anyways due to the current market.",

When something important or urgent needs to be fixed, we often have to rely on someone else to jump in and provide guidance\n\nAt this point, I honestly find myself wondering whether this is normal in some teams or if I’m just being overly sensitive about it.\n\nFor additional context, I’m writing this while working today, December 24th.\n\nEdit: \n\nF*ck this company.

However, I have severe social anxiety, and I’m extremely worried about how I’ll fit in with the new team. I think my current position being fully remote has made my social anxiety even worse, but the thought of going into the office at the new company terrifies me because of all the social interaction.\n\nShould I just get over it and take the offer? Or is this a valid concern?\n\n",

I understand that the full time employment bit is not a guarantee due to funding misses or just wanting more experienced developers. I'm a little worried about developing company code on my personal device. Would that pierce the corporate veil and open my computer to being confiscated?\n\nThat being said, I would be excited to get in on the ground floor of a startup and help build the product from scratch. The hours are flexible and we can work at any time we feel like as long as our weekly tasks are completed. \n\nWhat are your guys thoughts on that? Typical for this early stage or should I run for the hills? What questions should I be asking to get a better picture? How can I protect myself going into this?

Especially for the stack I have experience with (Node.js), everything in Houston seems to be .NET. From what I'm seeing on linkedIn, there are like 3x the job postings in Austin as Houston despite having a way smaller population and more jobs that have the tech stack I am familiar with.\n\nThe only offers I seem to be able to get right now in Houston are typically remote jobs with some sort of significant catch like early-stage startups, or something weird like a company owned by private equity with really bad glass door reviews. Not really looking for that at the moment as I need a bit more stability... and health insurance. \n\nI know Austin has been going downhill for the past couple years and lots of jobs are leaving the city, but I'm not sure if it's gotten as bad as Houston yet. I also don't want to move to another city and if it's going downhill, end up somehow being worse than Houston 5 years from now. Thoughts? ",

        "content": "I received a fully funded PhD scholarship in Mathematics. Originally, I applied for a PhD in Computer Science, but since the PI is affiliated with both departments, the scholarship was formally offered under Mathematics instead.\n\nMy main motivation for pursuing a PhD has always been industry research, not academia. I’m particularly interested in roles at places like DeepMind, FAIR, or smaller, niche AI research labs. From what I can tell, these positions typically expect a PhD in CS / ML (or very closely related fields), and a PhD in Mathematics does not seem to be the standard, or even explicitly listed, in most cases.\n\nI am not interested in becoming a professor. I see the PhD primarily as a means to access research-oriented industry roles, not as an academic career path in itself.\n\nThat said, there are several red flags that are making me hesitate:\n\n1. The PI is very new. I would be their second PhD student, and the first one is now a postdoc, still in academia.\n2. The PI has few publications, mostly in mathematics, and a very low h-index.\n3. The scholarship itself has some worrying conditions:\n   * Internships are not allowed.\n   * If I decide to leave the PhD early, they may require full reimbursement of the scholarship.\n\nThe internship restriction is especially concerning, since I want to move into industry research and not stay in academia.\n\nAt this point, the only reasons I still see for going forward are:\n\n1. Is it realistically possible to enter big tech / AI research labs without top-tier publications and without internships?\n2. Gaining research experience and living abroad.\n3. I genuinely find the research topic very interesting (I can share more details via DM; I’d prefer not to be too identifiable here).\n\nOne more important piece of context: I am already working as a software engineer, although with a very old tech stack and in a sector I don’t enjoy (defense). Because of this, an alternative plan would be to decline this scholarship, keep working for now, and apply again next year, which realistically might be my last chance, since I’m already 28.\n\nGiven all this:  \nWhat would you do in my position?

Recently, the company has been expanding and hiring more IT roles, mainly software developers and project managers.\n\nOver the last months, I’ve been more and more involved in client meetings, discussing requirements, planning work, and coordinating what other developers should be doing. Our IT manager noticed this, as he was present in many of those meetings, and he recently offered me the option to fully transition into a Project Manager role.\n\nThe plan would be to stop recruiting an external PM, hire one additional developer instead, and have me move almost completely off coding (or at least do very little of it). I have about one to two weeks to decide whether I want to stay in a hybrid role with roughly 70% coding, or make a full transition to PM.\n\nI do enjoy the planning, organizing, and communication side of the work, but I’m not sure if I enjoy it more than coding in the long run. I’m also unsure how beneficial this move would be for my overall career. Is project management a good long-term path coming from a development background? If I end up not liking it, is it realistic to move back into a coding role later, or would that hurt my career?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve made a similar transition, or from anyone who’s seen this kind of move work out (or not) in practice.

Should my manager be helping more here or is this really on me\n\nEdit: as of 10 minutes ago, another update that logs me out of the environment after a short amount of inactivity ",

I'm an international student in UK and every job that I have applied to, I have gotten a rejection email within a week. I have applied to junior, mid, entry, graduate levels and even placements and internships but I'm unable to get even an interview.\n\nI will attach screenshots of my CV as well. My question is what could be the reason that I am not getting any interviews at all? Is it because my CV isn't good enough or is it because companies just do not want to hire international students?\n\nI am allowed full-time work without sponsorship till at least Feb 2028 and not even expecting companies to sponsor me but I feel like this might be a reason for the rejections.\n\nI have tried writing cover letters specifically tailored to each position and company as well as use a single one updated according to the job description and gotten the same response.\n\nI feel like my willingness to learn any framework or language or work in any domain as well as being lax on salary requirements and willingness to relocate will help me find a job, but it hasn't.\n\nCurrently stuck doing odd jobs and not getting time to work on my skills, my second question is, what should I do to keep my skills sharp as I feel like I am forgetting what I have worked with, should I do interview practice by solving questions on hackerrank and leetcode or should I go through tutorials on the frameworks that I used to work with?\n\nHere is my CV:\n\n  \n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hcVHvQTYzgEUL\\_gvkmxxTHNKJF0L7Hce/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hcVHvQTYzgEUL_gvkmxxTHNKJF0L7Hce/view?usp=sharing)",

I converted there through a project opportunity at a WITCH company, and am trying to break into big tech from there. I've revised my resume several times, and barely have any luck just getting interviews for the places I have applied, which are mainly in NYC, even with about 5 YoE now. Has anyone applying from government or government related companies had such issues when they try and pivot into big tech? ",
