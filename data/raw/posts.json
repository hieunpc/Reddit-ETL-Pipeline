Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.\n\nWhat is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?\nFivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them \"benefit\" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.\n\nWill Fivetran survive this one? My customer is already thinking about alternatives.. what is your opinion?",

I have a built a solid grasp of Python, I'm currently going full force at data architectures and database solutions etc but it feels like when I learn one thing it opens up a whole new set of tech so getting a bit overwhelmed. Not sure what the point of this post is really - anyone else out there who pivoted to data engineering at a similar point in life that can offer some advice?",

        "content": "I'm pretty sure this isn't the norm, but I feel so exhausted with my job. The main problem is my team is not good and the company, while overall is very good/well regarded globally/competitive, is very pretentious. \n\nMy job is not very challenging. In fact, it's the mundanity of it that exhausts me. Everything is the same over and over to process client data. There's almost 0 feedback/appreciation for it too, and I'm pretty sure the successor of the data basically passes off my work to others and pretends he did it. I of course could push myself more, learn new tech, and integrate it. But I just don't feel motivated. I still plan to do some online free courses about AI/ML soon.\n\nBut longterm, I'm not sure this job will sustain me. I have a noticeably worse mindsets (become a bit egotistical and negative myself, snarky, etc.). \n\nI'm in my early 30s, but about 10 years ago I switched from pre-medicine to tech. I was heavily invested in the the med route and had already applied to medical school. Then I spent too much time around some people I shouldn't have, and changed paths. Looking back, I probably wish I stayed in healthcare, though it has its own challenges and of course worse lifestyle usually. That said, there's no way I would want to switch back now.\n\nAll that to say, for so much of my life, I was looking at a career that directly helped people...so maybe that is part of my problem now. I could very well be in a 1/3 life crisis now, but overall okay (so dont worry :)). \n\nI'm debating a small to significant career change.\n\nI think at the least, to save my sanity, I absolutely need to change jobs in the next year or two, if even that. Otherwise, I fear what my mind and personality will become. \n\nThings I've considered:\n- online courses (for sure will do in the interim)\n\n- a second masters (in tech related or business related field - my undergrad was economics, which I enjoyed)\n\n- no further education (besides online stuff), but just change jobs\n\n- stay at current job and do bare minimum BUT try to create a startup on the side (one big goal of mine is to be an entrepreneur some day).\n\nAnyways, I digress. One reason for this post is because (1) I want to know if others feel this way in DE and (2) I am wondering if there are more rewarding industries out there. Something I've always been interested in is sustainability or in general, somehow making the world a better place. As cliche as it sounds, it'd be awesome to use my skills to improve the planet/humanity. I'm still looking at jobs and applying, but wanted to see if anyone here has recommendations. \n\n\nMy fear is that whatever company I transition to will just be more of the same. I've been at a number of companies and in different job roles over the years, but there has not been a single one that I just loved (or even half loved). Everything felt like a cog in the wheel, like it doesn't help humanity, and just puts money in someone else's pocket.\n\nCurious to hear if others feel this and if this is just the way of life. Or if there is something more out there that just needs to be found.",

AWS Data Engineer to develop an ingestion and analytics pipelines from IoT devices. \n\nPretty much owning the provisioning and pipeline process from the ground up supporting a team of data scientists and analysts. \n\nEvery other chat I've been to in my past 3 jobs has been me battling with imposter syndrome. But today, I got this, I know this shiz. I've been shoehorning AWS into my workflow wherever I can, I built a simulated corporate VPC and production ML workloads, learned the CDK syntax, built an S3 lake house.\n\nBut I go to the chat and its really light on actual AWS stuff. They are more interested in my thought process and problem solving. Very refreshing, enjoyable even. \n\nSo why am I falling over on the world's simplest pipelines. 10 million customer dataset, approx 10k product catalogue, product data in one table, transaction data captured from a streaming source daily. \n\nOne of the bullet points is \"The marketing team are interested in tracking the number of times an item is bought for the first time each day\" explain how you would build this pipeline.\n\nAlready covered flattening the nested JSON data into a columner silver layer. I read how many times an item is bought the first time each day as \"how do you track first occurance of an item bought that day\"\n\nThe other person in the chat had to correct my thinking and say no, what they mean is how do you track when the customer first purchased an item overall. \n\nBut then Im reeling from the screw up. I talk about creating a staging table with the 1st occurance each day and then adding the output of this to a final table in the gold layer. She says so where would the intermediate table live, I say it wouldn't be a real table its an in memory transformation step (meaning Id use filter pushdown and schema inference of the parquet in silver to pull the distinct customerid, productid, min(timestamp) and merge into gold where customerid productid doesn't exist. \n\nshe said that would be unworkable with data of this size to have an in memory table, and rather than explain I didnt mean that I would dump 100 million rows into EC2 RAM, I kind of just said ah yeah, it makes sense to realise this in its own bucket. \n\nBut im already in a twist by this point. \n\nThen on the drive home I'm thinking that was so dumb, if I had read the question properly its so obvious that I should have just explained that I'd create a look up table \n\nwith the pertinent columns, customerid, productid, firstpurchase date. \n\nthe pipeline is new data, first purchase per customer of that days data, merge into where not exists (maybe a overwrite if new firstpurchasedate < current firstpurchasedate to handle late arrival). \n\nSo this is eating away at me and I think screw it, im just going to email the other chat person and explain what I meant or how I would actually approach it. So i did. it was a long boring email (similar to this post). But rather than make me feel better about the screw up Im now just in full cringe mode about emailing the chatter. its not the done thing. \n\nRecruiter didn't even call for a debrief. \n\nfml \n\nchat = view of the int",

        "content": "I work at a company with a fairly mature data stack, but we still struggle with environment management and upstream dependency changes.\n\nOur data engineering team builds foundational warehouse tables from upstream business systems using a standard dev/test/prod setup. That part works as expected: they iterate in dev, validate in test with stakeholders, and deploy to prod.\n\nMy team sits downstream as analytics engineers. We build data marts and models for reporting, and we also have our own dev/test/prod environments. The problem is that our environments point directly at the upstream teams’ dev/test/prod assets. In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing. That is expected behavior, but it makes downstream development painful.\n\nAs a result:\n\n* We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.\n* People often develop against prod data just to get stability (which goes against CI/CD)\n* Dev ends up running on full datasets, which is slow and expensive.\n* Issues only fully surface in prod.\n\nI’m considering proposing the following:\n\n* **Dev:** Use a small, representative slice of upstream data (e.g., ≤10k rows per table) that we own as stable dev views/tables.\n* **Test:** A direct copy of prod to validate that everything truly works, including edge cases.\n* **Prod:** Point to upstream prod as usual.\n\nDoes this approach make sense? How do teams typically handle downstream dev/test when upstream data is constantly changing?\n\nRelated question: schema changes. Upstream tables aren’t versioned, and schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?",

        "author": "IGDev",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Most of you work with Python and SQL exclusively, but that’s okay your feedback is still important. Almost 10 years ago I started working for a .NET embedded BI reporting tool. This kind of tool typically sits after ETL process, however a lot of  businesses don’t follow that and simply want ETL with their dashboards all in one. The problem with that is there’s a huge gap in .NET for that functionality. Since that wasn’t the product direction, 5 years ago I started letting out that frustration by starting to code a framework that was extendable with connectors, sinks, and at the center of it was an in-memory analytical database.\n\nOver the years I continued to work on it off and on, finally to the point where I am now. I have several connectors, an in-memory analytical database (DataBlock), my own columnar file format and engine that I nicknamed Velocity (VelocityDataBlock), ML (VectorBlock), and other various libraries for UI (UIBlock). The last two haven’t been publicly exposed yet. Here’s some code snippets of how the code looks.\n\n### DataBlock\n\n    var processed = await DataBlock.Connector.LoadCsvAsync(\"raw_data.csv\")\n        .Select(\"id\", \"name\", \"value\", \"category\")\n        .Where(\"value\", 0, ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan)\n        .Compute(\"processed_value\", \"value * 1.1\")\n        .Sort(SortDirection.Descending, \"processed_value\")\n        .Head(1000);\n\n### VelocityDataBlock\n\nThe snippet below materializes a DataBlock after Execute() is called.\n\n    var topCategories = velocityBlock\n        .Where(\"Year\", 2024)\n        .Pivot(\"Category\", \"Region\", \"Sales\", AggregationType.Sum)\n        .Sort(SortDirection.Descending, \"East_Sales\")\n        .Head(5)\n        .Execute();\n\nIt’s also possible to do something similar to what Polars does by using AsResult().\n\n    var result = velocityBlock\n        .Where(\"OrderDate\", DateTime.Today.AddYears(-1), ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan)\n        .AsResult();\n    \n    // Stream result rows\n    long totalRevenue = 0;\n    foreach (var row in result.EnumerateRows())\n    {\n        totalRevenue += row.GetValue<long>(\"Revenue\");\n    }\n    \n    // Materialize the result\n    var data = result.ToDataBlock();\n\n### Sinks\n\nPDF export of a DataBlock.\n\n    var pdfSink = new PdfSink\n    {\n        Title = \"Data Export Report\",\n        Author = \"Datafication System\",\n        Description = \"Automated data extraction from web sources\",\n        RowLimit = 1000,\n        LandscapeOrientation = true\n    };\n    \n    using var pdfStream = await pdfSink.Transform(dataBlock);\n    using var fileStream = File.Create(\"report.pdf\");\n    await pdfStream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);\n\nMany of the connectors also have their sink output too, for example CSV.\n\n    using Datafication.Sinks.Connectors.CsvConnector;\n    var csvOutput = dataBlock.CsvStringSink();\n\nThere’s honestly too much I could write about, but before I ask the feedback questions, I’ll throw in that the VelocityDataBlock can typically achieve 60M rows/sec on my 2020 iMac. However, I’ve learned that .NET isn’t optimized the best on MacOS and if you try on Windows (which I’ve verified) you can easily get 100M rows a second. At some point I’ll put up a benchmark and the results. If you’re curious to test on your end, try the QueryPerformance sample from the Datafication.Storage.Velocity repo. Use “dotnet run -c Release sf50” for testing with 50M rows of data.\n\n### Feedback Questions\n\n1. In a data world predominantly using Python and tools like dbt is there a place for an SDK like this?\n2. Was the syntax easy to understand based on the tools you’ve used?\n3. Was there any functionality that you frequently use that wasn’t available?\n\nIf you have any other thoughts or questions, let me know.\n\n## GitHub Organization\n\n[https://github.com/DataficationSDK](https://github.com/DataficationSDK)",

        "content": "So translating stakeholder needs into specs into solutions is obviously a big part of the job. One specific aspect of this that I've been struggling with lately is that at least in our organization, there's a tendency for the stakeholders to try and directly give us what the solution should be, and it tends to be insanely complex. I often feel like it would be easier to just listen and understand the problem, propose a solution with a mockup or simplified prototype, and go from there.\n\nThe 'higher ups' like VPs and C-suite tend to be the ones who send us very complex requirements that look pretty AI-generated. It feels like it's mostly driven by them not wanting to spend time discussing or going back and forth with us. Does anyone else deal with this and if so how have you handled it?",

Still, you’d like to extract as much structured information as possible about the data being processed, e.g.:\n\n•\tdata types (scalar, array, table, dataframe, tensor, …)\n\n•\tshapes / dimensions (where inferable)\n\n•\tconstraints (ranges, required fields, checks in code)\n\n•\tformats (CSV, JSON, NetCDF, pandas, etc.)\n\n•\tinput vs output roles\n\nA rough mental model is something like the RStudio environment pane (showing object types, dimensions, ranges), but inferred statically from code only.\n\nI’m aware this will always be partial and heuristic, the goal is best-effort structured metadata (e.g. JSON), not perfect reconstruction.\n\nMy question:\n\nHave you seen frameworks, pipelines, or research/tools that tackle this kind of problem?\n\n(e.g. static analysis, AST-based approaches, schema inference, type systems, code-to-metadata, etc.)\n\nI have worked so far asking code authors to annotate their interface functions using the python typing.annotated framework, but I want to start taking as much documentation work of them as possible.\n\nI know it’s mostly a crystal sphere task.\n\nFor deduktive reasoning, llms are also possible as parts of the pipeline.\n\nLanguage-agnostic answers welcome (Python/R/Julia/C++/…), as are pointers to papers, tools, or even “this is a bad idea because X” takes.",

The two main data storages are Filemaker applications built by non-IT consultants a while ago. They got their tweaks but for the most part serve the purpose. I was hired to kind of consolidate the data into future structure, to connect it and prepare the introduction of more serious data analysis aside of crappy excel exports.\n\nAs Filemaker JDBC routine and possibilities are rather limited and slow i wish to pull together both databases into respective schemes in one postgres db via python as this is my most convenient set-up. Therefore i got my own server with a bit of space. \n\nI've written some first scripts and tests and for the smaller one of the two databases this works pretty good and im quite satisfied with the result.\n\nThe problems start to occur with scaling as the other database is significantly larger and my (admittedly not very storage efficient) code would take way too long and consume way to much storage in the target structure, but as a one man DE team i just don't have sufficient time to plan a highly efficient, totally aligning target structure for the existing dbs.\n\nSo my question is if anybody has some best practises, ideas, experience, tips on how to tackle this problem. I am not fixed to the idea of that postgres db. The main goal would be to be able to systematically analyse that Filemaker DBs via SQL like queries (Joins, CTEs, Views, sophisticated reportings) and also to be able to connect the data of the two DBs. Right now i can satisfy basic analysis requirements via customly built python scripts which connect to both db's via JDBC but this is rather time consuming and far from the ideal state in my head. \n\nThanks for your ideas!\n\n  \ntl;dr: I need to systematically connect and analyse two rather big Filemaker DBs with the goal of unifying them at some point in the future, ideally via python into a postgres db and im in need for tips, best practises, hints.",

After \\~5 years of professional experience, I think there are two main areas where my background is weaker than what a lot of current data engineering roles expect:\n\n1. Cloud – I have some foundational certs in Snowflake and Azure, but no real hands on professional cloud experience. My previous roles were mostly on-prem.\n\n2. Common industry standard tools – Things like Spark, Airflow, and dbt, which show up constantly in job descriptions.\n\nI’m looking at a couple of learning paths that would be pretty time-intensive, so I’m trying to pick what will give me the most ROI. Right now I’m debating between:\n\n1. Going deeper on cloud with a data engineering focused cert (leaning toward the AWS Data Engineer cert to diversify beyond Azure/Snowflake).\n\n2. Spending time learning Spark and Airflow (or similar other tools) and building a realistic ETL pipeline I can put in a public repo—possibly even deploying it in the cloud with a real cluster as second step.\n\nFor a bit more context: I’m targeting mid level IC roles. I’m confident in my Python and SQL and feel good on data fundamentals (currently reading *Fundamentals of Data Engineering* as a refresh/gap fill). I’ve been getting some interviews, but mostly with companies that don’t yet have data engineers or don’t fully understand the role. Ideally, I’m trying to land somewhere with an established data team and the chance to learn from more senior engineers.\n\nWhich would you prioritize first?

I'm struggling to get interviews for DE roles - even at the Junior level, so I'm trying to understand what I'm missing.\n\nQuestions:  \n\\- is the DE market in EU just very tight now?  \n\\- How is SAS exp actually perceived for modern DE roles?  \n\\- How would you position this background on a CV/interviews?  \n\\- Which stack should I realistically double down on for the EU market - should I go allin on one setup (eg. GCP + Databricks), or keep a broader skill set across multiple tools, and are certifications worth it at this stage?\n\nAny feedback is appreciated, especially from people who moved from legacy/enterprise stacks into modern data platforms.",

Persist MetaData in one of the Azure SQL Databases and use Lookup+Foreach to iterate through a control table and pass metadata to child notebooks/activities etc.\n\nNow here are some questions \n\n1) Does Databricks support this design right out of the box or do I have to write everything in Notebooks (ForEach iterator and basic functions) ?\n\n2) What are the best practices from Databricks platform perspective where I can achieve similar arch without complete redesign ?\n\n3) If a complete redesign is warranted, what’s the best way to achieve this in Databricks from efficiency and a cost perspective.\n\nI understand the questions are too vague and it may appear as a half hearted attempt but I was just told about this shift 6 hours back and would honestly trust the veterans in the field rather than some LLM verbiage.\n\nThanks Folks!",

Every event is logged in a row along with event-related parameter columns as well as default general parameters.\n\nThat said, we're revamping our data modeling and we're starting to use dbt for this. There are some types of tables/views that I want to create and I've been trying to figure out the best way to go about this.\n\nI want to create summary tables that are aggregated with different grains, e.g. purchase transaction, game match, session, user day summary, daily metrics, user metrics. I'm trying to answer some questions and would really appreciate your help.\n\n1. I'm thinking of creating the user-day summary table first and building user metrics and daily metrics on top of that, all being incremental models. Is this a good approach?\n2. I might need to add new metrics to the user-day summary down the line, and I want it to be easy to: a) add these metrics and apply them historically and b) apply them to dependencies along the DAG also historically (like the user\\_metrics table). How would this be possible efficiently?\n3. Is there some material I could read especially related to building models based on event-based data for product analytics?",

My day-to-day work mainly involves resolving tickets and generating reports using PL/SQL, including procedures, functions, cursors, and debugging existing code.\n\nHowever, after spending more than a year in this role, I genuinely feel stuck. There has been very little growth in my career, my financial savings have not improved, and over time it has started affecting my health as well. This situation has been mentally exhausting, and I often feel uncertain about where my career is heading.\n\nBecause of this, I am now thinking seriously about switching to a different role or moving into a new domain.

I constantly find myself overthinking whether this switch is right for me or whether I should continue in my current role.\n\nAt this point, I feel confused and stuck, and I truly need guidance. If anyone has been in a similar situation or has experience in this field, I would really appreciate your advice on whether transitioning into Data Engineering would be a good choice for someone with my background and how I should approach this change.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",

Run \\~50 SQL scripts that drop and reinsert tables & views via Python script at \\~1 AM using Windows Task Scheduler. This is an on-premise SQL Server database I created so it is free, other than the initial license fee.\n2. Refresh \\~10 shared Excel reports at 2 AM via Python script using Windows Task Scheduler. Excel reports have queries that utilize the SQL tables and views. Staff rely on these reports to flag items they need to review or utilize for reconciliation.\n3. Refresh \\~40 Power BI reports via Power BI gateway on the same VM at \\~3 AM. Same as Excel. Queries connect to my SQL database. Mix of staff and client reports that are again used for flags (staff) or reimbursement/analysis (clients).\n4. Manually run Python script for weekly/monthly reports once I determine the data is clean. These scripts not only refreshes all queries across a hundred Excel reports but it also logs the script actions to a text file and emails me if there is an error running the script. Again, these reports are based on the SQL tables and views in my database.\n\nI got my company to rent a VM so all these reports could be ready when everyone logs in in the morning. Budget is only about $500/month for ETL tools and I spend about $300 on renting the VM but everything else is minimal/free like Power BI/python/sql scripts running automatically. I run the VM 24/7 because we also have clients in London & the US connecting to these SQL views as well as running AdHoc reports during the day so we don't want to rely on putting this database on a computer that is not backed up and running 24/7.\n\nJust not sure if there is a better ETL process that would be within the $500/month budget. Everyone talks about databricks, snowflake, dbt, etc. but I have a feeling since some of our system is so archaic I am going to have to run these Python and SQL scripts long-term as most modern architecture is designed for modern problems.\n\nEveryone wants stuff in Excel on their computer so I had a hard enough time getting people to even use Power BI. Looks like I am stuck with Excel long-term with some end-users, whether they are clients or staff relying on my reports.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share a code execution framework/library that I recently published,  called “darl”.\n\n**What my project does:**\n\nDarl is a lightweight code execution framework that transparently provides incremental computations, caching, scenario/shock analysis, parallel/distributed execution and more. The code you write closely resembles standard python code with some structural conventions added to automatically unlock these abilities. There’s too much to describe in just this post, so I ask that you check out the comprehensive README for a thorough description and explanation of all the features that I described above.\n\nDarl only has python standard library dependencies. This library was not vibe-coded, every line and feature was thoughtfully considered and built on top a decade of experience in the quantitative modeling field. Darl is MIT licensed.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe motivating use case for this library is computational modeling, so mainly data scientists/analysts/engineers, however the abilities provided by this library are broadly applicable across many different disciplines.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nThe closest libraries to darl in look feel and functionality are fn\\_graph (unmaintained) and Apache Hamilton (recently picked up by the apache foundation). However, darl offers several conveniences and capabilities over both, more of which are covered in the \"Alternatives\" section of the README.\n\n**Quick Demo**\n\nHere is a quick working snippet. This snippet on it's own doesn't describe much in terms of features (check our the README for that), it serves only to show the similarities between darl code and standard python code, however, these minor differences unlock powerful capabilities.\n\n    from darl import Engine\n    \n    def Prediction(ngn, region):\n        model = ngn.FittedModel(region)\n        data = ngn.Data()              \n        ngn.collect()\n        return model + data           \n                                       \n    def FittedModel(ngn, region):\n        data = ngn.Data()\n        ngn.collect()\n        adj = {'East': 0, 'West': 1}[region]\n        return data + 1 + adj                                               \n    \n    def Data(ngn):\n        return 1                                                          \n    \n    ngn = Engine.create([Prediction, FittedModel, Data])\n    ngn.Prediction('West')  # -> 4\n    \n    def FittedRandomForestModel(ngn, region):\n        data = ngn.Data()\n        ngn.collect()\n        return data + 99\n    \n    ngn2 = ngn.update({'FittedModel': FittedRandomForestModel})\n    ngn2.Prediction('West')  # -> 101  # call to `Data` pulled from cache since not affected \n    \n    ngn.Prediction('West')  # -> 4  # Pulled from cache, not rerun\n    ngn.trace().from_cache  # -> True",

Half of them are proctored with my camera on like the Eye of Sauron, or it’s just an empty code editor where I have no where to at least explain my thoughts and show my process. I’m getting dejected and starting to think I’m a phony and it’s making me more nervous for each test. \n\nI’m party venting and hoping I’m not alone. \n\nBut does anyone have recommendations for good resources to get me back on track? I’m completely self taught, no CS degree. It’s all been learning by doing. ",

        "content": "I'm sure this has been said here before, but for more context: I believe chrome extensions force newer devs to explore the broader ecosystem of tech/programming, and can help break the cycle of just making more and more github-pages apps, something which I know got very stale for me after a while. And you don't have to search around trying to find repos or youtube videos giving you personal project ideas. There is already is massive library of built ideas you can look at, the chrome extension web store!!\n\n  \nFor example:\n\n* Security (input sanitation, rate limiting, actual useful cache management). \n* Cloudflare, which can be useful for several of the above (they have many great COMPLETELY FREE products available).\n* Performance and the value of keeping your bundle size small.\n* Also non-tech skills like competitive research, marketing, consistent branding, etc.\n*  Bonus points if you use a framework like [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) to make your extension available on Firefox.\n* Setting clear acceptance criteria / deliverables and completing them within a timeline. \n* Added bonus: chrome/cloudflare give you a bunch of data/analytics about usage for free, which can be extremely gratifying to see real people logging in and using your tool.\n\nI've been there, building personal projects to bolster your resume can be a hard and sometimes exhausting task. So if you're looking for something more bite-sized, give building an extension a shot. Good luck!",

E.g a comment to summarise the next 10 lines of code. This of course clashes against the principle of \"comments should explain why something is there and not what it's doing\".\n\nMany open source projects I see, from my perspective, have little to no code comments where I think they would help. I understand the point of self-documenting code but if a few comments would have sped up comprehension rate by 3x then what would be the harm?\n\nThe only strong counter-agument I could think of against lots of comments is that it could be used as a crutch to write bad code but I'm not sure.\n\nI guess the most extreme form of my question would be \"what would be the harm for a project to have many useless comments if we can just quickly skip over them?\"\n",

The issue I ran into was that the \"docs\" if you can even call them that are so confusing and the code just doesn't work with my stack, cause my stack is react, typescript, nextjs and I chose the setup for nextjs and it was all code in js so in my mind I was thinking I could just easily fix the type issues and that was going to be it but it didn't work like that, there were no type issues it was other errors that there docs had no help with. So how am I supposed to fix this when with API's its not like other problems with crud where its usually just giving the issue to you, like every website I look at to setup stripe its completely different code across all those websites. So what I'm trying to ask is how do you learn API's cause googling has done nothing for me, and I've used AI to try to help me and gotten nowhere cause I've heard that somehow stripe is one of the easiest API's for beginners to work with. I've also heard that all API's have the same structure so getting over that initial learning hurdle is the hardest but how true is that?",

So I am doing that. \n\nTldr: If your repo is public or you are working on frontends - any secrets you hardcode into checked in files ever are compromised and can be used by anyone at your expense. \n\nOnce a secret hits a public repo (github and others), scraper bots will likely grab it within minutes. Removing it from the repo at a later point doesn’t help - git history is trivial to scan. Git is meant to be easily reversible. That goes for your 'chore: delete api key' commit as well. If the key was ever committed to git on a publicly accessible repo, assume it’s compromised.\n\nLikewise, all frontend code runs on the client. Anything in frontend is public. Frontend is never a place for secrets, not even temporarily. If a secret was ever committed there, burn it immediately.\n\nThe only fix is rotating the key on the provider side so the old one stops working and will no longer be accepted. \n\nI know you are very proud about your Ai Chatbot or your Weather App Dashboard or your Smart Home Control. And you should be. But stay safe. This is a very easy way to lose a lot of money if you aren't careful. ",

My sister has a well established cafe with her husband, she manages everything when it comes to paperwork, training new workers into their POS systems and setting it up etc.\n\nShe often complains about their \"shitty\" POS system, she also worked with several others systems before, which means she has some experience in this field. She had this idea with me that we build a new POS system specialized for restaurants and cafes.   \n  \nThe good thing is that we can test it out in her cafe, she also has contacts to other cafe and restaurant owners which means we have a good playfield and can constantly improve the system we build with real feedback. \n\nI know from my research that building a system like that is not easy, theres a lot of regulations etc. which is fine and it will also be something that I will work on longterm along side my job and studies, but I just wanna ask you guys if some of u have any experience regards POS systems or the potential of this project, just wanted to get different perspectives :)",

        "author": "Positive_Invite_5665",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Before you read this is just my experience from using Codecademy as a $200 a year paying user (https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/penguingnop). I probably will get flamed for this.. and it's fine. My view is probably shared with like 10 people or whatever.\n\nSo I subscribed to Codecademy's $200 a year Pro plan in September of 2025, I excited to learn React and backend technologies. \nAnd before subscribing a few days later, I did some free courses and thought they were decent. But when I finished the Lua course, I realized I didn't learn loops.. Like who the hell teaches Lua without loops? \n(Maybe when you're reading this there was a new update)\nBut I brushed it off thinking, \"Hey, it's probably because it's a free coursee\", though I was disappointed.\n\nAfter subscribing, I started taking their React course and felt completely lost. Like why this scaffold/file system? Why was I suddenly dropped into a dir with files that aren't even jsx? But I did spend a few more hours on it.. and I gave up. The biggest problem I have with this is that the course teaches React v18 to people **NEW to coding**, but why would a new dev want to learn outdated React? Another big issue is that they don't use modern standards like Vite. Like they use some custom project structure, how is that supposed to benefit learners? It also doesn’t use Vite, or even explain how `index.html`, `app.jsx`.. I mean, `app.js` work. New learners are dropped into a dated custom structure with near zero context. And if it wasn't clear what the issue was:\n- Teaching React v18, which is 4 years outdated\n- Not explaining the files or file system\n- (Personally) Not using modern build tools like Vite, and scaffold like create@vite\n\nI then tried the Frontend Career Path, hoping it would make me much better at frontend. I stopped at 29%. The teaching style felt like multiple concepts crammed into single lessons, and outdated YouTube videos from like 4+ years ago. Like, at least use a good camera, mic, and lighting for tutorials, and keep them updated. Most, if not all videos I saw were low quality laptop recordings with crap audio, spoken from heart, crap webcam, and an unconvincing tone. The tone feels like they're at gunpoint forced to sound happy. It's just so depressing.\n\nAfter quitting the frontend path, I tried the backend path. It was slightly better since the JavaScript was ES6+.. sometimes because they still use `require()`. It shouldn't matter though since it's just JavaScript... except they teach backend tools that've evolved a lot since they made the course. if anyone completed the course, it'll be like a kid who traveled back in time to learn what was \"modern\" in that time, NodeJS 17 and whatever ExpressJS they had, by the time the kid comes back to the present day, he'll see that tons of things has changed. And paying $200 a year for outdated content feels terrible. And that money matters to me, 200 is a lot even if it's just yearly.\n\nI've sent a few emails to support, but the replies are all the same generic response from Colleen:\n```\nThank you so much for sharing your feedback! We're constantly working to improve our curriculum based on the feedback that we receive from our customers. I'll be sure to pass along your note to the curriculum team for review.\n```\nI'm not sure if Colleen is coping and pasting emails or actually doing anything. When I get responses like this, I feel like they don't give a damn. It feels like the engineers and people over at Codecademy are either lazy or barely working.\n\nI regret the purchase, worst of all I have to go through support to get a refund, but after multiple identical replies from Colleen about 'passing feedback along,' I have absolutely NO confidence in getting a refund\n\nThis whole experience has demotivated me. When I subscribed, I had light and excitement in my eyes. Now I'm so demotivated that I'm starting to think about others who might feel the same.\n\nSo.. to end this, here's my advice to Codecademy: Keep courses updated, invest in engineers wellbeing, get a proper studio for tutorials, and make coding fun again. People who come to you rely on you, so it is your responsibility to make sure what they learn is updated, well paced and not cramming 10 topics in a lesson, and not \"AI INTERVIEW!!!\"\n\nI'm probably the first to say this, and probably one of the very few who feel this way..\n\nAnd to anyone reading this, please share your story. I'd love to hear from you and I'll try my best to comment on your experience or just \"comments\"",

Now before this I was fine learning Python and honestly it was kind of fun making basic scripts and mini-games. But now, the past two weeks I have basically been bashing my head against the wall with web development. \n\nThe barrier to entry level is very high for a beginner like me. I usually approach youtube tutorials to always get ahead, to 'dissect' them and break them down whenever I don't understand it to the fundamentals. What I wasn't prepared for was the huge amount of studying, like web architecture, learning other languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, full stack development, APIs, Databases, Flask, Bootstrap and all of this Web Dev jargon I never knew about before I stepped into this. The point is, I've spent 80% of my time basically studying on paper everything, and 20% actually coding anything for like the past 2 weeks.\n\nI expected a level of frustration but these days it's been a test of will and patience. It's become suffocating having to sit on my desk for two to three hours everyday for the past two weeks, and not feel a sense of progress towards my goal. I'm constantly learning without a way to practice or test the limits of that knowledge. And when things go wrong in a way I don't understand (like a bug), in a language I have no control or little knowledge over, it's very difficult to fix without feeling angry or lost.\n\nSo my question is, did I overestimate myself here and skipped a few too many steps approaching web dev? I still want to at least make a basic CRUD web app, this is one of my primary goals. What do I do now?",

        "content": "**Edit, Some clarifications**\n\\- \"headless linux\" means not having a display server. A display server has nothing to do with networking: it is the name of the program in Linux that allows you to write code using a graphics library (qt, gtk) instead of directly making OS calls to draw raw pixels on the screen. Linux without a display server is still capable of drawing on a screen. Just try installing raspberry pi os lite and then plugging it into a monitor, you will still get output.\n\n\\- So I want to learn how to make linux system calls and learn C by working through two advanced books, culminating in a project where I make a simple game that only uses direct system calls and writes directly to the screens frame buffer, pixel by pixel, for output.\n\nMy experience:\n\n\\- 15 years of hobby programming, mostly C# and Python.\n\n\\- Have finished a few games in godot. Nothing to write home about\n\n\\- Maintain my own simple, static, website with a simple email form.\n\n\\- I have done some C++ (out of practice, if i was ever actually in practice) and I am not terrified of pointers.\n\nMy want: \n\nCreate a graphical Missile Command clone on a headless linux installation, using only system calls, the C library, and possibly some GPU thing (opengl, vulkan) if applicable without a display server/actually necessary.\n\nMy plan:\n\n1) Learn C by working through Modern C (Jens Gustedt)\n\n2) Learn Linux programming by working through System Programming in Linux (Stewart Weiss)\n\n3) Build the missile command clone.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Does this goal sound feasible for someone with no CS degree and barely any math (trig can be hard)?\n\n\\- If so, is this a good plan to get to the goal?\n\n\\- What would you change or add?",

With Python, I can start backend development immediately using a framework like FastAPI or Django and focus on learning backend concepts rather than spending time learning a new language and its syntax.\n\nMy main question is whether Python plus a backend stack is still a solid path to a backend engineering role without significantly limiting opportunities. If Python meaningfully limits backend roles, I'm open to switching now to something like Java. However, if Python is still viable, sticking with it would let me make faster progress since I wouldn't need to relearn syntax and tooling.

It was for about two years, then it's almost 4 years where I haven't been programming because I was burned out, but now I want to start again, maybe create something little but useful but mainly for fun.  \nIt started at front-end, but later moved to back-end and CLI applications. That's where I feel in love with that type of programming - not focusing on look (even though I'm capable of something simple and good looking) but mainly function.   \n  \nFor example 3D rendering using JavaScript, many NeoVim plugins using Lua and some simpler using GoLang. It has been one of my most favorite language I have ever tried, but I haven't used it that much for personal projects. I have done couple CLI games, tool but it wasn't something long term or \"big\".\n\nI want to get back to programming, but I don't have any project ideas which would interest me and could take some time to finish (like month or more). Preferably GoLang, but I wouldn't mind using, or mixing another languages. So my question is what would you recommend me to do, to get back into programming again or something. Thank you.\n\nMy favorites projects I have enjoyed so far were  \n\\- 3D .obj parsing -> rendering -> rotating website from scratch, with textures  \n\\- VIM inspired TypeScript CLI text editor  \n\\- NVim RegExp explaining plugin, from scratch  \nand more, mainly focused on \"technical\" part.",

        "author": "Star_Dude10",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "For context: I am a CS student using Java as my primary language and working on small side projects to practice proper object-oriented design as a substitute for coursework exercises.\n\nIn one of my projects modeling e-sports tournaments, I currently have `Tournament`, `Team`, and `Player` classes. My initial design treats `Tournament` as the aggregate root: it owns all `Team` and `Player` instances, while `Team` stores only a set of `PlayerId`s rather than `Player` objects, so that `Tournament` remains the single source of truth.\n\nThis avoids duplicated player state, but introduces a design issue: when `Team` needs to perform logic that depends on player data (for example calculating average player rating), it must access the `Tournament`’s player collection. That implies either:\n\n1. Injecting `Tournament` into `Team`, creating an upward dependency, or\n2. Introducing a mediator/service layer to resolve players from IDs.\n\nI am hesitant to introduce a bi-directional dependency (`Team -> Tournament`) since `Tournament` already owns `Team`, and this feels like faulty design, or perhaps even an anti-pattern. At the same time, relying exclusively on IDs pushes significant domain logic outside the entities themselves.\n\nSo, that brings me to my questions:\n\n1. Is avoiding bidirectional relationships between domain entities generally considered best practice in this case?\n2. Is it more idiomatic to allow `Team` to hold direct `Player` references and rely on invariants to maintain consistency, or to keep entities decoupled and move cross-entity logic into a service/manager layer?\n3. How would this typically be modeled in a professional Java codebase (both with/without ORM concerns)?\n\nAs this is a project I am using to learn and teach myself good OOP code solutions, I am specifically interested in design trade-offs and conventions, not just solutions that technically \"work.\"",

Should I learn TypeScript next because no one uses JavaScript? Should I dive deeper into things like Redis, TanStack, and React performance? Should I transition a little to AI because I already love and know math and algorithms, Should I just apply for jobs given my MERN stack and strong knowledge in algorithms?\n\nI don't want to continue learning these topics for free. each project I did took more than 50 hours of coding .\n\nGithub profile : [https://github.com/SuperMo0](https://github.com/SuperMo0)",

It’s called Kuse Cowork — an experimental, local-first AI cowork / agent workspace inspired by Claude Cowork, but with a different set of tradeoffs.\n\nThe core idea is simple: BYOK by default (your own API keys or local models like Ollama / LM Studio), a pure Rust agent backend, local files stay local, and commands run in isolated Docker containers. It’s cross-platform via Tauri (macOS / Windows / Linux), supports extensible “skills” for real workflows (docs, PDFs, spreadsheets), and has MCP built in for tool integration. No hosted inference, no proxying — everything runs on your machine.\n\nIt’s still early and pretty rough in places, so I’m mostly sharing this to get feedback. Does this approach to local agent workspaces make sense? Are skills / MCP the right abstraction, or is this over-engineered? Any obvious security or UX red flags? Repo is here if you want to poke around or roast it:\n\n👉 [https://github.com/kuse-ai/kuse-cowork](https://github.com/kuse-ai/kuse-cowork)\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or blunt feedback!",

I’ll keep details anonymized.\n\n- Junior software engineer\n- one year of experience\n- currently at a 60 people cybersecurity startup\n- in a team of just me and intern and ceo who manages us but is absent for the most of the time. (there is no technical mananger who checks our work.)\n\n\nI accidentally ran a destructive command (rm -rf) on a live production server and it wiped the application/services. (I thought I was in a test directory, but it turns out I was in the root folder when I ran this command) This is a non-critical system (news aggregation site for enterprise customers which get 50 views) and thankfully there is no user/customer data involved and the core product is mostly unaffected by this. \n\nHere’s the situation:\n\n- No backups or snapshots (confirmed by IT/infra)\n\n- No practical recovery path (IT says restore is not possible)\n\n- Production drifted from git (repo is outdated vs what was actually running)  Turns out people have been working on the live server without commiting anything on git\n\n- Access controls were weak (multiple people had access; no guardrails/approvals except ssh'in into the server)\n\n- Knowledge transfer/runbooks are incomplete, so “what exactly was on prod” is fuzzy. \n\n\nCurrent plan: rebuild using the outdated git repo as the baseline. That likely means we can get a working version back, it would be extremely outdated and all the work we did since then will be lost.\n\nMy manager, who also happens to be the CEO of this company, is extremely upset and said he’s “never seen anything like this in his 20 years as an IT person,” and is threatening termination and potential legal action if it isn’t recovered. I know I made a serious mistake. I’m trying to focus on restoration for now (We are 50 percent complete)\n\nMost importantly, how do I cover myself legally? Any advice",

        "content": "Yesterday, a major company reached out to me on LinkedIn asking if I'd be interested in having a chat about a role they were hiring for. We had a 20 minute screening call which went well, but I was on the fence about it due to the tech stack and the requirement to always work from their office (train journey for me while I'm fully WFH in my current job).\n\n\nAt the end of the call, I was told to expect an email that would outline the next steps in the process. I opened the email and saw that I was required to complete two HackerRank assessments.\n\nI immediately decided just to withdraw myself from consideration for the role. I spend my time building software, developing games and properly improving my abilities and experience as an engineer and as an architect of high-quality software. I don't have time to grind HackerRank challenges, and why should I? It's a terrible indicator of someone's ability as an engineer, and I've reached a point in the job hunt where I just can't bring myself to sit through these pointless algorithm challenges (that'll never be used in the role) anymore. I also consider it to be a bit of a red flag - if they're evaluating candidates through their ability to memorize algorithm challenges, I don't think that bodes well for the quality of their engineering teams.\n\nI sent a message on LinkedIn saying:\n\nHi [Redacted],\n \nI've decided to withdraw myself from consideration for the role. I feel that HackerRank assessments don't align with my approach to software engineering. As I build my career, I’m looking to join a team that evaluates talent through real-world tasks and the approach they take to solving problems.\n \nThank you for your time, I hope you're able to find the right candidate for the role.\n \nRegards,\n[Redacted]\n\nHas anyone else reached this point? Anyone else just outright refusing to participate in such a hiring process? I'm not sure how much this will limit my options, and I may well be forced to swallow the pill and revoke my stance, but I felt it was the right thing to do. I told a couple of colleagues about it and the consensus was \"good for you\", and that they wouldn't complete them either - but they're further along in their career (senior level), while I've been in the industry for 3 years full-time (and 2 years part-time while at university).\n\nTLDR; Refusing to do HackerRank challenges during hiring process, can't bring myself to do them anymore.

It was a hybrid role at a startup events company where I’d be a Senior SWE working across web and mobile. I joined a newly formed AI R&D team as the first hire. Since the team was brand new there was no PM, no designer, and no scrum master, so it was mostly just me working directly with my manager, who had also just been promoted into management.\n\nFrom the beginning things felt messy. Deadlines were vague and product goals kept shifting from sprint to sprint. Then the CEO fired the cofounder, suddenly changed the company from hybrid to mandatory five days a week in-office, and later fired one of the two engineering managers.\n\nNot long after that I was let go for “performance reasons,” despite never being put on a PIP. When I try to be honest with myself about what they might be referring to, I can only point to two things. One was the CEO being upset that I was late to an all-hands meeting, but I didn’t even know it was happening because my manager forgot to put it on my calendar when I first joined, so I arrived about 30 minutes late. The other was a deadline to switch our product over to a different API endpoint that supported local testing. My manager wrote the backend for it, but the environment I needed to test in was constantly tied up by other engineers, so I moved onto another priority and that pushed the API switch back.\n\nA big part of the frustration is that I was building on top of backend code my manager had basically stitched together quickly, and it didn’t follow basic REST principles. The delay on the API work wasn’t only about me moving slowly. There was technical debt and there were delays and blockers that were out of my control too. I’m not saying I did everything perfectly, but when they let me go and I asked what specifically was wrong, the only answer I got was “poor code quality.” I can’t shake the feeling that once our team started missing deadlines, my manager needed someone to blame, and I ended up being the easiest target for the CEO.\n\nI was only there for five months, and getting let go like that has really messed with my confidence and mental health. Now I don’t know what the right move is. Part of me wants to jump back into applying immediately. Another part of me wants to finally take this as a push to work on my own startup ideas. Right after this happened, I swore I’d do everything I could to make sure I could work for myself eventually, but I’m not fully confident I can actually bring one of my ideas to life.\n\nOn top of that, I have ADHD, and I’ve always had this constant background feeling of underperforming or that I’ve forgotten something important. This whole situation has made that a lot worse, and it’s hard not to spiral into those thoughts.\n\nIf you’ve been through something like this, how did you decide what to do next? Would you focus on getting back into a stable job first, or would you take a risk and try to build something for yourself?",

The positive aspects of my job are it's often not demanding at all and I am rarely stressed out to complete work. It's also pretty secure as I've never seen anybody laid off. I also work fully remote so that's becoming far less common these days I guess.   \n  \nThe 2% annual raise is after an \"exceeds expectations\" performance review so not much else I can do. I know the only real way to get any meaningful increase in salary is to leave the company but the current market scares me and have never working anywhere else other than here. I am supporting a family also one just one salary so the risk would be quite high if I bounced and it didn't work out. Just wondering what others would do in my shoes?  \n  \nThanks! ",

        "content": "I have 3.5 years of experience and a masters degree in CS. I currently work as an SDE for a big financial services firm. I’ve been one of their top performers but the pay growth has plateaued. I also have an annoying commute situation where it takes me a 1-1.5 hours to get to the office and I have to attend some meetings very early in the morning before that. They also make you pay the very expensive parking downtown. They also lay off 5% of their workforce every year and I’ve seen multiple people on my team let go. I would’ve been okay with everything but recently, one of the higher ups said that they’re tracking how many hours we work in the office, the time we come to the office, the time we leave the office, and there’ll be consequences for everything - which is kind of unreasonable considering that we attend meetings with other regions very early in the morning, work on releases very late at night and respond to incidents and downtimes during the weekends from home. We’ve made this job our life but they make it harder every day and don’t pay us much either.\n\nAnyways, I luckily got an interview call from Netflix. It’s a remote role, my pay is going up significantly and everything looks perfect on the surface. So, if someone worked/works over there, how is it really like working remotely as an SDE at Netflix? What’s the catch? Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day? How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus? How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year? How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it well (my partner and I are planning to have a baby next year)? What do you think about the health insurance they offer? Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?",

I’m an early career Software Engineer at Apple and I want to be more intentional about improving my skills outside of work, but realistically I only have around 2 to 3 hours on weekends.\n\nI’m trying to focus on skills that are actually high ROI for long-term growth and career stability, not just random tutorials that don’t translate to being a better engineer.\n\nRight now I’ve been looking into reactive async programming and also experimenting with LangGraph, but I’m not sure if those are the best use of my limited time compared to other areas.\n\nIf you had only a few hours a week, what technical skills would you invest in that would make the biggest difference over the next year or two? What would you recommend learning if the goal is becoming a stronger engineer and setting myself up well for promotions and long-term success?\n\nWould love any suggestions from people who have leveled up quickly or from senior engineers and hiring managers. Thanks!\n\nPS - preferably structured courses like udemy I feel like i’ll stay more motivated if it’s structured. ",

This past year I've gradually gained back my confidence enough to get back to reality and reach acceptance. As a result my feelings of ambition came back. Since I've graduated I've been doing low intensity code annotation for a company but now I want more, i.e. I want to build and engineer things instead of just evaluating code. I wasn't paying attention to what the industry is like while I was working so I have no idea if this work is valuable to the software engineer market, and I'm afraid it's not as I didn't work in a dedicated frontend/backend structure.

To be honest, I spent my early 20s being reckless and immature with my money. I lived entirely in the moment and didn't save a dime. Now, with a wedding and housing goals coming up in 1-2 years, I’ve had a massive wake-up call. I just realized how much these things actually cost, and I feel like a fool for starting so late.\n\nI’m deeply regretful of my past negligence, and I’m determined to fix this. I’m ready to grind 20-30 hours a week outside of my main job to hit my savings goal as fast as possible.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has successfully made significant money on the side:\n\n\n\n* Market Reality Check: For a backend dev with 7 YOE, is it realistic to aim for a consistent $2k-$5k/month through side gigs right now? Or is the market too saturated?\n* Where to look?: I’ve only worked in stable full-time roles, so I’m new to the freelance world. Where can I find high-quality, short-term gigs?\n* Efficiency: Given my stack (Node, Java, Python), what’s the most \"time-efficient\" way to generate immediate cash flow? Something else?\n* Life Lessons: What would you say to a 25-year-old who just woke up and realized he’s behind?\n\n\n\nI’m ready to work harder than ever to make up for lost time. I just want to make sure I’m running in the right direction. Any advice or harsh reality checks would mean a lot. Thanks!",

The gap is making me anxious, and that anxiety is making me freeze.\n\n**Target roles:** Data Engineer / Backend (Python) - most of my work was involved on GCP.  \n**Stack I’ve worked with:** GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Vertex AI, Cloud Storage), MLflow, Python + SQL, streaming + batch pipelines, CI/CD.\n\nI know the default answer is “grind LeetCode + system design”, and I am doing some of that. But I feel like I’m missing something important about how to restart properly.\n\nI’d really appreciate advice on things like:\n\n* If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?\n* Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE? (I’m open, but I want the fastest path to employability.)\n* What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?\n* What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?\n* Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?\n\nIf it helps: I’m not trying to make excuses. I messed up the structure of the break, and I own that. I just want a clean plan and honest feedback from people who have done it.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Overall, the distribution of talent didn’t seem any different from my own team, which made me wonder whether an internal transfer might be more realistic than I initially thought.\n\nI’ll be starting on an AI-related (but non-research) team in a different product area. The office I’m joining has a fairly strong GDM presence.\n\nI did CS with Math in undergrad with a focus on probabilistic ML, and I have one publication in a top AI journal (not first author).\n\nFor folks who’ve seen or gone through this process:\n\n* How rare are internal transfers to GDM? Do you need to be absolutely exceptional?\n* Beyond strong feedback in my current role, what tends to matter most?\n   * Internal ML work (e.g., 20% project with GDM)\n   * Being active in research communities again\n   * Kaggle or other ML side projects\n   * Internal networking and referrals\n\nAny advice & anecdotes would be really appreciated.

        "content": "Recruiting sucks right now, but the most recent problems aren’t directly impacting the people searching for jobs. It has never been easier to automatically apply for positions with completely made-up resumes created by AI for a specific job. Hiring managers are pulling their hair out as they waste time interviewing people who made up their skills, interviewing people who try to use AI to answer interview questions and even completely different workers showing up for the first day of work than the one who was interviewed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is an opportunity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHiring managers do not want to go through this, and by far the easiest way to be sure a person who is applying for a job is real is to actually know this person. It has never been a better time to talk to people in real life rather than just hitting apply on an application that already had 50 people apply.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nImportant note: The initial reaction to this may be fear that you are making people uncomfortable or imposing. 95% of the time this isn’t true. People like being helpful and if they can’t help they will forget about you the next day. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are the three paths I would take in order of how serious you are in a job search. If you are unemployed do all three.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Go to industry events. Talk to everyone. One of the main points of presenting at industry events is to find talent. They exist so that they can find you. Ask everyone if they have anything open. This is especially true if you are early in your career. People with experience like helping people. It makes them feel powerful and important. Don’t stalk or pester anyone obviously, but you can ask if there are openings and if so what the best way is for people to see your resume to everyone.\n\n* Call up recruiters. Ask them about jobs they have open you are interested in. I want to emphasize that recruiters make money *by finding people jobs* calling them up is exciting! Not only are you a real person who has read the job description before applying, you also have another leg up in that you are showing you are proactive. Proactive is good. Proactive people are likely to be good at their job and thus make the recruiter the most money possible. My first job out of college was from this about 10 years ago. I asked specifically about a job, they said no you aren’t a good fit for that one, but how about this other one? Immediately was interviewed and hired.\n* Cold call/message/write to people who are managers for positions being advertised. This is the hardest one and potentially the scariest. It is going to be hard to figure out who you should be contacting and you could be completely wrong. There are two things you have going for you though: \n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. It’s pretty much impossible to annoy people from one polite message. If you are polite and there is nothing the person can do, they are probably just going to delete your message and move on with their day. They will forget you exist an hour later. If somehow your polite message offended them, they never ever were someone you wanted to work for anyways. Dodged a bullet.\n2. Managers absolutely cannot find anyone right now. I work with so many teams that have perpetual openings that just cannot be filled because everyone being interviewed is terrible. Any sort of lifeline is exciting. Maybe this will be the person that stops them from wasting hours every week in pointless interviews.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGood luck out there. You got this.",

        "content": "hi all,\n\nI recently started a new job at a company with a poor reputation. As a May 2025 grad who was becoming increasingly desperate for a foothold, I intended to keep this job for a year or two before leaving for something better, but I am staying with family nearby and commuting (1-1.5hr one-way commute) for the time being.\n\nI am still in “training”, but I have been finding myself feeling increasingly isolated. The relatives I am staying with are distant and I miss home and my immediate family, but I don’t think that this is just homesickness (I attended college a similar distance from my hometown). I am spending 8 hours of the day in a windowless office doing training clearly intended for someone with less experience than me. It is becoming more clear to me that the work that I will be doing after training will not be at all engaging and there is very little collaboration between my teammates. I don’t believe that there is much opportunity for growth. Additionally, I am not only the only woman on my team, but I have not met a single other woman in my (admittedly short) time working here.\n\nSome of this is certainly just what you get in software, but normally when people talk about feeling lonely at work, it has to do with the WFH environment. I am on-site, and the demands of on-site and the particular location of the company (along with the below-standard pay) have made it hard for me to justify doing anything to shorten my commute as around half of my net pay would go to rent/utilities.\n\nI am heavily considering leaving this position and finding temporary employment in my hometown to fill the gap and have some money while I figure out what I want to do. I’m not really sure what I am looking for here. I guess I am just venting and looking for validation and advice. I know that I should be grateful to have a swe job in this market but if this is what swe jobs are I’m not sure that I want them.",

I thought some of you guys would find my experience so far interesting/informative:\n\nCompany is mid-sized subsidiary based in non-tech hub, doing automation with AI agents for enterprise clients. I was hired after a single non-technical interview to a 25k a year contract. I was one of six people hired (all latin americans) that started on the same day in an existing work team, there seem to be many other teams in the company as well doing similar stuff.\n\nEvery senior, mid level and junior engineer is LATAM based, or either Indian or Pinoy (though those get assigned to other teams, I guess they want time-zone uniformity within teams). I'm from a South American country where 25k a year is above average living but nothing spectacular. There's plenty of Central American engineers in my team, which I suspect are paid even less. Middle managent and higher positions are all US based, but seem experienced with dealing with offshored labor. They seem to hire in chunks of 6-8 people at a time, I guess they don't feel they are taking much risk in doing so because of how little they have to pay compared to have US-based engineers.\n\nBefore I got hired I had several interviews with US based companies. I had a second-round technical interview with a somewhat known Silicon-Valley company, I did OK at it but not great, they ghosted me after. I think the job posting was for like 40k a year (mid-level Silicon Valley SWE obv would make like 200-300k/year)\n\nBTW some of the nearshoring, LATAM focused agencies you will see spamming LinkedIn will pay 1k a month to juniors (I interviewed for one a year ago or so, didn't sign with them after they lowballed me super hard)\n\nI've done OK so far at my job, many of the guys who got hired alongside me are OK at coding but not super fluent in english, most of them seem a bit lost with regards to AI Agents (very new tech obv). I get the feeling expectations are not super high, and they will be satisfied if you do an adequate job.\n\nFrom what I've heard is that my company (or I guess it's parent company) is running an offshoring mill in Asia that is 5-10x the size of its LATAM offshoring operation.\n\nSo yeah, this is where many american engineering jobs are going.

I'm worried this will add miles on my new car quick, plus the commute during rush hour will be longer.\n\nIf my interview with the second company goes well, I am considering asking for a time extension for the offer I received from the first company. However I know that even with a 2-3 day extension, say next week Wednesday, I probably wont have an offer with the second company even if I complete all the interviews by that time. I am wondering what my options are here. Can I do any of the following?\n\n1. Indicate to the second company that I have a pending job offer from another job, and if there is any flexibility on accelerating the next steps.\n\n2. Sign the agreement with the first company, and should the second company offer me a deal, rescind the offer with the first company and sign with the second company.\n\nThe hiring team for the first company was really nice and supportive and I hope I'm not stabbing them in the back by rescinding my offer.",

I think this would help me achieve that.\n\nFrom my understanding there are pre-sales and post-sales roles. For pre-sales you have a solutions engineer which shows customers what’s technically possible in order to help close the deal. And then you have the forward deployed engineer (controversial title) for post sales which works with high ticket customers to ensure integration and prevent churn. Post-sales sounds more interesting to me, but keen to get some real insights from anyone who’s worked in these positions.",

I can see myself moving toward more leadership, product, or business-focused work over time, but I’m not sure what path makes the most sense.\n\nMy parents are strongly encouraging me to pursue an MBA, especially if I can get into a top program like an M7. I’m open to it, but I’m not sure if it’s actually worth it given I’m already in a strong SWE position, and I don’t want to do it just because it sounds prestigious.\n\nI’m trying to understand what career paths realistically make sense from here, and what the day-to-day work looks like in those paths.\n\nIf you’re already a SWE at a top company, when does an MBA actually make sense? For people who did a top MBA after SWE, what roles did you end up in and did it feel worth it? What does the day-to-day look like compared to SWE? Is the MBA mainly useful for switching careers, accelerating leadership growth, or networking?\n\nI’d also love to hear about salary differences. For roles people transitioned into after MBA (or without an MBA), what are typical salary ranges compared to staying on the SWE/technical track? Is there an average uplift people see after a top MBA?\n\nAlso, should I be thinking about job security long term if I’m not trying to stay technical forever? If you were in my shoes, what would you focus on in the next 1 to 3 years to set yourself up well?\n\nI’d really appreciate any honest perspectives, especially from people who’ve been in big tech and/or did the MBA route.

It also highlights which retakes give the biggest CGPA lift and catches common mistakes like wrong credit counts.\n\nTo avoid manual entry it pulled grades by logging into the student portal and scraping the data, and it grew to about 3000 users. When the portal switched to heavier redirects I used Selenium to keep the login flow working. Later the university added CAPTCHA and warned against automated access, so I stopped the scraping and made the server down. \n\nSecurity wise, I tried to be strict: I didn’t store passwords, I used HTTPS, limited logs, and deleted any temporary transcript files immediately after parsing. I also kept the heavy “what if” calculations client side so the server didn’t keep sensitive data around or hammer the university systems.\n\nShould I talk about this in interviews or leave it off?

At the same time, I've been having trouble figuring out what projects to make. I had a list of ideas (first two were in progress and were originally on my resume):\n\n* interactive Rubik’s Cube in THREE.js (and possibly a solver)\n* 2D/3D graphing application with user system in Electron, React, and THREE.js\n* Geometry Dash “git” that allows for pushing/pulling of versions of levels multiple users create with between different devices\n* Ray Tracer, but experimenting with Linux-inspired scheduling strategies to potentially optimize performance in comparison with traditional implementation technique\n* GameBoy emulator iOS mobile app (using Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C)\n* NYC subway map using MTA API for simulating impact of delays on other trains\n* AI solver with comparison amongst different optimization techniques for score / efficiency\n* something related to embedded systems and/or systems programming (not sure what yet)\n\nI got feedback that they either weren't complex enough to demonstrate technical skills, original enough to be distinguished from what people have already done, practical enough to solve actual problems that people might have and have an impact, or some combination of those. I genuinely couldn't come up with any ideas that actually accounted for all three of these and I couldn't come up with any problems in my life that could be solved with programming a project, so I tried leaning towards using them as learning opportunities that relate to my interests, and planned on switching them out on my resume to fit it for a bigger range job requirements/skills. At the same time as *that* though, I know that experience is a lot more important than projects to recruiters and I did feel like I was starting to get the hang of things with the help of my team at work. But of course, that might not be the case 6 days from now. If it is the case (hoping it is) I was wondering if I could get any advice from anyone for what to do.",

But the market is what it is and I'm uncomfortable, and I actually kinda hate working for myself, I've always been a big fan of 9-5, hated the risk of starting my own business, and only went for this because I was 99% sure it would work.\n\nBTW I find it hard to fathom this niche having enough demand to take us beyond single digit millions revenue. I could be wrong, I'm not a market analyst. But for this decision, assume that this biz will never pull more than 10MM revenue. At that level, it's probably still sustainable with just myself + agentic coding full time and some cheap support staff.",

While I am beyond grateful and happy to have achieved this goal of mine I’m feeling confused and lost.\n\nI am on a small team of developers in a large company where I have one other dev who works directly on my area of focus: we are the backend team of a large application development team. I assumed this would be my go to person/senior. However this person does not give me tasks or really communicate with me at all. If I ask questions they answer them, but they delegate nothing to me nor have they taken anytime to explain how our services work-basically our only communication we have is if I reach out with a question. I am okay with working independently and figuring things out but it feels super weird to sit in silence and to wonder what I should be doing besides familiarizing myself with our codebases.\n\nI finally managed to suggest something small to do to them, add some additionally error handling to an api + some unit tests and they just said go ahead and submit a PR and I’ll review. The PR hasn’t been reviewed yet after 4 days. \n\nI have a manger that is the manger for the whole dev team but not technical, and he told my priorities should be getting api x working, which it is and then to begin work on brand new service.\n\nWe don’t use JIRA or anything of the sort either. Has anyone been in a situation like this before? Am I being paranoid as it’s still so early into my new job? Any advice would be appreciated!",

        "content": "So I’m coming to the end of my bachelor's in CS from WGU and have a decision to make. For context, this is where I’m at.\n\nI’m 24. I have an associate's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from a local community college, which helped kickstart my career as an automation engineer. For those who aren’t familiar, an automation engineer, in my case, is responsible for the automation of manufacturing equipment. I’m way oversimplifying here, but the job entails developing and troubleshooting specialized controllers that typically use non-traditional programming languages. Principles remain largely the same, so there is definitely a huge skill overlap between programming and the ever-growing need for more advanced computer systems for control and data acquisition in manufacturing. Today, I have about 8 years of full-time industry experience (4 as an engineer) and am almost finished with my bachelor's in CS from WGU.\n\nI started my CS program at WGU to check a promotion box in my current career. Still, I've always had a nagging fantasy of moving into a software engineering position or a similar role. With that in mind, what would be the wisest choice for me for a master's program?\n\nWGU affords me time, which is very important to me right now. My current position demands a lot of my time, and I never know when I might get called in to work. I am 24/7 on-call site support and the lead for my team, which means even on my “off” weeks, I’m still supporting the juniors. It’s a lot. \n\nOMSCS appears to be a much more rigorous workload AND schedule, but carries much more prestige. My main question is for folks who are already in the software engineering field. How much does that prestige matter for \\*me\\*? Do you feel my experience is relevant enough, or would I be filtered out immediately? I’m currently making around 105k base in an MCOL city, but am also worried about starting pay. I will be receiving a roughly \\~7% raise this year and expect around \\~10-15% the following year with a promotion. That puts my base at about 125k by the time I assume a master's program would wrap up. Would I be shooting myself in the foot by expecting a significant pay drop to make this transition happen?\n\nI’m hoping someone else has been through a similar path, but I’ve found my situation to be pretty unique and am struggling to find good resources as I don’t have a single connection within the tech industry.

I know cliche, but it's pretty niche so I'm hopeful. I've tried reaching out to people on Reddit but no luck yet, now want to switch to doing a full service for free for one project, make a recording of myself presenting why that was done, why that helps, why it's worth it, etc.\n* Just recently (2d ago) I've started reaching out to Real Estate agents regarding specific web services I can provide for them to increase their lead capture rate. Sent about 30 messages and will definitely be sending more.\n\nNow that I put it on \"paper\" I haven't really tried that many things for my age (23), and just as of recently I've started being more serious about \"biting\" into it. I want to have people alike around me, someone that's about grinding and working on owning something of his own that generates him revenue. I'm sure I'll meet them along the way once I have an actual model that works and I get into those people's space.\n\nThe closest people I have to that is random guys I follow on Instagram to look up to, they're relatively young, making good money doing online business - but again those are not friends. I should find a way to meet them and make them friends/partners but I feel like I have nothing to show/prove yet to make me worthy.\n\nI've got 1 close friend that also works from home and likes to hustle but he's not that disciplined in working together and doing it all day every day (we've lived together before for a bit). He for example recently didn't want to go to a trip to Asia where we'd be with our girlfriends and work all day every day, hit the gym, etc. He's pushing his design business (cups, t-shirts, posters, etc), needs to stay in the country because of it, and is making an okay amount of money but unfortunately not someone I can look at as \"we're gonna push each other and make a crap ton of money while being in hot weather, this is going to be great\". I've tried pushing him, trust me.\n\nI personally think that my only option is some scalable side hustle that will one day become my main work. I could try and get over-employed/contact work but that isn't scalable so I'd be stuck at having 2 jobs and a max of 5-7k EUR/month.\n\nI'm honestly okay alone as well of course but thought I'd put this out there with the goal of meeting like-minded people, or people who have already made it.\n\nWhat I'll be doing for the next period is the same as of now, sit home and work as much as possible.\n\n**I'd be more than happy to get advice from you guys! I don't feel lost but it's difficult to tell with just my perspective.**\n\nThank you if you read all this! Feel free to hit me up, I'd love to connect.",
