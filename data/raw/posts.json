Meanwhile, we're losing money on servers that barely do anything most of the time. I finally convinced them to add gravitee to at least get visibility into what we're actually using and it confirmed what I suspected, we're wasting so much capacity. The funniest part of it is we started using kafka for pretty simple stuff like sending notifications between services and now it's this massive thing nobody wants to touch\n\nAnyone else dealing with this?

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my situation and get some honest perspective from this community.\n\nI’m a data engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience building and maintaining production pipelines. Most of my work has been around Spark (batch + streaming), Kafka, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS and GCP), and large-scale data systems used by real business teams. I’ve worked on real-time event processing, data migrations, and high-volume pipelines, not just toy projects.\n\nDespite that, the current job hunt has been brutal.\n\nI’ve been applying consistently for months. I do get callbacks, recruiter screens, and even technical rounds. But I keep getting rejected late in the process or after hiring manager rounds. Sometimes the feedback is vague. Sometimes there’s no feedback at all. Roles get paused. Headcount disappears. Or they suddenly want an exact internal tech match even though the JD said otherwise.\n\nWhat’s making this harder is the pressure outside work. I’m managing rent, education costs, and visa timelines, so the uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I know I’m capable, I know I’ve delivered in real production environments, but this market makes you question everything.\n\nI’m trying to understand a few things:\n\n\t•\tIs this level of rejection normal right now even for experienced data engineers?\n\n\t•\tAre companies strongly preferring very narrow stack matches over fundamentals?\n\n\t•\tIs the market simply oversaturated, or am I missing something obvious in how I’m interviewing or positioning myself?\n\n\t•\tFor those who recently landed roles, what actually made the difference?\n\nI’m not looking for sympathy. I genuinely want to improve and adapt. If the answer is “wait it out,” I can accept that. If the answer is “your approach is wrong,” I want to fix it.\n\nAppreciate any real advice, especially from people actively hiring or who recently went through the same thing.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I wonder if we are too vested into Snowflake and would like to understand pros/cons from the community. The majority of the processing and transformations are done in Snowflake. I anticipate we deal with 5TB of data when we add up all the raw sources we pull today.\n\nQuick overview of inputs/outputs:\n\nEL with minor transformations like appending a timestamp or converting from csv to json. This is done with AWS Fargate running a batch job daily and pulling from the raw sources. Data is written to raw tables within a schema in Snowflake, dedicated to be the 'stage'. But we aren't using internal or external stages.\n\nWhen it hits the raw tables, we call it Bronze. We use Snowflake streams and tasks to ingest and process data into Silver tables. Task has logic to do transformations.\n\nFrom there, we generate Snowflake views scoped to our customers. Generally views are created to meet usecases or limit the access.\n\nMajority of our customers are BI users that use either tableau or power bi. We have some app teams that pull from us but not as common as BI teams.\n\nI have seen teams not use any snowflake features and just handle all transformations outside of snowflake. But idk if I can truly do a medallion architecture model if not all stages of data sit in Snowflake. \n\nCost is probably an obvious concern. Wonder if alternatives will generate more savings.\n\nThanks in advance and curious to see responses.",

        "author": "Remarkable_Result596",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi All,\n\n​Looking for a bit of advice on a career struggle. I like my job quite a lot—it has given me learning opportunities that I don’t think would have materialized elsewhere—but I’ve hit some roadblocks.\n\nThe Context\n\n​I’m 26 and based in the EU. I have a Master’s in Economics/Statistics and about 4 years of experience in Data (strictly Data Engineering for the last 2).\n​My current role has been very rewarding because I’ve had the initiative to really expand my stack. I’m the \"Databricks guy\" (Admin, Unity Catalog, PySpark, ...) within my team, but lately, I’ve been primarily focused on building out a hybrid data architecture. Specifically, I’ve been focusing on the on-premise side:\n\n​Infrastructure: Setting up an on-prem Dagster deployment on Kubernetes. Also django based apps, POCing tools like OpenMetadata.\n\n​Modern Data Stack (On-prem): Experimenting with DuckDB, Polars, dbt, and dlthub to make our local setup click with our cloud environments (Azure/GCP/Fabric, onprem even).\n\n​Upcoming: A project for real-time streaming with Debezium and Kafka. I’d mostly be a consumer here, but it’s a setup I really want to see through. Definitely have a room impact the architecture there and downstream.\n​\nThe Problem\n\n​Even though I value the \"builder\" autonomy, two things are weighing on me:\n\n​The Salary Ceiling: I’m somewhat bound by my starting salary. I recently learned that a new hire in a lower position is earning about 10% more than me. It’s not a massive gap, but it’s frustrating given the difference in impact. My manager kind of acknowledges my value but says getting HR to approve a 30-50% \"market adjustment\" is unlikely.\n\n​The 6-Month Notice: This is the biggest blocker. I get reach-outs for roles paying 50-100% more and I’ve usually done well in initial stages, but as soon as the 6-month notice period comes up, I’m effectively disqualified. I probably can't move unless I resign first.\n\n​The Dilemma\n\n​I definitely don’t think I’m an expert in everything and believe there is still a whole lot of unique learning to squeeze out of my current role, and I would love to see this through. I’m torn on whether to:\n​Keep learning: Stay for another year to \"tie it all together\" and get the streaming/Kafka experience on my CV.\n​Risk it: Resign without a plan just to free myself from the 6-month notice period and become \"employable\" again.\n​Do you think it's worth sticking it out for the environment and the upcoming projects, or am I just letting myself be underpaid while my tenure in the market is still fresh?\n\n\n​TL;DR: 4 YoE DE with a heavy focus on on-prem MDS and Databricks. I have great autonomy, but I’m underpaid compared to new hires and \"trapped\" by a 6-month notice period. Should I stay for the learning or quit to find a role that pays market rate?",

High-level flow + tradeoffs, or do they expect concrete decisions around storage formats, orchestration patterns, SLAs, backfills, data quality, cost controls, etc.?\n* Do they prefer to lean more toward “design a data platform” or “design a specific pipeline/use case” in your experience?\n\nI’m trying to calibrate how much time to spend refreshing specific tools vs practicing generalized design thinking and tradeoff discussions.

        "author": "Groove-Theory",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Long ass post sorry. Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR questions if you don't want the backstory.**\n\n# Backstory:\n\nHowdy... not entirely sure this is the right subreddit for this (between here and the BI sub) but figured I'd start here.\n\nOk so... I'm a tech lead for our engineers working on our core product in a startup. I am NOT on the data engineering or BI side of things, but my involvement in BI matters is growing, and this is me sanity-checking what I see.\n\nOur data stack is I think ok for a startup. We source our data, which is mostly our main Postgres DB plus with a few other third party tracking sources, with 5X into our staging tables in BigQuery. Then we use dbt to bucket our data into dimensions, fact tables, and what are called \"reporting tables\" which are the highest 1-to-1 tables that are used in whatever presentation layer we use (which is Looker). Our ingestion/bootstrap logic all exists in a GitHub repo.\n\nThis entire system was originally designed and put together by a very experienced senior data engineer when we were in a scaling phase. Unfortunately, they were laid-off some time ago cuz of runway issues before they could completely finish everything. Since that time, our management has continually pushed for additional and additional reporting, but we haven’t replaced that position. And it's getting worse.\n\nToday, we have ONE business analyst (not on the eng team) with no tech skills, having learned SQL basics from ChatGPT. They create reports as best as they can, but idk how correct they are in querying stuff from the BI layer (frankly I don't care tbh, not the eng team's concern)\n\nAnyway, the business comes to us with a regular set of new reporting requirements for tables, but many of these do not make sense. At all.\n\nFor example: *\"I’d like a list of all cars, but also like a column for how much spaghetti people eat per day, and then a column of every fish in the sea, and we need a dashboard for the fish-spaghetti-car metric per month \"*. That kind of bullshit\n\nSince we still have a reduced team post-layoffs, product management has started working on sprint stories for any product improvement we do such as *“Create a reporting table for the spaghetti bullshit above\"* despite the underlying data structure being ambiguous or incorrect (and not being a spaghetti company). Which I think is pretty fucking weird that they're telling us what the actual implementation should be.\n\nWe, as software engineers, are comfortable designing application schemas and writing database queries against Postgres (and the PG layer is well formed imo). We, however, are not professionals in business intelligence, and we are facing more and more questions about dimensional design, report structure, which are questions we feel uncomfortable answering.\n\nThe most aggravating part of this process is the business will attempt almost anything rather than considering adding another senior BI or data engineering person to the staff. They have attempted to draw general engineering talent into doing business intelligence tasks when that isn’t their technical niche. They have attempted to use short-term or lower-quality consultants. Many times, they have simply pressed onward with what we understand to be an iffy model.\n\nIncreasingly I spend my time fighting off requests against our team or explaining to others why some of those requests are simply nonsensical (in a polite manner of course) but I feel I'm slowly losing that fight over time, and my head of Product/Eng is not helping me here.\n\nI always knew the business was crazy when just dealing with product AC, but I've realized they really go fucking bonkers when you talk to them about anything related to a dashboard.\n\n# My questions to ya'll\n\n*(skip to here if you didn't want to read my sob story above)*\n\nMy questions are about whether we have a common concept of \"good\" data modeling and who really is responsible. The engineering department is picking up all of this slack, and BI isn’t really our expertise. So...\n\n* When is the time for the BI/data modeling necessarily a full-time endeavor and not something that should be accomplished as part of the product engineering team, if at all? Are there any heuristics that you have observed for smaller startups?\n* Is there ever value in planning or building \"bad\" or ugly reporting tables to meet current business requirements, or is it almost always harmful?\n* If leadership wants speed and they do not have data modeling knowledge, what data governance patterns work well for you?\n* How do you communicate concepts of dimensional modeling to non-technical business audiences in a way that leads to lasting behavior change? (If at all lol)\n* Finally, if leadership is flatly unwilling to engage experienced BI/DE talent, then what is the least worst alternative you've encountered?\n\nI'm way outside my lane here as a non-DE so any advice is greatly appreciated.

        "author": "shashanksati",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been building [SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB), for most of this year and I wanted to share what we’re working on and get genuine feedback from people who are interested in databases and distributed systems.\n\n*Sevendb is a distributed cache with pub/sub capabilities and configurable fsync.*\n\n# What problem we’re trying to solve\n\nA lot of modern applications need \\*\\*live data\\*\\*:\n\n* dashboards that should update instantly\n* tickers and feeds\n* systems reacting to rapidly changing state\n\nToday, most systems handle this by **polling-** clients repeatedly asking the database “*has*\n\n*this changed yet?*”. That wastes CPU, bandwidth, and introduces latency and complexity.\n\nTriggers do help a lot here , but as soon as multiple machine and low latency applications enter , they get dicey\n\nscaling databases horizontally introduces another set of problems:\n\n* nondeterministic behavior under failures\n* subtle bugs during retries, reconnects, crashes, and leader changes\n* difficulty reasoning about correctness\n\nSevenDB is our attempt to tackle both of these issues together.\n\n# What SevenDB does\n\nAt a high level, SevenDB is:\n\n**1. Reactive by design**\n\nInstead of clients polling, clients can \\*subscribe\\* to values or queries.\n\nWhen the underlying data changes, updates are pushed automatically.\n\nThink:\n\n\\* “Tell me whenever this value changes” instead of \"polling every few milliseconds\"\n\nThis reduces wasted work(compute , network and even latency) and makes real-time systems simpler and cheaper to run.\n\n**2. Deterministic execution**\n\nThe same sequence of logical operations always produces the same state.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n*  crash recovery becomes predictable\n*  retries don’t cause weird edge cases\n*  multi-replica behavior stays consistent\n*  bugs become reproducible instead of probabilistic nightmares\n\nWe explicitly test determinism by running randomized workloads hundreds of times across scenarios like:\n\n*  crash before send / after send\n*  reconnects (OK, stale, invalid)\n*  WAL rotation and pruning\n\n\\* 3-node replica symmetry with elections\n\nIf behavior diverges, that’s a bug.\n\n\\*\\*3. Raft-based replication\\*\\*\n\nWe use Raft for consensus and replication, but layer deterministic execution on top so that replicas don’t just \\*agree\\*—they behave identically.\n\nThe goal is to make distributed behavior boring and predictable.\n\n# Interesting part\n\nWe're an in-memory KV store , One of the fun challenges in SevenDB was making emissions fully deterministic. We do that by pushing them into the state machine itself. No async “surprises,” no node deciding to emit something on its own. If the Raft log commits the command, the state machine produces the exact same emission on every node. Determinism by construction.\n\nBut this compromises speed significantly , so what we do to get the best of both worlds is:\n\nOn the durability side: a SET is considered successful only after the Raft cluster commits it—meaning it’s replicated into the in-memory WAL buffers of a quorum. Not necessarily flushed to disk when the client sees “OK.”\n\nWhy keep it like this? Because we’re taking a deliberate bet that plays extremely well in practice:\n\n• **Redundancy buys durability** In Raft mode, our real durability is replication. Once a command is in the memory of a majority, you can lose a minority of nodes and the data is still intact. The chance of most of your cluster dying before a disk flush happens is tiny in realistic deployments.\n\n• **Fsync is the throughput killer** Physical disk syncs (fsync) are orders slower than memory or network replication. Forcing the leader to fsync every write would tank performance. I prototyped batching and timed windows, and they helped—but not enough to justify making fsync part of the hot path. (There is a durable flag planned: if a client appends durable to a SET, it will wait for disk flush. Still experimental.)\n\n• **Disk issues shouldn’t stall a cluster** If one node's storage is slow or semi-dying, synchronous fsyncs would make the whole system crawl. By relying on quorum-memory replication, the cluster stays healthy as long as most nodes are healthy.\n\nSo the tradeoff is small: yes, there’s a narrow window where a simultaneous majority crash could lose in-flight commands. But the payoff is huge: predictable performance, high availability, and a deterministic state machine where emissions behave exactly the same on every node.\n\nIn distributed systems, you often bet on the failure mode you’re willing to accept. This is ours.\n\nit helped us achieve these benchmarks\n\n    SevenDB benchmark — GETSET\n    Target: localhost:7379, conns=16, workers=16, keyspace=100000, valueSize=16B, mix=GET:50/SET:50\n    Warmup: 5s, Duration: 30s\n    Ops: total=3695354 success=3695354 failed=0\n    Throughput: 123178 ops/s\n    Latency (ms): p50=0.111 p95=0.226 p99=0.349 max=15.663\n    Reactive latency (ms): p50=0.145 p95=0.358 p99=0.988 max=7.979 (interval=100ms)\n\n# Why I'm posting here\n\nI started this as a potential contribution to dicedb, they are archived for now and had other commitments , so i started something of my own, then this became my master's work and now I am confused on where to go with this, I really love this idea but there's a lot we gotta see apart from just fantacising some work of yours\n\nWe’re early, and this is where we’d really value outside perspective.\n\nSome questions we’re wrestling with:\n\n*  Does “reactive + deterministic” solve a real pain point for you, or does it sound academic?\n*  What would stop you from trying a new database like this?\n*  Is this more compelling as a niche system (dashboards, infra tooling, stateful backends), or something broader?\n*  What would convince you to trust it enough to use it?\n\nBlunt criticism or any advice is more than welcome. I'd much rather hear “this is pointless” now than discover it later.\n\nHappy to clarify internals, benchmarks, or design decisions if anyone’s curious.",

So I do not have experience in all these usages that you refer to. My question is, what is the actual usable output from all of these. For example, we load data from various to Snowflake using COPY INTO, use  SQL to create a Star schema model. The \"usable Output\" we get in this scenario are various analytics dashboards and reports created using Qlikview etc.\n\n\\[Question 1\\] Similarly, what is the output of a ML pipeline in data bricks ?\n\nI read all these posts about Data Engineering that talk about Snowflake vs Databricks, PySpark vs SQL, loading data to Parquet files, BI vs ML workloads - I want to understand what is the usable output from all these activities that you do ?\n\nWhat is a Machine Learning output? Is it something like a Predictive Information, a Classification etc. ?\n\nI saw a thread about loading images. What type of outputs do you get out of this? Are these uses for Ops applications or for Reporting purposes?\n\nFor example, could an ML output from a Databricks Spark application be the suggestion of what movie to watch next on netflix ? Or perhaps to build an LLM such as ChatGPT ? And if so, are all these done by a Data Engineer or an  ML Engineer?\n\n\\[Question 2\\] Are all these outputs achieved using unstructured data in its unstructured form - or do you eventually need to model it into a schema to be able to get necessary outputs? How do you account of duplications, and non-uniqueness and relational connections between data entities if used in unstructured formats?\n\njust curious to understand the modern usage, by a traditional warehouse Data Engineer?",

Here are some proposals and I want to hear any tradeoffs between them. \n\nS3 Sink connector - lands the data in s3 in parquet files in bronze layer. Then have a secondary glue job that reads new parquet files and writes them to Iceberg tables. This can be done every 2 mins? Can I setup something like a microbatch glue job approach here for this? What I don't like about this is there are two components here and there is a batch/polling approach to check for changes and write to Iceberg. \n\nGlue streaming - Glue streaming job that reads the kafka topics then directly writes to Iceberg. A lot more boilerplate code compared to the configuration code above. Also not near real time, job needs to be scheduled. Need to see how to handle failures more visibly. \n\nWhile near real time would be ideal, 2-3 mins delay is ok for landing in bronze. Ordering is important. The same data also will need to be cleaned for insertion in silver tables, transformed and loaded via rest apis to another service (hopefully in another 2-3 mins). Also thinking to handle idempotency in the silver layer or does that need to be handled in bronze?\n\nOne thing to consider also is compaction optimizations. Our data lands in parquet in \\~100 kb size with many small files per hour (\\~100-200 files in each hourly partition dir). Should I be setting my partition differently? I have the partition set to year, month, day, hour. \n\nI'm trying to understand what is the best approach here to meet the requirements above. ",

        "content": "So my company runs qualitative tech audits for several purposes (M&A, Carveouts, health checks…). The questions we ask are a bit different from regular audits in the sense that they aren’t very structured with check list items. My team focuses specifically on data and analytics (typically downstream of OLTP), so It ends up being more of a conversation with data leads, data engineers, and data scientists. We ask questions to test maturity, scalability and reliability. I’m in a junior role and my job is basically taking notes while a lead conducts the questionnaire and deliver the write up based on my lead’s diagnosis and prescription. \n\nI have come to learn a lot of concepts on job and through projects of my own but I still lack the confidence and adaptability required to run interviews myself. So I need practice…Does anyone know where I can go to practice interviewing someone on either a data platform they have at work or something they built for a personal project? Alternatively, is anyone here interested in being interviewed (I imagine we could work something out that could be good prep for folks in the job market)?",

IDE - VSCode. With extensions you have so much functionality. \n2. Git - obviously \n3. Docker \n\nI guess these three are probably common for most devs lol. Coming in 4th for me would be an SFTP client. But you could just use a script instead. Docker is more beneficial I think. \n\nEdit: for sake of good conversation let’s just say VS Code and Git are pre installed. \n\nEdit 2: obviosuly the computer your work gave you came with an OS and a web browser.

You personally log errors provided by the ‘opposing’ company for why this process didn’t complete. 55% of the time you get an actual reason provided and steps to resolve by sending a communication or resolving by updating or correcting issue with information provided. Other times it will be a generic reason provided by the ‘main team’ and nothing notated by the ‘opposing team’ and you would have to do additional research to send the proper communication to a client or their advisor/liaison. Or figure out the issue and resolve it then and there. \n\n3. There are appropriate forms of communication to send to the client/advisor with steps to complete the process\n\n. If you collected data from the top biggest ‘opposing teams’ and have data to present would they be able to change some of their rules? Would you be able impose stricter guidelines at the point of entry when information comes through so the issue ceases before reaching point b? Once enough data and proof have been collected and shown to these ‘opposing teams’? \n\n4. Issue is there is no standardization for these rejection reasons. The given ones in lists are not exhaustive enough. Majority work but do not fit all situations. If you were to see the same rejection reason from specific ‘opposing teams’ aka Firms. How would you collect and present that data to impose change? Could you collect enough data organize it by Firm, rejection reason, true reason & system reason, time/date, and visualize it? “This firm caused by X amount to y. This firm caused us xyz if we were to do this and eliminate this it would save us xyz. Basically reducing same reoccurring issues so we could focus on more complex things? \n\nThis might not make sense as I’m not using names etc etc  but it is in the financial services realm.

I made improvements to the app and released new version. The app is now available to download from Microsoft store and Linux Snap store.\n\n**What My Project Does:**\n\nTidyBit is a File Organizer app. It helps organize messy collection of files in folders such as Downloads, Desktop or from External drives. The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders.\n\n*The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.*\n\nThis is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules.\n\nThe app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.\n\nAdd new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nMost other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store. The app is also available to download as an executable file for windows and portable Linux App Image format on GitHub releases.\n\nCheck the app: [TidyBit Github Repository](https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit)",

Now they are advocating a proprietary DW technology like all the other players (snowflake, fabric DW, redshift,.etc)\n\nConclusions seem to be obvious:\n\n- they are not going to open source their DW, or their lakebase\n- they still maintain the importance of delta/parquet but these are artifacts that are generated as a byproduct of their DW engine.\n- ongoing enhancements like MST will mean that the most authoritative and the most performant copy of data is found in the managed catalog of their DW.\n\nThe hype around lakehouses seems like it was so short lived.  We seem to be reverting back to conventional and proprietary database engines.  I hate going round in circles, but it was so predictable.\n\nEDITED: typos",

When someone smart tries to talk to me about a project ideia for instance, I just \"break\" and even ask them to repeat it 4 times until they give up. On the internship it was the same he needed  explain to me 10x  the same thing untill I half got it (he had a lot of patience) it took me months to even understand completly what the project was really about.\n\nShould I just give up?",

Felt that I got in by sheer luck. \n\nAcademically, I’m not smart. I was generally a B-student back in CS college. But I did enjoy SWE mods like networks, distributed systems, or even learning algorithms. \n\nOver the past 3 years, my job has been rather chill and I don’t read outside of work. I didn’t learn much while doing frontend for 2 years - my code looks more or less the same because frontend frameworks are very abstracted at my company.\n\nNow that I’m in my 3rd year without promotion, I’ve been looking for jobs. I’m terrible at Leetcode, not good at systems design, my problem-solving skills aren’t great either so I’ve been failing interviews here and there. Sometimes I get frontend interviews, which will test JavaScript or React or even HTML/CSS, where each language/framework has a lot of concepts to learn about. \n\nI feel that there’s endless to study for and I’m fighting against a bar that is high but I can’t even see where it is.\n\nIt’s been demoralising. I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. \n\nI have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. \nBut it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.\n\nAs an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.\n\nI think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using. \n\nBut now I feel so exhausted just by the thought of studying. It feels endless. I feel that I’m a terrible engineer and that I’m paying the price of not working hard for the past few years. \n",

While it’s not as difficult as other situations, I still want to keep improving to reach better roles. And I’ve been there too. Day after day trying to figure out what to build to improve, and even so I believe the previous advice still applies.\n\nSo, what is that project that interest me so much and made me change my mind? Just a self-hosting e-book library. Sorry if I disappointed someone (I'm not). I got a Kindle a few weeks ago and since I also like home-labs and self-hosting I looked for an app, but every one feels like artificial and not personal, and as a book lover, I want my library to feel personal, something that I truly own, so I decided to build one.\n\nYou may think, what can an e-book library teach? Well, is not about the specific case of my app, but more of the concept/problem itself that needs to be implemented or solved that can be applied for many contexts. For example: what if an user have 5000 books? How should I store the covers vs basic metadata (cache vs database)? How can I process all that books in seconds (concurrency & parallelism to improve performance)? How can I avoid the rate limits of an external api? How do I keep the database in sync if the user manually deletes a file? What if I implement an internal ddbb back up tool? Can I pass all the books from kindle to the library directly?\n\nAnd even if I knew about some of that questions before, applying it yourself will always teach you more that just theory.\n\nSome people will think that thinking about all that stuff early in the project may be over-engineering, but who cares, is your project you can do whatever you can with it according to your objectives, not someone else ideas. \n\nSo thanks to everyone who has always given that advice, and for those who are in the situation I mentioned, it’s better to build a project that seems simple on the surface, but where you really dive deep than creating something that looks good on paper but you’re not invested in.",

While I did pick up some new tools and workflows that school never taught me, I quickly felt like I was hitting a ceiling—just stuck in frameworks and endless CRUD missions. I wanted more.\n\nWhile looking for a way out, someone recommended **SICP** (the Wizard Book). They told me that just finishing the first three chapters would make me a good programmer, and finishing the exercises in the last two could make me a great one.\n\nI actually tried reading it in college a few times but gave up because it was tough and felt completely disconnected from what school was teaching. But about six months ago, I gave it another shot and started grinding through the exercises.\n\nI recently finished the first three chapters, and it honestly blew my mind. It gave me a whole new perspective on programming. But here's the catch: before the book, I wrote spaghetti code that \"just worked.\" Now... I’m painfully aware that I’m writing garbage, but I don't know where to start fixing it. (Honestly, I want to fire myself after realizing how terrible my code is.)\n\nThat's the problem. I feel like I've studied how to build the tools, but **in my current role**, I’m just expected to use them blindly. I have the vision now, but I lack the bridge between this high-level theory and my daily coding practice. What should I do next?",

Not impossible and I like the memory safety things.\n\n**- Use C#:** good documentation and toolchain but maybe I will feel I want something lower.\n\nDo you have any advice about what would give me the best experience?

        "author": "spunky_crunk",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm trying to understand why I can pass arrays into functions by declaring a pointer parameter. I've done this several times to pass arrays of different lengths into general purpose functions (along with their lengths) for software that I've written, but although I thought I had a grasp on the inner workings, I've found I'm unable to fully explain what's going on.\n\nHere's my understanding, using a simple example. \n\n    #include <iostream>\n    \n    using std::cout;\n    \n    float averageScores(float* scores, int length) \n    {\n        float sum;\n       \n        for (int i=0; i<length; i++)\n        {\n            sum = sum + scores[i];\n        }\n        float average = sum/length;\n        return average;\n    }\n    \n    \n    int main()\n    {\n        float testScores [] = {81.2, 90, 91.8, 76.3, 78.4};\n        int numScores = sizeof(testScores)/sizeof(testScores[0]);\n        float classAverage = averageScores(testScores, numScores);\n        cout<<classAverage;\n        return 0;\n    } \n\nMight not be the most efficient way to do this but you get the idea. What I've done is passed an array of test scores into a function that calculates their average. However, to my understanding, when I declare an array variable, it's actually interpreted as something like &testScores\\[0\\], or the memory location of the first float variable in testScores. \n\nFirst question: the entire array is stored at that memory location, correct? So if the memory location is something like 0x5ffe60, that's where the entire array is stored?\n\nNow, in my function I have declared the parameters float\\* scores and int length. float\\* scores is a pointer. So, this to me seems like creating a pointer to a memory address, similar to the classic example folks usually show when discussing pointers:\n\nint x = 6;  \nint \\*pX = \\&x;\n\nWhere pX is a pointer to the memory location at which the value of x is stored. So, similarly, it seems that \n\nfloat \\*scores = &testScores\\[0\\].\n\nNow, my ultimate question: given that C++ is particular about variable types matching, does this mean that &x and &testScores\\[0\\] are \"pointer types?\" Like, \\* and & are just inverses of the same variable type, and that's why I can write a function that expects a pointer and pass it a memory address.\n\nSo both \\*scores and &testScores\\[0\\] are float\\* numbers? \n\nI think I'm missing something because my explanation feels inconsistent. If anyone could clarify what I have right and wrong about this, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Because If you fix the underlying bug you directly fix the problem being reported. Or does it just mean that sometimes you just look at the symptom and you don't go deeper to see underlying bug?\n\n  \nPS: Sorry if this too dumb question lol",

Whenever a new model is released, they rush to upload yet another shallow video either praising it or criticizing it and compare it with other models. This trend is spreading like a virus.\n\nI honestly don’t understand what they are doing or WHY. I wonder what AI has done to senior engineers(as they talk about themselves). I don’t like how the community is being ruined. It has become increasingly difficult to discover new, genuine channels as the algorithm aggressively pushes these repetitive videos.\n\nI am going to unsubscribe lots of youtube channel next year!",

I originally self tought for one year, it was okay but I was curious about more and enrolled for this and a diploma. It is free, due to my country.\n\nSo, my problem. My main issue is how we learn stuff and the testing model. In classes like Calculus, electronics, or physics, you can add more, it feels like we just memorize algorithms to solve questions. I can learn the 'why' from external sources, for example books or Prof.Leonard for calculus but at uni, if you solve 100 past years questions or questions from books, you still can get a good grade, without truly knowing the material. This means that you cannot solve a different kind of problem that involves the integral that you learned 1 week ago and passed the exam, because you didn't understand what you doing, just memorize algorithm.\n\nI have many friends, even when they got a good grade, they still lack an understanding. I don't want to be same but what's point?  \nAm I right to feel this way or I'm being ignorant?  \nSorry for long post and bad english.\n\n**TL;DR:** University exams feel like testing memorized solution patterns  rather than deep conceptual understanding. Is this a valid concern or just how academia works?\n\n\n\n",

Content creation doesn't really scratch the same itch.\n\nIt's like with content creation you make things that people watch but how impactful is that? Half of the stuff we watch we don't even remember ....but with coding you make things that people USE.\n\nAnd that's what I think is so cool.\n\nPart of me worries that because I'm bad at math I'll never really \"get\" programming, I also worry I'm not smart enough for it...but I enjoy it.\n\nAnyway I don't know if this post is something that people will love, or not, but I just wanted to share it. It's late here, 4am and I've been really struggling last few days with figuring out what I enjoy.\n\nI've been trying to be a \"content creator\" for the last few weeks, and while I'm really good at it, I don't think I enjoy it. It feels really fake and tbh, a large portion of content out there is entirely fake anyway.\n\nI still don't really understand where I fit in with life, but I like the idea of making stuff people use and I see myself for the next while making programs or apps that solve simple problems in peoples lives.

I’m looking for some serious advice on how to push myself forward when I feel like I’m stuck at a standstill. To give you some context: I’ve never considered myself a natural at tech. I didn’t do any advanced prep before starting my degree, and honestly, I struggled through my first year. I managed to pass, but looking back, I realize I was just surviving, not actually learning.\nThis year, due to personal circumstances, I had to switch to online classes. It’s been a disaster for my learning style. My professor primarily uploads modules and assessments without live sessions, leaving me to teach myself through YouTube and documentation. Here is the predicament: In trying to teach myself, I realized I’ve forgotten a lot from my first year. Even the most basic concepts have slipped away. I’ve decided to \"start from scratch\" while still trying to keep up with my current 2nd year workload. I’m currently grinding through Java learning strings, characters, loops, and operators while simultaneously staring down a mountain of Networking and SQL coursework including C++ and other programming languages that we’ve studied in my first year that I have to run through again, I feel completely overwhelmed. My progress feels incredibly slow. I see others online who seem to grasp these concepts effortlessly, and I can’t help but feel a deep sense of envy and doubt. I’m questioning if I’m even making progress or if I’m just not cut out for this. I’m not planning on changing my course I genuinely want to be good at this but the anxiety that I’ll never \"get it\" is starting to take over. I know going back to face-to-face classes eventually will help, but I also know that won't fix the fact that I'm currently starting from zero.\n\nHas anyone else felt like they were \"starting over\" in the middle of their degree? How do you deal with the slow progress and the feeling that you'll never catch up?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice on how to manage this workload or how to change my mindset so I can stop feeling like a failure.\n",

So far, most of what I’ve learned has been frontend-related (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some React concepts). The problem is… I’ve slowly realized that I really don’t enjoy frontend work.\n\nI don’t like dealing with UI, layout, styling, or making things “look nice.” I find it frustrating and draining. What I do enjoy is logic, problem-solving, data handling, and figuring out how things work behind the scenes. Deep down, I feel more drawn to backend development.\n\nNow I’m stuck mentally because: I’ve already invested around a year in TOP I don’t want to feel like I “wasted” that time I’m thinking of shifting toward backend-focused learning (maybe Python, APIs, databases, etc.)\n\nSo my questions are:\n\nIs this a normal realization?\n\nIs my frontend knowledge from TOP still useful if I move to backend?\n\nWould switching to backend now be a mistake, or is it better than forcing myself to continue frontend?\n\nIf you were in my position, what would you do?\n\nI’d really appreciate honest advice, especially from people who disliked frontend but found their place elsewhere.\n\nThanks!\n\nTL;DR: 1 year into TOP, realized I hate frontend and prefer backend logic.

As I'm a physicist, would it be nice to start with a functional language?\n\nEdit: I'm planning to program as a hobby, nothing work related. \n\nHi all. In my journey finding my path and fighting my low self-esteem. I stumbled with this book called [Learn physics with functional programming](https://nostarch.com/learn-physics-functional-programming). I'm a physicist and I was wondering if it would be a good idea to try to learn with this book. I know I would be using the book in reverse, instead of learning physics I would learn to program.\n\nAlso, Idk if starting with a functional programming would be a great idea. In the end, I'm used to work with functions. I did a bit of Java during uni but I don't remember much of it apart from the structure of the typical control flow statements ( if, for, foreach, switch, etc.). I know there are great books like the famous [SICP](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) for Scheme and [OCamL from the very beginning](https://ocaml-book.com/), that can be a good introduction to programming, but idk. I know I have to keep fighting and gain enough self-esteem to overcome my fears and do something. Maybe that's functional programming, who knows. What do you think? ",

My background isn't technical although I work for a software company where people are nice and usually happy to answer noob questions when they have the time. \n\nOver the years, I have learned some basics: Very basic Java and C++, what logic gates are, been messing around with Arduino, breadboards and chips, binary numbers, algebra and a bit of precalculus. But whatever information I have gathered seem pretty trivial and overall I feel like I don't \"get it\".\n\nRecently someone recommended that I start from the basics again and just focus on one gate per month before I go any further: write the truth table, the HDL description for that gate, and what the gate is made of (for example an OR gate is two NOT and one NAND gates) every day of the month and then do the same for the next gate the following month, until I have covered all the gates. The goal being that this becomes \"automatic\" for me.\n\nI am 38 and want to learn out of interest/hobby although part of me is secretly hoping to either make a bit of money with it in the future or even a new career. But I'm not in a rush and willing to take the time to make sure I understand what I'm doing.\n\nWhat's your take on the recommendation that was given to me? If you don't agree, what would be your strategy if you were me?\n\nThanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read and/or answer!",

        "content": "Hello guys,\n\nI'm spending my Christmas week brushing up on my C and I decided to go back to source material : ie Kernighan & Ritchie. Probably one of the best programming book I've read so far. Clear and concise (most of the time...).\n\nAnd even if there are sometimes sometimes some example that require you to spend a few minutes studying the code, you usually have been provided with the tools to understand them.\n\nHowever I'm having trouble understanding one line of their code example for function pointers. Here's the code :\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    \n    #define MAXLINE 5000     /* max #lines to be sorted */\n    char *lineptr[MAXLINES]  /* pointer to text lines */\n    \n    int readlines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);\n    void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines);\n    \n    void qsort(void *lineptr[], int left, int right,\n                  int (*comp)(void *, void *));\n    int numcomp(char *, char *);\n    \n    /* sort input lines */\n    main (int argc, char *argv[])\n    {\n      int nlines;          /* number of input lines read */\n      int numeric;         /* 1 if numeric sort */\n    \n      if(argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], \"-n\") == 0)\n        numeric = 1;\n      if((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) >= 0){\n        qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1,\n          (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));\n        writelines(lineptr, nlines);\n        return 0;\n      } else {\n        printf(\"input too big to sort\\n\");\n        return 1;\n      }\n    }\n\nand here is the line I'm having trouble with :\n\n    qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1,\n          (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));\n\nI understand that the last argument to qsort is a function pointer allowing you to customize the behaviour of the sorting algorithm. That pointer needs to point to a function that take 2 pointers to void as argument and returns an int.  \nI also understand that this part : **(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp)** is used to chose between the function **numcmp** and **strcmp** depending on if the **numeric** flag is set to 0 or not.\n\nThe book tells us that using a function name like this (without parentheses) in a expression evaluates to the addresses of the functions, a bit like using & for variable name or using the name of an array.  \nAnd so far, when passing a pointer as an argument to a function, we've been able to write **function(&variable);** as in **scanf(\"%d\", &count);**\n\nSo what's going on with **(int (\\*)(void\\*,void\\*))** just before ? Is that type casting because the functions **numcmp** and **strcmp** are declared to take pointer to char as arguments?  \nI think it is, but the book say nothing about it and the syntax is cryptic at best. I hope one of you guys could shed some lights on it.\n\nMerry Christmas and all the best to you all. ",

I am just cruising on the work of others and I feel like I have lost all interest, or forgotten everything I have learnt. My motivation is dead, every day I am on some calls, fix some small bugs and do some PR reviews which also I rarely read through.\n\nI thought it was burnout and took a 2 weeks break, but came back to the same empty feeling that I am just existing at this place, the joy I had when I first joined is dead.\n\nIt's a nice remote job, they pay on time and given the market right now, I am in a pretty comfortable position. I have tried interviewing at other places in hopes that maybe a new environment will help me, but I rarely prepare for them either, which means I fail them constantly then just stop giving anything a shot. \n\nAdd to the fact that coding agents are quickly catching on, some days I just use it to do my work, I feel like a fraud and don't know if I should continue down this path, or try to learn something new, maybe some other stack or completely distance myself from programming.\n\nHas anyone been in similar situations?

I had a great 3 months and got strong incline and got told I was the best intern they had and built good connections with the team i would return to, but I guess wlb is the big con\n\n\\- I reneged a Warner Bros. Discovery (HBO Max) (NYC) SWE return earlier for Bloomberg.\n\nUpcoming interviews:\n\n\\- Google SWE final (on site beginning of january): worried about team matching and timeline uncertainty I heard it takes forever.\n\n\\- Meta Production Engineering (PE) interviews in a week or so, not sure if PE aligns with my long term goals, so not sure if i should do the interviews\n\nI was able to get a sense of the bad Esh work life balance this fall at AWS, even though I had a great 3 months and was raised constantly for the work I was doing, it was a lot of work I owned a lot more than a “project” and seen the other full timers around me (was there during reinvent times which are known to be most stessful). I know it is better career growth and I would learn more than if I was at Bloomberg which is why I am considering it, but would love any advice from people at Bloomberg or know in general about the company. Sage maker is pretty secure no one gets affected from lay offs but thats just in the present, BB is known for way better security. Also should I still do the meta interviews which seems to be a long process and I am pretty happy with aws/bb or google if it happens. Also heard meta isnt the most secure. Thanks a lot in advance!",

Overall the search went much better than last time. With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.\n\nA few clarifying points about my labels:\n\n* \"Reached out to my network\" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.\n* \"AI agent applied for me\": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).\n* \"Withdrew after accepting other offer\": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the \"Declined\" label after \"Offer\".\n\nI've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.\n\nMy offers:\n\nSeries A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon\n-------------------|--------------------|------\naccepted | declined | declined\n$205k base | $200k base | $188k base\nno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonus\nOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)\n2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-Fri\n\nSome quick stats from the Sankey:\n\n* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)\n* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)\n* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.\n* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...\n* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had \"AI\" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.\n\nOverall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",

I'm 32 so I still have 35 years of career to go, even though it feels hard to start a new path when others have been growing in their path. My sister is getting ready to become a PRN and I feel so jealous! Although the nursing path would probably never have been open to me - she's been working night shifts in the ICU and I couldn't deal with the trauma and night schedule. \n\nFor those who have left CS or are planning to leave, what did you do or what do you plan on doing?

        "content": "So I'm soon to become one of those \"unemployed CS majors\" everyone keeps talking about once I graduate. I've been struggling to find meaningful employment, and don't have a job lined up. The way things are currently heading, after graduation I'm likely just heading back to my mom's house and maybe working some shitty retail job with 0 upward mobility. This is a future some people (including some friends) from my high school have achieved without attending college, and if that's my future, it means my mom will have wasted 4 years on an expensive degree that ended up being worthless.\n\nI'm well aware that it only gets harder and harder to find a full-time job the longer you wait after graduating. Which is why I'm frightened of being jobless or underemployed once that happens, and then having an awkward gap in my resume to have to explain, which only gets more and more awkward the longer I wait.\n\nThe roles I've been applying to include SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science. While my undergraduate internship grinds have been very hit-or-miss, I have some \"roundabout\" experience (multiple unpaid internships + paid research) on my resume, some of it ongoing (and my performance there has been satisfactory), which I've been told is enough to land me interviews, which I have. It's just that I've been struggling to pass these interviews. I've known people who've managed to hand-wave themselves in through interviews just by talking a bit, but I've somehow failed even one of those when given one (though that was partially my fault since my reference waved me through without even giving me the JD).\n\nMy clear metric for \"success\" is having enough money to *be able to* move away from home and afford a non-shitty apartment if I wanted to (and in the event I don't, it'll be because the job is in my metro area, aka NYC). If I don't achieve this, I'll have failed. I wouldn't say I'm asking for much, and I feel like this is a quite reasonably low bar to clear, and if I don't clear it, I'm a failure.\n\nNow that it's Christmas already and I still don't have any kind of post-college offer in hand, things are not looking up. I've barely applied to any positions between Thanksgiving and Christmas and have secured 0 new interviews therein. I barely even grind Leetcode anymore, since it just makes me disappointed whenever I fail questions that are supposedly \"Easy\" or \"Medium\". If you gave me a Leetcode-style interview or OA right now, I'd probably fail it. I've yet to actually receive such an *interview* (OAs I have, with mixed performance), but I'm well aware that many companies do ask them. A lot of what I've failed so far is behavioral, though I've passed a few.\n\nI've received mixed messaging on whether to consider grad school. My parents aren't going to pay for it and I'll have to take out expensive loans if I do go for it. And I know cheap online programs like OMSCS exist, but I don't know if they're right or if it'll be too challenging, and I'm not even sure if it's something I'm seriously invested in either. The whole field just seems like a sinking ship with AI and all, and people seem to be right about there being no need to hire any more juniors.\n\nI just want to know what to do, because things seem absolutely grim, and people who've been through 2008 keep calling me entitled and telling me that the job market now isn't nearly as bad as 2008. Keep doing what I'm doing and hope something lands? But if nothing lands, what then? Certmaxx and pivot to IT? Push boxes in some Amazon warehouse alongside people without college degrees, rendering the degree worthless?",

        "content": "I’m a first-year CS student, and honestly, the job market has been stressing me out. Between tech layoffs, market saturation, and the rapid rise of AI, it’s hard not to feel anxious about the future of this field.\n\nLuckily, I’m still a freshman, so if shifting to another degree would truly offer better job security and a more stable income, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I genuinely love tech. I can see myself studying and working in this field long-term because of how vast and interesting it is. But we also can’t deny reality: the industry feels oversaturated, entry-level roles are extremely competitive, and the barrier to entry is relatively low. Anyone who self-studies can technically enter the field (even if they don’t have the same depth as someone who studied CS formally), and that definitely affects competition.\n\n\nSo my question is this:\nIf you were in college right now, still studying CS and not yet graduated, would you consider shifting to a traditional engineering degree instead?\n\nI’m talking about fields like:\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nElectronics Engineering\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nCivil Engineering\n\nDo these degrees actually offer better long-term job security compared to CS today? Or is the grass just greener on the other side?\n\nPS: I know some people will say, “If you’re doubting CS, then it’s not for you,” or that those who truly grind will succeed—or that this is just a way to reduce competition. That’s not my intent. I’m just trying to be realistic and pragmatic.

In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers.

In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often? Why do so many people, especially those trying to break into tech, stick to LeetCode, personal projects, and the job application grind instead of collaborating to build products that solve real problems and potentially create their own jobs?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAs someone trying to break into tech, I don’t understand why more people keep grinding interviews instead of teaming up to build software that solves real problems in non-tech industries and potentially creates their own jobs?",

As you might guess, this has its pros and cons. We do not have well-defined responsibilities at the job, so in this 1-year experience, I could work with every part of a software like CICD, BE, FE, AI, etc.\n\nBUT\n\nThis gives me a feeling of \"knowing a little bit of everything but not mastering anything\", so I decided to start with something with the new year. I enjoy the tasks that I would classify as CICD/DevOps the most. I really enjoy working with k8s, so I primarily have this in my mind to master, but I am not sure if it is the right thing since my experience/title is not mainly DevOps, and in the company, there is not much space to apply those skills on a scale I can write it to my CV, it is basically a couple of microservices. When I checked the jobs I am really interested in, I found that they mostly prefer Go. I have Go in mind too, but again, I have the same concern: I am not sure if a skill that I do not use at my job can help me get my next job.\n\nAbout Me:\n\n1 YOE, leetcoding daily (around 300 problems), not actively looking to change jobs, but want to stay interview-ready, and I will try my luck with big tech in 2026.

        "content": "I came across a detailed guide shared by people who have cleared ML Engineer interviews at different companies and found it helpful to share. The process varies by company, but the core skills are consistent across big tech and startups.\n\nAbout the ML Engineer Interview Process:\n\nML Engineer interviews typically include 4 to 6 rounds a virtual screen which has coding + ML basics, followed by onsite or virtual loops with coding. Expect 45 to 60 min sessions, often with live coding in a shared doc or whiteboard for design. Companies like Meta and Google emphasize productionizing models, while others focus on specific domains.\n\nPREPARATION:\n\n● Python is the main language that I use for programming.\n\n● Additionally, I am very good at the most common Machine Learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit learn, TensorFlow etc.\n\n● The basic machine learning concepts are that I know supervised and unsupervised learning methods.\n\n● I can evaluate models using several metrics.\n\n● I understand overfitting versus underfitting and the relationship between bias and variance.\n\n● I also understand the differences between regression and classification models.\n\n\n\nMy preparation was based on these courses:\n\n1.) Coursera AI of Everyone/ Deeplearning AI: Machine Learning Engineering for Production by Andrew Ng Concentrates on turning ML systems into real world applications, covering data pipelines, deployment, monitoring, and scaling necessary for ML Engineer positions, putting an emphasis on the real-world systems.\n\n2.) Fast ai: Practical Deep Learning A Hands on, code first method to building state of the art models quickly, very good for gaining practical intuition and confidence in implementing deep learning solutions from scratch.\n\n3.) Stanford CS229/CS230: Gives rigorous, university level depth in machine learning theory and deep learning that is excellent for the understanding of derivations and advanced topics that may come up in technical discussions.\n\n4.) LogicMojo AI & ML Interview Preparation Course: Focused specifically on machine learning interview preparation, with practice problems, ML system design patterns, and commonly asked interview questions. It helps for project development for interviews.\n\n\n\nMOVING ONTO THE PRACTICE AFTER THEORY:\n\nPractice coding without an IDE use Google Docs or plain editor to simulate interviews. Focus on implementing ML algorithms from scratch or debugging production issues.\n\nGreat platforms for practice:\n\n● LeetCode - ML tagged + general coding\n\n● Kaggle competitions for end to end projects\n\n● [Interviewing.io](http://Interviewing.io) or Pramp for mocks\n\n\n\nFAQs Asked:\n\n1. Basic machine learning\n2. Model evaluation & metrics\n3. Feature engineering & selection\n4. Recommendation systems.\n5. Convolutional neural networks for vision, normal language transformation transformers for NLP.\n6. Scaling ML distributed training, data parallelism\n7. Production issues\n8. ML system design\n9. Coding: Implement linear regression, k-means, decision trees from scratch; PyTorch or TF basics\n\nThis GitHub repo on Machine Learning Interviews is a solid checklist covering fundamentals to production topics.\n\n\n\nDURING THE INTERVIEW ASK YOURSELF:\n\n1. Do you feel confident explaining ML concepts clearly?\n2. Can you clarify problem requirements and ask good questions?\n3. Are you capable of delineating the whole Machine Learning system by talking about data, features, models, evaluation, deployment, and trade-offs?\n4. Is your code neat, effective, and without any error?\n5. Have you thought about real world constraints?\n6. Can you draw from past projects and experiences effectively?\n\nAll the best! ML roles are in high demand and consistent practice on projects, mocks, and designs will get you there. If you are targeting specific companies, tailor to their products. Good luck",

        "content": "Hi\n\nI am fast approaching 5 years of android development, and i am still relatively young at 24 since i started working early (while in university in eastern europe)\n\nI like android development but its gotten so easy and effortless for me and it kind of makes me feel stuck because currently i work in a big corporation and I’ve gotten bored of how easy the job is and its making me worry about the future, to be clear I’ve worked a lot , on a lot of repos and on multiple platforms and projects\n\nBut Im not sure if i want to be an android developer forever, i don’t get excited to learn new things in Android, I’ve developed a couple of apps on my own, one in react native and one in Android, but i think that nowadays you need to learn to build fullstack more than ever, being on mobile just seems like being a super small part of the project and i would like to be more ambitious and be more important\n\nSo i am conflicted if i should stay the course on mobile development (which is okay for me and safe for now) or start pursuing fullstack jobs and/or developing my own full stack applications (asking because this would take a significant amount of time which im not sure where to invest)\n\nWhat do you think?\nThanks in advance",

Especially for the stack I have experience with (Node.js), everything in Houston seems to be .NET. From what I'm seeing on linkedIn, there are like 3x the job postings in Austin as Houston despite having a way smaller population and more jobs that have the tech stack I am familiar with.\n\nThe only offers I seem to be able to get right now in Houston are typically remote jobs with some sort of significant catch like early-stage startups, or something weird like a company owned by private equity with really bad glass door reviews. Not really looking for that at the moment as I need a bit more stability... and health insurance. \n\nI know Austin has been going downhill for the past couple years and lots of jobs are leaving the city, but I'm not sure if it's gotten as bad as Houston yet. I also don't want to move to another city and if it's going downhill, end up somehow being worse than Houston 5 years from now. Thoughts? ",

Also higher pay wouldn’t hurt. \nAnd how best to go about doing this, for example i know that if going down the cybersecurity route I can get some certs such as sec+ or something to improve my chances at getting a job as well as having a deeper knowledge in that area. \n\nIf you guys have any advice or dos or don’ts for when working towards any of these careers in your personal time, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nP.S.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nI’m looking for some perspective and advice from people who have been in similar situations.\n\n\nI joined a small startup about three months ago as a *full-stack developer*, although in practice I’m doing almost entirely front-end work. The company has been around for about 7 years, ~20 people total, and only 3 developers:\n\n\n* One backend developer\n* One senior developer who is currently transitioning into a Customer Success role\n* And me\n\n\nBefore this job, I did a bootcamp and a lot of self-study, but I’m very aware that I’m still junior. I’m learning every day, but there’s a big gap between where I am technically and the level of responsibility and trust they’re giving me.\n\n\nThat said, the company has been incredibly supportive so far:\n\n\n* I asked for Frontend Masters access and they approved it\n* I asked to understand more about the business beyond pure frontend, and they gave me a project building JavaScript automations in Airtable, touching operations, product, inventory, etc.\n* I asked for regular time with the senior dev to review things together, and that was also approved\n\n\nFrom a support and trust point of view, I honestly couldn’t ask for more.\n\n\nThe company is very product-focused and mainly B2B. They sell hardware and services to other businesses, but they also have a SaaS product. Around 80% of customers actively use it and pay for it, yet there’s no clear long-term SaaS strategy or roadmap. It feels more like “it exists and works” than “this is a core growth engine.”\n\n\nHere’s where my internal conflict starts:\n\n\n* On one hand, I know I’m still junior and should probably focus on fundamentals, shipping solid frontend work, and not overthinking things.\n* On the other hand, I see a real opportunity here to grow the SaaS side of the business, help shape a more structured software team, and eventually take on more responsibility if things go well.\n* I’m interested in full-stack and system complexity, not just UI work, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself or become “the guy with ideas but weak execution.”\n\n\nSo my questions are mainly:\n\n\n* Is this a good environment for a junior dev to grow, or is the lack of senior technical leadership risky?\n* How would you balance learning deeply vs stepping up when the company clearly gives you room?\n* Should I focus narrowly on becoming a very solid frontend engineer first, or is it reasonable to also invest energy in understanding the business and SaaS side early on?\n* Any red flags or opportunities you see from the outside?\n\n\nI’m genuinely grateful for the chance I’ve been given, but I want to be intentional about how I grow and avoid making preventable mistakes.\n\n\nThanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read or respond.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m going to college next year and have been having multiple changes of heart regarding my future career prospects and my major. For context, I learned how to program when I was 8, and now I would consider myself a pretty well-accomplished programmer with many great projects to boast. I’m excellent at Rust, C++, C, and JavaScript, and proficient with Java, Python, and other C-like languages. Since ages 8–15 I built multiplayer games, full-stack websites, physics engines, and ECS frameworks, with some projects having thousands of GitHub stars.\n\nBy 15, I discovered I really liked systems programming and learned theoretical CS topics like OS theory, compiler theory, networking, and embedded programming through open courseware. At 16, I made a dynamic memory allocator that rivals the speed of tcmalloc and jemalloc using a decentralized approach with journals, embedded metadata, and slabs. At 17, I built an ahead-of-time compiler for a Rust-like language with a complete frontend, a robust type checker handling traits and generics, a MIR system with monomorphization, and an LLVM backend generating cross-platform IR.\n\nVery recently, I’ve had an intense desire to learn math. I’ve already studied Calc 1–3, linear algebra (Axler is great btw), real analysis (baby rudin, abbott, fitzpatrick), abstract algebra (d&f, aluffi), and category theory, and this interest sharpened after reading Ahlfors' Complex Analysis starting in September, to the point that I'm now seriously considering majoring in it.\n\nMy mind has been flipping between studying math, CS, double majoring, or minoring in one. Given my extensive programming experience and familiarity with upper-level CS, I feel I’d rather spend college learning something I’m less proficient in (math). Double majoring in Math&CS might make it difficult to take all the math courses I want due to CS requirements, and I dislike entry CS courses like DSA that I likely can’t test out of.\n\nI don’t currently have job prospects (they keep changing), but I want to keep SWE jobs as an option after graduation, and I will 100% continue programming and building projects throughout college. If it helps in your consideration, I've been admitted to MIT and will likely commit there, and I might pursue a PhD afterward. My main question is whether majoring in math without a CS major/minor would be bad for SWE jobs given my experience and projects.\n\nEdit: I'll be majoring in pure math, not applied math that's nonsense.",

I'd like try o figure out ways to deal with these / overcome rather than give up / leave, for now.\n\nI myself am a senior, experienced engineer, we both have decades of experience, relatively successful careers.\n\nThe challenge with working with him, though, is that its like \\_he\\_ has a difficult time working autonomously. \n\nAs examples... he'll write a library for some good in principle idea of his, generally with an ambitious and elaborate implementation, a few ok unit tests, etc... then ask me to integrate some applications with that library. Fair enough. After I do that, he'll look at the integrated application+library combo, say it's not working as expected... and that its basically my job to diagnose/troubleshoot the whole combination. If I ask, well, has this library functionality been tested, has it \\_ever worked\\_, generally the answer is no. Now, sure, it is \\_possible\\_ for me to take over and figure out what's wrong with his library, but it's kind of inefficient, since its all fresh in his head, and I'm coming at it from it uninitiated, so maybe it's a few days work just to figure out how it's \\_supposed\\_ to work., etc.\n\nOther examples are, there are tasks assigned to me, I do them, send a PR, he approves the PR, I put the PR in a weekly status update, the ticket gets updated and closed... then a few weeks later, he'll be like \"what happened with ticket 1234? did that get ever get done? was it lost, i don't see it when running the app\". I do some basic looking around... turns out the app has been rolled back to an older version by someone else in the team. It's frustrating, though, because that would be pretty trivial for him to look into via either email, the ticket system, looking at the app version, asking other people in the team, etc etc... but he chats straight to me like drop everything, work got lost, etc.. which can be disruptive.\n\nOverall, I feel like, if I had junior-ish developer reporting to me that started out like this, that would be ok, but I'd be focusing strongly on getting them up to speed, self-sufficient, and past this stage over the first year or two, and if they didn't, I'd consider that to be a problem. Along the way, I'd be asking questions like \"What have you tried so far to diagnose this?\", \"Do you have everything you need to solve this kind of issue yourself in future, etc.\".\n\nOverall, it just feels like he is intelligent, but also kind of \"needy\", lacking in attention to detail, and ultimately that's going to stop us both from being able to do our best work, but it's kind of difficult dealing with this as the report rather than the manager in this situation. Ideas welcome!\n\n",

The positives are pretty good pay (esp for the area), stupid secure job security, and most the people who work there are alright\n\nI don’t really care what I do for work, nor do I care about money, all I really care about is living close to my friends and family (location is a tech hub). Do you think that it’s reasonable to assume that I can find another job in one/two years or should I get comfortable and consider going back to school?",

        "content": "  \nI have struggled figuring out how to manage this since high school.\n\nBecause the software engineering industry was changing so fast, I wanted a full understanding of the fundamentals of program design and computer science.\n\nI had done clone-tutorials and courses to learn how to build projects that came to mind such as 2d game engines in SDL2 or an app clone, but I would always forget the code I learnt because I was \"studying\" a bunch of programming libraries and the program design of the tutorial by trying to copy line by line, after I see the working project I try to google each part of the code in the documentation, get lost googling more concepts without understanding the big picture, then I had to go back to my schoolwork and would forget everything I \"learnt\". It was as though there was a big valley between:\n\n (intro to/ intermediate /advanced xyz programming language + intro to object oriented programming course structure  then getting into a specific software programming discipline such as \"intro to app development\" and being overwhelmed with the sheer amount of libraries and how exactly these tools are designed in order to implement anything. I had no idea how to reach the point to even just read the documentation and code from scratch without having to read half of the entire class  attributes while still confused.)\n\n  \nI felt insecure about this learning style and decided I would focus more on trying to study mathematics and computer science topics before college, an effort that just amounted to doing a bunch of practice problems and khan academy constantly as per my math teachers instruction.\n\nI wanted to be able to design programs and dissect pre-existing designs, to be able to understand research on algorithms if not to design my own, to explore future applications of CS research or at least to be a software engineer that could make something without relying on a tutorial with code to copy. \n\n  \nIn college I had to split my focus between biology, chemistry, anatomy, anthropology, discrete math, calculus, linear algebra, bioanthropology.. as you can see, a lot of topics required by my CS degree before I could even think about programming, yet pre-existing programming knowledge was expected and  in our CS classes our assignments would consist of fairly complicated 'real world projects' to implement the concepts we were learning but we never talked about any code in class. Most professors were laissez faire in defining how students should learn to program. \"Just code\" which made it hard to see why I was doing so poorly compared to other students.\n\nMy cohort consisted of:\n\n people who had parents who were in STEM/programmers  or very STEM oriented schools so they had learnt programming & CS a structured environment for so long they couldn't really define their curriculum beyond \"I just learnt it\" compared to me who just struggled on youtube & stackoverflow without any help.\n\npeople who were using GPT  & friends for all assignments and somehow getting away with it, but I didn't want to risk it and I had no friends either way. \n\n  \nPeople who seemed to make \"just  think of things you'd like to make, watch tutorials and ask questions\" work, but I still don't understand the specifics of how they learnt to dissect program design from tutorials without flailing around in the documentation taking notes on a dozen functions and variables that still don't tie together conceptually,  especially while dealing with schoolwork at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs professionals, how are students supposed to manage learning software engineering and computer science + other coursework independently?\n\n",

        "content": "I’m currently a PM in my first tech job post-grad and have been at the company for about 6 months. My long-term goal is to move into engineering.\n\nI’ve been pretty upfront about this internally and have reached out to engineers to learn and help where I can. I’m now doing some actual engineering work and the feedback has been good people have told me I have strong technical skills.\n\nThe issue is there’s been no title change, no formal transition, and no real timeline. Another opportunity came up to work even closer with engineering, but again, no official role change. While I appreciate the trust and recognition, it’s starting to feel like I’m adding engineering value without actually being moved into an engineering role.\n\nFor those who’ve been here before:\n\n\t•\tIs this just how internal transitions usually go?\n\n\t•\tWhen do you stop “being patient” and start protecting yourself?\n\n\t•\tShould I keep taking the risk internally or start looking elsewhere for an actual engineering role?\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from people who’ve made a similar move or seen this play out.\n\nTL;DR: PM 6 months into first tech job, trying to move into engineering. Doing engineering work with good feedback but no title change or clear path. Not sure if I should keep waiting internally or look elsewhere.",
