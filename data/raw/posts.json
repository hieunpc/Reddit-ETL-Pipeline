        "author": "Dense_Car_591",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI made a post a while back agonizing whether or not to take a 175k DE II offer at an allegedly toxic company. \n\nWanted to say thank you to everyone in this community for all the helpful advice, comments, and DMs. I ended up rejecting the 175k offer and opted to complete the final round with the second company mentioned in the previous post. \n\nWell, I just got the verbal offer! Culture and WLB is reportedly very strong but the biggest factor was that everyone I talked to from peers to potential manager all seemed like people I could enjoy working with 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. \n\nOffer Breakdown: fully remote, 145k base, 10% bonus, 14k stock over 4 years\n \nFirst year TC: 165.1k due to stock vesting structure \n\nTo try to pay forward all the help from this sub, I wanted to share all the things that worked for me during this job hunt. \n\n1. Targeting DE roles that had near 100% tech stack alignment. So for me: Python, SQL, AWS, Airflow, Databricks, Terraform. Nowadays, both recruiters and HMs seem to really try to find candidates with experience in most, if not all tools they use, especially when comparing to my previous job hunts. Drawback is smaller application shotgun blast radius into the void, esp if you are cold applying like I did. \n\n2. Leetcode, unfortunately. I practiced medium-hard questions for SQL and did light prep for DSA (using Python). List, string, dict, stack and queue, 2-pointer easy-medium was enough to get by for the companies I interviewed at but ymmv. Setting a timer and verbalizing my thought process helped for the real thing. \n\n3. Rereading Kimball’s Data Warehouse Toolkit. I read thru the first 4 chapters then cherry picked a few later chapters for scenario based data modeling topics. Once I finished reading and taking notes, I went to ChatGPT and asked it to simulate acting as an interviewer for a data modeling round. This helped me bounce ideas back and forth, especially for domains I had zero familiarity in. \n\n4. Behavioral Prep. Each quarter at my job, I keep a note of all the projects of value I either led or completed and with details like design, stakeholders involved, stats whether it is cost saved or dataset % adoption within org etc, and business results. This helped me organize 5-6 stories that I would use to answer any behavioral question that came my way without too much hesitation or stuttering. For interviewers who dug deeply into the engineering aspect, reviewing topology diagrams and the codebase helped a lot for that aspect. \n\n5. Last but not least, showing excitement over the role and company. I am not too keen on sucking up to strangers or act like a certain product got me geeking but I think it helps when you can show reasons why the role/company/product has some kind of professional or personal connection to you. \n\nThat’s all I could think of. Shoutout again to all the nice people on this sub for the helpful comments and DMs from earlier!\n\n",

        "content": "Just a Friday rant…I’ve worked on a bunch of data platforms over the years, and lately it’s getting harder to stay motivated and just do the job. When Fabric first showed up at my company, I was pumped. It looked cool and felt like it might clean up a lot of the junk I was dealing with. Now it just feels like it’s being shoved into everything, even when it shouldn’t fit, or can’t fit.\n\nAll the public articles and blogs I see talk about it like it’s already this solid, all-in-one thing, but using it feels nothing like that. I get random errors out of nowhere, and stuff breaks for reasons nobody can explain. It makes me waste hours to debug just to see if I ran into a new bug, an old bug, or “that’s just how it is.” It’s exhausting me, and leadership thinks my team is just incompetent because we can’t get it working reliably (Side note: if your team is hiring, I'm looking to jump).\n\nBut what’s been getting to me is how the conversation online has shifted. More Fabric folks and partner types jump into threads on Reddit acting like none of these problems are a big deal. Everything seems to be brushed off as “coming soon” or “it’s still new,” even though it’s been around for two years and half the features have GA labels slapped on them. It often feels like we get lectured for expecting basic things to work.\n\nI don’t mind a platform having some rough edges. Butt I *do* mind being pushed into something that still doesn’t feel ready, especially by sales teams talking like it’s already perfect, especially when we all know that the product keeps missing simple stuff you need to run something in production. I get that there’s a quota, but I promise I/my company would spend more if there was practical and realistic guidance and not just feel cornered into whatever product uplift they get on broken feature.\n\nAnd since Ignite, the whole AI angle just makes it messier. I keep asking how we’re supposed to do GenAI inside Fabric, there are lots of, “go look at Azure AI Foundry” or “go look at Azure AI Studio.” Or now this IQ stuff that’s like 3 different products, all called IQ. It feels like both everything and nothing at all are in Fabric? It just feels like a weird split between Data and AI at Microsoft, like they’re shipping whatever their org chart looks like instead of a real platform.\n\nHonestly, I get why people like Joe Reis lose it online about this stuff. At some point I just want a straight conversation about what actually works and what doesn’t, and how I can do my job well, instead of just getting into petty arguments",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nI need some advice on a big career shift that just landed on me.\n\nI’ve been working at the same company for almost 20 years. Started here at 20, small town, small company, great culture. I’m a traditional data-warehousing person — SQL, ETL, Informatica, DataStage, ODI, PL/SQL, that whole world. My role is Senior Data Engineer, but I talk directly to the CIO because it’s that kind of company. They trust me, I know everyone, and the work-life balance has always been great (never more than 8 hours a day).\n\nRecently we acquired another company whose entire data stack is modern cloud: Snowflake, AWS, Git, CI/CD, onboarding systems to the cloud, etc.\n\nWhile I was having lunch, the CIO came to me and basically said:\n“You’re leading the new cloud data engineering area. Snowflake, AWS, CI/CD. We trust you. You’ll do great. Here’s a 100% salary increase.”\nNo negotiation. Just: This is yours now.\n\nHe promised the workload won’t be crazy — maybe a few 9–10 hour days in the first six months, then stable again. And he genuinely believes I’m the best person to take this forward.\n\nI’m excited but also aware that the tech jump is huge. I want to prepare properly, and the CIO can’t really help with technical questions right now because it’s all new to him too.\n\nMy plan so far:\n\nLearn Snowflake deeply (warehousing concepts + Snowflake specifics)\n\nThen study for AWS certifications — maybe Developer Associate or Solutions Architect Associate, so I have a structure to learn. Not necessarily do the certs.\n\nLearn modern practices: Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, etc.)\n\n\nMy question:\n\nIs this the right approach?\nIf you were in my shoes, how would you prepare for leading a modern cloud data engineering function?\n\nAny advice from people who moved from traditional ETL into cloud data engineering would be appreciated.",

Found duplicates constantly, maybe we configured wrong but after 3 weeks of trying we gave up. Said screw it and rebuilt everything simpler.\n\nDitched kafka entirely, we went with nats for messaging, services pull at own pace so no backpressure disasters. Custom go services instead of spark because spark was 90% overhead for what we needed and cut airflow for most things, use scheduled messages. Some results after 4 months: latency 3-4 hours to 45 minutes, zero lost messages, infrastructure costs down 40%.\n\nI know kafka has its place.

I already know basic to intermediate SQL (used it for my own work), I know basic programming.\n\nI’d love a reality check on two things: \n\nFirst, is data engineering actually a \"safer\" environment for someone who wants to code but is anxious about the \"people\" side?\n\nSecond, given my age and background, does it make sense to move in this direction in this economy?\n\nThanks for the help",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am a 36-year-old accountant working in the UAE passionate about data and automation. I have been with a financial services company for more than 10 years. Over the years, my work has evolved: I started in front-office operations, then moved into complex reconciliations, later handled end-to-end accounting (A to Z) for a sister company, and eventually returned to financial services.\n\nMy role has never been clearly defined. I am usually brought in to solve problems. I have access to an Oracle database now and I know basic SQL (not advanced). I also have strong Excel and VBA skills. I’ve regularly used these skills to solve operational problems, build logic, help write scripts, and set rules in vendor-provided tools to automate reconciliations. I also helped create Excel templates for reporting.\n\nI completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, along with SQL courses and basic Python, although I can’t recall everything well now. I’ve done some reconciliation work in BigQuery using SQL (often with ChatGPT support), but in my actual day-to-day job I mostly use standard queries like SELECT, GROUP BY, WHERE, and HAVING—nothing very advanced.\n\nMy dilemma is this: my company has huge backlogs, but the core problems are not about writing the right query or automating something. The real issues are poor initial setups, incorrect postings, bad historical decisions, and choosing the wrong cheap vendors to cut the cost. We’re trying to “clean the garage,” but the garage is fundamentally broken—missing data, open loops, and structural issues that can’t realistically be fixed.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that old staff are defensive. They won’t allow corrections that might expose their past mistakes because it affects their reputation. The expectation is: you’re here to fix things, but without the authority or data needed to actually fix them.\n\nBecause I commute around 5 hours a day, I arrive at work already exhausted. I struggle to learn new skills consistently. This has left me stressed, stagnant, and feeling useless—trying to clean deeply broken systems alone, with no real progress in either my career or my technical growth.\n\nSo I am stuck between these options:\n\n1) Stay with the company, learn very slowly, continue firefighting, take blame for issues I didn’t create, remain stressed, and feel that my career and skill set are not progressing.\n\n2) Go back to my home country, focus seriously on learning (properly and deeply), work on real projects, join something structured like Zoomcamp or another bootcamp, and try to move into freelance or remote work. I see people around me leveraging new tools, AI, automation, and platforms like n8n—while I feel stuck in a toxic environment with almost no time or energy to grow. My fear here is losing time and professional reputation.\n\n3)  Any other option I’m not seeing?",

On the other hand, this direction is slightly easier and little more interesting to me and maybe business communication skills will be more valuable in the future than technical skills.\n\n\n\nThe Data Engineer path, however, is more technically demanding, but the long-term benefits seem much greater - better pay, more opportunities, lower risk of being replaced by AI and more technical skill development.\n\n\n\nPlease don’t reply with “just do what you like,” because I’ve spent several years in a dead-end job and at the end of the day, work is work.\n\n\n\nI’m just a junior with only a few days of experience who already has to make an important decision, so I'm sorry if these questions are stupid.",

Is it safe*** **?\"**. Lineage alone often isn't enough to quickly assess the risk especially in large projects.  \n  \nThat's why I've extended my tool to be more **\"impact analysis\"** oriented. It uses the column lineage to generate a high-level, actionable view that clearly defines how and where the selected column is utilized in downstream assets, **without the need for navigating in the whole lineage graph** (which can be painful / error prone), it shows :\n\n* **Derived Transformations:** Columns that are transformed based on the selected column. These usually require a more extended review compared to a direct reference, and this is where the tool helps you quickly spot them (with the code of the transfo).\n* **Simple Projections:** Columns that are a direct, untransformed reference of the selected column.\n\n**Github Repo:** `Fszta/dbt-column-lineage`  \n**Demo version:** I deployed a live test version -> You can find the link in the repository.\n\nI've currently only tested this with Snowflake, DuckDB, and MSSQL. If you use a different adapter (like BigQuery or pg) and run into any unexpected behavior, don't hesitate to create an issue.\n\nLet me know what you think / if you have any ideas for further improvements",

Though, I can see the value where after repartitioning we cache the data and use it in more joins ( in seperate action), as Spark native engine wouldn't cache or persist repartitioning, is this right assumption?\n\nSo, I am trying to understand in which scenarios doing repartitioning would beat Sparks catalyst native repartitioning?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Been doing data engineering for a while now and wanted to share some thoughts on a pattern I've been seeing more of.\n\n**TL;DR:** Instead of trying to consolidate all your data into one platform (which never actually works), there's a growing movement to federate metadata instead. The \"metadata lake\" concept. After being skeptical, I'm starting to think this is the right approach for most orgs.\n\n## The pattern that keeps repeating\n\nEvery company I've worked at has gone through the same cycle:\n\n1. Start with one data platform (Hadoop, Snowflake, Databricks, whatever)\n2. A different team needs something the main platform doesn't do well\n3. They spin up their own thing (separate warehouse, different catalog, etc.)\n4. Now you have two data platforms\n5. Leadership says \"we need to consolidate\"\n6. Migration project starts, takes forever, never finishes\n7. Meanwhile a third platform gets added for ML or streaming\n8. Repeat\n\nSound familiar? I've seen this at three different companies now. The consolidation never actually happens because:\n- Migrations are expensive and risky\n- Different tools really are better for different workloads\n- Teams have opinions and organizational capital to protect their choices\n- By the time you finish migrating, something new has come along\n\n## The alternative: federate the metadata\n\nI've been reading about and experimenting with the \"metadata lake\" approach. The idea is:\n\n- Accept that you'll have multiple data platforms\n- Don't try to move the data\n- Instead, create a unified layer that federates the metadata\n- Apply governance and discovery at that layer\n\nThe key insight is that data is expensive to move but metadata is cheap. You can't easily migrate petabytes of data from Snowflake to Databricks, but you can absolutely sync the schema information, ownership, lineage, and access policies.\n\n## Tools in this space\n\nThe main open source option I've found is Apache Gravitino (https://github.com/apache/gravitino). It's an Apache TLP that does catalog federation. You point it at your existing catalogs (Hive, Iceberg, Kafka schema registry, JDBC sources) and it presents them through unified APIs.\n\nWhat I like about it:\n\n- Doesn't require migration, works with what you have\n- Supports both tabular and non-tabular data (filesets, message topics)\n- Governance policies apply across all federated catalogs\n- Vendor neutral, Apache licensed\n- The team behind it has serious credentials (Apache Spark, Hadoop committers)\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/apache/gravitino (2.3k stars)\n\nThere's also a good article explaining the philosophy: https://medium.com/datastrato/if-youre-not-all-in-on-databricks-why-metadata-freedom-matters-35cc5b15b24e\n\n## My POC experience\n\nRan a quick POC federating our Hive metastore, an Iceberg catalog, and Kafka schema registry. Took about 3 hours to set up. The unified view is genuinely useful. I can see tables, topics, and schemas all in one place with consistent APIs.\n\nThe cross-catalog queries work but I'd still recommend keeping hot path queries within single systems. The value is more in discovery, governance, and breaking down silos than in making cross-system joins performant.\n\n## When this makes sense\n\n- You have data spread across multiple platforms (most enterprises)\n- Consolidation has failed or isn't realistic\n- You need unified governance but can't force everyone onto one tool\n- You're multi-cloud and want to avoid vendor lock-in\n- You have both batch and streaming data that need to be discoverable\n\n## When it might not\n\n- You're a startup that can actually standardize on one platform\n- Your data volumes are small enough that migration is feasible\n- You don't have governance or discovery problems yet\n\n## Questions for the community\n\n1. Has anyone else moved toward this federated metadata approach? What's your experience?\n\n2. Are there other tools in this space I should be looking at? I know DataHub and Atlan exist but they feel more like discovery tools than unified metadata layers.\n\n3. For those who successfully consolidated onto one platform, how did you actually do it? Genuinely curious if there's a playbook I'm missing.",

        "author": "marco_nae",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Built an ADBC driver for Exasol in Rust with Apache Arrow support**\n\nI've been learning Rust for a while now, and after building a few CLI tools, I wanted to tackle something meatier. So I built `exarrow-rs` \\- an ADBC-compatible database driver for Exasol that uses Apache Arrow's columnar format.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nIt's essentially a bridge between Exasol databases and the Arrow ecosystem. Instead of row-by-row data transfer (which is slow for analytical queries), it uses Arrow's columnar format to move data efficiently. The driver implements the ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity) standard, which is like ODBC/JDBC but designed around Arrow from the ground up.\n\n**The interesting bits:**\n\n* Built entirely async on Tokio - the driver communicates with Exasol over WebSockets (using their native WebSocket API)\n* Type-safe parameter binding using Rust's type system\n* Comprehensive type mapping between Exasol's SQL types and Arrow types (including fun edge cases like `DECIMAL(p)` → `Decimal256`)\n* C FFI layer so it works with the ADBC driver manager, meaning you can load it dynamically from other languages\n\n**Caveat:**\n\nIt uses the latest WebSockets API of Exasol since Exasol does not support Arrow natively, yet. So currently, it is converting Json responses into Arrow batches. See [exasol/websocket-api](https://github.com/exasol/websocket-api) for more details on Exasol WebSockets.\n\n**The learning experience:**\n\nThe hardest part was honestly getting the async WebSocket communication right while maintaining ADBC's synchronous-looking API. Also, Arrow's type system is... extensive. Mapping SQL types to Arrow types taught me a lot about both ecosystems.\n\n**What is Exasol?**\n\nExasol Analytics Engine is a high-performance, in-memory engine designed for near real-time analytics, data warehousing, and AI/ML workloads.\n\nExasol is obviously an enterprise product, BUT it has a free Docker version which is pretty fast. And they offer a free personal edition for deployment in the Cloud in case you hit the limits of your laptop.\n\n**The project**\n\nIt's MIT licensed and community-maintained. It is not officially maintained by Exasol! \n\nWould love feedback, especially from folks who've worked with Arrow or built database drivers before.\n\nWhat gotchas should I watch out for? Any ADBC quirks I should know about?\n\nAlso happy to answer questions about Rust async patterns, Arrow integration, or Exasol in general!",

        "author": "Jaded_Bar_9951",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm 26 and I just graduated in Data Science. Two months ago I started working in a small but growing company as a mix Data Engineer/Data Scientist. Basically, now I'm making order in their data, writing different pipelines to do stuff (I know it's super generic, but it's not the point of the post). To schedule the pipelines, I decided to use Airflow. I'm not a pro, but I'm trying to read stuff and watch as many videos as I can about best practices and so on to do things well. \n\nThe thing is that my company outsourced the management of the IT infrastructure to another and even smaller company, which made sense in the past because my company was small and they didn't need the control, nor did they have IT figures in the company. Now things are changing, and they have started to build a small IT department to do different stuff. To install Airflow on our servers, I had to pass through this company, which I mean, I understand and it was ok. The IT company knew nothing about Airflow, it was the first time for them and they needed a looooot of time to read everything they could and install it \"safely\". The problem is that now they don't let me do the most basic stuff without passing through them, like make a little change in the config file (lfor example, adding the SMTP server for the emails) or install python packages, not even restart Airflow. Every time I need to open a ticket and wait, wait, wait.  It happened in the past that airflow had some problems and I had to tell them how to fix them, because they didn't let me do it. I asked many times the permission to do these basic operations, and they told me that they don't want to allow me to do it because they have the responsibility of the correct functioning of the software, and if I touch it they cant guarantee it. I told them that I know what i'm doing, and there is no risk at all. Furthermore, most of the things that I do are BI stuff, so it's just querying operational databases and make some transformations on the data, the worst thing that can happen is that one day I don't deliver a dataset or a dashboard because airflow blocks, but nothing worse can happen. This situation is very frustrating for me because I feel stuck many times, and it annoys me a lot to wait for the most basic and stupid operations. A colleague of mine told me that I have a lot to do, and in the meantime I can work on other tasks. It made me even angrier because, ok I have a lot of stuff to do, but why I have to wait for nothing?? It's super inefficent. \n\nMy question is, how does it work in normal/structured companies? who has the responsibility of the configuration/packages/restart of airflow? the data engineers or the \"infrastructure\" team?  \n\n  \nThank you",

I’ve always gravitated toward data, and that curiosity pushed me into big data engineering. I completed a 6-month live course on PySpark along with several others. I’m also completing my degree online to close the non-degree gap.\nMy Tech Stack:\n1. SQL\n2. Python\n3. PySpark\n4. AWS\n5.

I’m comfortable with GitHub.\n\nI don’t rely on ChatGPT for coding, I’m old-school about writing my own solutions. I mainly use LLMs to understand bugs faster than digging through StackOverflow.\n\nEarlier Guidance from others has made me realize I can’t jump directly into a DE role because I lack production-level experience, so the “right” path should be Data Analyst first, then transition.\n\n**The problem:**\nThe DA market is extremely saturated. Every posting gets 10–15K applications, and realistically, I’m not competitive right now on paper. I’ve done the whole drill - no movement. I’ve been jobless for over a year, and I’m desperate at this point.\n\n**My concern/dilemma:**\nGiven that my end goal is DE, should I really stick to the DA/PA → AE → DE route, or should I bypass DA entirely and aim for AE → DE? \n\nIf I do land a DA job, I’ll have to go through another full transition again, whereas AE → DE is almost a direct pipeline.\n\nA lot of this dilemma comes from the fact that I’m not even getting any calls for DA roles because the market is congested and full of scams/fake hiring. If I were getting traction, I would’ve followed the original plan.\n\nBut since I’m getting nowhere, should I aim directly for AE instead? I genuinely like the AE toolset- dbt, Snowflake, data modeling, that’s the direction I want to go.\n\nI’m just unsure whether hiring managers would consider me for an AE role purely based on my projects and skills, given that I don’t yet have production experience. \n\nWhat if I face same issue in AE and be back to square one after spending 3-4 month learning and applying. \n\nShould I just stick to DA/PA and keep applying. \n\nPlease help!",

        "content": "Hey all, I had an idea for a data lake visualization tool but I don't know if this is a pain point that other engineers have as well. When I used to work on a team that built a data lake on top of AWS technologies (S3, DMS, Redshift, Glue, Athena, Lake Formation, etc) I found it a bit hard to visualize the data flow since everything was a bit scattered, though having the architecture diagram helped a little bit. Aside from visualization, the AWS monthly bill was eye watering and it had a bunch of operational issues. Observability was a bit of a pain too since we had to create alarms for each table and each database in Glue. This is just my experience from working on a data lake that was built from scratch.\n\nThis might be a stupid idea but I was thinking about possible ways to make it easier to build data lakes and manage everything in an all-in-one platform, from prototyping to testing to observability. Especially for smaller companies that don't have the luxury of spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars per month in infrastructure costs, they can use smaller machines to setup a data lake and expand it as they go. To start off, the idea is to build a visualization tool where you can use your choice of hosting / tools, for example S3 or your own blob storage, and execute scripts to perform transformations on that data and build a data lake from there. It would include ways to automate observability by automatically setting up alarms as you connect different pieces together.\n\nIs this a pain point that others face as well? Does something like this exist already? And would something like this be worth building?",

Instead, Databricks just vaults my the unity catalog connection owners refresh token and runs **every** consumer query as the owner.  There is no second consumer sign-in and no identity switch in the Snowflake logs. Thats not what we expected..\n\nHas anyone gotten this to work so it actually respects the specific Entra user? Or is this \"U2M\" feature just a shared service account in disguise / extra steps?",

(Seems redundant).\n   * *Option B:* Keep a separate \"Glossary\" index that gets retrieved independently?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi!\n\nSo I am finally getting around to reading the Data Warehouse Toolkit by Ralph Kimball and I'm confused. \n\nI have reached Chapter 4: Inventory, which includes the following ERD for an example on periodic snapshot facts. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tfxpmlj27o4g1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=115f322cd498649895da55f8b01f69e3212b80c1\n\nIn this section, he describes all facts in this table except for 'Quantity on Hand' as fully additive:\n\n>Notice that quantity on hand is semi-additive, but the other measures in the enhanced periodic snapshot are all fully additive. The quantity sold amount has been rolled up to the snapshot’s daily granularity. The valuation columns are extended, additive amounts. In some periodic snapshot inventory schemas, it is useful to store the beginning balance, the inventory change or delta, along with the ending balance. In this scenario, the balances are again semi-additive, whereas the deltas are fully additive across all the dimensions\n\nHowever, this seems incorrect? 'Inventory Dollar Value at Cost' and 'Inventory Value at Latest Selling Price' sound like balances to me, which are not additive across time and therefore they would be semi-additive facts.   \n  \nFor further context here is Kimball's exact wording on the differences:  \n\n\n>The numeric measures in a fact table fall into three categories. The most flexible and useful facts are *fully additive*; additive measures can be summed across any of the dimensions associated with the fact table. *Semi-additive* measures can be summed across some dimensions, but not all; balance amounts are common semi-additive facts because they are additive across all dimensions **except time**.\n\n  \nThe only way this seems to make sense is that these are supposed to be deltas, where the first record in the table has a 'starting value' that reflects the initial balance and then each day the snapshot would capture the change in each of those balances, but that seems like an odd design choice to me, and if so the naming of the columns doesn't do a good job of describing that. Am I missing something or is Kimball contradicting himself here?   \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n",

Sessions spanning multiple days now start to conspire and ruin our pipelines.\n\nA single session can look different depending on the day we process it. Example:\n\n* On Day X, a session might touch marketing channels A and B;\n* After crossing midnight, on Day X+1 it hits channel C;\n* On day X+1 we won’t know the full list of channels touched previously, unless we reach back to day X’s data first.\n\nSame with devices: Day X sees A + B; Day X+1 sees C. Each batch only sees its own slice, so no run has the full picture. Looking back an extra day just shifts the problem, since sessions can always start the day before.\n\nLooking back at prior days feels like a backfill nightmare come true, yet every discussion keeps circling back to the same question: how do you handle sessions that span multiple days?\n\nI feel like I’m missing a clean, practical approach. Any insights or best practices for modeling sessionized data more accurately would be hugely appreciated.",

        "author": "Decent-Goose-5799",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering! A few weeks ago I shared Rigatoni, my CDC framework in Rust. I just published comprehensive benchmarks and the results are interesting!\n\n\n\n  TL;DR Performance:\n\n  \\- \\~780ns per event for core processing (linear scaling up to 10K events)\n\n  \\- \\~1.2μs per event for JSON serialization\n\n  \\- 7.65ms to write 1,000 events to S3 with ZSTD compression\n\n  \\- Production throughput: 10K-100K events/sec\n\n  \\- \\~2ns per event for operation filtering (essentially free)\n\n\n\n  Most Interesting Findings:\n\n\n\n  1. ZSTD wins across the board: 14% faster than GZIP and 33% faster than uncompressed JSON for S3 writes\n\n  2. Batch size is forgiving: Minimal latency differences between 100-2000 event batches (<10% variance)\n\n  3. Concurrency sweet spot: 2 concurrent S3 writes = 99% efficiency, 4 = 61%, 8+ = diminishing returns\n\n  4. Filtering is free: Operation type filtering costs \\~2ns per event - use it liberally!\n\n  5. Deduplication overhead: Only +30% overhead for exactly-once semantics, consistent across batch sizes\n\n\n\n  Benchmark Setup:\n\n  \\- Built with [Criterion.rs](http://Criterion.rs) for statistical analysis\n\n  \\- LocalStack for S3 testing (eliminates network variance)\n\n  \\- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions\n\n  \\- Detailed HTML reports with regression detection\n\n\n\n  The benchmarks helped me identify optimal production configurations:\n\n  Pipeline::builder()\n\n.batch\\_size(500)              // Sweet spot\n\n.batch\\_timeout(50)            // ms\n\n.max\\_concurrent\\_writes(3)     // Optimal S3 concurrency\n\n.build()\n\n\n\n  Architecture:\n\n  Rigatoni is built on Tokio with async/await, supports MongoDB change streams → S3 (JSON/Parquet/Avro), Redis state store for distributed deployments, and Prometheus metrics.\n\n\n\n  What I Tested:\n\n  \\- Batch processing across different sizes (10-10K events)\n\n  \\- Serialization formats (JSON, Parquet, Avro)\n\n  \\- Compression methods (ZSTD, GZIP, none)\n\n  \\- Concurrent S3 writes and throughput scaling\n\n  \\- State management and memory patterns\n\n  \\- Advanced patterns (filtering, deduplication, grouping)\n\n\n\n  📊 Full benchmark report: [https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance](https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance)\n\n  🦀 Source code: [https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni](https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni)\n\nHappy to discuss the methodology, trade-offs, or answer questions about CDC architectures in Rust!\n\nFor those who missed the original post: Rigatoni is a framework for streaming MongoDB change events to S3 with configurable batching, multiple serialization formats, and compression. Single binary, no Kafka required.",

Is it just Software Eng mindset vs. Data Eng mindset?\n\nIn the industry, do you typically wrap the modular code inside the infra tools, or do you stick to the simpler script-based approach for pipelines?\n\n For a junior, is it better to show I can write robust OOP code, or that I can orchestrate containers?\n\nAny insights from those working in the field would be amazing! \n\n\n\nThanks! :rocket:",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI graduated with a CS degree in 2021, but due to some life circumstances and a tough job market, I haven't held a developer position since then. I've decided to stop worrying about the gap and finally get back into the saddle to break my impostor syndrome.\n\nMy goal is to build a portfolio of 2–3 solid projects to prove (to myself and employers) that I can still write code. I’m looking for some feedback and/or suggestions on a learning path.\n\nAs it stands, I have familiarity with the following programming languages and will list my strength/capability with said languages:\n\nPython: 8/10 - I can confidently write most things in Python and I think the only thing that I would need to re-visit are some OOP concepts and other small nuances given that most OOP I did during my undergraduate years were done in Java. I've tinkered with (but could never really finish or grasp) Pythonic frameworks like Flask and Django, and that's as far as I've ever went project-wise with the language. Can say without a doubt it's my strongest language. I have some books like *Fluent Python 2nd Edition, Django 4 By Example 4th Edition,* that I bought a year or so ago; was wondering if they're still relevant or have become outdated. What other books or resources would you recommend?\n\nJava: 5/10 - It's been a *whileeeeeee* since I wrote anything in Java, but a lot of job descriptions I've seen for listings in my area have things like Java Spring and Spring Boot which have roots in the language, therefore piquing my interest to re-visiting Java. The problem? I can hardly remember the syntax let alone know if it's worth re-learning. Is it worth re-visiting Java just for the job market, or should I double down on Python to get \"job ready\" faster? If I do go the Java route, what is the best \"refresher\" resource for someone who already understands the theory but forgot the syntax?\n\nC++: 5/10 - Roughly the same description as above, but will say it was my favorite to play around with and was a bit simpler to understand vs. Java. Was told there was still demand with the language, particularly in Finance and Embedded Systems.\n\n  \n... and other languages that I can say I have \"familiarity\" with, but have hardly done things in: C#, Bash, and JavaScript.\n\nThus, what would you guys recommend I start with topic-wise, anything-wise? Also, I like physical media such as books so I can take notes and physically get involved with the learning. Any recommendations would be much appreciated! Thanks for taking the time to read this post.  \n\n\n\n\n",

I wanted to study a career that I both enjoyed and could get good money from, so I decided to go for Systems Engineering (in a University that focuses on Software Development and ICT).\n\nAt first it was really fun, I learned pseudocode and at the end of the semester I made an over 2000 line program that contained 10 minigames, each one more complex than the other. Everything was fine, until I got to the second semester and started learning basic programming. I found out they focused only on teaching java, and in the future we'll learn other languages like C++ and CSS, and while I stayed on track for most of the time, everything collapsed when we got to OPP and GUIs. Our teacher only taught us the basics, and said we had to learn the rest by ourselves. I couldn't find the time to do it because of homework from other subjects, and even when I did, I forgot everything faster than usual. Then he taught us UML diagrams, and same story, even when I watched a lot of tutorials, I could never understand how to do it properly.\n\nMy grades dropped a lot at this point, we had to construct small business applications that stored data on arraylists. I always got stuck at points where I tried to compile but got errors everywhere, and from that moment on, even if I wanted to learn so hard I just couldn't get myself to do it. Programming now feels overwhelming and boring, even if I get excited when thinking of project ideas, everything starts to feel too big for me at some point, and I drop it.\n\nI'm really nervous because my final exam will be tomorrow and I have no idea how things will turn out for me, and after that I'll be on vacation. I want to improve my coding during that time, but I don't know if I'll have the motivation to do it. Does anyone have any tips for me? How can I recover my motivation again, how can I get myself to learn and actually understand?",

        "content": "I really just wanted to get a CS degree at a local college but my study coach is basically telling me to go screw myself because I have mental health issues and trouble working in groups with strangers. I know this sounds weird but my situation is complicated, if I were to explain it this post would be way too long. I'm getting treatment for it and maybe I'll be able to resume college next academic year. I really wish I could just continue instead of wasting my time bc my coach is underestimating me but I need a decent alternative that doesn't cost me a fortune and maybe helps me get through college faster later on if possible. I just want that degree ASAP really.\n\nI'm mainly interested in learning programming so I can have a career related to it later and can maybe develop an indie game or two in my off time, before I started with college I had basically zero programming experience, now I have a little but it's not enough really. I thought \"I'll just go through college and when I have my degree I'll be all set\"\n\nI learned from boot.dev from a few sponsorships and bought a subscription once but I barely felt like using it bc the opinions on it were mixed and I refunded it. Now there's a pretty good deal for it from Black Friday. I often have trouble with motivating myself to study and getting enjoyment out of it so maybe this helps. Seems like a good fit for an introvert like me I guess? It says you can get hired after 12 or so months of using it but is that actually legit or is it just false advertising? I've also heard mixed opinions about whether the certificates you can get from it, or from anywhere really, are actually useful, or whether employers actually care for them. I know getting a degree is important and I want to get one at some point, this is just an alternative to pass the time until next academic year while I'm getting treatment. I'm not sure if this will actually shorten the time I have to wait before I can get that degree tho.\n\nHas anyone here actually taken courses from boot.dev and what are your opinions on it? Were the certificates actually useful? How long will it take me to go through it if I try to use it as a substitue for college and spend like say 40 hrs a week on it? So is this actually useful enough to me or should I go argue with my study coach?\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to point out that while I do want to make indie games, I know I most likely won't be able to do it for a living so I do want to get a career that's adjacent to something like that and put programming experience and other CS-related things to use. I'm also consdering university instead of college but idk if that'll actually work better for me. So I guess boot.dev isn't a great way to self study?",

My brain works kinda wild, if something doesn’t hook me or challenge me enough, I get bored and jump to something new. But with code it feels different, like I want to dive deeper, but the fear still hits sometimes.\n\nHave any of you ever felt that? The “is this real or just hype?” moment? How did you deal with it? Did that feeling go away with time or experiences? I’d appreciate any stories or advice, fr.\n\nI’m learning everything from zero by myself, building projects, watching talks, reading docs, trying to absorb the real engineering mindset.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\nI posted here before saying that I’m a Software Engineering graduate who feels completely lost, and many people told me to either try getting an internship or start building small projects to figure out if I even enjoy programming. The problem is that during university I mostly studied just to pass exams, not to really learn, so even though I worked with front-end, Java, C++, and a few other things, I honestly forgot most of it because I never practiced. I also feel like there are a lot of basic concepts I should already know but don’t.\n\nAnother thing that’s been holding me back is applying to companies. Most places ask for a CV, and I honestly don’t feel confident putting mine out there. It’s not that the things I list are “wrong”—I really did study them—but I don’t master them and barely remember anything. That makes me hesitate to apply for internships or entry-level positions because I feel like I don’t truly deserve the skills I say I have.\n\nAt the same time, I always felt like things like HTML or even C++ are “easy” and that anyone can learn them, so I’m not sure if I should learn completely different languages like Java or Python, or if I should just stick to one clear track and build from there.\n\nRight now I want to restart properly from zero, but I don’t know where to begin. I see a lot of people recommending The Odin Project—would that be a good starting point? I can study around 4–6 hours a day, but I don’t want to waste time on something too basic or something that won’t help me get anywhere. I’m also not sure whether to focus on front-end, back-end, or try both at the same time. And I’m confused about how people even start building small projects—do you follow certain websites for ideas, or specific courses?\n\nWhat’s also discouraging me is AI. It feels like AI can now build a full website in minutes while a beginner needs days. Is this actually true, or am I overthinking it? Should I look into mobile development instead, or try something that fits the market better?\n\nAny advice or a clear roadmap for restarting would really mean a lot. Thanks 🙏 .",

This is however, a question to those curious minds wanting to understand and learn OpenGL. Or even just want to know how computer graphics works in general. \n\nFirst, some context.\n\nA while ago I undertook the arduous task of learning OpenGL. From all the basics of drawing primitives and up to advanced concepts such as compute shaders and volumetric cloud rendering. The entire process was an immense learning curve and honestly felt like I was relearning how to program. The result is a procedurally generated universe where you can explore endless galaxies and solar systems. However, it is still unfinished and I will continue working on it.\n\nI found that while learning OpenGL you are bombarded with terminology, and it can be quite difficult to take these concepts and develop your own ideas. So, I was thinking of making a series that introduces you into the concepts needed, and develop an intuitive understanding of graphics programming. Then each concept we learn we can apply that to our custom program.\n\nSo my question is, would any of you be interested in this? Would you have any recommendations? Or should I scrap this idea? I already have a 'thumbnail' (not a very well thought out one) that I put together if anyone would like to see it. I will provide a link to a google docs if that is allowed. Once again, it is an unfinished project but I will continue to develop it and add new features as the series continues.\n\nOnce again, sorry if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to.\n\nThank you! :)",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "For context, I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.\n\nLatin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.\n\nFor example, lets take the word \"Servus\", which means (a male) slave. (Dont be scared, its a unfortunately very common word in the roman time period, in which most of the training texts are settled). \n\nIn the nominative case, its just \"Servus\", while the genitive case has \"servi\", the dative has \"servo\" and the accusative case has \"servum\" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations).\n\nBut then there are also the plural forms, which are \"Servi\", \"servorum\",\"servis\" and \"servos\" respectively.\n\nAnd nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.\n\nThis requires me to somehow construct something that can handle a lot of those cases, the question is just, how.\n\nMy first instinct was creating a Noun-Class (Java) and then create a constructor that takes the word stem and the grammatical gender and then write methods that return the fitting suffix based on the context that is called.  \nThis looks then like this:\n\n    public String getNominativeSingular() {\n        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\n        stringBuilder.append(stem);\n        String suffix = \"\";\n        switch (gender){\n            case \n    NEUTRUM \n    -> {\n                suffix = \"um\";\n                break;\n            }\n            case \n    MASCULINUM \n    -> {\n                suffix = \"us\";\n                break;\n            }\n            case \n    FEMININUM \n    -> {\n                suffix = \"a\";\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        stringBuilder.append(suffix);\n        return stringBuilder.toString();\n    }\n\nIn a vacuum this approach is fine, but it feels like this might cause more work than actually necessary in the long run. Imagine this as a big table with multiple dimensions. What i could imagine would be creating a big Array with multiple dimensions that have a size based on the amount of states that the given properties can have. Does this sound like it makes sense or are there some patterns i potentially could utilise?",

So far, the material seems manageable and I feel like I’m understanding the concepts. However, when I open up a real project to look at as an example, it’s completely overwhelming - there are so many files, and I can’t make sense of how everything fits together. This makes me anxious and I start doubting myself, thinking maybe I’m not cut out for this, that it’s too difficult, or that it’s meant for people smarter than me.\nOn top of that, I rely heavily on AI assistance right now, and honestly, I feel like I wouldn’t be able to write much code without it.\nI wanted to reach out and ask: are there any QA professionals here who successfully transitioned to development? If so, could you share some words of encouragement or advice? I’d really appreciate hearing about your experience.\nThanks in advance!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention - my company will actually provide me with a .NET project within the next month or so, and they’re giving me the opportunity to contribute to development work while still being in my QA role.

I had an idea on how to go about it, but while talking with one colleague his words discouraged me from this initial idea.\n\nSo, one of us thinks that I should pick up a project, design it in broad terms, do some research on what technologies make sense for it, then learn them as I work on the project.  \n  \nThe other thinks that I should make a list of topics (design patterns etc) and technologies I would like to learn, find some solid resources, follow them. As I follow the concepts I also do exercises or make up examples to apply the knowledge / tinker with the different info. As knowledge accumulates, I revisit these exercises and see if there are better ways to do those things and why. By the time I have covered a significant amount of the material, I think of a project that would be fitting for the topics and technologies I am studying and work on it.\n\n  \nIn case the answer to my question is \"whatever works for you\", I don't know what works for me.

On the other hand, I do 3 hours for front-end self study and I usually just follow FCC's Curriculum, I dont make any projects out of it, i mean I do, but only 1 or two mini projects, compared to C where I'd make 3 or more mini projects. I just wanna get used to the syntax and theory for the meantime which is why I'm relying heavily on the Fullstack curriculum.\n\nI've come across freecodecamp (currently doing responsive web design certification) and I heard about people saying I should move to TOP when I finish doing the said certification. (it only covers CSS and HTML), but the resource i found makes me unsure since it was 3 years ago and I'm not sure if the FCC new Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum is much better than TOP's javascript path.\n\nTLDR: Which is better as of this date? considering FCC VS TOP's UPDATED curriculums.\n\nHoping for your kindest responses, and would appreciate to hear some good feedback based on your experience, thanks!",

The flexibility and safety of the interface is demonstrated via examples and even a few fully simulated control laws. \n\nThe final code is also distributed as a freely available single-header library. I'm posting in this community because its both informative, and includes exercises you can do to practice working with these concepts. I'd say this is more intermediate-advanced difficulty than beginner, but it is still really useful for learning more about programming in C++!\n\n[https://www.volatileint.dev/posts/feedback-controller/](https://www.volatileint.dev/posts/feedback-controller/)",

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nHow do you abstract CRUD methods and still maintain flexibility?  \nIs DRY worth it when you don't even know what will be changed in the future?\n\nHere is an example from the current API (mainly \\`insert\\`, \\`update\\`, and \\`delete\\` methods):\n\n[https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/customer/customer.repository.ts](https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/customer/customer.repository.ts)\n\n[https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/customer/customer.repository.ts](https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/customer/customer.repository.ts)\n\n[https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/order/order.repository.ts](https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/order/order.repository.ts)\n\n[https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/product/product.repository.ts](https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/product/product.repository.ts)\n\nMy \"experience\" with DRY\n\nI've been remaking an API to learn design patterns. And one of the things I've been going out of my way to avoid is abstracting the repositories. The reason behind that is, the first few versions of this API (Files are lost) I did exactly that, everything worked really well until I had to do major changes in one of them. And since everything was super tied together any change I did would require me to change the others or add new methods that will handle the new changes. I did find some work around at the time but they were not great and I ended up remaking the whole thing with out abstracting the repositories again.\n\nOne of my main problems at the time with DRY was adding logic to the try/catch block that was abstracted. That's why I'm searching for a solution that's is flexible enough to allow this.\n\nThe API isn't done, there are like 100 things to be added, that's why I've been hesitant of abstracting them.\n\nI will be honest, the first few versions were bad, really really bad, horrible, the worst thing you will ever see (service logic mixed with repositories...) and I do believe that's part of it why I couldn't properly separate them. The current one isn't the best yet but it's a day and night difference from the older ones, I'm still learning on how to do things the right way, and that's why I'm posting this.\n\nIDK why I was embarrassed about posting this.",

        "author": "Environmental_Emu830",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone. I’m currently in my 5th semester of Computer Engineering and I’m trying to figure out which path to follow professionally. Until recently I was leaning toward software development, but after reading a public-sector job exam syllabus from my city (it had a ton of infrastructure topics), I got really interested in infra/cloud and started considering security too.\n\nThe problem is: I feel kind of lost about where to start studying infrastructure properly. My initial idea was to use that exam syllabus as a structured study guide, then later go for cloud certs (AWS/Azure/GCP). But someone told me that using a government exam syllabus as a learning roadmap isn’t a great idea, and that infrastructure can be a tough field in terms of pay and quality of life early on (lots of on-call, lower salaries in some places, etc.).\n\nThey suggested a more “traditional base” first, like:\n\n* strong Linux fundamentals (LPIC-1/2)\n* Windows basics\n* virtualization (VMware)\n* storage fundamentals\n* DB administration\n* containers (Docker → Kubernetes later)\n* IaC (Terraform)\n* configuration management (Ansible)\n* maybe CompTIA certs (A+, Network+, etc.)\n\nThey also said DevOps/DevSecOps usually come later in a career, after you’ve had solid experience in infra + dev (and security for DevSecOps).\n\nOn top of that, I’m planning long-term to work abroad. I have Italian citizenship and I’ve lived in Spain before, so Europe is a realistic option for me. My English is decent (not perfect yet, but improving). I’m also saving money monthly so I can move if needed. That said, if I found a good remote job paying in EUR/USD, I might even stay in Brazil.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. For someone still in college, does it make sense to start with infrastructure as a base and move into cloud later? Or is it better to go straight into cloud studies early on?\n2. Between infrastructure/cloud and security, which one is smarter to focus on first if I genuinely like both? I’m thinking: build a strong infra foundation first, then if I end up enjoying security more, transition over time since they overlap a lot.\n3. For people who’ve worked in Europe (or hired there): is it true that with 2–3 years of solid experience you can become competitive there pretty fast? What skills/certs/projects actually matter most for entry-level roles?\n4. Since I’m still in university, would it be worth trying to transfer to a European university (Erasmus / full transfer / master later), or is it better to finish here and move with experience?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice, especially from people in infra/cloud/security or who’ve made a similar move abroad. Thanks!",

I negotiated with them with a higher base and told them that I'm in process with Meta (L5). With some back and forth, today they reached out and told me that they're willing to meet my asking base salary, which is higher than their cap for the role. I can tell that they want me and I also told them that I'm willing to stop my process with Meta if they can meet my requirements. They did, and now I'm wondering if I should cancel my final rounds with Meta next week. Regardless I will choose the fully remote role since even if I pass Meta, the 2-3 days hybrid in office requires me to uproot my family and relocate probably, and I do have a 18-month old toddler so work/life balance matters a lot to me now.\n\nSo for now, I'm thinking what's the point of doing the interviews if I'm not going to take the offer. Plus I've been preparing for this round for months, doing leetcode, system design everyday. I'm tired of all of this. If doing interviews, I think it's just for the sake of gaining experience. I don't want to waste everybody's time. The thing is I failed the final rounds with Meta in 2024, so if I fail this time it would be the 2nd fail attempt. But pulling before the final rounds might be better since I technically only failed once I guess. What do you think?",

We made plans to rewrite critical parts of the code, but my company is terrible at allocating resources and everyone has been working on other things (we’re supposed to be on a code freeze but people are getting massive PRs up to both Fe and be repos).\n\nSo the CEO and CTO have gotten frustrated with lack of progress and made an insane decision that the CTO will vibe code the frontend and backend alone. He does have the most business context and the original product was poorly written, but this has been worked on for two years and has a lot of custom config that will likely be overlooked in the rewrite and will cause tons of issues for existing customers.\n\nMy CEO was bragging about how our CTO stays up all night vibe coding and I later found out that they are not even reviewing their frontend code. He expects my team to maintain his code - literally said, “I don’t want to maintain that.” He said it appears to work because his endpoints work (who cares about user interaction). I feel like his failure to manage his team has led to him deciding that it is easier to do it himself than do his job. \n\nThis is insane right? Do I jump ship? How do I express how ruinous this is as a business decision when both the CEO and CTO are on board? ",

        "content": "Hey, \n\nI have been laid off around 5 times in my whole software development career (also tried consulting) because I have a bit of a slower performance than others and made more mistakes (bugs or small design issues like margin mismatch when doing frontend dev). \n\nChatgpt mentioned that I might have ADD (so ADHD-I) because I sometimes struggled in private areas too. But it's more like I forget things or I don't force myself to do my work hard enough. I feel like my brain is often more \"lazy\" because thinking hard (like solving a complex issue) is uncomfortable. I mean it's not that I'm lazy at work, but having the complex issue in ones mind and try to solve it efficiently is not that easy. On some days I have a overall good performance and I'm clearheaded but unfortunately on other days I'm not. \n\nChatgpt mentioned that I might have some mental issue where stimulants could help me to have a better performance. Actually I'm not sure if ADHD-I would be the right diagnosis because I don't have distraction issues like these people often have. It's not that my focus or thoughts are changing all the time and that's the core reason of all... No rather it's stuff like working memory, processing speed, mild \"brain fog\", etc. where I feel this impacts my performance at work. \n\nThe thing is that I'm not sure anymore. Even psychologists do have an overall different opinion... some say it could be ADHD-I, others say rather not. I don't know. \n\nCurrently I don't know what kind of work I can do instead if the only issue is that I'm not capable to work in this field.  I'm currently studying so I focus on that at the moment.

        "author": "Comet7777",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was coming from a tech leadership role for a handful of years before sort of burning out and deciding to jump at a startup. Same industry that I know, cool new hook and angle, a \"Head of Product\" title and good investors. This company demanded 10-12 hours daily and would rush projects out and I'm just completely allergic to this way of \"working\". Because they're in pacific time and I'm in central, I was working past dinner time and not eating or spending time with my family. So, after 4 months of being here, something I've never done, I decided to look for something better already.\n\nI've always been \"good\" at getting new offers if I wanted them, via by networking or other means. I was sort of slapped to reality and humbled when I saw how awful this market actually is. The pain at work, coupled with two early phone screen rejections made me realize I had to change how I was doing this. The tech job market from 2017-2022 was long gone.\n\nHere are the tips that ultimately worked for me:\n\n1. Reached out to my network and let them know my situation. I received 4 referrals and a handful of informational interviews with folks. I did this via group chats, messaging connections on LinkedIn, college alumni groups I'm a part of.\n2. I used LinkedIn Premium. Why use this overpriced service? As soon as I have it and I mark myself as actively looking (oh and hide the damn Premium icon from your profile or your employer will find it odd that you have it) - I start getting tons of recruiters hitting me up. 2 of these led to an initial screen.\n3. Adjusted my title appropriately. I de-leveled my title for certain Senior Product Manager roles. One question I kept getting was why go from leadership/management to a role like this. The real reason was because my current environment is toxic, my title is inflated there, and the money isn't great, and these \"lower title\" roles were paying on par or sometimes higher for significantly less responsibility. A buddy of mine who was a VP had to practice a similar thing in de-leveling his title when he was laid off. You can play around with your title a bit, but I DO NOT recommend leveling up your title when that isn't factual. It'll come out.\n4. Apply daily to the latest openings, I'll show you how to best do this below.\n5. Had a single thread with ChatGPT where it knew my resume, my work history, my specific projects, my answers to previous interview and job application questions. This made answering bespoke custom questions on ATSs very quick.\n6. A benefit/luxury/advantage - I do have a variety of experience as a software engineer, product manager, tech leadership etc. I'm aware that this greatly expedited this whole process and if I was more junior I likely would have struggled significantly more.\n\n**Best Places to Apply.**  \nI would open up my computer and had a browser with the following tabs open:\n\n1. LinkedIn job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)\n2. Indeed job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)\n3. [Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/) search (an AI aggregator that links you directly to company careers postings)\n4. [Wellfound.com](http://wellfound.com/) search (specifically for start-up hiring)\n5. Google search with the following:\n\nsite:jobs.smartrecruiters.com (\"Group Product Manager\" OR \"Principal Product Manager\" OR \"Senior Product Manager\" OR \"Director of Product\" OR \"VP of Product\" OR \"Head of Product\") AND \"remote\"\n\nThis will list ALL job postings that match the description of those job titles I was looking for (and remote!) directly against the ATS without having to rely on crappy job aggregators. Now open up a tab and do the same thing but replace site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com with the following ATSs I could find:  \n\\- site:jobs.lever.co  \n\\- site:boards.greenhouse.io  \n\\- site:ashbyhq.com\n\nThen on the google results, go to Tools and select last 24 hours.\n\nThis means I would have 10'ish tabs open each day and do the search at 9am and later around 2-3pm and then apply right away. This search almost always takes you to a new posting, rather than those annoying ghost openings or jobs that get reposted for months. This also takes you directly to the employer's site.\n\n**High-level stats:**  \n\\- Total Applications - 350+  \n\\- Referrals made on my behalf - 4 (only one led to a phone screen lol)  \n\\- Duration - \\~2 months  \n\\- Companies scheduling phone screen - 9 (2 ghosted, 2 wanted very niche experience)  \n\\- Companies moving to hiring manager round - 5  \n\\- Companies moving to second/third+ round - 5  \n\\- Offer - 1, I cancelled the remaining 4 live opportunities upon accepting offer\n\nThe offer came from the place I least expected (Wellfound). An application for a hybrid role in NYC (I'm not in NYC, or close to it) led to the CEO directly reaching out to me. I took his call not thinking much of the opportunity since the description didn't have much to go off of. We both had a ton of fun talking and getting a feel for each other. The rest of the interviewing process with that team felt like talking to friends, it was an easy offer to accept.\n\nI could go way more in detail about how I prep for interviews, not sure how helpful that would be for people. I just wanted to share my process of applying, hoping it's of any use to anyone!",

When you read interviews or biographies, you see traits often associated with autism or what used to be called Asperger’s, hyper-focus, intense special interests, difficulty with socializing, and a preference for systems over people. It makes me wonder how much neurodivergence plays into the tech world. These founders go from isolated kids to running giant companies, and even after becoming billionaires, they don’t “relax” like other wealthy people. A lot stay obsessively focused on huge, almost sci-fi goals (Mars missions, reinventing society, etc.), while others try to reinvent themselves as cool, stylish, yacht-owning public figures ( bezos, zuckerberg ). It sometimes feels like a real-life revenge of the nerds.",

I ended up touching so many parts - old monolith application, data pipelines for etl workloads, cloud application, and heaps of languages: C++, C#, Perl, node, python, golang and more… yet I don’t feel like I’m good enough in any of them. \n\nBetween the stress of immigration and family problems, I haven’t been putting enough effort to grow my skills and knowledge in the past. This resulted in me being promoted to a senior and performing like one in that company using my knowledge of their software - but having no particular in-demand skills to land another job. \n\nIn the past few years I have been realising that I do not want this to be my reality. I started learning more about AWS, working on small personal projects, reading books like DDIA and, yes, grinding leetcode to prepare for the interviews. However, my CV remains unimpressive. \n\nIt was always my dream to get into a FAANG company.

Whenever a tool automates a skill, the neural circuitry behind that skill weakens over time. We’ve seen this with GPS and navigation ability, calculators and mental arithmetic, spell check and spelling. AI is now scaling that effect across almost every domain.\n\nThe next generation of workers will grow up in a radically different cognitive environment. A huge part of what we call \"skill\" is repeated cognitive strain, and AI removes that strain.\n\nCritical thinking follows the same rule as physical training: stop working the muscle and it atrophies. If you skip the gym for 6 months, your body changes; skip mental effort for 6 months, your mind changes.\n\nProblem solving won’t decline because people are getting “dumber,” but because the incentives to think deeply are disappearing. When an answer is always one prompt away, the cognitive machinery for generating answers naturally weakens.\n\nIt creates a double bind:\n\n1. Use AI heavily and you outsource your thinking. \n2. Avoid AI and you risk falling behind everyone who does.\n\nWe’ve never faced a technological shift that directly competes with our core cognitive processes. As experienced workers with decades of intuition retire, we may end up with a workforce whose baseline thinking is increasingly shaped and limited by the tools they rely on.\n\nIf this trajectory continues, we’re heading toward a society where AI performs most of the critical thinking, and humans gradually lose the habit and even the ability to do it themselves.",

In fact, most of them built their core services on Java from day one and continue to scale with it.\n\nFrom what I've seen, only a smaller set of newer or niche fintechs actually use Go as their main language for example, Monzo is the standout case here with a Go-based microservices architecture.\n\nGo does have strengths: simplicity, concurrency model, and speed for distributed systems.

I'm currently going through all responses seeing who I think I can help the most, I'll be in touch shortly!\n\n================\n\nEdit:  \nGoogle form is set up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRQuAjhNgKwXzdkaYjRQC8vk4_VKyzsvsKkgcZH_Q2o6EZjA/viewform?usp=dialog)!. I've replied to all the comments that were put up here so far with this form. In the (likely) event that there may be too many responses, I'll do my best to have at least one conversation with everyone, and find folks in my peer group who I respect a lot who may be willing to be mentors as well. This is all best effort, I appreciate your patience :)\n\n================\n\nHey all,\n\nNot sure if this violates the rules of the subreddit (don't think it does!).\n\nI've been fortunate enough to have done reasonably well in my tech career, and I wanted to see if I could offer mentorship support to anyone in this subreddit (or other kinds of support, depending on need).\n\nA bit about me: Based in the US, been in the tech industry for well over a decade, and have worn several hats from test to backend engineering to research. I won't share my personal details on this post, but here are the highlights:\n\n\\- Have a bachelor's and a Master's in Computer Science (consciously opted to not do a PhD)\n\n\\- Started out as a Software Engineer in Testing at a Big Tech firm\n\n\\- Made a lateral move to a \"traditional\" Software Engineer role\n\n\\- Made a lateral move to ML Research, all in premier research labs you've definitely heard about. A few promotions along the way\n\n\\- Founded a startup in the AI space, did fundraising, hiring, sales calls, etc.\n\n\\- Been an IC, TL, manager, founder, etc.\n\nWhat I think I can help with:\n\n\\- General mentorship: I currently (and have in the past) mentor early-career folks, topics range from \"how do I talk to my manager about this issue\" to \"How do I know what to work on?\"\n\n\\- Technical mentorship: General technical brainstorming/AI model review/code review, etc., in the past I did this with folks who didn't have a senior technical leader to learn from (e.g. they were the founding engineer in a small startup).\n\n\\- Mock interviews: Prepping for interviews at a tech company? I've done quite a few of those for engineering roles (and a few for product), I can do mock interviews and give you feedback.\n\n\\- Resume review\n\n\\- You just want to vent and need someone to listen :)\n\nWhat I can't help with:\n\n\\- Referrals for job openings: I get these requests semi-regularly on LinkedIn, and unfortunately, I'm unable to refer anyone I don't know personally or have worked with (literally one of the first questions in any referral is: \"how do you know this person?\").\n\nIf there's interest, I was planning on setting up a Google Form or something to coordinate -- please let me know if this is something that people here would want!",

        "content": "Hey yall, as end of year reviews come out and as my company hits raise and bonus time of year, I am curious if I am really underpaid, or if I am paid fairly and have unrealistic expectations.\n\n  \nI work for a non tech, semi small (around 100 employees) company, that has some pretty big clients. **I currently make 39k a year,** I am going on almost 2 years here and I have not received a raise yet. We work mostly in C# and .net, but have been making some pushes into some python development (more on this). personally I work on a wide range of applications, both client facing and internal. I am remote but company is located in Southern U.S. \n\n  \nSince we are a smaller dev team, I have alot of responsibilities that I feel like *most*  jr. devs don't have, but I could be wrong. Some of the things I do outside of programming are\n\n1. Meeting directly with Clients to scaffold out and discuss task, creating them in Jira, developing the solution, presenting and then directly receiving feedback on the solution (along with the PM and sr. dev) \n2. Having a heavy involvement in AWS migration, being the one creating proof of concepts for utilizing alot of different AWS micro services (e.g. currently working on lambda function that work with our applications) \n3. Creating internal and client facing documentation and sop's for applications, work flows, and pipelines\n\nI had a rocky start during my first 6 months, but improved alot and got an -A in my end of year review, as compared to a -B one my first.\n\nBut there are some caveats that I think are important\n\n1. I am \"Full-time\" w/ benefits but contracted at 32 hours a week. This because I am also a full time student at a university. They work around my class schedule, but I try my best to make my classes compliment the work day. I would be willing to move to 40 hours a week\n2. I am also part time Military, I know that they can't hold this against me, but during my first 6 months at this company, I spent probably about 4 of Military service, which could have slowed my progression either way. They also let me work reduced hours while I am fulfilling military commitments and pay me as usual (I can't really afford not to)\n3. I am sometimes a mediocre developer, however, past work experience makes my true strength my soft skills. I am applauded for how I carry myself in meetings and presentations with clients. \n\nSo, after all that, I am as underpaid as I think I am? I went into software development for financial stability for my family (I do have children), but I am kind of at a loss. I don't really want to start looking for other jobs, because I am unsure if they would work with my school schedule and be as flexible as this place. I also love the team and the work life balance is pretty good. \n\nIs thinking I should at least be around 70-80k unrealistic? I have brought up getting a raise before, but there really hasn't been an actual conversation about it. How do I engage in negotiation? What do yall think is acceptable pay? \n\nI think that's everything, thanks guys!\n\n  \n**TLDR;** Junior Software dev making production level code being paid 39k, often works directly with clients and new technologies, such as AWS during a huge migration. Am I super underpaid? If I am, what should I ask for and how should I broach that subject",

(ask me to build a working scalable MVP of anything I doubt I could do it) I feel like I can’t keep up without using AI but then I have an over dependence on AI. \n\nSo in conclusion: without AI I can’t actually build anything and thus I feel like I am faking it in big tech. \nI want to learn how to be a better programmer and be able to do all these things so, where to start? \n\nThanks!

This more of a HW/Production facing company then SW design based so that definitely plays a role.\n\nIs this common? Or is this just an unlucky circumstance of the company I’m at. I’m just afraid after years of this I’ve lost my “edge” I had due to barely touching any code some days due to internal complications and just slow moving-ness of work through the system.\n\n",

        "content": "So I worked three excessively shitty jobs in a row\n\nFirst was (Forest in Brazil). I found my manager nearly impossible to communicate with, we just did things so differently. My mentor was excessively aggressive, I legit thought he had some sort of personality disorder. I remember in my first week, I asked maybe 3 questions, common ones like where to find certain resources. Each time my mentor would simply send me a link, and on the third one, he made a remark about how I’m asking too many questions. So, I took the hint and didn’t ask questions unless it was absolutely necessary. Then they started complaining I wasn’t asking _enough_ questions. I was so lost. Then I was assigned a job with another new hire and she faced the same problem, told she asks too much questions then when she stopped. They said that she “just went off and did her own thing”. I kinda felt like I was missing something — isn’t the obvious reaction to “you’re asking too many questions” to… ask fewer questions? Obviously it was more than just this, but it’s an example of how communication was very hostile. I just kept a low profile as much as possible. I ended up quitting, but I definitely think something lingered here\n\nNext job was a weirdly incompetent AI company. Management expected ~30 tickets to be completed per week, and those tickets were usually big ones. For context, they expected something similar to ChatGPT to be built in 2 weeks by 2 engineers with 0 bugs. I was let go from here. I asked why, and they seemed to say I should be available 24/7 and I wasn’t (I explicitly said I can’t be contacted 6-8pm because I help at a Muay Thai gym and you can’t have a computer/phone on you while holding pads obviously)\n\nNext job started great. I was cautiously optimistic. Around 6 months in, I started to relax and take a deep breath. Then… they hired a new manager. I could not understand for the life of me what this manager was talking about. I thought I was losing my mind a little, honestly. She would constantly say these bromides like “act more like a senior engineer”. If I asked where I was falling short of being a “senior engineer” or what goals I should have, she said it’s not her job to tell me that, nor is it her job to give me work to do. I’d have to fight for hours to figure out what I should be working on. She was just an odd person. I remember she had an exercise where she _insisted_ that everyone eats peanut butter sandwiches. I don’t and never have. I thought this was some sort of weird test, because she was so insistent that everyone does this. I could tell I was being intentionally sabotaged by her, as she would block PRs with frankly obviously stupid and unproductive comments\n\nNow I’m starting a new job and I feel extremely intense anxiety about… everything. Although I’m a frontend engineer, this job has asked me to get up to date on ruby. I’ve never written ruby before. It’s not that I can’t learn it, but it causes me such deep anxiety to feel like I’m asking “stupid” questions. I asked one stupid question and I lost a whole night of sleep over the anxiety of thinking that I’m gonna get fired and start this cycle again\n\nIs there anything I can do? I’ve hired a therapist and everything but she mostly says “you should take it easy and be in the present” but that’s easier said than done. I have some fear that the “new manager” thing happening again. Yeah, the job is good _now_, but what if I get a new manager who just decides to fire me?",

        "content": "This post may be long, but I want to be completely honest so I can get real guidance.\n\nI completed my BCA in 2021 and started my career at Cognizant as a Programmer Trainee. I worked there for about 1.1 years, but I left because the project felt dull and I thought I could do better. Looking back now, resigning without a backup was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made.\n\nAfter that, I joined Amazon as an SPS Associate. The work was mostly repetitive support tasks - more like a BPO setup. There was no real growth, and I thought I should get back into a proper IT role while I was still young. So I left Amazon too.\n\nTo rebuild myself, I joined a 9-month Data Analyst bootcamp. I genuinely put effort into it - completed all modules, built projects, created a portfolio website, made proper LinkedIn project presentation, customized my resume as per each JD, and applied mainly through official career sites. My ATS score was almost always above 95%.\n\nDespite all that, I wasn’t able to secure even a single interview. Not one. I applied to more than 2000 jobs. Each rejection hit me harder, and eventually I completely burned out. I stopped studying, started escaping into video games and alcohol, and mentally I was in a very dark place. Every day felt heavier than the last.\n\nIt’s been around 5-6 months since I stopped my job search. Now I’m sitting with:\nan almost 1.8-year career gap, no savings, no sense of direction and a lot of self-doubt.\n\nMy parents are supportive and even willing to invest in further studies if needed. But at this point, I don’t have the courage to spend more money on courses that may or may not lead to anything. The job market feels extremely dry, and I’m scared of making another wrong move.\n\nThe only safe option I can think of is going back to the BPO world - but then I wonder why I even left a good WFH Amazon job if I have to end up in the same place again. It makes me feel like I’ve messed everything up.\n\nRight now, I’m not even fixated on IT. I just want a career with real growth, not something where even after 10-15 years the salary barely crosses 50k. I’m willing to put in 3-5 months of focused effort to learn something valuable but I don’t want to end up in another dead-end situation.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation, or has genuine advice on what direction I should take next, I would be truly grateful. I’m not looking for motivation, I just need clarity and a practical path forward.",

A lot of the tools we write are based on other internal tools from other teams that we have to add automation and scalability, basically making it so developers (our customers) don't have to think about how and where this tool is running and testing their code. \n\nRecently we started working with a new team who was supposed to be providing this whole suite if new tools for us to take and \"wrap\". \n\nExcept their product is absolute shit. They gave us a pip package that makes the most insane assumptions. It assumes that the package is being a run on a machine with a mount to the company wide NFS. This NFS is the most dogshit piece of bullshit to ever exist. It works. It works great. And what that means is that you have thousands of devs just throwing files and scripts in places, and assuming that other scripts exist. And the dependencies chain down, so every thing is tied to everything else. And their pip package needs to be run there. Even worse, one of their scripts that they call from inside their package starts with \" #!/usr/bin/python3.7\" (we are using python 3.13) and assumes that there are certain packages installed in that environment. \n\nNow we have been trying to unplug from all this bullshit, but the amount of crappy design and dev culture is just driving me insane. We tried to dockerize and run our stuff cleanly in a cluster, but the amount of leaky dependencies that we are finding is just soul crushing.\n\nThankfully at least my managers are very understanding and basically want to go to war with these nonces for providing such ass backwards tooling. \n\nRant over.

The other is a Security Engineer role. Both companies seem strong, but the work and long term trajectories look very different.\n\nOn the SRE side, the work is focused on cloud engineering, observability, automation, CI CD, Kubernetes, and reliability. It feels very hands on and technical. A lot of people say SRE experience opens doors at big tech later because it shows you can handle scale and complex systems.\n\nOn the Security Engineering side, the work is more about hardening, IAM, vulnerability management, detection logic, cloud security, and defense. It feels more structured and predictable. It also seems like a path that can lead to architect level security roles or broader cloud security positions.\n\nFor people who have been in either role, I’d really appreciate your insight on a few things:\n\n• Which role grows your skills faster\n• Which path tends to pay more over time\n• Which one provides better job security\n• Which is more stressful day to day\n• Which one is easier to move from into big tech\n• If you switched between these fields, what made you change\n\nAny honest advice from people who have done SRE or security engineering would help a lot.

So candidate does, reapplies, get another rejection, company likes that you have exposure/experience with a, b, c, d, e, f, but pass because you don't know g, h, i , and to spend a few months learning those before reapplying, repeat.\n\nI think stuff like that is also what drives people to tutorial hell since they want to have experience with some tech/stack, but don't have enough time, but keep switching to new things because of rejections telling them to learn new things.",

Junior C#/.NET developer for a national bank working on internal software for the company.\n\n  \n2.) Junior Android developer working on an in-vehicle infotainment system.  \n  \nThe second offer is coming from a company not based in the U.S but who has a small (<50 people) North American branch they are trying to build up.\n\nThe pay for the .NET role was higher at first but the Android position has offered to match the rate.\n\nBoth would be on a contract-to-hire of 6 months and 9 months respectively.  \nThe .NET role is 4 days in-person and 1 day remote.  \nThe Android role is fully in person.\n\nMy only consideration is which will bring me closer to my ultimate goal of working as low-level developer working with C++ or adjacent languages. Operating Systems, Game Engines, and Computer Graphics being three areas I am super interested in.\n\nThe android position might have some embedded programming but it would be for debugging purposes only. It's also not guaranteed. For the most part, I can expect to be working in Java and Kotlin.\n\nWith the .NET role, it is technically fullstack as I will be expected to work (minimally) on the front-end, I'd also be dealing with a lot of SQL.\n\n  \nI would appreciate any advice for which of these roles would help bring me closer to my goal. I have no professional experience related to either role so I am unsure of what the best move is. \n\n",

        "content": "This post may be long, but I want to be completely honest so I can get real guidance.\n\nI completed my BCA in 2021 and started my career at Cognizant as a Programmer Trainee. I worked there for about 1.1 years, but I left because the project felt dull and I thought I could do better. Looking back now, resigning without a backup was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made.\n\nAfter that, I joined Amazon as an SPS Associate. The work was mostly repetitive support tasks - more like a BPO setup. There was no real growth, and I thought I should get back into a proper IT role while I was still young. So I left Amazon too.\n\nTo rebuild myself, I joined a 9-month Data Analyst bootcamp. I genuinely put effort into it - completed all modules, built projects, created a portfolio website, made proper LinkedIn project presentation, customized my resume as per each JD, and applied mainly through official career sites. My ATS score was almost always above 95%.\n\nDespite all that, I wasn’t able to secure even a single interview. Not one. I applied to more than 2000 jobs. Each rejection hit me harder, and eventually I completely burned out. I stopped studying, started escaping into video games and alcohol, and mentally I was in a very dark place. Every day felt heavier than the last.\n\nIt’s been around 5-6 months since I stopped my job search. Now I’m sitting with:\nan almost 1.8-year career gap, no savings, no sense of direction and a lot of self-doubt.\n\nMy parents are supportive and even willing to invest in further studies if needed. But at this point, I don’t have the courage to spend more money on courses that may or may not lead to anything. The job market feels extremely dry, and I’m scared of making another wrong move.\n\nThe only safe option I can think of is going back to the BPO world - but then I wonder why I even left a good WFH Amazon job if I have to end up in the same place again. It makes me feel like I’ve messed everything up.\n\nRight now, I’m not even fixated on IT. I just want a career with real growth, not something where even after 10-15 years the salary barely crosses 50k. I’m willing to put in 3-5 months of focused effort to learn something valuable but I don’t want to end up in another dead-end situation.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation, or has genuine advice on what direction I should take next, I would be truly grateful. I’m not looking for motivation, I just need clarity and a practical path forward.",

Both positions still remain open on their website so I figure they are still letting applicants roll in, but is this normal for the defense industry?

        "content": "So I'm not sure how usual or standard my experience has been, but I've found that so far, as a current undergraduate senior, my new grad job application cycle has been more successful than last year's internship application cycle.\n\nLast year, during almost all of my fall semester, my resume sucked so badly I had to put down summer and part-time non-tech survival jobs down under \"experience\". And from August to March, I failed to receive even one response for any kind of tech role. (Just one startup, which then went on to reject me.)\n\nI've improved considerably ever since, in terms of both projects and actual experience. And much to my relief, come March, April, and May, I was actually receiving interviews for internships. Not much, and not all were successful or led to offers, but it felt rewarding as it represented a significant improvement from both the previous fall, and my sophomore-year job recruiting experience (which lasted from October to January, and proved even more pathetic).\n\nThis semester has been even more rewarding, and I've consistently been talking to real people at around 1 or even 2 companies a month on average. The roles aren't always nice, but beggars can't exactly be choosers if you have 0 years of FT experience. What probably helps presently is currently having a side job actually involving tech (although it's for school, and so it's unlikely it'll be extended).\n\nFor reference, I've been applying to an assortment of roles in pure SWE, cloud, IT, informatics, data science, data analytics, and business analytics. At this point, I'm aware that, again, beggars can't exactly be choosers, and I'd be thrilled if any company can have me on board and pay me a living wage, doesn't have to be FAANG or even F500.\n\nRight now, since around mid-November, I've actually been taking a bit of a break from job applications, since a) I've recently had a couple of nasty ones and just feel bummed out, and b) it's the holiday season, so hardly anyone's hiring at this time of year. I hope things can kick back up from roughly January to May, though I'm aware from my internship recruiting that it's a bit deader or something (part of which is what motivated me to kick the bucket as a sophomore at the same time of year). But if I don't manage to land a tech or even tech-adjacent job by this summer, or maybe the summer after if accounting for new-grad roles that have like a 12-month window or something, am I permanently locked out of the tech industry? Will I have finished a CS degree for nothing? Will I be doomed to live with my conservative mom or stock shelves for the foreseeable future barring some miracle?",

I had no other offers lined up at the time, so I accepted it. I thought recruiting was over.\n\nThen, a month later, I was contacted by another one of my dream companies to interview. I thought, why not, and did it. I actually received an offer. However, I initially told them I didn’t have any other interviews or offers because I was dumb and thought it would hurt my chances.\n\nBasically, the second company offers better growth, salary, and still has decent RO since I’m a junior.\n\nHowever, that means I would have to renege on the first offer. I’ve never done anything like this, and it feels super unprofessional, but I know at the end of the day, I just want to make the best decision for me.\n\nBasically, should I go through onboarding with the new company and finish all the steps before reneging? I’m also worried that my first company might somehow appear in my background check, even though I haven’t worked for them before and haven’t started. I don’t think it will, but if it does, that could be a sticky situation since I initially lied about other offers. My worst fear is that the recruiters might somehow get in touch, and I would be screwed out of both options.\n\nAdditionally, is reneging as simple as sending an email to your recruiter? If so, should I be detailed and explain why, or should I be vague? Will this likely burn bridges in the future?\n\nSorry for all the questions. I just don’t know what I’m doing and don’t want to mess things up. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",
