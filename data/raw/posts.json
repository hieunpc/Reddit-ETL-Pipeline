After a couple of years of self-teaching (programming, SQL, data fundamentals) and some freelancing, I landed a role about a year ago in a large company (hundreds of millions in revenue).\n\nWhen I joined, there was zero data culture. No team, no processes, just a lot of manual work and fragmented info. My official title is \"Data Manager\", but since I’m building the function from scratch, I’ve been doing a bit of everything:\n\n* Automation & ETL: Writing Python scripts and using Power Automate to kill manual tasks.\n* Infrastructure: Designing and building business-oriented databases from the ground up.\n* BI/Visualization: Creating the first actual dashboards.\n* Optimization: Cleaning up the \"Excel Wild West\" and setting common data policies.\n\nMy question: Imposter syndrome aside, I’m struggling to map this experience to the actual market. I love the \"ideation\" and architecture part—designing the pipelines, thinking through the data flows, and making things work automatically. But I sometimes worry I’m doing a lot of useful things, but not building a clean and recognizable profile.\n\n\\- What term would you use to describe this type of role? I'm not sure if I'm closer to data engineering or analytics...\n\n\\- Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\n\n\\- What would you discover next if you were in my shoes? I want to switch from band-aid solutions to more reliable, scalable procedures. At this point, what would you learn first: DBT, cloud architecture, orchestration tools like Airflow, or something else?\n\nMy current stack is Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Automate, and some legacy VBA.\n\nI genuinely love this job—it's a world away from my previous life in humanities—but I want to make sure I’m steering the ship in the right direction.

        "content": "Just wanted to share my experience with Snowflake Openflow.\n\n  \nThe client i work for relies heavily on CDC replication for their data ingestion to snowflake. We mainly bring in data from SQL server and oracle database to our snowflake data lake.\n\nOur client is using many different ETL tools mainly Firvetran's HVR, IICS and AWS DMS and in some cases snowpipe when they want to ingest data from s3 to snowflake.\n\n  \nWhen snowflake announced openflow which supports CDC replication we were excited. Out of the box it was supporting SQL Server CDC replication and Oracle connector was soon to be released. We were very excited as our client wanted to move away from IICS and HVR due to licensing costs.\n\n  \nWe immediately started working on a POC when the openflow was available in private preview.\n\nPOC Area: - CDC based replication from SQL Server to snowflake.\n\n  \nIts fairly very easy to setup the connectors and start using it. We were able to configure the connectors and start ingesting the data within couple of hours and mind you none of us had used apache nifi before.\n\n  \nPros: - \n\n1. easy to setup and use.\n\n2. Replication latency is pretty low. Plus it can be configured as well to fit your use case.\n\n  \nCons: - \n\n1. Cannot configure target snowflake schema : - biggest downside we have found out yet. We were using the default workflow for SQL server CDC and there is no option to ingest the data into desired snowflake schema. By default Openflow is creating a schema in snowflake database with the source SQL Server schema name. We were pulling the data from SQL server schema \"DBO\" and Openflow was creating the same schema inside our snowflake database.\n\nWe updated almost all the processors inside the workflow to use the custom schema name, for most part it worked. we were able to create tables and journal tables etc inside our custom schema in snowflake. But there is one processor which merges journal tables to permanent table which was not supporting to use custom schema name. Somehow it was still using \"<DB\\_NAME>.DBO\". DB name is configurable in this processor but not the schema name.\n\n  \nWe connected with the snowflake internal team regarding the same and the guy said they working on it after receiving complaints from lots of other clients. \n\nLater he suggested us to not configure/updated the workflow which comes with database connectors. If we do update it, it's gonna be considered as a custom workflow and it will be locked out of future updates.\n\nSo, customizing the pipeline is out of the picture.\n\n2. Environment variables and JVM variables: - there is no one stop UI to manage all these variables inside the workflow. You need to navigate to each processor to manage these variables. \n\n  \n3. Error logs: - not a fan of how openflow manages error logs, its very janky to navigate  and use.\n\n  \nthese were the stuff we found out in the last couple of weeks. We have stopped our POC midway due to con 1. And we and the client are totally dissappointed with how openflow is working as of now.\n\n",

        "author": "ukmurmuk",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Some principles I have been thinking about productive modern data engineering culture, sharing this here to see different perspectives about my outlook.\n\nFirst, I want to begin by making an assertion that in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodity. The expensive part is in reviewing & testing the code. But, as long as the pipelines are batch, the processing is not in a regulated environment, and the output is not directly affecting the core business, cost of mistakes are REALLY low. In most cases you can simply rerun the pipeline and replace the bad data, and if you design the pipeline well, processing cost should be very low.\n\nSo, here are my principles:\n\n•\t⁠Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthless. It slows down development, and it doesn’t really check the true output (product of complex interactions of functions and input data). It adds friction when expanding/optimizing the pipeline. It’s better to do WAP (Write-Audit-Publish) patterns to catch issues in production and block the pipeline if the output is not within expectations rather than trying to catch them locally with tests. (edit: write your e2e tests, DQ checks, and schema contracts. Unit test coverage shouldn’t give you any excuse to not have the other three, and if having the other three nullifies the value of unit tests, then the unit tests are worthless) \n\n•\t⁠Dependencies has to be explicit. If table A is dependent on table B, this dependency has to be explicitly defined in orchestration layer to ensure that issue in table A blocks the pipeline and doesn’t propagate to table B. It might be alluring to separate the DAGs to avoid alerts or other human conveniences, but it’s not a reliable design. \n\n•\t⁠With defensive pipelines (comprehensive data quality check suites, defensive DAGs, etc), teams can churn out codes faster and ship features faster rather than wasting time adjusting unit tests/waiting for human reviews. Really, nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for review. \n\n•\t⁠the biggest bottleneck in data engineering is not the labor of producing code, but the frictions of design/convention disagreements, arguments in code reviews, bad data modeling, and inefficient use of tables/pipelines. This phenomenon is inevitable when you have a big team, hence I argue in most cases, it’s more sensible to have a very lean data engineering team. I would even go further to the point that it makes more sense to have a single REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineers. Even if this really good one costs 5x than the average one, it’s more worth the money: allowing faster shipping volume and better ROI.\n\nSo, what do you think? Are these principles BS?",

        "content": "Hello. I need to calculate sliding windows as fast as possible in real time with historical data (from SQL tables) and new streaming data. How can this be achieved in less than 15 ms latency ideally? I tested Rising Wave's Continuous Query with Materialized Views but the fastest I could get it to run was like 50 ms latency. That latency includes from the moment the Kafka message was published to the moment when my business logic could consume the sliding window result made by Rising Wave. My application requires the results before proceeding.\nI tested Apache Flink a little and it seems like in order to get it to return the latest sliding window results in real time I need to build on top of standard Flink and I fear that if I implement that, it might just end up being even slower than Rising Wave.\nSo I would like to ask you if you know what other tools I could try.

Sometimes dabbling a bit in azure but no data pipeline work. I have been in this role for 1,5y and before this for 3 years I worked part time in more technical roles which included c#, git, azure devops, ssis, ssrs, qlik sense.\n\nI have been offered a position to move to our central analytics & bi team, they basically serve all the smaller units in our org (like the one I am in) and help with BI stuff. Not sure how many units there are but this is a large company with very regulated industries (like nuclear power). This role would introduce fabric to my daily tools and sql and python based on the conversation I had with the manager. The role listing also mentions that knowledge of etl/elt and ci/cd processes is required. But it also mentions on-prem gateways and fabric tenant admin.\n\nIn addition to this, I have been offered a position at a very good consulting company. It’s a data engineer position but it starts with a 4 week bootcamp to get me going in the DE skills (they mention tools like dbt, databricks, snowflake, fabric, python, sql etc) and then I start with customer projects. The caveat is that I get a \\~10% net pay cut. But they offer a ton of possibilities for growth, internal academies and they pay for certifications etc. I currently have none.\n\nI have to do my decision next week and I’m not sure what to choose. I know DE can open architect roles in the future but I have no idea what in-house fabric can do for me if I want to progress. From what I have read this subreddit I have gathered that Fabric isn’t that liked but I’m hoping if someone can give neutral opinions. Right now the situation is that I’m really bored with my job. I dislike the dashboard building, it’s boring. And talking with business why my numbers dont match their excel is well… also boring. I like the modelling part and the back end side but I also enjoy optimizing and trying different solutions and understanding how much our reporting costs us (computationally).\n\nFor context: based in EU, no kids, less than 3y of part time experience and now 1,5y full time\n\nEdit: I chose the Fabric role :)",

        "author": "shashanksati",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been building [SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB), for most of this year and I wanted to share what we’re working on and get genuine feedback from people who are interested in databases and distributed systems.\n\n*Sevendb is a distributed cache with pub/sub capabilities and configurable fsync.*\n\n# What problem we’re trying to solve\n\nA lot of modern applications need \\*\\*live data\\*\\*:\n\n* dashboards that should update instantly\n* tickers and feeds\n* systems reacting to rapidly changing state\n\nToday, most systems handle this by **polling-** clients repeatedly asking the database “*has*\n\n*this changed yet?*”. That wastes CPU, bandwidth, and introduces latency and complexity.\n\nTriggers do help a lot here , but as soon as multiple machine and low latency applications enter , they get dicey\n\nscaling databases horizontally introduces another set of problems:\n\n* nondeterministic behavior under failures\n* subtle bugs during retries, reconnects, crashes, and leader changes\n* difficulty reasoning about correctness\n\nSevenDB is our attempt to tackle both of these issues together.\n\n# What SevenDB does\n\nAt a high level, SevenDB is:\n\n**1. Reactive by design**\n\nInstead of clients polling, clients can \\*subscribe\\* to values or queries.\n\nWhen the underlying data changes, updates are pushed automatically.\n\nThink:\n\n\\* “Tell me whenever this value changes” instead of \"polling every few milliseconds\"\n\nThis reduces wasted work(compute , network and even latency) and makes real-time systems simpler and cheaper to run.\n\n**2. Deterministic execution**\n\nThe same sequence of logical operations always produces the same state.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n*  crash recovery becomes predictable\n*  retries don’t cause weird edge cases\n*  multi-replica behavior stays consistent\n*  bugs become reproducible instead of probabilistic nightmares\n\nWe explicitly test determinism by running randomized workloads hundreds of times across scenarios like:\n\n*  crash before send / after send\n*  reconnects (OK, stale, invalid)\n*  WAL rotation and pruning\n\n\\* 3-node replica symmetry with elections\n\nIf behavior diverges, that’s a bug.\n\n\\*\\*3. Raft-based replication\\*\\*\n\nWe use Raft for consensus and replication, but layer deterministic execution on top so that replicas don’t just \\*agree\\*—they behave identically.\n\nThe goal is to make distributed behavior boring and predictable.\n\n# Interesting part\n\nWe're an in-memory KV store , One of the fun challenges in SevenDB was making emissions fully deterministic. We do that by pushing them into the state machine itself. No async “surprises,” no node deciding to emit something on its own. If the Raft log commits the command, the state machine produces the exact same emission on every node. Determinism by construction.\n\nBut this compromises speed significantly , so what we do to get the best of both worlds is:\n\nOn the durability side: a SET is considered successful only after the Raft cluster commits it—meaning it’s replicated into the in-memory WAL buffers of a quorum. Not necessarily flushed to disk when the client sees “OK.”\n\nWhy keep it like this? Because we’re taking a deliberate bet that plays extremely well in practice:\n\n• **Redundancy buys durability** In Raft mode, our real durability is replication. Once a command is in the memory of a majority, you can lose a minority of nodes and the data is still intact. The chance of most of your cluster dying before a disk flush happens is tiny in realistic deployments.\n\n• **Fsync is the throughput killer** Physical disk syncs (fsync) are orders slower than memory or network replication. Forcing the leader to fsync every write would tank performance. I prototyped batching and timed windows, and they helped—but not enough to justify making fsync part of the hot path. (There is a durable flag planned: if a client appends durable to a SET, it will wait for disk flush. Still experimental.)\n\n• **Disk issues shouldn’t stall a cluster** If one node's storage is slow or semi-dying, synchronous fsyncs would make the whole system crawl. By relying on quorum-memory replication, the cluster stays healthy as long as most nodes are healthy.\n\nSo the tradeoff is small: yes, there’s a narrow window where a simultaneous majority crash could lose in-flight commands. But the payoff is huge: predictable performance, high availability, and a deterministic state machine where emissions behave exactly the same on every node.\n\nIn distributed systems, you often bet on the failure mode you’re willing to accept. This is ours.\n\nit helped us achieve these benchmarks\n\n    SevenDB benchmark — GETSET\n    Target: localhost:7379, conns=16, workers=16, keyspace=100000, valueSize=16B, mix=GET:50/SET:50\n    Warmup: 5s, Duration: 30s\n    Ops: total=3695354 success=3695354 failed=0\n    Throughput: 123178 ops/s\n    Latency (ms): p50=0.111 p95=0.226 p99=0.349 max=15.663\n    Reactive latency (ms): p50=0.145 p95=0.358 p99=0.988 max=7.979 (interval=100ms)\n\n# Why I'm posting here\n\nI started this as a potential contribution to dicedb, they are archived for now and had other commitments , so i started something of my own, then this became my master's work and now I am confused on where to go with this, I really love this idea but there's a lot we gotta see apart from just fantacising some work of yours\n\nWe’re early, and this is where we’d really value outside perspective.\n\nSome questions we’re wrestling with:\n\n*  Does “reactive + deterministic” solve a real pain point for you, or does it sound academic?\n*  What would stop you from trying a new database like this?\n*  Is this more compelling as a niche system (dashboards, infra tooling, stateful backends), or something broader?\n*  What would convince you to trust it enough to use it?\n\nBlunt criticism or any advice is more than welcome. I'd much rather hear “this is pointless” now than discover it later.\n\nHappy to clarify internals, benchmarks, or design decisions if anyone’s curious.",

        "content": "Teams meetings with transcription enabled. One hour of discussion quickly turns into 10k+ words of unstructured text.\n\nExtracting decisions, action items, and open questions manually doesn’t scale. The common approach is to push the full transcript into a large cloud model and hope for a usable summary.\n\nThat approach breaks down for a few reasons.\n\nLarge transcripts often exceed context windows. Even when they fit, you’re dependent on external infrastructure, which can be problematic for sensitive meetings. Most importantly, you lose determinism: the same input can produce different outputs.\n\nI ended up treating the transcript like any other batch-processing problem.\n\nInstead of processing the full text in one go, the transcript is handled incrementally:\n\n- split into manageable chunks\n- each chunk summarized independently using a stable structure\n- clean intermediate results written out\n- a final aggregation pass over those intermediates to produce the high-level summary\n\nIn practical terms:\n\n- the model never sees the full transcript at once\n- context is controlled explicitly by the pipeline, not by a prompt window\n- intermediate structure is preserved instead of flattened\n- the final output is based on accumulated, cleaned data rather than raw text\n\nThis reframing changes the requirements completely.\n\nOne interesting side effect of this approach was realizing that model size stopped being a deciding factor altogether. Once the task is constrained and the workflow is explicit, even relatively small models perform reliably enough for this kind of summarization.\n\nOnce handled this way, transcript size stops being a concern. A small local model is sufficient, because it’s just one interchangeable component in a controlled pipeline. The value comes from explicit inputs, deterministic steps, and reproducible outputs, not from model size.\n\nThis runs entirely locally on a modest machine, no GPU, no cloud services.\n\nI’m curious how others here approach large meeting transcripts or similar unstructured text when the goal is a clean, deterministic result rather than maximal model capability.",

Wondering if anyone has some ideas for how to engineer this?\n\nHere’s my problem: I have gigabytes of LLM conversation logs in parquet in S3. I want to add per-row annotations (llm-as-a-judge scores), ideally without touching the original text data. \n\nSo for a given dataset, I want to add a new column. This seemed like a perfect use case for Iceberg. Iceberg does let you evolve the table schema, including adding a column. BUT you can only add a column with a default value. If I want to fill in that column with annotations, ICEBERG MAKES ME REWRITE EVERY ROW. So despite being based on parquet, a column-oriented format, I need to re-write the entire source text data (gigabytes of data) just to add \\~1mb of annotations. This feels wildly inefficient.\n\nI considered just storing the column in its own table and then joining them. This does work but the joins are annoying to work with, and I suspect query engines do not optimize well a \"join on row\\_number\" operation.\n\nI've been exploring using little-known features of parquet like the file\\_path field to store column data in external files. But literally zero parquet clients support this.\n\nI'm running out of ideas for how to work with this data efficiently.

Then have a secondary glue job that reads new parquet files and writes them to Iceberg tables. This can be done every 2 mins? Can I setup something like a microbatch glue job approach here for this?

A lot more boilerplate code compared to the configuration code above. Also not near real time, job needs to be scheduled. Need to see how to handle failures more visibly. \n\nWhile near real time would be ideal, 2-3 mins delay is ok for landing in bronze. Ordering is important.

This is necessary because there’s no last-modified field in the source tables and yet records can be updated up to 7–14 days after creation.\n\nThe target tables are partitioned by the business date, and I overwrite partitions on each run. This works in theory when extracting full days, but timezone conversion complicates things. When converting CST to UTC, some records shift into the next day, meaning a “full day” CST extract can become partial days in UTC, potentially overwriting partitions with incomplete data.\n\nI’m avoiding MERGE because there’s no reliable primary key and analysts want to keep duplicates (some are valid), so partition overwrites seem like the best option. Essentially I just want to clone the source tables into BigQuery.\n\nOne idea is to extract data as UTC midnight-to-midnight, but the only apparent option in the source is extracting as GMT Monrovia (which I think maps to UTC). This is what I’m edging towards, but not sure if extracting data in a different timezone to what it’s natively stored as is a recommended approach?\n\nCan someone please sanity check my approach and let me know if it’s a bad idea, or if I’m missing anything?",

The issues are most often resolved by just restarting the application.\n\n However task scheduler does not seem to be able to really \"read\" a task as failed even if I am returning error codes other than 0x0. Does anyone know how to fix this or are there alternatives which can handle these type of problems much better? \n\nThe main issue is that this process needs to run and in any case of problems we often had to monitor it really early in the morning and restart it by hand which is stupidly annoying.",

I have some previous experience with Python and plan on quickly up-skilling and implementing as much as I can within my current role through automation, using AWS SDK etc as well as making projects in my own time. My current role now involves managing Aurora as part of it, there’s also ‘ownership of data’ and everything that brings amongst our AWS deployments.\n\nI guess my current role is transitioning away from standard DBA things though I want to make more deliberate movements towards data engineering largely for financial reasons. I’m currently on about £75k, I have no plans to move at the moment but with the job market things can change and tomorrow my company could decide I am no longer needed. I’d like to do what I can to be in a position where I could pivot if needed without taking too much of a hit salary wise.\n\nObviously I’ve not given too much information,  but can you give an idea of the skills I ought to prioritise, things to focus on etc based on the above and if possible given an idea as to how well versed I need to be with them. e.g. with AWS is it a case of simply using EKS, MKS and being able to write functional python code or does it need to be super performant. Also is it realistic and achievable to pivot from DBA to Data Engineer on a salary of around £75k without too much of a reduction or am I being unrealistic?",

The idea is that some of our operators should be able to check things like how much revenue they’ve generated this month, how many clients they’ve converted, etc.\n\nAs you can imagine, we’re currently discussing the best way to bring Data Warehouse data back into the app. So far, for our first use case, we’ve built a data microservice that queries tables containing the KPIs. In this setup, the Data Warehouse almost acts like an API, providing the data that the dev team can then display on the frontend with full control over colors, layout, and whatever custom UX our designers come up with.\n\nHowever, looking ahead, we plan to add many more charts to the product. This made me wonder whether there are already solid embedded analytics tools that allow a high level of customization so the look and feel can match our app’s design patterns. On top of that, it seems much easier for a data team to develop and test a dashboard and then embed or share it inside the app, rather than producing multiple KPI tables and wiring all of that through the app’s backend.\n\nI’d be interested to hear how others have approached this and what tools or architectures have worked well for you.",

I am currently working on a small stored proc which would create files and upload them to an EXTERNAL stage.\n\nI am using python to do so. \n\nNow the problem I am facing is:\n\nI am currently using just a simple with open and create the txt file in the current directory, so for example if the job is run on a warehouse it'd be in warehouses memory. I move this file to an external stage using a put command.\n\nNow it all works fine but my manager wants this python script to run locally as well - we do our development locally in a repo.\n\n  \nI looked at alternatives which were for example put\\_stream, but none of the solutions would work in both local environment and when run on the warehouse. Some solutions wouldn't let me create a txt file.\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a solution to this problem? Has anyone faced a similar problem?\n\nThe key things is: the ouput has to be a TXT file and it is the EXERNAL stage I have to upload the files to.\n\n  \n",

Felt that I got in by sheer luck. \n\nAcademically, I’m not smart. I was generally a B-student back in CS college. But I did enjoy SWE mods like networks, distributed systems, or even learning algorithms. \n\nOver the past 3 years, my job has been rather chill and I don’t read outside of work. I didn’t learn much while doing frontend for 2 years - my code looks more or less the same because frontend frameworks are very abstracted at my company.\n\nNow that I’m in my 3rd year without promotion, I’ve been looking for jobs. I’m terrible at Leetcode, not good at systems design, my problem-solving skills aren’t great either so I’ve been failing interviews here and there. Sometimes I get frontend interviews, which will test JavaScript or React or even HTML/CSS, where each language/framework has a lot of concepts to learn about. \n\nI feel that there’s endless to study for and I’m fighting against a bar that is high but I can’t even see where it is.\n\nIt’s been demoralising. I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. \n\nI have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. \nBut it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.\n\nAs an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.\n\nI think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using. \n\nBut now I feel so exhausted just by the thought of studying. It feels endless. I feel that I’m a terrible engineer and that I’m paying the price of not working hard for the past few years. \n",

While I did pick up some new tools and workflows that school never taught me, I quickly felt like I was hitting a ceiling—just stuck in frameworks and endless CRUD missions. I wanted more.\n\nWhile looking for a way out, someone recommended **SICP** (the Wizard Book). They told me that just finishing the first three chapters would make me a good programmer, and finishing the exercises in the last two could make me a great one.\n\nI actually tried reading it in college a few times but gave up because it was tough and felt completely disconnected from what school was teaching. But about six months ago, I gave it another shot and started grinding through the exercises.\n\nI recently finished the first three chapters, and it honestly blew my mind. It gave me a whole new perspective on programming. But here's the catch: before the book, I wrote spaghetti code that \"just worked.\" Now... I’m painfully aware that I’m writing garbage, but I don't know where to start fixing it. (Honestly, I want to fire myself after realizing how terrible my code is.)\n\nThat's the problem. I feel like I've studied how to build the tools, but **in my current role**, I’m just expected to use them blindly. I have the vision now, but I lack the bridge between this high-level theory and my daily coding practice. What should I do next?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for good learning resources (books, articles, courses, videos, blog series, etc.) that focus on the *underlying mechanics of web development*, rather than on specific frameworks or how to write code. I’m currently working as a working student at a software company, and most of my day-to-day work is focused on implementing features and writing code. While this is valuable experience, I don’t really get the opportunity to deeply learn or reflect on the underlying concepts and mechanics of the web. The problem I see here is that there are things I dont even know about and I would I need a good overview about the things that they even exist, like a book for example. Of course, I could just google individual topics, but the problem is that I don’t always know *what* I should even be googling. That’s why a well-structured roadmap, book, or resource where the relevant information is collected and explained in a coherent way would be extremely helpful.\n\nBecause of that, I want to be very clear: I’m **not** looking for tutorials on JavaScript, CSS, HTML syntax, or how to use frameworks like React, Vue, etc. I already work with those technologies on a daily basis.\n\nWhat I’m interested in are topics like:\n\n* Authentication & authorization (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.)\n* Cookies, storage, and state management\n* Caching strategies (browser, CDN, server-side)\n* HTTP fundamentals and request/response lifecycle\n* Security concepts (CORS, CSP, CSRF, XSS, same-origin policy)\n* How browsers and servers actually interact\n* General web architecture and system design concepts\n\nI want to better understand *why* things work the way they do, not just *how* to implement them in a specific stack.\n\nIf you know any resources that explain these concepts well (beginner-friendly but not superficial is ideal), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I want to choose C or C++ over python. What I've found looking at a lot C++ vs Python first questions on this reddit is that, Python makes it easier to pick up programming in general, but if you're willing to take the harder start then it's way more beneficial to your long term understanding of coding to learn C/C++ first because your brain solidifies good traits that are really hard to relearn from python.\n\nIf any one has any comments on this specific parity that'd be cool. The formatting of Python also seems to be a cheat that isn't as healthy as having your base reference in C/C++'s symbolic referencing over indentation.\n\nMy real question because it does seem C style is better for long term than python first and I intend to learn both, is it best to learn C or C++? It appears C and Python are around the same learning time and C++ is way longer than learning C. Should I do C first then Python to get the benefits of understanding C style code with Python's greater utility and universal usage, or should I tough it out and do C++ , which I guess is extended C, then Python? So essentially my perspective is C is much shorter and faster to learn, but C++ has much more use case, despite the fact they both equally prime you for more \"close to the metal\" thought than high abstract languages like python, what's more worth it first?\n\nThank you\n\nTLDR; I think the first impression and perspective solidifying advantages of C and C++ beats the ease of introduction with Python for first language, thoughts?

I've done this several times to pass arrays of different lengths into general purpose functions (along with their lengths) for software that I've written, but although I thought I had a grasp on the inner workings, I've found I'm unable to fully explain what's going on.\n\nHere's my understanding, using a simple example. \n\n    #include <iostream>\n    \n    using std::cout;\n    \n    float averageScores(float* scores, int length) \n    {\n        float sum;\n       \n        for (int i=0; i<length; i++)\n        {\n            sum = sum + scores[i];\n        }\n        float average = sum/length;\n        return average;\n    }\n    \n    \n    int main()\n    {\n        float testScores [] = {81.2, 90, 91.8, 76.3, 78.4};\n        int numScores = sizeof(testScores)/sizeof(testScores[0]);\n        float classAverage = averageScores(testScores, numScores);\n        cout<<classAverage;\n        return 0;\n    } \n\nMight not be the most efficient way to do this but you get the idea. What I've done is passed an array of test scores into a function that calculates their average. However, to my understanding, when I declare an array variable, it's actually interpreted as something like &testScores\\[0\\], or the memory location of the first float variable in testScores. \n\nFirst question: the entire array is stored at that memory location, correct? So if the memory location is something like 0x5ffe60, that's where the entire array is stored?\n\nNow, in my function I have declared the parameters float\\* scores and int length. float\\* scores is a pointer. So, this to me seems like creating a pointer to a memory address, similar to the classic example folks usually show when discussing pointers:\n\nint x = 6;  \nint \\*pX = \\&x;\n\nWhere pX is a pointer to the memory location at which the value of x is stored. So, similarly, it seems that \n\nfloat \\*scores = &testScores\\[0\\].\n\nNow, my ultimate question: given that C++ is particular about variable types matching, does this mean that &x and &testScores\\[0\\] are \"pointer types?\" Like, \\* and & are just inverses of the same variable type, and that's why I can write a function that expects a pointer and pass it a memory address.\n\nSo both \\*scores and &testScores\\[0\\] are float\\* numbers? \n\nI think I'm missing something because my explanation feels inconsistent. If anyone could clarify what I have right and wrong about this, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

As much as I hate to admit it, I am overreliant on AI and wanting to break that habit. So, I've taken the time to set up Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi, changed the web interface password to a randomly generated string and blocked most chatbot websites (ChatGPT, Claude, etc), and also setup blocking via browser extensions. That's a discussion I'm sure all of you have heard so I won't say anymore about that.\n\nI am posting because I really struggle with ideas for projects that can actually teach me something. Sure, a todo app can teach me something but I want something practical and that I (or other people) can use. I also struggle with planning/designing the projects so I am looking for help on that as well. \n\nI do have an example of a practical project I want to finish that I've been working on, but I am really struggling with breaking it down into manageable parts. I am a music producer that posts my type beats on YouTube and Beatstars (beat selling website), and I found that uploading things is starting to become increasingly annoying as I need to click through a ton of menus and upload files and such, so I wanted to streamline that. The idea is a desktop GUI app that uses web automation to upload to Beatstars, and then Google's API for uploading to Youtube. \n\n  \nWhat I've done so far is defined Pydantic types (I'm using Python) and started work on a setup wizard screen, but I feel like feature creep is really hitting hard so I wanted to step back and plan more. Any tips?\n\n",

My main issue is how we learn stuff and the testing model. In classes like Calculus, electronics, or physics, you can add more, it feels like we just memorize algorithms to solve questions. I can learn the 'why' from external sources, for example books or Prof.Leonard for calculus but at uni, if you solve 100 past years questions or questions from books, you still can get a good grade, without truly knowing the material. This means that you cannot solve a different kind of problem that involves the integral that you learned 1 week ago and passed the exam, because you didn't understand what you doing, just memorize algorithm.\n\nI have many friends, even when they got a good grade, they still lack an understanding. I don't want to be same but what's point?  \nAm I right to feel this way or I'm being ignorant?  \nSorry for long post and bad english.\n\n**TL;DR:** University exams feel like testing memorized solution patterns  rather than deep conceptual understanding.

I’ve been building apps at work (mostly power apps, power automate - but learning Python made learning these EASY) and my database is now active. I’ve also built standalone tools with Python at work that are being used. \n\nI’ve got no formal education in technology. But I clearly understand the concepts that have been introduced to me. I find myself now gravitating towards a career in technology. I could do this all day. Managing people is great when things are going well but……there’s downsides. \n\nI guess I’m wondering what I should learn next to level up and make me valuable to a software development company? I’d even do simple things as a side hustle to level up my experience. \n\nMy journey so far is Python (object oriented programming, pyqt -> still learning), sql, JSON, html. Where would an experienced professional tell me to research next?\n\n",

        "content": "As a 3rd-year college student, I’ve participated in many hackathons, especially in Kolkata, where there are a lot of great hackathon events happening. I try to take part in almost every opportunity I get.\n\nThe biggest benefit for me has been the exposure. You meet new people, work with different teams, and learn new things beyond regular classroom coding. Hackathons improve not just coding skills, but also communication, collaboration, and networking. You also get to know about new platforms, tools, and technologies, which is really helpful. What makes hackathons exciting is the experience of solving a real-world problem within a limited time — whether it’s a 24-hour or 36-hour hackathon. Thinking of an idea, building a solution from scratch, and implementing it under pressure is challenging but incredibly fun and rewarding.\n\nOverall, the experience is top-notch and honestly enjoyable. I personally recommend college students to participate in hackathons along with their regular studies. They help improve coding knowledge, problem-solving skills, creative thinking, and even leadership skills.\n\nFor me, hackathons have been one of the most valuable parts of my college journey.",

        "content": "Hello everyone! Been lurking around, haven't posted though.\n\nI've been wondering about my career and its direction for about a year at least and I felt that's it would be good to share and ask for advice and opinions.\n\nSome background.\n\nI'm a programmer with about ten years of experience. I come from a math background. Never completed my uni studies but I was fortunate enough to build somegood foundations that helped a ton in programming. \n\nProgramming for me was also my only hobby for most of the last decade. Read many books, tried many tools and languages. Had tons of fun on many late nights home.\n\nRecent two years the excitement dropped off and I've been enjoying non programing stuff a lot. I've organically ended up doing team lead/tech lead stuff for the last five years and I've accustomed to that. My job is primarily reviewing, mentoring, planning and estimating effort.\n\nDue to the recent advancements in AI I've started feeling the heat. It seems to me that much of the toolset that used to make us competent as programmers is fading away. Now, as a team lead/tech lead I feel that I do a good job exactly because I've spent so many hours fiddling with stuff from many different angles. But in the age of AI I have much less consifidence in my ability to reasons about those genai system that I think we'll be dealing with in the upcoming years.\n\nI've tried to move to areas of game development and design, graphics programming but I gave up after a while. I did not feel the urge to pursue and do what it takes to jump to another field. \n\nRight now I'm asked to design systems based on AI which, I don't feel equipped to do.\n\nAnd even though I know that I'm through a burnout for about three years now, I appreciatey job. I appreciate how it has transformed my life and I've seen able to do and own things I never would have if I did not spend so much time studying cs and programming. \n\nThis is why I decided to create a self made curriculum of data science, machine learning, deep learning and finally genai in order get myself familiarize with those concepts. This is something that's I evaluate to take at least a year. I think that if I am to continue managing development teams and since I seems to a place in our toolset, I think it makes sense. I feel it would boost my abilities and therefore my confidence in order to continue doing a good job.\n\nI don't feel like I'm going to definitely lose my job to AI. But I feel like that if I don't expand my knowledge in any way, I leave it to chance. I don't know if I'm maybe too pessimistic about this, but my gut call is saying that it's to re evaluate some things and it's time to be proactive again.\n\nThought I'd share with you, I expect that many might have somewhat similar thoughts, with all this ai madness going around constantly. Would really like to read your experiences and point of view. ",

My background isn't technical although I work for a software company where people are nice and usually happy to answer noob questions when they have the time. \n\nOver the years, I have learned some basics: Very basic Java and C++, what logic gates are, been messing around with Arduino, breadboards and chips, binary numbers, algebra and a bit of precalculus. But whatever information I have gathered seem pretty trivial and overall I feel like I don't \"get it\".\n\nRecently someone recommended that I start from the basics again and just focus on one gate per month before I go any further: write the truth table, the HDL description for that gate, and what the gate is made of (for example an OR gate is two NOT and one NAND gates) every day of the month and then do the same for the next gate the following month, until I have covered all the gates. The goal being that this becomes \"automatic\" for me.\n\nI am 38 and want to learn out of interest/hobby although part of me is secretly hoping to either make a bit of money with it in the future or even a new career. But I'm not in a rush and willing to take the time to make sure I understand what I'm doing.\n\nWhat's your take on the recommendation that was given to me?

I have significant free time in the office and on weekends. I feel stagnated and want to use this time to upskill, but I’m paralyzed by choice.\n\nThe Options: I am confused between these 5 very different paths.\n1. Deep Dive into Company Legacy Code: I have access to the main production codebase. The Catch: It’s written in a non-intuitive, non-standard way. Is it worth struggling through the code base to understand the domain?\n2. Certifications (MongoDB & AWS): Since I work with Mongo heavily, should I aim for the Developer/Data Modeling certs and add AWS to the mix? Do these actually hold value for a junior dev in the current market?\n3. DSA & System Design: Ignore the current work tech stack and just grind LeetCode/LLD/HLD.\n4. Ride the AI Wave: Learn LLMs, RAG, and build AI projects to stay relevant, even though my current job is purely traditional backend.\n5. Content Creation: Start documenting my journey/coding tips on LinkedIn/Twitter/YouTube. Does building a personal brand actually help with career growth, or is it a distraction?\n\nQuestion: If you could go back to being a fresher with free time, which combination of these would you pick?",

Now all new hires are Indians. Obviously, I don’t care. The timings help me.\n\nAnd I can pinpoint exactly when this shift happened. A new Director was hired from a WITCH company and suggested offshoring. He’s just pushing sprint after sprint with no overall goal or idea from top to bottom. We are making useless products and being overworked for basically nothing.\n\nWhen this happens, it particularly sucks more for the US employees since they have less leverage due to much higher salaries.\n\nWhen you see this trend, run. Although, the offshore engineers are amazing. The issue is when they only want offshore engineers and not the best ones. They have a plan ahead for their own selfish benefits. It doesn’t help the company.\n\nPS - We didn’t even get Christmas week off \n\nEdit - Addition",

I am just cruising on the work of others and I feel like I have lost all interest, or forgotten everything I have learnt. My motivation is dead, every day I am on some calls, fix some small bugs and do some PR reviews which also I rarely read through.\n\nI thought it was burnout and took a 2 weeks break, but came back to the same empty feeling that I am just existing at this place, the joy I had when I first joined is dead.\n\nIt's a nice remote job, they pay on time and given the market right now, I am in a pretty comfortable position. I have tried interviewing at other places in hopes that maybe a new environment will help me, but I rarely prepare for them either, which means I fail them constantly then just stop giving anything a shot. \n\nAdd to the fact that coding agents are quickly catching on, some days I just use it to do my work, I feel like a fraud and don't know if I should continue down this path, or try to learn something new, maybe some other stack or completely distance myself from programming.\n\nHas anyone been in similar situations?

I had a great 3 months and got strong incline and got told I was the best intern they had and built good connections with the team i would return to, but I guess wlb is the big con\n\n\\- I reneged a Warner Bros. Discovery (HBO Max) (NYC) SWE return earlier for Bloomberg.\n\nUpcoming interviews:\n\n\\- Google SWE final (on site beginning of january): worried about team matching and timeline uncertainty I heard it takes forever.\n\n\\- Meta Production Engineering (PE) interviews in a week or so, not sure if PE aligns with my long term goals, so not sure if i should do the interviews\n\nI was able to get a sense of the bad Esh work life balance this fall at AWS, even though I had a great 3 months and was raised constantly for the work I was doing, it was a lot of work I owned a lot more than a “project” and seen the other full timers around me (was there during reinvent times which are known to be most stessful). I know it is better career growth and I would learn more than if I was at Bloomberg which is why I am considering it, but would love any advice from people at Bloomberg or know in general about the company. Sage maker is pretty secure no one gets affected from lay offs but thats just in the present, BB is known for way better security. Also should I still do the meta interviews which seems to be a long process and I am pretty happy with aws/bb or google if it happens. Also heard meta isnt the most secure. Thanks a lot in advance!",

Overall the search went much better than last time. With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.\n\nA few clarifying points about my labels:\n\n* \"Reached out to my network\" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.\n* \"AI agent applied for me\": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).\n* \"Withdrew after accepting other offer\": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the \"Declined\" label after \"Offer\".\n\nI've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.\n\nMy offers:\n\nSeries A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon\n-------------------|--------------------|------\naccepted | declined | declined\n$205k base | $200k base | $188k base\nno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonus\nOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)\n2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-Fri\n\nSome quick stats from the Sankey:\n\n* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)\n* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)\n* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.\n* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...\n* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had \"AI\" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.\n\nOverall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",

        "author": "MarathonMarathon",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm soon to become one of those \"unemployed CS majors\" everyone keeps talking about once I graduate. I've been struggling to find meaningful employment, and don't have a job lined up. The way things are currently heading, after graduation I'm likely just heading back to my mom's house and maybe working some shitty retail job with 0 upward mobility. This is a future some people (including some friends) from my high school have achieved without attending college, and if that's my future, it means my mom will have wasted 4 years on an expensive degree that ended up being worthless.\n\nI'm well aware that it only gets harder and harder to find a full-time job the longer you wait after graduating. Which is why I'm frightened of being jobless or underemployed once that happens, and then having an awkward gap in my resume to have to explain, which only gets more and more awkward the longer I wait.\n\nThe roles I've been applying to include SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science. While my undergraduate internship grinds have been very hit-or-miss, I have some \"roundabout\" experience (multiple unpaid internships + paid research) on my resume, some of it ongoing (and my performance there has been satisfactory), which I've been told is enough to land me interviews, which I have. It's just that I've been struggling to pass these interviews. I've known people who've managed to hand-wave themselves in through interviews just by talking a bit, but I've somehow failed even one of those when given one (though that was partially my fault since my reference waved me through without even giving me the JD).\n\nMy clear metric for \"success\" is having enough money to *be able to* move away from home and afford a non-shitty apartment if I wanted to (and in the event I don't, it'll be because the job is in my metro area, aka NYC). If I don't achieve this, I'll have failed. I wouldn't say I'm asking for much, and I feel like this is a quite reasonably low bar to clear, and if I don't clear it, I'm a failure.\n\nNow that it's Christmas already and I still don't have any kind of post-college offer in hand, things are not looking up. I've barely applied to any positions between Thanksgiving and Christmas and have secured 0 new interviews therein. I barely even grind Leetcode anymore, since it just makes me disappointed whenever I fail questions that are supposedly \"Easy\" or \"Medium\". If you gave me a Leetcode-style interview or OA right now, I'd probably fail it. I've yet to actually receive such an *interview* (OAs I have, with mixed performance), but I'm well aware that many companies do ask them. A lot of what I've failed so far is behavioral, though I've passed a few.\n\nI've received mixed messaging on whether to consider grad school. My parents aren't going to pay for it and I'll have to take out expensive loans if I do go for it. And I know cheap online programs like OMSCS exist, but I don't know if they're right or if it'll be too challenging, and I'm not even sure if it's something I'm seriously invested in either. The whole field just seems like a sinking ship with AI and all, and people seem to be right about there being no need to hire any more juniors.\n\nI just want to know what to do, because things seem absolutely grim, and people who've been through 2008 keep calling me entitled and telling me that the job market now isn't nearly as bad as 2008. Keep doing what I'm doing and hope something lands? But if nothing lands, what then? Certmaxx and pivot to IT? Push boxes in some Amazon warehouse alongside people without college degrees, rendering the degree worthless?",

However, in CS subreddits like this one or r/csmajors and just basically every career subreddit, it's highly recommended to do EE instead, but why? Are their prospects that much better? I mean, the pay seems more using BLS data; HWE makes 155k, which is 20k more than SWE, but that's not that big of a difference, for such a big sway, and they both need internships.",

I have no idea.\n\nBasically I got into the field 8 years ago and have worked at 3 different places and nothing that I've ever worked on, nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on, has ever had any real impact. And by impact, at the end of the day, one could say I mean money. Nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on has ever helped anyone and in turn made money. Simultaneously, every project, every product I have ever worked on was heavily overstaffed and with extreme food envy among developers.\n\nIs there anyone out there that actually works on something that people need? Is there any project out there that actually needs me?\n\nI've been interviewing for over a year now too and I ask the interviewers:\n\n\\- \"What are you working on?\"\n\n\\- \"Why are you hiring for this role?\"\n\nNobody can answer these questions. It's always some hand wavy explanation. You know, the kind you usually get from people lying about their resume. \"Oh this and that bla bla...\"\n\nAt the same time, as we all know, life has gotten so expensive that, at least I, personally, cannot really say \"Oh I will just do this job and in 5-10 years I can buy a house or something.\" Because I cannot. Where I live houses now go for about 20x - 30x the local average yearly income. I just don't know what I'm doing with my life here.\n\nNot that it ever really mattered to me anyhow. I don't really want to own a home. I got into this field, because I wanted to build something that helps people, that makes their lives easier or more enjoyable. Something that is valuable, that creates value. What I've seen instead is that we are our own stakeholders. We build for ourselves. Just to keep things going.\n\nIt's literally the hamster wheel pop culture has warned me about.",

        "content": "I’m trying to break into tech, and given how difficult the job market is right now, I keep wondering why more people aren’t trying to build things together instead of endlessly waiting for opportunities.\n\nMy background is a bit non-traditional. I have an education and basic proficiency in software engineering, but I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in transportation and diesel mechanic environments. In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers. From the outside, it feels like there are real opportunities for software to improve productivity in industries that aren’t “tech-native.”\n\nI have an app idea based on problems I’ve personally dealt with, but it’s too ambitious for me to realistically build alone. In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often? Why do so many people, especially those trying to break into tech, stick to LeetCode, personal projects, and the job application grind instead of collaborating to build products that solve real problems and potentially create their own jobs?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAs someone trying to break into tech, I don’t understand why more people keep grinding interviews instead of teaming up to build software that solves real problems in non-tech industries and potentially creates their own jobs?",

Between tech layoffs, market saturation, and the rapid rise of AI, it’s hard not to feel anxious about the future of this field.\n\nLuckily, I’m still a freshman, so if shifting to another degree would truly offer better job security and a more stable income, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I genuinely love tech. I can see myself studying and working in this field long-term because of how vast and interesting it is. But we also can’t deny reality: the industry feels oversaturated, entry-level roles are extremely competitive, and the barrier to entry is relatively low. Anyone who self-studies can technically enter the field (even if they don’t have the same depth as someone who studied CS formally), and that definitely affects competition.\n\n\nSo my question is this:\nIf you were in college right now, still studying CS and not yet graduated, would you consider shifting to a traditional engineering degree instead?\n\nI’m talking about fields like:\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nElectronics Engineering\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nCivil Engineering\n\nDo these degrees actually offer better long-term job security compared to CS today? Or is the grass just greener on the other side?\n\nPS: I know some people will say, “If you’re doubting CS, then it’s not for you,” or that those who truly grind will succeed—or that this is just a way to reduce competition. That’s not my intent. I’m just trying to be realistic and pragmatic. I still see myself pursuing CS, but I want honest perspectives before it’s too late to pivot.\n\nWould really appreciate your thoughts.",

        "content": "I joined Walmart Global Tech India based on an offer letter where RSUs were explicitly part of my compensation. Stock was discussed, documented, and factored into the target total pay used to justify the offer.\n\nAfter onboarding, Walmart quietly rolled out a new compensation letter saying they’ve moved to a “globally aligned stock framework.” What this actually means in practice:\n\nStock is no longer percentage-based\n\nAnnual RSUs for my level are now effectively zero\n\nTarget total compensation is reduced, without touching base or bonus\n\nRSUs that were part of the hiring pitch are simply gone\n\nTo soften the blow, they mention a possible “one-time transition equity grant”, but:\n\nThe new fixed stock amount by level is not disclosed\n\nThe transition grant is discretionary\n\nThere’s no clarity on whether it’s meaningful or just optics\n\nFuture annual stock is not guaranteed at all\n\nSo let’s call this what it is:\n\nRSUs were used to attract candidates\n\nOnce people joined, the structure was changed\n\nThe impact is framed as “global standardization” instead of what it really is a comp cut\n\nYes, the fine print says stock is discretionary. But using total compensation numbers to hire, then removing a major component post-joining, is at best misleading and at worst a deliberate bait-and-switch.\n\nThis has nothing to do with:\n\nPerformance  \nRole change  \nLevel change\n\nIt’s purely a policy change that benefits the company at the expense of employees who already joined.\n\nPosting this for visibility because these “global alignment” narratives are increasingly being used to quietly roll back compensation after offers are accepted.\n\nHas anyone else at Walmart or other big tech seen RSUs removed after joining?\n\nIs this becoming the new normal in India under cost-control pushes?\n\nAny real leverage employees have in situations like this, or is the offer letter basically meaningless once you join?\n\n\n\nSharing for awareness. People deserve to know what they’re signing up for.",

Right now, I’m standardizing on one backend language (Java) and building projects using Spring Boot, while still using different tools and frameworks around it (databases, auth, cloud, frontend frameworks, etc.).\n\nI’ve heard that as long as your DSA and core CS fundamentals are strong, companies care less about exact stack alignment and more about your ability to reason about systems and pick up new tools.\n\nMy question is:\n\nIf I build solid full-stack projects using Java + Spring Boot on the backend, with modern frontend frameworks and strong DSA, is that generally sufficient to apply broadly to full-stack roles, even at companies using different backend languages?",

        "content": "Hi, I transfered into a computer science degree during covid. Even before AI, I think I was better at  taking computer science exams as opposed to coding. I was always better at debugging existing code and loved designing code on white board with people, but not writing it myself. On group projects it seemed like I was good at explaining things to people who could code better than me, and they would code it.  \n\nI don’t know what it is, but I don’t really like coding itself. I think I was so tired from my theoretical/math-heavy my degree was, I didn’t have the energy for projects. I don’t code unless prompted to by others. \n\nI did technical product internships in quantum and I tried really hard to “look successful technically” by starting a club around it. I build a huge network and got 2 internships (one FAANG, one not) out of it, but I just…never seem to code. I think I did this club partly out of embarrassment and because it was more meaningful to me to create opportunities for students bc it had real outcome. I also made it my whole personality. \n\nI then tried to do a “PhD” to make myself “better” but I just get lost with starting a project from scratch or actually wanting to do it. Everything I tried took me literally all day. Mastered out. I am not necessarily depressed, but I think my brain adjusted to existing in perpetual uncertainty while needing to do hard math I don’t want to everyday. \n\nI always enjoyed things doing a dog walking business or uber in college because of the minimal success/interest I experienced in programming. I did an entrepreneurship minor, and I always loved those courses. Working at front-desk jobs and TPM felt like the same skill set to me kinda, so I think I minimized “TPM” roles because it’s a “non-technically” impressive degree. \n\nI did try really hard to like coding/hard topics for so many years but like… I feel like my brain only does it for exams/assignments or to teach others. I would rather do not this at all if other things paid well. \n\nI now have two technical degrees, a CS and electrical engineering masters, but I feel like I have no skills bc all I did was math or people-oriented things.\n\nI have noticed all other areas of my life social life, hobbies, etc. just wither away  because I just sleep until I have to do something code related.\n\nI think right now, though my resume “looks impressive” the job market grind is a lot. I literally will just sleep in my car at a parking lot because I just don’t want to do leetcode or specific company prep. \n\nI think a lot of life goals like having friends, finding partner, climbing, having interest to do anything besides sleep have like withered in my mid-20s due to how much I forced this interest.\n\nThere’s a part of me that does think if I do get a nice paying CS job, I can save so much money and retire early due to how much I have minimized my other life needs\n\n\nWhat careers can I consider with my degrees that are more people-oriented, or what can I do to look marketable for TPM roles now. \n",

Especially for the stack I have experience with (Node.js), everything in Houston seems to be .NET. From what I'm seeing on linkedIn, there are like 3x the job postings in Austin as Houston despite having a way smaller population and more jobs that have the tech stack I am familiar with.\n\nThe only offers I seem to be able to get right now in Houston are typically remote jobs with some sort of significant catch like early-stage startups, or something weird like a company owned by private equity with really bad glass door reviews. Not really looking for that at the moment as I need a bit more stability... and health insurance. \n\nI know Austin has been going downhill for the past couple years and lots of jobs are leaving the city, but I'm not sure if it's gotten as bad as Houston yet.

I work at a pretty big company, and was working as a trainee before getting hired full time.\n\nI think I’m probably struggling with some self esteem / performance issues, and was wondering if someone has a similar experience.\n\nI work really hard, usually do overtime every week, try to overachieve constantly and am the youngest full time engineer my team has ever hired (21). In my performance review, my manager said that my performance is bench mark for others and he’s not able to find any areas for improvement. All in all I should be really happy.\n\nSo, even with all this considered, why do I still constantly fear that I will be fired and I am not performing? I feel like I’m overanalysing every interaction, thinking I am one mistake away from losing my job. Partly this is triggered because some of my fellow trainees and new hires were recently let go because of poor performance, and I am afraid I will end up like them. I’ve noticed it’s started to affect my sleep and happiness in general. I will think about buying something nice for myself for example, and immediately think (but do I deserve it, and what if I need this money in a month when I get fired).\n\nTo add to this even more, I live and work in Finland although I’m from the US. As in, I’m in a union and if I got fired, I know it would be a 4-6 month process with severance etc, but I still keep thinking I’ll suddenly be let go like in the US, and I keep reading horror stories online of young careers ending because of X and Y reason. I genuinely made one mistake last sprint where I fucked up an automation script and I genuinely thought I was getting fired over it for a week straight.\n\nSorry for the ramble, just feeling weird about my situation.",

The company has been around for about 7 years, ~20 people total, and only 3 developers:\n\n\n* One backend developer\n* One senior developer who is currently transitioning into a Customer Success role\n* And me\n\n\nBefore this job, I did a bootcamp and a lot of self-study, but I’m very aware that I’m still junior. I’m learning every day, but there’s a big gap between where I am technically and the level of responsibility and trust they’re giving me.\n\n\nThat said, the company has been incredibly supportive so far:\n\n\n* I asked for Frontend Masters access and they approved it\n* I asked to understand more about the business beyond pure frontend, and they gave me a project building JavaScript automations in Airtable, touching operations, product, inventory, etc.\n* I asked for regular time with the senior dev to review things together, and that was also approved\n\n\nFrom a support and trust point of view, I honestly couldn’t ask for more.\n\n\nThe company is very product-focused and mainly B2B. They sell hardware and services to other businesses, but they also have a SaaS product. Around 80% of customers actively use it and pay for it, yet there’s no clear long-term SaaS strategy or roadmap. It feels more like “it exists and works” than “this is a core growth engine.”\n\n\nHere’s where my internal conflict starts:\n\n\n* On one hand, I know I’m still junior and should probably focus on fundamentals, shipping solid frontend work, and not overthinking things.\n* On the other hand, I see a real opportunity here to grow the SaaS side of the business, help shape a more structured software team, and eventually take on more responsibility if things go well.\n* I’m interested in full-stack and system complexity, not just UI work, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself or become “the guy with ideas but weak execution.”\n\n\nSo my questions are mainly:\n\n\n* Is this a good environment for a junior dev to grow, or is the lack of senior technical leadership risky?\n* How would you balance learning deeply vs stepping up when the company clearly gives you room?\n* Should I focus narrowly on becoming a very solid frontend engineer first, or is it reasonable to also invest energy in understanding the business and SaaS side early on?\n* Any red flags or opportunities you see from the outside?\n\n\nI’m genuinely grateful for the chance I’ve been given, but I want to be intentional about how I grow and avoid making preventable mistakes.\n\n\nThanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read or respond.",

At 17, I built an ahead-of-time compiler for a Rust-like language with a complete frontend, a robust type checker handling traits and generics, a MIR system with monomorphization, and an LLVM backend generating cross-platform IR.\n\nVery recently, I’ve had an intense desire to learn math. I’ve already studied Calc 1–3, linear algebra (Axler is great btw), real analysis (baby rudin, abbott, fitzpatrick), abstract algebra (d&f, aluffi), and category theory, and this interest sharpened after reading Ahlfors' Complex Analysis starting in September, to the point that I'm now seriously considering majoring in it.\n\nMy mind has been flipping between studying math, CS, double majoring, or minoring in one. Given my extensive programming experience and familiarity with upper-level CS, I feel I’d rather spend college learning something I’m less proficient in (math). Double majoring in Math&CS might make it difficult to take all the math courses I want due to CS requirements, and I dislike entry CS courses like DSA that I likely can’t test out of.\n\nI don’t currently have job prospects (they keep changing), but I want to keep SWE jobs as an option after graduation, and I will 100% continue programming and building projects throughout college. If it helps in your consideration, I've been admitted to MIT and will likely commit there, and I might pursue a PhD afterward. My main question is whether majoring in math without a CS major/minor would be bad for SWE jobs given my experience and projects.\n\nEdit: I'll be majoring in pure math, not applied math that's nonsense.",

        "content": "I received a fully funded PhD scholarship in Mathematics. Originally, I applied for a PhD in Computer Science, but since the PI is affiliated with both departments, the scholarship was formally offered under Mathematics instead.\n\nMy main motivation for pursuing a PhD has always been industry research, not academia. I’m particularly interested in roles at places like DeepMind, FAIR, or smaller, niche AI research labs. From what I can tell, these positions typically expect a PhD in CS / ML (or very closely related fields), and a PhD in Mathematics does not seem to be the standard, or even explicitly listed, in most cases.\n\nI am not interested in becoming a professor. I see the PhD primarily as a means to access research-oriented industry roles, not as an academic career path in itself.\n\nThat said, there are several red flags that are making me hesitate:\n\n1. The PI is very new. I would be their second PhD student, and the first one is now a postdoc, still in academia.\n2. The PI has few publications, mostly in mathematics, and a very low h-index.\n3. The scholarship itself has some worrying conditions:\n   * Internships are not allowed.\n   * If I decide to leave the PhD early, they may require full reimbursement of the scholarship.\n\nThe internship restriction is especially concerning, since I want to move into industry research and not stay in academia.\n\nAt this point, the only reasons I still see for going forward are:\n\n1. Is it realistically possible to enter big tech / AI research labs without top-tier publications and without internships?\n2. Gaining research experience and living abroad.\n3. I genuinely find the research topic very interesting (I can share more details via DM; I’d prefer not to be too identifiable here).\n\nOne more important piece of context: I am already working as a software engineer, although with a very old tech stack and in a sector I don’t enjoy (defense). Because of this, an alternative plan would be to decline this scholarship, keep working for now, and apply again next year, which realistically might be my last chance, since I’m already 28.\n\nGiven all this:  \nWhat would you do in my position?

It was as though there was a big valley between:\n\n (intro to/ intermediate /advanced xyz programming language + intro to object oriented programming course structure  then getting into a specific software programming discipline such as \"intro to app development\" and being overwhelmed with the sheer amount of libraries and how exactly these tools are designed in order to implement anything. I had no idea how to reach the point to even just read the documentation and code from scratch without having to read half of the entire class  attributes while still confused.)\n\n  \nI felt insecure about this learning style and decided I would focus more on trying to study mathematics and computer science topics before college, an effort that just amounted to doing a bunch of practice problems and khan academy constantly as per my math teachers instruction.\n\nI wanted to be able to design programs and dissect pre-existing designs, to be able to understand research on algorithms if not to design my own, to explore future applications of CS research or at least to be a software engineer that could make something without relying on a tutorial with code to copy. \n\n  \nIn college I had to split my focus between biology, chemistry, anatomy, anthropology, discrete math, calculus, linear algebra, bioanthropology.. as you can see, a lot of topics required by my CS degree before I could even think about programming, yet pre-existing programming knowledge was expected and  in our CS classes our assignments would consist of fairly complicated 'real world projects' to implement the concepts we were learning but we never talked about any code in class. Most professors were laissez faire in defining how students should learn to program. \"Just code\" which made it hard to see why I was doing so poorly compared to other students.\n\nMy cohort consisted of:\n\n people who had parents who were in STEM/programmers  or very STEM oriented schools so they had learnt programming & CS a structured environment for so long they couldn't really define their curriculum beyond \"I just learnt it\" compared to me who just struggled on youtube & stackoverflow without any help.\n\npeople who were using GPT  & friends for all assignments and somehow getting away with it, but I didn't want to risk it and I had no friends either way. \n\n  \nPeople who seemed to make \"just  think of things you'd like to make, watch tutorials and ask questions\" work, but I still don't understand the specifics of how they learnt to dissect program design from tutorials without flailing around in the documentation taking notes on a dozen functions and variables that still don't tie together conceptually,  especially while dealing with schoolwork at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs professionals, how are students supposed to manage learning software engineering and computer science + other coursework independently?\n\n",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am currently a backend Java software engineer at a large bank, 3 yoe. I actually recently got promoted to senior but I don't really see it that way as I don't think I've learned much during my time here. Most deliverables are business/regulatory related and not much technological innovation or otherwise. For that reason, and to avoid stagnation, I've been doing OMSCS and have maintained a 4.0 so far. \n\nMy question is, since I am doing a master's anyway, and I feel like my technical skills could improve by working in big tech, would it be worthwhile to apply for internships? My undergrad was in physics so I didn't have any CS internships in undergrad and jumped more or less straight into the field. I don't mind quitting this job if it means I can transition into more technical companies and positions where I can learn a lot more.\n\nI know all levels of the SE field are super competitive but think that going the internship route may be the best option right now.\n\nThoughts? Has anyone else gone through a similar route?",

        "author": "Flamyngoo",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a full-stack software developer with around 4.5 years of experience, and I’ve been at my current company for a couple of years. Recently, the company has been expanding and hiring more IT roles, mainly software developers and project managers.\n\nOver the last months, I’ve been more and more involved in client meetings, discussing requirements, planning work, and coordinating what other developers should be doing. Our IT manager noticed this, as he was present in many of those meetings, and he recently offered me the option to fully transition into a Project Manager role.\n\nThe plan would be to stop recruiting an external PM, hire one additional developer instead, and have me move almost completely off coding (or at least do very little of it). I have about one to two weeks to decide whether I want to stay in a hybrid role with roughly 70% coding, or make a full transition to PM.\n\nI do enjoy the planning, organizing, and communication side of the work, but I’m not sure if I enjoy it more than coding in the long run. I’m also unsure how beneficial this move would be for my overall career. Is project management a good long-term path coming from a development background? If I end up not liking it, is it realistic to move back into a coding role later, or would that hurt my career?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve made a similar transition, or from anyone who’s seen this kind of move work out (or not) in practice. Thanks in advance for any advice.",

        "content": "I’m applying to full-stack/web SWE roles at a mix of big and mid-size tech companies (e.g. Amazon, Microsoft, Stripe, Coinbase, Shopify, Uber) and wanted to sanity-check my resume/project strategy.\n\nAll of my projects currently use the same core stack:\n\n* Backend: Python + FastAPI\n* Frontend: React + TypeScript\n* SQL database, auth, external APIs, cloud deployment\n\nThe projects themselves are intentionally different in the problems they solve and the engineering focus (e.g. data-heavy application, async/background processing, external API integrations, one AI-assisted feature). I’m prioritizing depth, clean design, and being able to clearly explain tradeoffs rather than learning many stacks superficially.\n\nMy question is not about whether I should learn more languages.\n\nI’m specifically wondering:\n\n* Is it generally acceptable to list a single main tech stack on a resume if all projects use it but demonstrate different problem domains and complexity?\n* For companies like the ones mentioned above, do recruiters/interviewers care more about stack diversity, or about project quality and engineering decisions?\n* At what point (if any) does repeating the same stack across projects become a negative for full-stack SWE roles?\n\nContext: first year student in Canada\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from people who’ve reviewed resumes or interviewed candidates.",
