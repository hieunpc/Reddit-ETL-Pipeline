Spent roughly 5 years at my current job, all with excellent reviews each year, survived the last round of layoffs, had my performance review which basically said don't make any thing and start putting process in place while the ceo just looked at me in disgust. So I'm thinking I'm pretty much on the way out as the company is planning to buy software that makes what I'm doing irrelevant (Has its own data warehouse, it's own way of loading data, etc).\n\nOur company is currently all on prem for work, so a big shared drive is our datalake, sql server is our database, and the best I've been able to do to improve/modernize things was to introduce Prefect for our orchestration, make my own libraries in python to make loading data easier, show the usages of PowerBI and Tableau and create a data warehouse that did what the company wanted to do, but now has decided was a waste of time.\n\nI've started go through the AWS Data Engineering Exam and Snowflake exams, and I have projects on Github that show the use of Amazon S3, Athena, and Glue, so I can at least point to those and say I have cloud experience that I've set up myself. I've been applying to jobs, but I usually get stopped where they are looking for cloud experience. \n\nI've been working with data for almost 20 years now, so I'm hoping my experience can help in terms of getting a job. Does anyone have any advice out there for how to get an in on cloud experience or what places look for with cloud experience? Would the certifications be enough?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.\n\nWhy am I potentially cooked?\n\nData stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. \n\nNow that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.\n\nI asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.\n\nI know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.\n\nI’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?\n\nTldr:\nAlmost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

        "content": "I was running some tests on OneLake the other day and I noticed that its performance is 20-30% worse than ADLS. \n\nThey have these 2 weird APIs under the hood: Redirect and Proxy. Redirect is only available to Fabric engines and likely is some internal library for translating OneLake paths to ADLS paths. Proxy is for everything else (including 3rd party engines) and is probably just as it sounds some additional compute layer to hide direct access to ADLS.\n\nI also think that there may be some caching on Fabric side which is only working for Fabric engines...\n\nMy scenario - run a query from Snowflake or Spark k8s against an Iceberg table on ADLS and on OneLake. The performance is not the same! OneLake is always worse especially for tables with lots of files...\n\nSo here is my fear - OneLake is not ADLS. It is NOT operating as open storage. It is operating as a premium storage for Fabric and a sub optimal storage for everything else...\n\nJust use ADLS then.. Yes, we do. But every time I chat with our Microsoft reps they are pushing and pushing me to use OneLake. I am concerned that one day they will just deprecate ADLS in favour of OneLake.\n\nLook Fabric might be decent if you love Power BI, but our business runs on 2 clouds. We have transactional workloads on both, and no way are we going to egress all that data to one cloud or another for analytics. Hence we primarily run an open stack and some multi cloud software like Snowflake.\n\nWhat is wrong with ADLS? Why. do they keep pushing to OneLake? Is this is the next lock-in?",

I've been working on an ETL project at work that involves moving data from one platform via an API to a SQL database using Python. I work on this project with a senior dev with 10+YOE.\n\nA lot of my work on this project feels like I'm reinventing the wheel. My senior dev strives for minimizing dependencies to not be tied to any package which makes sense to some extent, but we are only really using a standard API library and pyodbc. I don't really deal with any business logic and have been basically recreating an ORM from the ground up. And at times I feel like I'm writing C code, like checking for return codes and validating errors at the start of every single method and not utilizing exceptions. \n\nI don't mean to knock this senior dev in any way, he has a ton of experience and I have learned a lot about writing clean code, but there are some things that throw me off from what I read online about Python best practices. From what I read, it seems like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Prefect are popular frameworks for creating ETL solutions in Python. \n\nFrom experienced Python developers: is this approach — sticking to vanilla Python, minimizing dependencies, and using very defensive coding patterns — considered reasonable for ETL work? Or would adopting some standard frameworks be more typical in professional projects?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am seeing A LOT of discussion on AI and I feel nervous b/c I haven't quite integrated AI too much in my workflow yet. To be quite frank, I don't know how just yet - I am supposed to be wrapping up a task and moving onto a brand new project. My current task that I've worked on for some time now has been really all over the place - basically, I'm an analytics engineer and I create the datasets that go into dashboards for stakeholders. I work in a slightly niche scientific domain where the parameters of what I need weren't well described and the only way I know I'm looking at the right thing is eyeballing and seeing which parameter is the one that makes the most sense per the stakeholders ask. The issue I am currently dealing with is our data warehouse went through an upgrade and not all the data I need is there - so I have to sometimes use data from the raw data files. And in those files, I have to go through 2 or 3 and find the parameter by eyeballing b/c I don't know the exact name of the field, but can tell what is the right one by looking at it. Also, how we actually want to use and transform those parameters is constantly changing per stakeholders request. There's just a lot of vagueness in this process that is difficult to be clear with a prompt. \n\nWriting code isn't really the hard part for me (with this work in particular) and so far, I use genAI (my work gives access to GPT-5) to help me debug if something is wrong or give me a better solution to what I'm doing, which it gives me a good answer I'd say 6/10 times. I'm seeing people discuss Claude to an extent they are no longer doing anything technical at all really, just prompting. Is this really is for people's work these days? I feel behind because I use AI very sparingly and haven't touched Claude yet. I'm planning to try it out but idk what is hype or real anymore, on LinkedIn people are teaching vibe coding courses and it's like being made to feel anybody can be an engineer now, no technical skills needed. Or the narrative if you're not using AI, you are going to become irrelevant. It's honestly making me nervous about how to move forward in my career or what to do anymore really. ",

We did a poc with Fabric, but it did not really meet our need, on the following points:\n\n\\- GovCloud. Majority of the services of Fabric are still not in GCC, so commercial was the choice of poc for us. But the transition of couple of lakehouses from Synapse to the Fabric was really painful. Also, the pricing model is very ambiguous. For example, if we need powerbi premium licenses, how Fabric handles that? \n\n\\- Lakehouse Explorer does not supportfor OneLake security RW permissions. RBAC also not mature for row level security.\n\n\\- Capacity based model lead to vety unpredictable costing, and Microsoft reps were unable to provide good answers,\n\nSo we are looking to Databricks, and Snowflake. I am very curious to know thought and experiences for you'll for these platforms. To my limited toe-dipping Databricks environments, it is very well suited for lakehouse. Snowflake, not so. Do you agree with this?\n\nHow Databricks handles govcloud situations? Do they have mature services in govcloud? How is their pricing model compared to Fabric, and Snowflake?\n\nManagement is very interested in my opinion as a data engineer, and also values whatever I will decide for the long run.

        "author": "danielgafni",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "My name is Daniel, and I'm an ML Ops engineer at [Anam](https://anam.ai).\n\nAt [Anam](https://anam.ai), we are making a platform for building real-time interactive avatars. One of the key components powering our product is our own video generation model.\n\nWe train it on custom training datasets that require all sorts of pre-processing of video and audio data. We extract embeddings with ML models, use external APIs for annotation and data synthesis, and so on. \n\nWe encountered significant challenges with implementing efficient and versatile sample-level versioning (or caching) for these pipelines, which led us to develop and open-source [Metaxy](https://metaxy.io): the framework that solves metadata management and **sample-level versioning** for multimodal data pipelines.\n\n[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) sits in between high level orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io)) that usually operate at table level and low-level processing engines (such as [Ray](https://ray.io)), passing the exact set of samples that have to be (re) computed to the processing layer and *not a sample more*.\n\n\n## Background\n\nWhen a traditional (tabular) data pipeline gets re-executed, it typically doesn't cost much. Multimodal pipelines are a whole different beast. They require a few orders of magnitude more compute, data movement and AI tokens spent. Accidentally re-executed your Whisper voice transcription step on the whole dataset? Congratulations: $10k just wasted!\n\nThat's why with multimodal pipelines, implementing incremental approaches is a requirement rather than an option. And it turns out, it's damn complicated.\n\n## Introducing Metaxy\n\n[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) is the missing piece connecting traditional orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)) that usually operate at a high level (e.g., updating tables) with the sample-level world of multimodal pipelines.\n\nMetaxy has two features that make it unique:\n\n1. It is able to track partial data updates.\n\n2. It is agnostic to infrastructure and can be plugged into any data pipeline written in Python.\n\nMetaxy's versioning engine:\n\n- operates in batches, easily scaling to millions of rows at a time.\n\n- runs in a powerful remote database or locally with Polars or DuckDB.\n\n- is agnostic to dataframe engines or DBs.\n\n- is aware of *data fields*: Metaxy tracks a dictionary of versions for each sample.\n\nWe have been dogfooding Metaxy at Anam since December 2025. We are running millions of samples through Metaxy. All the current Metaxy functionality has been built for our data pipeline and is used there.\n\n### AI Disclaimer\n\nMetaxy has been developed with the help of AI tooling (mostly Claude Code). However, it should not be considered a vibe-coded project: the core design ideas are human, AI code has been ruthlessly reviewed, we run a very comprehensive test suite with 85% coverage, all the docs have been hand-written (seriously, I hate AI docs), and /u/danielgafni has been working with multimodal pipelines for three years before making Metaxy. A great deal of effort and passion went into Metaxy, especially into user-facing parts and the docs.\n\n## More on Metaxy\n\nRead our [blog post](https://anam.ai/blog/metaxy), [Dagster + Metaxy blog post](https://dagster.io/blog/building-real-time-interactive-avatars-with-metaxy), Metaxy [docs](https://docs.metaxy.io/), and `uv pip install metaxy`!\n\nWe are thrilled to help more users solve their metadata management problems with Metaxy. Please do not hesitate to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/anam-org/metaxy)!",

For our own SQL engine (Floe), we needed stable, reusable statistics and relational metadata to support predictable planning over Iceberg and Delta. Floe will be available later this year, but Floecat is designed to be engine-agnostic.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, I wrote more about the motivation and design here: https://floedb.ai/blog/introducing-floecat-a-catalog-of-catalogs-for-the-modern-lakehouse\n\nFeedback is very welcome, especially from folks who’ve struggled with planning, stats, or metadata across multiple lakehouse catalogs.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm the CTO at Floe.",

LanceDB is an open source, embedded library that exposes convenient APIs on top of the Lance format to manage embeddings and indices.\n\nCheck out the latest Lance datasets uploaded by the awesome OSS community here:\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance\n\nWhat the Hugging Face integration means in practice for Lance format and LanceDB users on the Hub:\n- Binary assets (images, audio, videos) stored inline as blobs: No external files and pointers to manage\n- Efficient columnar access: Directly stream metadata from the Hub without touching heavier data (like videos) for fast exploration\n- Prebuilt indices can be shared alongside the data: Vector/FTS/scalar indices are packaged with the dataset, so no need to redo the work already done by others\n- Fast random access and scans: Lance format specializes in blazing fast random access (helps with vector search and data shuffles for training). It does so without compromising scan performance, so your large analytical queries can be run on traditional tabular data using engines like DuckDB, Spark, Ray, Trino, etc.\n\nEarlier, to share large multimodal datasets, you had to store multiple directories with binary assets + pointer URLs to the large blobs in your Parquet tables on the Hub. Once downloaded, as a user, you'd have had to recreate any vector/FTS indices on your local machine, which can be an expensive process.\n\nNow, with Lance officially supported as a format on the Hub, you can package all your datasets along with their indices as a single, shareable artifact, with familiar table semantics that work with your favourite query engine. Reuse others' work, and prepare your models for training, search and analytics/RAG with ease!\n\nIt's very exciting to see the variety of Lance datasets that people [have uploaded](https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance) already on the HF Hub, feel free to share your own, and spread the word!",

        "content": "Most data engineering stacks are optimised for batch and scale. That’s fine until you actually need low-latency analytics, live dashboards, or fast iteration on streaming data - then you’re suddenly standing up Flink, renting beefy cloud instances, or duct-taping together tools that were never designed for the job. Even worse - you go to push it into Databricks that you are paying 20k a month for and it doesn’t really stream. Mate.\n\nI kept running into this, so I’ve been building [Minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow) \\- a fast, minimal columnar data library that’s wire-compatible with Apache Arrow but purpose-built to run efficiently on a single machine.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Core data building block paired with “*SIMD-Kernels*” crate -> delivers sub-second aggregations on laptop-class hardware - no cluster, no JVM/Java OOM, no orchestrator\n* Drives live dashboards directly from streaming data without an intermediate warehouse or materialised view layer (you and/or your mate Claude still need to wire it up yourself)\n* Converts to Arrow, Polars, or PyArrow at the boundary via zero-copy, so it slots into existing ecosystems without serialisation overhead *(.to\\\\\\_polars() in Rust)*\n* Pairs with a companion crate (*Lightstream*) if you want to push results straight to the browser over WebSocket\n\n**Where it fits** *(and where it doesn’t):*\n\nThis sits at pipeline as code, or the engine-internals level. It’s a building block for engineers who are comfortable constructing pipelines and systems, not a plug-and-play BI tool. If your workload is distributed and you genuinely need horizontal scale, keep using Spark/Flink - Minarrow won’t replace that.\n\nBut if you’re in the zone - and prefer compiling for performance, and working with the blocks you need, this is the layer I wanted to exist and couldn’t find.\n\nHappy to answer questions, take criticism, or hear what you feel you’ve actually been missing in your stack.\n\nAlso, if you’ve focused more on the Python side happy to help point you into Rust land.\n\nThanks for checking it out.",

Nodes need shared state like sessions, user creds, quotas, and proxy pool data.\n\na. My current proposal is: each node talks only to a central internal API using a node key. That API handles all reads/writes to Redis/DB. This gives me tighter control over node onboarding, revocation, and limits blast radius if a node is ever compromised. It also avoids putting datastore credentials on every node.\n\nb. An alternative design (suggested by an LLM during architecture exploration) is letting every node connect directly to Redis for hot-path data (sessions, quotas, counters) and use it as the shared state layer, skipping the API hop. -- i didn't like the idea too much but the LLM kept defending it every time so maybe i am missin something!?! \n\nI’m trying to decide which pattern is more appropriate in practice for systems like gateways/proxies/workers: direct datastore access from each node, or API-mediated access only.\n\nWould like feedback from people who’ve run distributed production systems.",

        "content": "Hi. Question about production access. Does your organization allow users/developers who are not admins or in IT access to run their pipelines in production? Meaning they developed it but maybe IT provided the platform such as Airflow, nifi, etc. To run it.  If they can’t run it do they have production access but just more restricted? Like read access so that they can debug why a pipeline failed and push changes without have to ask someone to send them the logs for them to see what happened.\n\nI’m asking this since right now I’m in an org where there are a few platforms but the two biggest don’t allow anyone outside their 2-5 person teams access to it. Essentially developers are expected to build pipelines and hand them off and that’s it. No view into prod anything.   The reasoning by those admins is that developers don’t need to see prod and it’s keeps their environment secure. They will monitor and notify us if something goes wrong.  I think this is dumb honestly as in my opinion that if you can’t grant people production access and keep it secure at the same time your environment is not as good as you think.  I also think that developers need prod access if they are an engineer. At minimum I think they should have read access so that they can easy see how their pipelines are performing and debug if needed.  The environments and nifi and ssis for the record and this isn’t a post to bash them so I’m only saying that for context. I don’t care what the platform is per se but just the workflow in general.\n\nHow does your organization work? Am I missing a reason why developers should not have prod access to if they are required to build and debug pipelines?",

Sei o básico (funções, variáveis etc.), mas sinto que ainda não entendo bem os conceitos e a estratégia por trás das coisas.\n\nO que mais me confunde é que muitos cursos ensinam um fluxo tipo: pegar um CSV, salvar em algum lugar, limpar, subir de novo, carregar no Python, automatizar com o Windows Task… e, sendo bem sincera, isso parece pouco prático no dia a dia real de uma empresa.\n\nAqui onde trabalho temos vários dashboards, alguns bem pesados para editar, que puxam direto do banco do TI. Usamos Oracle e MySQL. Aí fico pensando: o Python não poderia se conectar direto no banco e alimentar o BI? Porque, se for para pegar dados de um banco que eu nem tenho permissão de edição, jogar no Python e depois subir para outro banco ou planilha… isso realmente compensa?\n\nTambém fico perdida porque vejo opiniões muito diferentes: tem gente que fala que Power BI é maravilhoso, outros dizem que o certo é fazer todos os gráficos no Python e que BI é ruim… e eu sinceramente não sei por onde começar nem no que focar para evoluir.\n\nOutro ponto: temos um banco em que o pessoal do TI cadastra nomes de empresas e outras informações de formas diferentes. A gente trata isso nos dashboards, mas sempre aparece uma nova variação e temos que corrigir tudo de novo. Se levássemos esse tratamento para Python, não seria o mesmo problema? Como garantir que os dados fiquem padronizados e corretos ao longo do tempo?\n\nE ainda surgem outras dúvidas:  \nonde guardar os códigos?  \ncomo organizar os projetos?  \ncomo lidar com erros?  \nquestões de segurança?\n\nO Python é tão abrangente que acabo não sabendo em que focar primeiro.\n\nSe alguém puder compartilhar como funciona esse fluxo na prática (Python + banco + BI) e o que realmente vale a pena estudar no início, eu agradeceria muito!",

        "content": "TL;DR\n\n***Claude code + DW MCP server = Reliable Data Models***\n\nHey guys! I have been a data engineer for 10+ years now and have worked at several big tech companies and was always skeptical at LLM's ability to reason over messy data sources to produce reliable fct/agg tables to service business analytics. My experience had been that they lack the domain knowledge for the data sources and business rules. \n\n**HOWEVER**… This week I built a data mart (dbt+duckdb) sourced from a very messy and obscure data source coming from a legacy (think 80s SW) ERP system, with claude code and was blown away by the results!!\n\nI found that giving claude code the following produced exceptional results basically in one shot! (*footer has this laid out in more details*)\n\n* A duckdb MCP server so that it can explore the raw data itself \n* **VERY** clear explanations on the analytical use cases \n* **VERY** explicit data modelling patterns (raw -> stg -> fct -> agg)\n* Quick blurb on what I know about the source system and encouraging it to search online and learn more before diving in\n\nThe data mart produced was clean, effective, easy to query, and most importantly correct and reliable. Hierarchy was respected all agg sourced from fct all fct from stg and all stg from source. It built a few robust core fct tables that then serviced multiple aggs for each analytical use case I outlined. I was using DBT so in my prompt I stressed data quality and trust so it added tests. \n\nWith 10+ years of experience it would have probably taken me a week to build, what claude code did in an afternoon. While this data mart still would still require further testing and QA before I would be confident in rolling it out to the broader org it made me realize that AI can in fact write high quality SQL.\n\nThis experiment got me thinking... As these base models keep getting better (this was on Opus 4.6) the research, reason, explore, build, test loop that I prompted my claude code to do for this project is only going to get better. So that means 1 DE who knows what they are doing and understands core data modelling principles really well can in fact replace an entire DE team and move much faster **IF** they are able to harness the true power of these AI agents.\n\nMy next experiment is going to be trying to bundle my learnings from this project into a skill and just letting loose on a new data source and seeing what comes out.\n\nCurious has anyone else done something similar? Would also love to hear peoples thoughts on AI agents in the realm of DE where mistakes are really costly and you basically cant afford even 1 because stakeholders will loose trust instantly and never touch your data assets again.\n\n\\------------\n\n***Technical Notes***\n\n* AI Agent = Claude code/Opus 4.6\n* Source data was in a MSSQL Server\n* Relevant source tables extracted to a duckdb database in their raw form\n* Final DB was another duckdb db\n* DBT used for transformations\n* Motherduck Duckdb MCP server so the AI Agent can query the db's (although sometimes I noticed Claude just resorted to using the duckdb cli or running via python -c) \n* High level workflow; \n   * Explain to agent what produced the source data, what analytical use cases we want to service, what data modelling patterns to follow, ask it to do research and come back to me. \n   * Go back and forth clarifying a few things\n   * Ask it to use the MCP server to explore the raw data and run exploratory queries so it can get its bearings\n   * Enter plan mode and ask it to start designing the data mart, review the plan, discuss as needed, and then let it execute\n   * Ask it to use the MCP server to QA the data mart it produced (apply fixes if needed)\n   * Ask it to verify metric values sourced from data mart vs. raw data (apply fixes if needed)\n\n[DBT produced lineage graph \\(sorry for it being unreadable but this was for a client and they would like table names to remain private.... green = source tables\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gl5bvx8hn2jg1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=305954d6c8b0edf58138568f87c0f8e61cbf1482)\n\n",

The first thing I noticed is that most softwares we see are built on top of open source tools that have been made by thousands of developers world wide example: Linux, Database Management Systems, Frameworks so most devs work on business logic on top of this software.\n\nWhat is important for any programmer are fundamentals when you understand some commonly used fundamentals like: data types, variables, conditions statements, loops, collections, functions, data structure and OOP are enough for expressing logic. \n\nBefore writing and following syntax I basically think a good programmer understands something in a very high level way instructions, also how the full flow works without touching the syntax. Then, the last part is translating high level written instructions into syntax based on a certain language.\n\nThis is based on my opinion and how I have been coding also being language agonistic by ensuring that logic comes first before anything else. \n\nMay be, some experienced devs may correct or share thoughts on this but this is basically based on what I have experienced throughout my programming journey.",

        "author": "UsefulExplanation131",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey, everyone. Im really hoping to get outside perspectives on some difficulties ive been experiencing while learning to program. I keep experiencing burn out and exhaustion over and over again and I can’t figure out why it keeps happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore and just can’t think clearly about my situation anymore. \n\n\n\nHere is some background:\n\n  \n\n\nRough timeline of my programming journey: August 2022- I begin working through TOP curriculum with the goal of seeing if i enjoy programming. I decide that i do enjoy it -> Feb 2024 - I physically and mentally burn out from my job as a delivery driver. Managing my job, programming, and therapy was too much and I quit after i got injured while working.  March 2024- after spending a year going from 45 mins of studying/week to 10 hours/week, a mental health crisis, and 1 month after quitting my job, i complete the foundations module of TOP -> Nov or Dec 2024 - I take advantage of being unemployed and living off savings to focus hard on programming. I build up to studying 25-30 hours/week consistently. I realize I don’t like front end stuff. I choose the js path on TOP, skip the “advanced html/css” and “react section,” but complete everything else up to the file uploader project of the “NodeJS” section. Around December i take a small break to focus on an art project, and that snowballed to a few months of no programming (though i think that would’ve happened regardless if i took a break or not). -> Feb 2026 - the past year and few months were a blur of trying so hard to build back the habit of programming as well as i did the first time. I spend some months completely dreading programming and unable to start and some months of still struggling, but able to at least show up mostly consistently. I follow a pattern of on for 2-3 months to off for 2-3 months. After i learn I don’t like front end stuff and realize that endlessly building endpoints was equally dreadful, i decide to focus on other backend topics and keep finding myself bouncing around. I spend a few months on [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) then burn out. I go to nand2tetris to switch things up, last a month, then burn out. I decide to learn C from “C programming: a modern approach,” to switch things up again, and actually have some fun, but things fizzle out again. Every attempt leaves me broken and exhausted. At this point, I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to restart. The feelings that kept me going during my most consistent periods of study, feeling like im improving and growing as a person and programmer, the satisfaction and euphoria of solving some problem that I genuinely believed i could not solve, just have been completely absent for so long. \n\n\n\nDuring all of this, ive been working hard in therapy to resolve a lot of things including social anxiety. I bring this up because i have bad social anxiety that prevents me from going to local programming meetups, participating in online programming communities, and applying for jobs. Going at this mostly alone just adds another layer of complexity to it all. Ive made a lot of progress on that front but still have a ways to go. \n\n\n\nI haven’t programmed in a couple months now and its like no amount of time away makes me dread programming any less. I feel spiritually broken. Im too close to my situation to think objectively anymore. What do y’all think i could do differently? Why does programming keep becoming this thing that i dread? Am i focusing on studying too much and not spending enough time making projects? For me, the hardest part about this whole journey (and ive realized this applies to many, maybe most, endeavors) hasn’t even been the intellectual side of things. That’s hard, sure, but by far the hardest part has been the emotional side of things. Specifically, having to find a way to program consistently over time. That’s the aspect of all of this that is the most soul crushing. It was hard to get yourself to program today, and guess what? You have to do it all over again tomorrow. And the day after. Maybe not every single day, but most weeks, most months. How do y’all not get overwhelmed with this? I think i do a decent job of focusing only on the short term but the big picture and the stakes are always on the back of my mind. I do find enjoyment in solving some programming problems, but I can’t deny that I wouldn’t be pursuing this if it wasn’t a well paying career that doesn’t require a degree. Which is the reason why i even decided to see if i enjoy programming and why i still pursue it after all this struggle. Every job ive had up to this point has been low skilled work. Server, cook, cashier, delivery driver, etc. I’m almost 25 and i want and need to get a career going. I can’t keep living the life that ive been living and programming seems to be a good enough fit. It’s intellectually challenging, doesn’t require a degree, well paying, and i find a lot of it enjoyable (even if there are a lot of things i find tedious and annoyingly boring).\n\n\n\nThat being said, i do have ideas that get me excited and could be solved using code. Some of my programming project ideas include:\n\n* Something similar to GitHub but for digital artists to save snapshots of their artwork. \n* Data management system for iot devices. Inspiration came from thinking about how massive amounts of data from telescopes are efficiently stored and organized\n* A tool that takes a 3D model and allows you to see the cross section along the axial planes\n* A massive library of artworks that pulls artwork from the online catalogs of museums and other collection websites\n\nI can’t help but feel like i am not ready for any of these projects and that I need to keep studying and learning before i can attempt any of them. That was part of the inspiration to learn c, to better learn how databases work by making a simple database since these are all data intensive projects. \n\nAnyway, if anyone has anything to share about what I could do better, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading, ill stop yapping now\n\n  \n",

There is also an \"harder\" version of it where you need to print 2 pyramids. you know, the beginner level stuffs..\n\nsince i dont have prior syntax knowledge i asked AI to generate me a code in order to check it, study it and understand it. and after i did it, i felt everything was clear, i knew what every line did and why. NICE RIGHT?\n\n\\#\n\n\\##\n\n\\###\n\n\\####\n\nwhen it came part 2 i decided to imperatively not use AI and only using my knowledge acquired from the first exercise to complete it.\n\nthis time the first of the two pyramid had to be reversed, so with blank spaces before the \"#\" symbols. Like this:\n\n\\#\n\n\\##\n\n  \\###\n\n\\####\n\nSo how do you reverse a pyramid? by starting printing spaces instead of ashes right ? perfect. This concept was pretty obvious and clear in my mind, as it should be, but the application? impossible. I could't \"invent\" a way to do it. I just lacked the creativity, even if i had all the starting points in front of me.\n\nThe formula to print the ashes was the same exact formula for basically all the other operations in the program:\n\nfor (int s = 0; s < height - i; s++)  \n{  \nprintf(\"  \")  \n}\n\nthe only difference here is that im subtracting the variable (i) from the (height), because as the height increases i should also decrease the number of spaces. Perfect, logic and it works...BUT I COULDNT INVENT IT MYSELF!!!  \ni totally lacked the creativity to think about subtracting (i) from (height) in order to solve my problem...i knew about the base formula and what it did, but i couldn't modify myself and understand what to do\n\nI HAD TO LOOK AT THE SOLUTION IN ORDER TO UNDERSTED WHAT TO DO.\n\nthis is the very first set of exercises, this is the base. This is \"hello world\" level almost and yet i failed miserably.\n\nI feel super bad because i genuinely love the idea of becoming a good programmer. im 100% convinced about it.\n\nbut this kind of misses makes me think that im just retarded to be honest... Imagine at a job when things gets serious and i can't even wrap my had around the simplest of problems...i'd get fired, or not even assumed probably.\n\nso yea, tell me what you think...tell me how miserable my story has been your eyes.\n\nPlease just be hard and tell me the truth.",

        "title": "Coupling data with behaviour considered harmful",
        "author": "Achereto",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I've seen a couple of posts by people new to programming struggling with understanding OOP and people in the responses making claims about the benefits of OOP. I want to give a bit of a different perspective on it, having written OO code for over 15 years and moving away from it over the last 2-3 years.\n\nThe core idea of OO is to model things analogue to the real world. So for example a `Datetime` object would represent a specific date and time, and everything related to that (like adding a second or minute) would be implemented by the object. It would also allow you to compare dates in an expressive way. Some languages allow you to have something like `if (today < tomorrow)`, or calculate the difference using `one_day := tomorrow - today` which is neat. \n\n**This approach couples data with behaviour.** If you need to add behaviour to a class and you don't own the class, you can't just add the behaviour to the class, and if the fields of the class are private you also can't easily access them from the subclass. So you're already facing a design problem. Yes, people have thought about it and found solutions but the key is that the coupling of data and behaviour *created* the design problem that had to be solved. With structs and functions you could just write a new function and would be done. No design problem in the first place.\n\nBut the problem becomes worse: With objects acting on their own behalf you lose the efficiency of [iterating over data and modifying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVbI1HIzCE). For every update on an object, you have to call a method and create significant computation overhead (and no, the compiler usually can't optimize this away).\n\nIn fact, the problems created by coupling data to behaviour (like classes do) has become such a pain for developers that we started teaching \"Composition over Inheritance\". In simple terms this means that an object (containing data) shouldn't implement its own behaviour any more, but instead provide placeholders for other objects that implement specific behavior can be used by the original object, effectively decoupling data from behaviour again (undoing OO). One of the better talks explaining this principle is [Nothing is Something by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) from ~10 years ago. In her example in the second half of her talk you can see that the `House` class is stripped down to data and placeholders for behaviour, giving her the maximum flexibility for new features.\n\nTo reiterate: **OOP couples data with behaviour. The design problems arising from this are best solved by decoupling data from behaviour again**\n\nIf you need more convincing data, then you can look at all the [OOP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). 13 of those 22 patterns (including the most useful ones) are actually separating data from behaviour, 3 are debatable if they do (Composite, Facade, Proxy) and only 6 (Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Flyweight, Memento, Observer) aren't about separating data from behaviour.\n\nIf coupling data with behaviour is the root problem for many design problems in programming and the solutions people come up with are different ways to decouple data from behaviour again, then you should clearly avoid coupling them in the first place to avoid all of these problems.\n\nSo what should you learn instead of OO? I would say that Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a good start as they seems to continue emerging as a solution to most design problems. Even \"Composition over Inheritance\" is already a step towards ECS. ECS have become more popular of the last years with both Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine switching to it. There is a fantastic video about the [ECS in Hytale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglU107_DA4) as well, explaining how this makes modding extremely easy. More upcoming companies will do ECS in the next years and learning it now will put you in an advantage in the hiring processes. \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk. :)\n\n(ps: not sure if \"Tutorial\" is the right Flair because I don't actually show code, but it may be the best fit for explaining a concept and its downsides)",

        "author": "normantas",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Preface. I have 4YOE as backend engineer. I use Azure with some tiny experience with React + TypeScript when I worked in teams that had some React components or a webpage. I have used RabbitMQ and Mass Transit with PostgreSQL.\n\nI still can't wrap my head around why use Message Brokers (MB). Sometimes I find their use. You have an API and a pods for long jobs. The ones that take at least few seconds. So let's say API takes in a massive file and does a request for a long calculation operation which queues a task to the Pods.\n\nWhere my issue falls is when the operation is short so giving it to a message broker does not seem to make sense. It feels a lot of times it is not worth to create the logic for message brokers.\n\nI was reading about making a URL shortener. One person said if you want metrics you will want to use a MB to log statistics and usage. Why not just push the request locally on same instance of a service just different process/thread. I do not thing logging statistics take that much resources? Would it not slow down giving the request and add costs for running 2 services instead of one? A lot of programs nowadays run on 1 thread and just use the async/await pattern as creating a new process is costly.\n\nThe primary values I find in message brokers:\n\n1. Separation of intents and simplifying services. So basically microservices. Though a lot of people are moving to \"modular monolith\" structure where you create a new service when it is needed.\n2. Orchestrating long running tasks.\n3. If you have few seperate services on same machine, some MB can read the RAM data and reuse it which lowers the memory usageand speeds up the process by not sending the data but just re-reading the same data from RAM.\n4. There is probably a case of improved Horizontal scaling.\n\nBoth can be done with an API (without the use case of RAM), though API adds some bloat but so do message brokers and not sure if managing something more complex is worth the investment. I guess also small benefit of some MB is sequentiality of tasks or in case the process fails, it stores the tasks. Though not all MB do that.\n\nIt just creates me  lot of confusion (as my writing is probably all over the places so the confusion is shown). To me it has tradeoffs though I see a lot of people putting MB where they can instead of evaluating if it is worth it.\n\nCan someone give me good project ideas, examples to master the value of MB? Message broker usage is so far and wide and sometimes I do not understand why not just have an API that is closed to external traffic?\n\nI'll give an example of a project I think could use MB: A web Crawler. There is a crawler that collects web pages. Fills the queue with URLs and the Workers consume the URLs and extract data. That is how I would do a basic crawlers for data collection. Data collection like metadata, Urls can take multiple DB queries and such so it can take up to 100ms on a massive page. Though I have to take into account if the Web Crawler can't do the same. If the added time for sending the request take a while. Why use workers? I just add more time to work by sending the request and waiting for it to be consumed.",

Isn't giving a callback like \"ExecuteJump\" to inputManager and making the inputManager call it way more efficient? Why would unity dev team who are clearly more experienced than me do this?\n2. Why is there polling in the first place? Tbh it feels like it will always be more efficient to give callback instead? Is there a case where polling is actually better in terms of performance or when they can do something callbacks cannot do?\n3. I get that this can get pretty annoying and harder to debug and complicate stuff if the amount of additional calculation is insignificant, but wouldn't using some sort of design pattern like observer be able to just remove the additional amount of complexity while keeping the implementation simple?",

Please recommend good YouTube tutorials (German or English).\n\n\\---\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI don’t want to end up posting in r/ifuckedup in a couple of months, so I figured I’d ask for help now.\n\nMy team leader asked if anyone would be willing (and able) to adapt a spreadsheet from another division to fit our department’s needs. It’s basically an automated form where you enter your name, the station, select a specific part from a dropdown, and add a short description of the issue (after it’s fixed) so the next shift has proper documentation and certain parts can be monitored.\n\nI work with Excel on a surface level and thought this would be something like:\n\n“Delete a few unnecessary dropdowns, add some new ones, rename a few labels — done.”\n\nSince nobody else was interested, I said I’d give it a try. I made it clear that this would be somewhat experimental on my end. My boss was totally fine with that and said I could take as much time as I need. We currently use our own list, but it’s all free text, which makes filtering difficult. For example, one station is officially called “03st02,” but colleagues enter things like “3st2” or “3-2”… you get the idea.\n\nAnyway — I received the file and the password for the VBA project.\n\nAnd wow. I completely underestimated it.\n\nThe file basically contains a full program running in the background, constantly cross-checking every input. I can’t just remove, add, or rename anything without breaking everything else. And honestly, for our department’s needs, it feels way overengineered. The deeper I dive into the code, the more confusing (and unnecessary) it seems.\n\nI’ve told my boss that I don’t think adapting this file makes sense and that I’d rather build something new from scratch. He’s fine with that — no pressure.\n\nBut if I’m going to do this, I want to do it properly. So I need to actually learn VBA.\n\nCan you recommend some good beginner-level YouTube tutorials to get started? German or English is fine. I also wouldn’t mind paid courses if they’re really worth it.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAI-Usage for grammar etc",

        "content": "Before I start my rant, I want to say I use AI everyday. I use it for:\n\n1. Understanding a concept/service. Why is it designed in a particular way and verifying the sources (not all the time, only when I am skeptical of the answers).\n2. Understanding a piece of code from a language I am not familiar with. Asking the LLM to explain each line.\n3. Asking the agent to edit a specific function in an unfamiliar language to do a certain thing and asking the agent to explain line by line.\n4. Writing unit tests.\n5. Pros/Cons of a system design approach. \n6. Fixing the grammatical mistakes that I make while writing something or asking it to rewrite certain sentences which are harder for audiences to grasp.\n\nThe ability of an LLM to do all of the above is big win and a big productivity boost for me. I am still amazed by the capabilities of an LLM to do all the above. \n\nHowever, I am somewhat disappointed and puzzled by the upper management push to not write code at all and delegate the writing part to AI agents. When we wrote code line by line, it gave us the ability to understand the software that we are building in a fundamental level. The friction we had when writing code, helped us to develop critical thinking and helped develop the debugging skills (the golden egg the management got over time). If we delegate this work to AI, are we not going to lose this skill eventually ? When things go wrong, the senior management is going to ask the engineers to fix the issue not an LLM. The engineer has to have atleast some mental model of how the code works. Isn't it too late and expensive to rewrite things when a production issue happens ?\n\nFinally, how are software engineers going to create novel libraries/services if they don’t write code and understand the underlying behavior. Are we sure that the engineers can create a library like React if they have not written HTML/JS by hand in years. \n\nI want to know your thoughts and hear opposing view points. I am of the opinion that an LLM can make me 1.2x faster not 10x faster. This is a conversation I have been having internally with me and many of my colleagues (who are very smart than me) did not reciprocate the same feelings. I want to know where I am going wrong.",

        "author": "reduke2",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "A bit of a niche question, but I'm hoping someone in the community could help me out with this, since I'm finding a scarce amount of resources online regarding this topic. I'm a bachelor of music student and my main focus has been in emerging music technology for a long time, but it was only recently when I took an elective course in Pure Data that my mind was opened to the possibilities of creating my own VSTs, and it wasn't until even more recently that my roommate/bandmate suggested that he use his electrical engineering course to good use and we make music hardware together. Naturally, I love this idea, and we've been conceptualising a few admittedly ambitious ideas for boutique guitar pedals, synthesizers and other music hardware that we'd love to use ourselves, but now that he's started his EE course, I'm at a position where I really do have to start locking in and learning the relevant programming. I'm aware it'll take years before we're both skilled enough to create anything close to the ideas that we have now, but I figure it's never too early to start learning now.\n\n  \nFor VSTs in particular, I know the JUCE framework for C++ is the standard, and I've found a decent amount of resources on that, so I'm not too worried about it. My bigger question regards the hardware side of things. Which microcontrollers are standard for pedals, eurorack modules, synthesizers, etc, or does it depend more on processing power and other factors i'm not yet aware of? Is C++ a good language to know or should I also think about branching out and learning other languages instead? How does one even write code for microcontrollers and make it interact with the electronic components on the PCB? Are these stupid questions?\n\n  \nAs you can tell, I am truly lost in the dark here as I haven't an ounce of programming experience (outside of pure data and briefly learning GML when I was younger) but I know I can learn it, I just desperately need to know where to start, where to find resources, who to talk to, and what I should focus on learning now. Thank you very much in advance!",

Due to this I noticed a deterioration lately in their mental health and mood. \n\nI thought I could download some of the series they used to watch time ago, store them in a USB and connect it to the TV so they can watch that instead of the news all the time. My parents are old and they would not know how to navigate through Netflix or other platforms, so I‘d have to do it this way.\n\nWhat I would like, and here is my question for you, is a file in the USB that randomly plays any video file in the USB. My parents basically use the TV as background noise so they wouldn’t care about what’s playing or follow the episodes in a given order. I want a file that they click on it and it plays whatever in the USB stick, and I need it to be random so it doesn’t always play the same episode first. I also need it to play episodes non-stop, so that they don’t need to click on the file after every episode.\n\nI have some knowledge in Python and bash, so if you give me a hint on what kind of file could do such a thing maybe I can write it on my own. \n\nThe approach I can think of is the following; when I click on this file it will:\n- Collect all the file names in the USB (or the ones with a video format).\n- Sort them on a random order.\n- Grab the first 20 files on the list.\n- Play this 20 episodes as a playlist.\n\nOn a computer I could write it so that VLC plays this list of files, but on a TV I don’t know how it could be done.

The course lasted 3\nmonths, 5 days a week for 4 hours with additional homework\nassignments, etc, and it gave me solid ground to start a career. I was\npretty good and fast with learning concepts from programming when I\nwas starting to get into this field, which definitely encouraged me to\nstart learning more.\n\nAlso i am aware that just being good with C++ syntax is not enough, so\ni was kinda looking for some learning roadmap of some things that I'll\nalso need to learn in order to land a job.\n\nAlso, for context, I live in Europe.\n\nThanks",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m planning a small, local delivery platform inspired by Wolt/UberEats, but starting very lean. The idea is to have three roles: customers who can browse products, add them to a cart and place orders, stores/restaurants that only see and manage their own orders and products, and in-house couriers who get assigned deliveries and update their status through a mobile-first interface (likely a PWA).\n\nI want to avoid reinventing basic e-commerce logic, but I also don’t want to be locked into a heavy platform that fights against delivery-style workflows. I’ve looked at Bagisto and similar full platforms, but they feel very e-commerce-centric. Lately I’ve been considering Laravel with LunarPHP (core + Filament admin) and building the store, courier and dispatch logic on top of that.\n\nDoes LunarPHP sound like a reasonable foundation for this kind of project, or would you recommend a different stack or approach? I’m mostly interested in starting with a clean architecture that can scale later.\n\nThanks!",

This field is no longer something you can pursue if you’re motivated by money alone. If you want to last, you need some level of genuine passion for the work itself.\n\nEver since I was young, I’ve wanted to work at a large national retailer. Not because of the paycheck, but because I genuinely enjoy the work. I live for consumer behavior analysis, demand forecasting, real-time pricing optimization, and supply-chain analytics. I wake up every day motivated to contribute to a company that sells food. We all need food. And that makes it meaningful to me. And also you’re welcome.\n\nMoments spent in Power BI dashboards, watching shifts in purchasing behavior, tracking category growth in Kombucha, Spindrift, and non-alcoholic beverages, and translating those insights into actionable strategy? Ecstasy. Seeing those trend lines move is why I wake up everyday\n\nThere are too many contrarians here reflexively dismissing uncomfortable truths, and not enough people willing to acknowledge how the industry actually works and what  it really takes to thrive in it.\n\nI for one am so grateful to be a data scientist at a large grocery chain.

The team knew there are things that I don't know, because they have never been properly communicated, so I was helped with that. There are changes in the team or deployment process? communicated. Some new framework? communicated. Some update in our best practices? communicated too.\n\nBut in the new team, the approach turned out to be very much 'sink or swim'. You are told some things initially but then rest of the things, even processes, even whom to reach out and even what to do when there is a conflict with someone else, everything was left on you. Your ticket/task was handled to you and it was said to be your ownership \n\nThe moment you are assigned your task, you treat it like a sword hanging near your neck and you do everything possible to deliver it on time. Something unexpected causing delays? Some other component which you rely on, not working properly? Nobody cares. You need to deliver on the deadline anyhow.\n\nI don't really like this kind of a culture, really. I loved the old, collaborative culture where it felt like we are working on a mission together with our team. Where our team is not our enemy, but they are comrades. But my director told me that if I don't become highly independent, I won't survive the industry.\n\nHas it become become the norm lately that sink or swim is the only approach to work being adopted in the tech industry?

        "content": "Last summer I was unemployed and depressed. I felt like a dissapointment to my parents, especially seeing my friends progress with their lives while i was back at home bedrotting everyday. I told myself that i NEEDED to lock in and get an internship for this summer, orelse I had to apply for some retail job like starbucks to keep me afloat.\n\nWelp… this morning after 624 job applications, I finally got my offer letter today. It’s not a big prestigious company like amazon but im literally so happy and cannot complain.\n\nIm like one of the dumbest people I know so if I can do it, SO CAN YOU. DONT GIVE UP!! if you are still struggling to find an internship, here are some tips that helped me:\n\n* use linkedin to network but not for applying to jobs. they repost jobs and it’s just a waste of time because everyone is applying to those postings\n* surround yourself with ambitious friends. im so thankful that my friends are so smart and supportive because they helped me fix my resume, and seeing their success just motivates me to do better\n* in the job interview, you need to show some personality. lots of candidates focus too much on GETTING the interview but remember you also need to pass it, show that you are someone enjoyable to be around\n* try to find internships the moment they get posted, literally the day of. constantly refresh github repos, intern insider, discord, etc. or stalk company sites directly\n* stay consistent and protect your mental health. I kept applying even when nothing was working, but I also made sure I had hobbies and friends outside of job hunting so rejections did not completely wreck me\n\nAt the end of the day, i think it’s just a game of luck. Keep putting shots up and eventually one will fall in.. or something like that. Happy to answer any questions about my job search and help give more advice if youre struggling!",

Here’s a shortlist of under-the-radar platforms where you can actually find teams building interesting stuff, I’m sharing this from the POV of someone who works closely with VCs and early teams and sees where hiring actually happens.\n\n* [**YC Work at a Startup:**](https://www.ycombinator.com/jobs) direct job board from YC companies. High density of legit startups, often hiring fast and globally.\n* [**Better Call Jobs**](https://bettercalljobs.com/app): AI Recruiter specialised in startup & tech roles, talk to him and he’ll introduce you to his company network.\n* [**Techstars Portfolio Jobs**](https://jobs.techstars.com/jobs): similar to VC boards but very startup-focused, especially seed/Series A companies.\n* [**Wellfound**](https://wellfound.com/) (ex-AngelList Talent): still one of the best places to find early-stage startups hiring. You can filter by funding stage, remote, equity, and see who you’re actually talking to. Very founder-heavy.\n* **Hacker News:** [**Who's Hiring**](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43243024) (very high signal and usually can connect directly with founder/early team. Check out the March 2025 thread)\n* [**Startups.Gallery**](http://startups.gallery/) (good directory of top startups/scaleups + job board)\n* **Joining a VC's talent networks** / job boards ([**Greylock**](https://greylock.com/jobs/#talent-network-tab), [**a16z**](https://a16z-games.typeform.com/1337-talent?typeform-source=www.google.com), [**SPC**](https://jobs.southparkcommons.com/jobs), etc)",

Long time ago when I was unemployed making posts here, I had people say things like \"You sound like you deserve to work in FAANG, give me your resume\" you don't work in FAANG get the fuck out of here. \"Yo send me your resume. I'll give you much better advice than the people commenting on your post. They don't know anything 🤣🤣\" No you won't. You won't say anything different from the other 100+ comments. Fuck off.\n\nI had to enable the hide all posts feature on my profile because of this sub. I would post something on a completely different sub and someone from this sub will then go over there and comment \"Did you hear back from xyz's assessment?\" referring to a post I made here like 2 years ago...like what the fuck is wrong with some of you? I had one guy send me his LinkedIn after sending me a few messages I never responded to a long time trying to become best friends through Reddit dms. Most of us on Reddit use this platform anonymously. We're not trying to show our real identity. The other issue I have with this is that some of you are currently in uni. Why don't you guys try to interact with CS people in your lectures, tutorials, labs, or the tech club at your uni? For all you know, you could be talking to some guy on this sub who's living on another continent who you will never meet in real life. At least interact with your community at uni/college.\n\nI should've made this post a long time ago but better late than never. The main thing to be careful is to watch out for the people trying expose your identity through something like \"send me your resume\". But even putting that aside, I don't get the whole dming thing on this sub when I never experience it on any other sub.",

        "content": "I got laid off 2 weeks and 2 days ago from Amazon (after getting my only 6 months of experience), and there's always been an underlying sense of insecurity about it. My old job as an SWE was genuinely like the only redeeming quality I have. I'm not cool, charismatic, skilled, or attractive like other people. I'm trying to change that, but no matter what I do, I just lack in comparison to other people online and IRL. Most of the people I live have tech jobs still – hell, I see a few still wearing their badges from my old company. I'm kind of tempted to try a career pivot and get a master's because of the whole AI thing, but I don't know if I can get into that great of a school (and in turn, I don't know how accomplished I could get to feel).\n\nI don't have a job like other people I know now. Outside of my team, almost all of the people I know at my old company still have their jobs. I also feel even more envious than usual of people that were able to get into really prestigious companies that I've gotten rejected from multiple times (namely Google and Apple). Every time I meet someone new, there's that inevitable circle of everyone saying what they do for a living. It honestly feels like I'm lying if I were to say I'm still a software engineer, so I usually end up caving and saying that I got laid off and am searching. I was debating whether to try to hang out with my friends, but I can't help but feel somewhat avoidant since I'd be the oddball.\n\nI know it's technically not my fault (it was a mass layoff of thousands of people, then half my old team including my manager), but as is, I still don't have a job anymore. Beyond getting another position (which I'm of course, working on), I don't really think there's a way to feel better. I wish I could rewind – maybe I could've made it to another company out of college that didn't do mass layoffs..",

        "content": "I honestly think what’s happening in the job market is pretty obvious. It’s not just AI taking everyone’s jobs (maybe some of them, sure), but a lot of work is simply being outsourced to cheaper labor markets : Eastern Europe, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc.\n\nI’m pretty active on a bunch of subreddits, and the difference is obvious. You’ve got people in the US and Western Europe saying they’ve applied to 100+ jobs and can’t even land an interview. Meanwhile, people in places like India or the Philippines talk pretty casually about getting IT jobs, call center work, remote contracts  and earning high income ( relative to their country’s norm) .\n\nIf someone like Trump argues that protectionist policies are necessary to protect Western industries,  workers and western dominance , and points to China building its economy off the back of offshored manufacturing , then why isn’t this treated the same way? Offshoring these tech jobs might not look as dramatic as factories moving overseas, but it’s shifting income, skills, and long-term capacity to other countries. It should be treated as a threat to western dominance \n\nAnd the bigger picture is this: when you offshore work, you’re not just saving money in the short term. You’re helping build those countries skilled workforce. Over time, those countries  will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.\n\nIt just feels like we’re watching the same pattern repeat, only this time with tech and services instead of manufacturing. Maybe it’s a bit wild to say but I don’t think companies that offshore lots of their jobs like this should be allowed to operate in the country or at the very least they should face much higher taxation that makes offshoring unattractive ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm a mid level dev, I also do quite a lot of devops work. For the longest time I was quite against using AI to develop code because I wanted to enjoy the challenges, solve problems etc. I simply enjoy my job too much to want to delegate it away.\n\nAnd recently, I've been experimenting with some AIs (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) because as much as I enjoy my job, I don't want to fall behind. But my real, hands on experience was that AI was only really useful as a glorified autocomplete, generating boilerplate code, and maybe stuff like terraform skeleton code. It's good for things that are not a problem at all and that I can do quite fast myself anyway, but whenever I try to use AI to solve an actual problem/something I'm stuck on/something that requires logic, it always fails miserably. Trying to talk it into actually doing the work, and even pointing out the mistakes (and entering the, 'you're right, I'll fix that!' loop for ever), it makes me feel like a Sisyphus, and it never goes anywhere. Pretty much every single time I've attempted it, I was better off writing the code myself anyway.  \n\nBut everywhere I look, I see people about agentic ai, using ai in development and increasing the productivity 10x, etc. but in reality, these are never followed up with real life actual examples, it just feels like a cloud of buzzwords and people parroting what's currently popular. \n\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So a year ago I started at my first development job after a career change. I consider myself BLESSED to have found a role, and such a good one to get started in. The job is way chiller than I ever could have expected. I'm fully remote, on a team of five (with some very experienced people), On Call weekend once every ten weeks or so but it's generally very uneventful. Leadership is thoughtful, people get along, WLB is amazing (working hours are working hours, 4 weeks PTO, etc). It's really a genuinely great situation. \n\nThe bad is that the work isn't really challenging or interesting. We maintain probably 20-30 different legacy Java applications, frequently that just looks like small little feature or workflow changes, database work, or some kind of server script that needs to be done. We're in the process of modernizing them - but the vast majority (which truly are very simple boring CRUD workflows) are getting moved into a proprietary \"pro-code\" platform (a convuluted, absolute mess of a thing that uses java objects in a bizarre way) with the remaining 5-6 of them being rewritten as cloud native react apps. \n\nRight now, we're inbetween that. Theres a few developers that are staying pretty busy doing deep dives into a high impact java app that was originally written around 2006, but the rewrites haven't started yet and I find myself doing super low impact work and trying to \"look\" busy because theres just not much to do. For a while I was enjoying that - doing projects around the house or the yard but now I'm over that. I want to do something interesting and I have NO interest in taking part in the low code nonsense. I'm being underutilized. I also only get paid around 65k (LCOL area so whatever, but even the \"leads\" are barely pushing 100). \n\nIt seems obvious to look for something else but I work with awesome people, have a ton of free time, fully remote, AND good management? I'd hate to leave and go somewhere else thats miserable. \n\nBackground: 31, Career changer, went to an average state school after high school for accounting, proceeded to go work at a car dealership because I liked cars and hated taxes. Did pretty well, moved through the ranks, wanted to do something more intellectually challenging, went back to school (WGU don't flame me) to get a CS degree (honestly I was always a nerd who understood computers well and tinkered with stuff so I was more looking for the HR checkbox, I know it's not great though). Decent soft skills, better than a lot of my coworkers for sure, could probably do well at leetcode mediums if I gave it some effort, but no strong interest in relocating. Would consider myself competent and a strong employee but I'm probably never going to be the guy coding on the weekends because he just loves it that much. Have considered signing up for OMSCS to lose some of that wgu stigma and open up possibilities but with AI here it kind of feels like: why? ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.\n\nSoftware engineering used to feel like the golden path. High pay, tons of demand, solid job security. Then bootcamps blew up, CS enrollments exploded, and now it feels pretty saturated at the entry level. On top of that, AI tools are starting to automate parts of coding, which makes the future feel a bit uncertain.\n\nNow I’m wondering if machine learning is heading in the same direction.\n\nML pays a lot of money right now. The salaries are honestly a big part of why people are drawn to it. But I’m seeing more and more people pivot into ML, more courses, more degrees, more certifications, and some universities are even starting dedicated AI degrees now. It feels like everyone wants in. People from all kinds of backgrounds are moving into ML and AI too, math majors, engineering majors, stats, physics, and even people outside traditional tech paths, similar to how CS became the default choice for so many different majors a few years ago. At the same time, tools are getting better. With foundation models and high-level frameworks, you don’t always need to build things from scratch anymore.\n\nAs a counterpoint though, ML is definitely harder than traditional CS in a lot of ways. The math, the theory, reading research papers, running experiments. The learning curve feels steeper. It’s not something you can just pick up in a few months and be truly good at. So maybe that barrier keeps it from becoming as saturated as general software engineering?\n\nI’m personally interested in going into AI and robotics, specifically machine learning or computer vision at robotics companies. That’s the long term goal. I just don’t know if this is still a smart path or if it’s going to become overcrowded and unstable in the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nWould love to hear from people already in ML or robotics. Is it still worth it? Or are we heading toward the same oversaturation issues that SWE is facing?",

These are, no doubt, heavily crowded tech stacks in the market right now. Additionally, I used the phrase \"organic interview\" earlier, since I did have a few interviews early in my job search, but only after reaching out to some old connections about openings at their companies. None of those interviews led to anything.\n\nThese past 8 months (with some breaks in between days/weeks), I've applied to over 600 openings and tried what feels like everything.

I've never gotten a formal onboarding into my SWE role and it's been rough trying to understand the codebase (product is older than me).

I can count on both hands how many rejection emails I’ve gotten.\n\nOver the last 3 years I’ve tried many different tactics to stand out:\n\nI have tried resume services, i’ve tried putting my resume through AI, I’ve tried tailoring my resume to the job description, I’ve tried putting my resume through ATS, I’ve even been uploading cover letters for each application\n\nI’ve gotten many many referrals, reached out to people on linkedin and blind, applied to startups, applied to FAANG and smaller local companies, I don’t apply through 3rd party I always apply to the direct site and then attempt to reach out to the hiring manager/recruiter through LinkedIn, and I’ve also gotten multiple certifications related to my field.\n\nIs this just how it’s going to be going forward? I mean I know i’m not the only one not getting interviews. It honestly feels like I’m throwing my resume out into the void. I’m not sure how I can send out (at this point) thousands of applications as an early-mid software engineer and not get even a single interview?\n\nI don’t remember it being like this when I was looking for internships honestly and for those in college right now I feel for yall.\n\nI feel bad complaining because while i have an (albeit shitty) job I still have a job. It just honestly makes me feel so demoralized about my future and it makes me sad to see an industry that’s revolutionized so much of our day to day lives basically cannibalize itself with AI.\n\nWe just can’t compete with robots who don’t need to get paid and don’t need breaks/rights.\n\nEDIT: after seeing some replies I think I’m gonna scrap and rewrite my resume. I didn’t necessarily post here for advice just to rant after a shitty day but after seeing yalls responses I have some renewed faith",

        "content": "Hey everyone, looking for a reality check.\n\nI recently joined an early-stage startup (idea/MVP level) as the sole technical person. The existing team has 3 more people...all non-tech. I was initially going to only work on the AI parts but that soon turned to handling all of BE. The product would be a web-app; there will be an AI agent and quite a few dynamic dashboards with user data. The AI Agent will provide insights and suggestions from the data among other things.\n\nThe issue is, they just revealed their plan for the frontend: WordPress + Elementor. They think because they are building the \"site\" in WordPress, they are handling the frontend.\n\nThe product requires:\n\n* Complex Data Ingestion: Parsing fragile PDFs and CSVs from automated emails\n* OAuth Integration: Securely connecting to Gmail/Outlook APIs.\n* AI Engine\n\nWordPress can't handle a dynamic SaaS dashboard. I’m effectively having to build a \"Custom Backend\" that does 95% of the heavy lifting, including the API bridges to make their WordPress site even function.\n\n**Their proposed workload for me is insane... I am the Backend Dev, Data Engineer, and AI Engineer. Their \"contribution\" is marketing and a drag-and-drop website.**\n\nI’m getting 20% equity to build 100% of the intellectual property...equity is the only form of payment.\n\nI have talked with them about the importance of a solid FE for the product...They are pushing everything to the \"custom backend\" because they don't know how to code. Am I overreacting, or is 20% equity for a solo dev building a complex AI data pipeline and a custom backend way too low? Especially when the \"frontend assistance\" is just a marketing site?\n\nTL;DR: Only dev on the team. Founders doing marketing/WordPress. I'm building a custom AI engine + data parsers for 20% equity. Does this sound like a fair split, or am I being used as cheap labor for their \"idea\"?\n\nI feel like I'm being taken advantage of and don't know how to navigate this discussion ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m asking mostly out of curiosity and to get a sense of how things look from inside the industry today.\n\nI used to be a software developer in Seattle about ten years ago. I worked in the field for roughly two years before deciding to switch careers and move on to something else. I’ve been out of tech for a long time now, but I still loosely follow what’s going on. Watching the wave of layoffs since 2022, one thing I’ve been wondering about is whether they disproportionately affected people who entered tech through coding bootcamps during the 2015 to 2021 boom. Back when I was around, bootcamps were just starting to become a thing, and later they seemed to turn into a very common path into junior roles. From the outside, it feels like when hiring tightened, companies cut a lot of junior or surface level roles first. That made me wonder whether former bootcamp hires, especially career switchers with fewer years of deep experience, were more exposed compared to traditional CS grads or more senior engineers.\n\nI’m not trying to bash bootcamps or the people who went through them. I’m genuinely curious whether people inside companies noticed any real pattern during layoffs, or whether this is mostly selection bias and anecdotal noise.\n\nFor those who stayed in tech through the last few years, did layoffs feel credential blind, or were certain backgrounds more vulnerable? Did former bootcamp grads fare worse, better, or about the same as everyone else once the market contracted? Would really appreciate perspectives from engineers, hiring managers, or anyone who went through layoffs themselves.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nFormer software dev from Seattle, out of the industry for about 10 years. Curious whether the post-2022 layoffs hit former bootcamp hires harder than others, or if that’s just anecdotal.",

It seems like my mind has stopped functioning and I can't find a solution on my own so I really need help from wise strangers on the internet.\n\nSo here goes my story: I am a 34 years old man (birthday in about a week from now). I was born and raised in a third world country. I completed my BS in CS in 2013 and I have worked as a software dev until 2019 when I started my own business (not related to tech) so I kinda gave up on my career.\n\nMy business was doing good and everything was fine until in 2025, I moved to the US. My family is here and I was alone back in my country so it made sense to move here. I thought I could keep my business running remotely but unfortunately, due to some issues I couldn't and it all came crashing down.\n\nNow, I dont have anything. I no longer have a career to get a job in IT here nor do I have a business to support me. I am also in $19K of debt. I have started working an odd job to survive here which pays $19/hour but I am even unable to meet my basic need as I need to pay the rent here. I am unable to find a job with better pay. My resume is a disaster.\n\nI desperately need to revive my career but I don't know how. I was a .NET (C#) dev back then and I use to work on MVC & Web forms projects. I also use to make REST & SOAP APIs. I did dabble in a little bit of [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) core too. I used to work on MS SQL too.\n\nI asked ChatGPT and it recommened to start with Azure cloud as I can leverage my background in .NET & C#. Although I have no experience in cloud, do you think it is a wise suggestion? I have started prepping for AZ900 (which I know, doesnt help in securing a job as its just fundamentals but its a necessary step to cloud). Its been so long since I coded that I have forgotten almost everything about it.\n\nOr should I look into AI and Data Science stuff? Feels complicated but since there is all the hype about it and how AI is the future, I am not sure. I was never good at maths so I am not sure if I will be able to grasp it.\n\nSo can anyone of you please help me in guiding towards a path (in detail please if possible) where I can potentially have a financially stable life? I have always been a hard worker and have been praised for my work ethics, even in the odd job here. So I know with a little bit of help, I can rise again.\n\nRight now, I feel broken. I have nothing to show for 34 years of my life. All my friends/ex-colleagues have good careers and are married, have their own house, cars, kids and living a stable (or close to it) life. I can't go back to my country as there is absolutely nothing there for me and I am finding it extremely hard to survive here. After bills, I dont have enough money for basic groceries here. I had a comfortable life back home and was earning well and never had a physical/laborious job in my life. Here I am working 12 hours shift as a warehouse worker. I dont mind it but it feels like I am wasting away my life.\n\nI am sorry if my post looks like I am looking for pity. I am not. Its just that I do not have anyone to talk to about this and I am not in a good state of mind right now.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I would really appreciate your help.\n\nTLDR: .NET dev who abandoned his career in 2019, is now looking to go back to his career in tech and asking for the correct path.",

The 2nd human can think in a truly independent way regardless of what the first human has tried. Hallucinations can still happen between humans but they are much rarer and even when they do happen are usually understandable and predictable.\n\nIn short, I've observed that human collaboration is scalable in a way that AI agent collaboration is not.\n\nIt's almost as if due to the simple fact that each human has a unique neural net wiring, human collaboration is able to make discoveries and break throughs that a single neural net whether synthetic or biological, cannot compete against.\n\nIt's as if the current state of the art for AI is still only at the level where it's a tool. If I didn't know better, I would say investors are being duped into believing it'll reach true human level autonomy. Surely, these benevolent tech \"leaders\" wouldn't bend the truth like that.",

After the pandemic... it fluctuated between 100% remote and hybrid. Every time I went fully remote, I eventually hated it. I felt purposeless, like I had a \"fake job,\" and struggled with the lack of structure (I’ve discussed this extensively in therapy).\n\n- Last Year: Worked a 1-year stint for a government contractor (hybrid). This worked fairly well for me mentally. I actually did a lot of work on remote days, but from a closer office just to focus. But the contract folded over the summer due to budget cuts (DOGE), forcing me to find a new job quickly. Some other parts of the job didn't quite work...it was a far commute in particular.\n\n- Current Role (6 months): I joined a smaller \"boutique\" government contracting firm. It’s 100% remote, and the same bad feelings have returned. On top of the isolation, the environment is toxic, disorganized, and the codebase is chaotic. But after the shakeup last summer with contracting work, I felt desperate. \n\nI’m looking again and have landed 5 interviews, mostly focusing on in-person or hybrid roles. Mostly SCIF work in the government contracting world...but the front-runner is a role 20 minutes from my house with core hours of 10am–2pm. They seem really modern, use Svelte and more prototyping stuff, but just the nature of it can't be remote. \n\nWhere I'm at rn, I mean...it's really not working out, and I have the experience to know and see these are some bad managers and work environment...even outside of it being remote. \n\nI feel at odds. My mental health and history tell me I need to be in the office (or at least hybrid) to feel purposeful and get out of the house. But now that it's becoming real, I’m worried I’m going to miss the freedom of remote work once it's gone.\n\nAlso planning to push for more money. I currently make around $170k TC. I'm gonna push more for $200k-$220k. Security clearance work and being only on-site, I think could justify it. They don't really know my situation that I don't like remote and could use it to my advantage I feel.\n\nI don't have an offer in-hand but...I can read the signs one of these 5 will come through at least.\n\nHas anyone else here realized they just can't do remote work? Did you regret going back to the office, or did the structure help you?",

I was accepted into OMSCS last year but I withdrew because I thought if I just applied like crazy I'd be able to get a job. Well here I am with no CS job still after a year. The main thing that bothers me about OMSCS is the time commitment with how bad the job market is. I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.\n\nI recently made another post where I said I was considering going back to university to try and get a bachelors from a more respected university. I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume.

And if I do pick up back end, could I transition to sec in the future? Would that be viable?\n\nJust as an added info: I'm not trying to \"get rich quick\" here.

        "content": "Hi the following wall of text is just me whining about my luck running out, whoa is me, yada yada. But I would appreciate advice after reading between the lines.  \n  \nRecently I was turned down for a job specifically because they said I lacked a bachelor's degree. I have an associate's degree from a community college, and some 4 year university for a mechanical engineering before I ran out of money. I got an insanely lucky break at a small startup anyway for roughly 6 years, then a year at an enterprise position. Both of them remote which is insanely lucky because I live in south PA, hours away from most tech centers. I should have saved up and moved but I was making pretty below average pay so it never really added up. Plus family things kept me rooted where I am. I should have jumped ship from my job sooner but I thought all the experience would look better rather then job hopping. I also had a weird sense of loyalty since they took me on without a bachelors in the first place. The stupid part is I was trying to save up to return to college at that enterprise job but then I was laid off.   \n  \nThat was a year ago. I got an entry level helpdesk position at an old job for about half the pay I was making and I've been trapped here ever since. I got maybe 8 interviews total last year and half of them the companies disappeared overnight. The other half went with what unicorns I assume the market is oversaturated with now. At least that's what it felt like.\n\nAt this point I am at a loss of what to do. I've been up and down the existential nightmare of the AI hype and have safely arrived at the \"it's a tool nothing more\" stance but it feels like it's going to be another couple years before CEOs recognize this. I know most of this thread is in the same boat dealing with that aftermath. But what do I do in the meantime? I get small one off \"maintenance\" with my old company's software I play up a bit on my resume and I'm \"technically\" still registered with them but I feel like it's hurting more then helping. I only play it up because I was under the impression it's much harder to get hired in software if you haven't been doing it recently. If I say I've been doing 99% tech support for the past year that makes it sound like I'm not even an engineer anymore. I had a recruiter straight up ask me \"why'd you leave to do tech support instead\" like I did this on purpose. It's demeaning. It's not that I mind IT but I don't have the certs to move up in it, and I always wanted to build software for a living. It's part of the reason I started having trouble with my bachelor's degree originally, because I wanted to change trajectory and it ended up being too expensive to.\n\nI have a handful of active personal projects, including a rust library, a game engine, and a joint one with a dev friend I've been working on that's more of a SaaS. I feel like entrepreneurship might be my only hope at this point but I don't consider myself business brained, nor do I necessarily consider myself a designer. Even my system design is probably just mediocre at best. I feel gross using AI to churn out slop. I am trying to figure out a way to use it productively like i know peers of mine manage without feeling like I'm building on top of popsicle sticks. I think I'm better then AI but by how much i couldn't tell you.\n\nAnyway I know this is a bit of a sad sap ramble but really it comes down to income. I love software development, I've been doing it since I was a kid, but I also need money. I have mouths to feed and a mortgage and entry level jobs aren't cutting it. My credit card is almost maxed out and the interest is enough I can never pay it off. I'm hoping the answer isn't just to take up a trade like my dad and father in law did. I always felt like software is what I'm meant to do and it kills me that I can't make it happen anymore. If I could even just get some gigs like the good ol days I could hunker down until the economy corrects, but the gig market is basically dead from what I've found. And I haven't had a single bite on Fiver/Upwork. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation?",

Because of my history with the company (basically rotating between teams in my department), I’ve had the chance to touch basically everything: Frontend, Backend, Databases, Devops pipelines, K8s/containers, Cloud infrastructure, AuthN/AuthZ, API gateways/reverse proxies, and Messaging (Pub/sub). I’ve become the \"jack of all trades\" in our department.\n\nManagement is now aggressively pushing me toward a Tech Lead/Lead developer role. They want me focused on unblocking other developers, guiding engineers, and handling the \"big picture\" stuff. This would drastically reduce my time \"in the trenches\" where I'm basically delegating the day to day stuff.\n\nThe issue is that I’m already losing my time to code. My typical day now includes: mentoring other junior developers/interns, discussing integration points with other systems, stakeholder meetings with my EM, sprint planning, and removing blockers for other engineers - for example, getting our authN/authZ infra setup or API routes design done so that implementation can begin on a new module.\n\nI’ve only been coding seriously for 5–6 years (including personal projects and my college degree) and only have \\~2 years of \"professional\" industry experience. I feel like it is **way too early** to stop being an Individual Contributor (IC). I want to experience being a \"Senior dev\" and build true deep technical expertise. Basically I foresee my career moving towards the \"IC\" path rather than the \"EM\" one.\n\nEven worse, I’m starting to feel anxious (like I'm not ready for this step up) and feel like a fraud. Because I’ve been a generalist, I look at our dedicated Backend engineers and realize they are better at their jobs than I am. They have depth I don't have in terms of programming and db design.\n\nHas anyone else been fast-tracked like this and am I right to think that \\~2 years of experience is too shallow for a Tech Lead role?",

        "author": "kyngslyr",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience, mostly working with .NET/C# and SQL. I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role, which means I’ve had exposure to architecture decisions, client calls, and owning delivery end to end.\n\nLately though, I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.\n\nI recently went through interviews with a US-led SaaS company, and they’ve communicated intent to extend an offer. The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role.\n\nFrom conversations with their engineering leadership, though, this doesn’t sound like a traditional ticket-only support job. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes. They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.\n\nWhat I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.\n\nThere’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.\n\nIf you’ve worked in product SaaS companies or made a similar move, how would you look at this? What would you watch for early on to tell whether it’s actually a stepping stone versus a dead end? Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?\n\nEDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.",

I'm glad to have gotten the experience, but it meant that I took 6 years to graduate in the first place.\n\nApplying to jobs feels worthless. It feels like I might as well have no degree and no experience. I can't tell if it's because of the sites I'm using to look for jobs, or because AI, or recession, or because my resume isn't good enough (which means grads with actually no experience are completely fucked). Currently I'm unemployed and applying to jobs here and there that look like I match their requirements and pay decently well, in the 70-85k range makes sense to me for SE MI with experience and a degree.\n\nI've been slowly building a website that I think provides a niche unique utility to a gaming community I've been in for over a decade as a side project, nothing super serious. Though I think I can monetize it through ads or a freemium model and maybe just pour my efforts into that as somehow a better alternative. Is it crazy to think that investing my time into my own site that could just flop and make no money is the way to go? I figure it's either gonna support me or be a good portfolio addition, but I don't know if it's short-sighted to consider self-employment the way to go or if the dev doomerism has simply taken control of my brain.\n\nWhat do you guys with experience think? Is it stupid to focus on self-employment opportunity? Or is it the way to go when the industry is shutting its pants over AI and other problems?\n\n- Edit to clarify my YOE and graduation.",

The problem started recently, where my manager decided that I have to learn Business Intelligence, in particular how to make dashboard (a task that I hate and I'm really bad at since I have basically zero aesthetic sense), in order not to present my job to internal stakeholders, but to sell them outside the company (and this worries me A LOT, I spoke about this with my internal stakeholder and he seemed worried too).\n\nMy perception about why this did happen was that the head of data made some terrible choices that burned out the budget and now they have to find a way to save money (about 60% of the BI team left not being replaced recently).  They'll probably to sell this transition as a new way to intend the Data Engineering job, compliant with our target company model.\n\nNow I'll soon have to speak with my manager about this, I'll for sure tell him that I'm not ok with this, and that I expected to proceed in a more managerial path, rather than taking on more technical work, that I cannot do and I'm not brilliant with. But I fear that this won't make any changes. \n\nSo what would you do in my place?\n\nI thought about:\n\n1. Leaving the company (the market isn't as bad as in the US, so it's not out of questions, but i still would like to have an offer first)\n2. Take a step back and ask for part-time trying to use the free time to land some other job (perhaps freelance or something different)\n3. Go to HR, tell them that I'm not anymore happy with my position and see if there's something else available withing the company.\n4. Comply and see what happens (if they will fire me, they'll have to give me an exit bonus)\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nAs a Data Engineer forced to take on even Business Intelligence tasks due to corporate politics.

Plus, you can’t really afford to in this economy.\n\nI’m a self-taught developer. I have a bachelor’s degree but it’s not technical. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. I obtained a marketing degree because, to be honest, I didn’t know what I wanted to do at the time.\n\nI realize that technology moves fast, and going back to school will likely slow me down. Most of the stuff taught at school is theoretical. And, as far as the practical stuff goes, that will essentially be useless by the time one graduates.\n\nStill, I feel like there’s a big gap of knowledge that I’m missing. Especially foundational stuff like how operating systems work, how compilers work, and computer architecture. I also feel like I’m missing a lot of math as well.\n\nUltimately, I’d like to become a ai systems architect. One who knows not only how to strategically implement ai models, but also  how to create the models and teach them.\n\nIf i were to go back to school, I’s likely wouldn’t be able to just jump into a masters program. I’d need to end up taking a bridge program. I’d likely apply to a post bacc cs program, like OSU. And then, a few years down the road, if things go well, enroll in Georgia Tech and earn a masters program emphasized in machine learning.\n\nUltimately, im wondering if this is a good idea or just a waste of time and money. Considering how much material is out there, it might be better off just teaching myself these things. Yes, it’ll take longer and it’ll be unstructured, but, I’d be saving money, I’d be able to upgrade myself with hands-on on practical skills, I’d get more hands-on experience while making money, and let’s be honest, I’d be able to have more of a social life (which i could use right about now).\n\nBut, what fears me is the slight chance that not having any technical degree will prevent me from leveling up as an engineer. Obviously I know there are certain fields which almost certainly require an advanced technical degree like robotics or self-automation engineering and ml research. But I’m not too interested in those fields. What i am interested is backend development, cloud infrastructure, systems architecture, applied machine learning (maybe), and maybe dabble in cybersecurity.\n\nSorry for the long post, but it’s just something that’s been lingering in my mind these past couple weeks. And, yes, i do know how fortunate i am to still have a job. Thank you. Wish u guys all the best",

I actually found that side really interesting — especially understanding how things run in production.\n\nShould I go deep into backend (microservices, distributed systems), focus on backend + DevOps, backend + cloud, or improve my frontend skills and stay full stack?\n\nI enjoy backend and infrastructure more than frontend, but I’m also worried about narrowing too early and missing full-stack opportunities.hould I specialize in backend/cloud or keep full stack as a safety net?\n\nWhat would you prioritize in my position?",

For example for syncing data between multiple devices or similar short-undescriptive-named commits.\n\nBasically, I would want my portfolio to be clean and professional. But in reality I might more often than not work in a bit of a chaotic way.\n\n  \nMy idea was to work on a private Github/Gitlab and when I'm done with a project, I can create a project on my public portfolio Github and just copy the files. Meaning only the finished project would be there, no commits or branches, etc. Is that a good idea?\n\nWhat would you recommend in this scenario/problem?\n\n(This is mainly personal projects that I do because it's fun so I would rather not put in a lot of effort into working on the main portfolio Git and name every commit and do documentations and comments, etc. I wanna have fun while also get some portfolio out of my projects, don't wanna make it a bothersome process)",

        "content": "I wanted to see what this subs opinion are of my work environment to see if I am crazy or not. For background, I work in a remote marketing company in the US that pays 18 dollars an hour that has been a bizarre experience (in a very bad way). They fired their employee that trained me right before they offered a paid position too. Probably not a coincidence.\n\nMy work expectations went from conducting audits for social media accounts with Excel and Python (in the first week) to doing a ton of stuff that does not involve coding. I am now expected to manage all 52 of their social media accounts. I have to edit and add captions to videos along with scheduling them, coming up with titles, descriptions, hashtags, tagging people, thumbnail design, etc. I have to be tech support and solve every tech problem they have. I have to manage their database and answer some of their client’s phone calls too regarding whatever questions they have. I am now expected to be their project coordinator too.\n\nRegarding coding related things, they want me to automate employees’ entire workflow, be a cybersecurity expert, design user interfaces, automate website creation for clients, and build AI agents. I do not have the experience, knowledge, or time to do many of these tasks and despite trying to explain these concerns to my employer, it goes on deaf ears as “it’s critical for the company as clients come first.” I only have so much time out the day to do things. It gets worse though.\n\nI am expected to attend the employer’s conferences they host or attend for hours of my weekend for free and they keep handing me entrepreneurial books that I have to read on my own time (I spark noted all of them) and then I have to join their book club for those books. I am getting messaged on night after working hours constantly inquiring about various tasks too.\n\nThere is excessive micromanagement in my opinion that just makes my life miserable. I am expected to give a detailed report every hour (yes, every hour) on what work I’ve done, what work I’m currently doing, the work I have remaining and it’s ETA, what setbacks I’ve had, and proposed solutions. At the end of the day, I’m expected to give a report on what I’ve learned for the day. I also have keep time of every task I have done. There are constant impromptu meetings asking all of this information above along with the fact that we have a Jira like website that has this information already which makes it insanely redundant.\n\nWhat is the craziness level here? Have any of you experienced this before? This does not seem normal to me whatsoever.\n\nEDIT - I am the only tech worker in the company.",

Don't have too much alpha on Jump other than that they're secretive, make tonnes of money and super tech focussed.",
