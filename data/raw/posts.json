Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.\n\nBeing new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.\n\nThe premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!\n\nFast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.\n\nEvery single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.\n\nMassive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nIn none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always \"because that's how it's done today\", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.\n\nChoosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...\n\nSure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the \"collecting\" part and completely disregard the \"let's do something useful with this\" part.\n\nI understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying \"people will do anything to avoid using a database\".\n\nAnyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",

Spent roughly 5 years at my current job, all with excellent reviews each year, survived the last round of layoffs, had my performance review which basically said don't make any thing and start putting process in place while the ceo just looked at me in disgust.

I've been applying to jobs, but I usually get stopped where they are looking for cloud experience. \n\nI've been working with data for almost 20 years now, so I'm hoping my experience can help in terms of getting a job. Does anyone have any advice out there for how to get an in on cloud experience or what places look for with cloud experience? Would the certifications be enough?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.\n\nWhy am I potentially cooked?\n\nData stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. \n\nNow that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.\n\nI asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.\n\nI know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.\n\nI’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?\n\nTldr:\nAlmost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.\n\nPrecog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish. \nEach has tradeoffs depending on your scale, team size, and needs.

I work on this project with a senior dev with 10+YOE.\n\nA lot of my work on this project feels like I'm reinventing the wheel. My senior dev strives for minimizing dependencies to not be tied to any package which makes sense to some extent, but we are only really using a standard API library and pyodbc. I don't really deal with any business logic and have been basically recreating an ORM from the ground up. And at times I feel like I'm writing C code, like checking for return codes and validating errors at the start of every single method and not utilizing exceptions. \n\nI don't mean to knock this senior dev in any way, he has a ton of experience and I have learned a lot about writing clean code, but there are some things that throw me off from what I read online about Python best practices. From what I read, it seems like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Prefect are popular frameworks for creating ETL solutions in Python. \n\nFrom experienced Python developers: is this approach — sticking to vanilla Python, minimizing dependencies, and using very defensive coding patterns — considered reasonable for ETL work?

Redirect is only available to Fabric engines and likely is some internal library for translating OneLake paths to ADLS paths. Proxy is for everything else (including 3rd party engines) and is probably just as it sounds some additional compute layer to hide direct access to ADLS.\n\nI also think that there may be some caching on Fabric side which is only working for Fabric engines...\n\nMy scenario - run a query from Snowflake or Spark k8s against an Iceberg table on ADLS and on OneLake. The performance is not the same! OneLake is always worse especially for tables with lots of files...\n\nSo here is my fear - OneLake is not ADLS. It is NOT operating as open storage. It is operating as a premium storage for Fabric and a sub optimal storage for everything else...\n\nJust use ADLS then.. Yes, we do. But every time I chat with our Microsoft reps they are pushing and pushing me to use OneLake. I am concerned that one day they will just deprecate ADLS in favour of OneLake.\n\nLook Fabric might be decent if you love Power BI, but our business runs on 2 clouds. We have transactional workloads on both, and no way are we going to egress all that data to one cloud or another for analytics. Hence we primarily run an open stack and some multi cloud software like Snowflake.\n\nWhat is wrong with ADLS? Why. do they keep pushing to OneLake? Is this is the next lock-in?",

I also find it frustrating that sometimes when I ask a question to different people (whom have been with the team for more than a year) only for them to give off different answers.\n\nOur documentation is so scattered its stored on individual or group OneNote, confluence, excel, azure dev ops, some obscure SharePoint, and sometimes pdfs that were just being shared or sometimes not even shared (for reasons beyond my understanding). On the bright side, they are pushing towards a more unified and reliable way of storing documentation. \n\nI get anxious answering to users / operations manager because honestly, I'm scared that what I'm saying is absolutely wrong or something I assumed, so every time I have to ask someone to verify what I'm saying.\n\nI also feel misled with my title of being a data engineer and doing specifically only investigation and escalation to other teams and it feels more like a support rather than a DE (and this is for the whole team, there will be no touching of pipelines / code or actual data).\n\nOn some positive note, I got my AZ-900 and AI-102 (planning for more) and I constantly try to better myself by taking advantage of the free learning sites of the company and now starting some side projects.\n\n  \nGiven of what I am experiencing, is this my cue to find another job ?

The idea is that I run DAGs that fetch data from an API and store it in a database for later processing. Until now, I have coded and run everything on my local machine. However, I now want to run the DAGs without keeping my computer on 24/7. To do so, I plan to set up Airflow 3 and a PostgreSQL database on my Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu 25.4 ARM. Airflow recommends using Docker Compose. I have this up and running, including the PostgreSQL database.\n\nHowever, I am having trouble deploying code/DAGs that I wrote in VSCode on my local machine to the Docker container running on the Raspberry Pi.  \n\nDoes anyone have an easy solution to this problem?

Dumping all the files in a database, keeping them raw, transforming the data in whatever best possible. The files being “open” enables the power of the collective to be added to the project.\n\nI have never organised or initiated anything like this. I have a project management, product management and analytics background but no open source.  I know graphanalytics was used across the massive Panama papers dataset, but never used that technology myself.\n\nI’d be happy to contribute in whatever way possible.\n\nIf you think it could help and I any way and have any resources (time, money, knowledge) and want to contribute - ship in! What would we need to get going? Could we get inspiration from the way “open source” projects are formed? Maybe the first step would just make the files a little easier for everyone to work with - downloaded and transformed, classified by llms etc?

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am seeing A LOT of discussion on AI and I feel nervous b/c I haven't quite integrated AI too much in my workflow yet. To be quite frank, I don't know how just yet - I am supposed to be wrapping up a task and moving onto a brand new project. My current task that I've worked on for some time now has been really all over the place - basically, I'm an analytics engineer and I create the datasets that go into dashboards for stakeholders. I work in a slightly niche scientific domain where the parameters of what I need weren't well described and the only way I know I'm looking at the right thing is eyeballing and seeing which parameter is the one that makes the most sense per the stakeholders ask. The issue I am currently dealing with is our data warehouse went through an upgrade and not all the data I need is there - so I have to sometimes use data from the raw data files. And in those files, I have to go through 2 or 3 and find the parameter by eyeballing b/c I don't know the exact name of the field, but can tell what is the right one by looking at it. Also, how we actually want to use and transform those parameters is constantly changing per stakeholders request. There's just a lot of vagueness in this process that is difficult to be clear with a prompt. \n\nWriting code isn't really the hard part for me (with this work in particular) and so far, I use genAI (my work gives access to GPT-5) to help me debug if something is wrong or give me a better solution to what I'm doing, which it gives me a good answer I'd say 6/10 times. I'm seeing people discuss Claude to an extent they are no longer doing anything technical at all really, just prompting. Is this really is for people's work these days? I feel behind because I use AI very sparingly and haven't touched Claude yet. I'm planning to try it out but idk what is hype or real anymore, on LinkedIn people are teaching vibe coding courses and it's like being made to feel anybody can be an engineer now, no technical skills needed. Or the narrative if you're not using AI, you are going to become irrelevant. It's honestly making me nervous about how to move forward in my career or what to do anymore really. ",

It's been great, but I wanted to up my game, so now I'm following a really enjoyable data engineering Zoom camp. I love it. But what I'm noticing is these tools, great as they may be, they're all higher level abstractions of like what would be core, straight up, no-frills, writing raw syntax to perform multiple different tasks, and when combined together become your powerful ETL or ELT pipelines. \n\nMy question is this, these tools are great. They save so much time, and they have these really nice built-in \"SWE-like\" features, like DBT has nice built-in tests and lineage enforcement, etc., and I love it. But what happens if I'm a brand new practitioner, and I'm learning these tools, and I'm using them religiously, and things start to fail or  or require debugging? Since I only knew the higher-level abstraction, does that become a risk for me because I never truly learned the core syntax that these higher-level abstractions are solving? \n\nAnd on that same matter, can the same be said about agentic AI and MCP servers? These are just higher-level abstractions of what was already a higher-level abstraction in some of these other tools like DBT or Kestra or DLT, etc. So what does that mean as these levels of higher abstraction become magnified and many people entering the workforce, if there is going to be a future workforce, don't ever truly learn the core principles or core syntax? What does that mean for us all if we're relying on higher abstractions and relying on agents to abstract those higher abstractions even further? What does that mean for our skill set in the long-term? Will we lose our skill set? Will we even be able to debug? What do all these AI labs think about that? Or is that what they're banking on?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "My name is Daniel, and I'm an ML Ops engineer at [Anam](https://anam.ai).\n\nAt [Anam](https://anam.ai), we are making a platform for building real-time interactive avatars. One of the key components powering our product is our own video generation model.\n\nWe train it on custom training datasets that require all sorts of pre-processing of video and audio data. We extract embeddings with ML models, use external APIs for annotation and data synthesis, and so on. \n\nWe encountered significant challenges with implementing efficient and versatile sample-level versioning (or caching) for these pipelines, which led us to develop and open-source [Metaxy](https://metaxy.io): the framework that solves metadata management and **sample-level versioning** for multimodal data pipelines.\n\n[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) sits in between high level orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io)) that usually operate at table level and low-level processing engines (such as [Ray](https://ray.io)), passing the exact set of samples that have to be (re) computed to the processing layer and *not a sample more*.\n\n\n## Background\n\nWhen a traditional (tabular) data pipeline gets re-executed, it typically doesn't cost much. Multimodal pipelines are a whole different beast. They require a few orders of magnitude more compute, data movement and AI tokens spent. Accidentally re-executed your Whisper voice transcription step on the whole dataset? Congratulations: $10k just wasted!\n\nThat's why with multimodal pipelines, implementing incremental approaches is a requirement rather than an option. And it turns out, it's damn complicated.\n\n## Introducing Metaxy\n\n[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) is the missing piece connecting traditional orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)) that usually operate at a high level (e.g., updating tables) with the sample-level world of multimodal pipelines.\n\nMetaxy has two features that make it unique:\n\n1. It is able to track partial data updates.\n\n2. It is agnostic to infrastructure and can be plugged into any data pipeline written in Python.\n\nMetaxy's versioning engine:\n\n- operates in batches, easily scaling to millions of rows at a time.\n\n- runs in a powerful remote database or locally with Polars or DuckDB.\n\n- is agnostic to dataframe engines or DBs.\n\n- is aware of *data fields*: Metaxy tracks a dictionary of versions for each sample.\n\nWe have been dogfooding Metaxy at Anam since December 2025. We are running millions of samples through Metaxy. All the current Metaxy functionality has been built for our data pipeline and is used there.\n\n### AI Disclaimer\n\nMetaxy has been developed with the help of AI tooling (mostly Claude Code). However, it should not be considered a vibe-coded project: the core design ideas are human, AI code has been ruthlessly reviewed, we run a very comprehensive test suite with 85% coverage, all the docs have been hand-written (seriously, I hate AI docs), and /u/danielgafni has been working with multimodal pipelines for three years before making Metaxy. A great deal of effort and passion went into Metaxy, especially into user-facing parts and the docs.\n\n## More on Metaxy\n\nRead our [blog post](https://anam.ai/blog/metaxy), [Dagster + Metaxy blog post](https://dagster.io/blog/building-real-time-interactive-avatars-with-metaxy), Metaxy [docs](https://docs.metaxy.io/), and `uv pip install metaxy`!\n\nWe are thrilled to help more users solve their metadata management problems with Metaxy. Please do not hesitate to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/anam-org/metaxy)!",

        "content": "I’ve been digging into the recent news about Fundamental AI coming out of stealth with their Nexus model (a \"Large Tabular Model\" or LTM), and I have some doubts, I wanted to run by this sub.\n\ncontext: we have LLMs for text, but tabular data has always by tree-based models (XGBoost/LightGBM). Nexus claims to be the \"first foundation model for tabular data,\" trained on \"billions of public tables\" to act as an \"operating system for business decisions\" (e.g forecasting, fraud detection, churn).\n\nI have doubt regarding the data standardisation, unlike text, which has a general structure, business data schemas are the messy. \"Revenue\" in Company A might b \"Total\\_Sales\\_Q3\" in Company B. Basically relationships are implicit and messy.\n\nIf businesses don't follow open standards for storing data (which they don't), how can a pre-trained model like Nexus actually work \"zero-shot\" without a massive, manual ETL work?\n\nI've been trying to map where Nexus sits compared to what we already use:\n\n1. Nexus vs. Claude in Excel: Claude in Excel (Anthropic) is basically a super-analyst.  It’s a productivity tool. Nexus claims to be a predictive engine. It integrates into the data stack (AWS) to find non-linear patterns across rows/columns automatically. It’s trying to replace the manual modeling pipeline.\n2. Nexus vs. Deep Learning Architectures (TabNet / iLTM): TabNet (Google) is an architecture you train \"yourself\" on your specific data. It uses sequential attention for interpretability (feature selection).  iLTM (Integrated Large Tabular Model - Stanford/Berkeley) seems to be the academic answer to this. It uses a hypernetwork pre-trained on 1,800+ datasets to generate weights for a specific task. It tries to bridge the gap between GBDTs and Neural Nets. LaTable: This is for generating synthetic data (diffusion).\n\nQuestions for the community:\n\n1. Has anyone actually tested a \"Foundation Model\" for tabular data (like Nexus or the open-source iLTM) on messy, real-world dirty data?\n2. Can an LTM really learn the \"schema\" of a random SQL dump well enough to predict fraud without manual feature engineering?\n3. Is this actually a replacement for ETL/Feature Engineering, or just another black box that will fail when Column\\_X changes format?",

The pipeline picks up flat files from ADLS and processes them via SQL scripts, dataflows and a messy data model. It fails frequently and also silently. On top of that is the analytics part for PowerBI dashboarding within the same model (which is broken as well).\n\nI have the feeling that Synapse is not really made for that and it gets confusing very quickly. I am thinking of creating a Python service within Azure Container Apps for the integration part and splitting it from the Analytics data. I am familiar with Python and my boss inherited the mess as well, so he is open to a different setup. Do you think this is a good approach or should I look elsewhere?",

That’s fine until you actually need low-latency analytics, live dashboards, or fast iteration on streaming data - then you’re suddenly standing up Flink, renting beefy cloud instances, or duct-taping together tools that were never designed for the job. Even worse - you go to push it into Databricks that you are paying 20k a month for and it doesn’t really stream. Mate.\n\nI kept running into this, so I’ve been building [Minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow) \\- a fast, minimal columnar data library that’s wire-compatible with Apache Arrow but purpose-built to run efficiently on a single machine.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Core data building block paired with “*SIMD-Kernels*” crate -> delivers sub-second aggregations on laptop-class hardware - no cluster, no JVM/Java OOM, no orchestrator\n* Drives live dashboards directly from streaming data without an intermediate warehouse or materialised view layer (you and/or your mate Claude still need to wire it up yourself)\n* Converts to Arrow, Polars, or PyArrow at the boundary via zero-copy, so it slots into existing ecosystems without serialisation overhead *(.to\\\\\\_polars() in Rust)*\n* Pairs with a companion crate (*Lightstream*) if you want to push results straight to the browser over WebSocket\n\n**Where it fits** *(and where it doesn’t):*\n\nThis sits at pipeline as code, or the engine-internals level. It’s a building block for engineers who are comfortable constructing pipelines and systems, not a plug-and-play BI tool. If your workload is distributed and you genuinely need horizontal scale, keep using Spark/Flink - Minarrow won’t replace that.\n\nBut if you’re in the zone - and prefer compiling for performance, and working with the blocks you need, this is the layer I wanted to exist and couldn’t find.\n\nHappy to answer questions, take criticism, or hear what you feel you’ve actually been missing in your stack.\n\nAlso, if you’ve focused more on the Python side happy to help point you into Rust land.\n\nThanks for checking it out.",

I don’t see a bright future there any longer but the role is well paid and fully remote.\n\nOne of my options will likely be a team lead role. The job is for a regionally recognized software company that works in the finance space. It’s likely similar to a data engineering and architect role with some management of some junior developers. The role will be more corporate and pays roughly the same after the year-end bonus but will require being in-office twice a week.\n\nThe other option is a senior data engineering role at another smaller startup that just raised some capital. It’s better paid but will require being in-office three times a week. Overall, the leadership team is strong and everyone on the team seems very down-to-earth.\n\nWhat would you guys lean towards? Is getting into management in a tech context worth it at this point? Does it offer any advantages as far as AI-proofing?\n\nEdit: typos and context",

Our sources include various Marketing APIs, MySQL, and SQL Server On Prem Source Systems. Currently, we use Metadata Driven Ingestion via Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load data directly into a dedicated SQL Server Bronze DB.\n\nOption A: Dedicated Bronze Database (SQL Server)\n\nThe Setup: Ingestion goes straight into SQL tables. Dev and Prod DWH reside on different servers. The Dev environment accesses the Prod Bronze DB via Linked Servers.\n\nWorkflow: Engineers have write access to Bronze for manual CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements. Silver/Gold are read-only and managed via CI/CD.\n\nOption B: ADLS Gen2 Data Lake (Parquet)\n\nThe Setup: Redirect the ADF metadata pipelines to write data as Parquet files to ADLS before loading into the DWH. Tho, this feels like significant engineering overhead for little benefit. I would need to manage/orchestrate two independent metadata pipelines to feed Dev and Prod Lake containers. But I will still need to somehow create a staging layer or db for both dev and prod so dbt can pick up from there as it cant natively connect to adls storage and ingest the data. So i need to use ADF again to go from the Data in the Lake to both environments seperately. \n\nAt 100GB, is the Data Lake approach over-engineered? If a source schema breaks the Prod load, it has to be fixed regardless of the storage layer. I just dont see the point of the Data Lake anymore. In case we wanna migrate in the future to Snowflake or smth a data lake would already been setup. Even tho even in that case I would simply create the Data Lake „quickly“ using ADFs copy activity and dump everything from the PROD Bronze DB into that Lake as a starting point. \n\nAny help is appreciated!",

        "author": "Prudent-Newt-7603",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "We’re currently running our data warehouse on SQL Server on an Azure VM and only have a single production environment. We want to move to a proper DEV/STAGING and PROD setup so we can test changes safely before promoting them to production.\n\nAt the same time, we’re also introducing Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) as a central landing zone for raw data. Instead of ingesting directly into SQL Server like we do today, data will first land in ADLS in partitioned Parquet format (for example `/bronze/<source>/<table>/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/`). From there, it would be loaded into SQL Server. This should give us better control, allow replay/backfills if needed, and make it easier to keep DEV and PROD consistent.\n\nHistorically, most of our transformations were implemented using stored procedures directly in SQL Server. As things have grown more complex, this has become difficult to maintain and version properly, so we want to move transformation logic into dbt to get proper version control, modularity, and lineage.\n\nThe main challenge we’re facing is around ingestion and schema management. dbt assumes that the source tables already exist in the warehouse, but in our case those bronze tables need to be created and updated first, including handling schema changes like new tables or columns.\n\nSince PROD will be locked down (engineers shouldn’t be able to write to it directly), we need a controlled way to manage and promote schema changes from DEV/STAGING to PROD. We also need a reliable way to ingest data from ADLS into both environments, either incrementally or as full reloads, without maintaining everything manually.\n\nRight now, we see two main options:\n\n**Option 1:**   \nUse a migration tool like Flyway? to manage bronze table schemas via version-controlled migrations. ADF would then load data from ADLS into those bronze tables in both DEV and PROD, ideally using a metadata-driven approach.\n\n**Option 2:**  \nUse external tables (there is apparently a dbt-external-source tables package that could handle that directly within the dbt repository) over ADLS and let dbt read directly from the data lake and materialize bronze or staging tables itself using incremental models. This would reduce the amount of ingestion logic in ADF, but we’re not sure how well this works with SQL Server on an Azure VM, especially around incremental loads, schema changes, and operational stability. Also given that the data is organized as `/bronze/<source>/<table>/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/` would that even work as a pointer?  \n\n\nAny help would be great!!",

        "content": "Hello! I'm currently in a Business Analyst trainee position at an insurance company, six months into a 12-month program. The problem is that I don't feel fulfilled in terms of growth and challenge; I work exclusively with PROC SQL and SAS, simply joining tables and creating basic rules for them.\n\nI recently received an offer to work as an Intern Data Engineer at Natixis. For the first two months, I would attend an internal academy to learn their tech stack (which involves a significant salary hit during this period). This would be followed by three months of on-the-job training (where the pay is similar to my current salary) and, finally, a six-month \"solo\" professional internship where the pay exceeds my current salary by a good margin.\n\nI am inclined to accept the offer, but it has its downsides: the initial salary hit, a fully on-site schedule for the first two months (though it eventually moves to three days remote, compared to my current two), and one extra working hour per day (moving from a 35-hour week to a 40-hour week). Both jobs require about a one-hour commute each way.\n\nI'm wondering if I should take this opportunity (being that currently I have zero monetary responsibilities), or if I am simply being over-optimistic about the growth potential of a Data Engineering career path, a field that genuinely interests me.",

        "content": "TL;DR\n\n***Claude code + DW MCP server = Reliable Data Models***\n\nHey guys! I have been a data engineer for 10+ years now and have worked at several big tech companies and was always skeptical at LLM's ability to reason over messy data sources to produce reliable fct/agg tables to service business analytics. My experience had been that they lack the domain knowledge for the data sources and business rules. \n\n**HOWEVER**… This week I built a data mart (dbt+duckdb) sourced from a very messy and obscure data source coming from a legacy (think 80s SW) ERP system, with claude code and was blown away by the results!!\n\nI found that giving claude code the following produced exceptional results basically in one shot! (*footer has this laid out in more details*)\n\n* A duckdb MCP server so that it can explore the raw data itself \n* **VERY** clear explanations on the analytical use cases \n* **VERY** explicit data modelling patterns (raw -> stg -> fct -> agg)\n* Quick blurb on what I know about the source system and encouraging it to search online and learn more before diving in\n\nThe data mart produced was clean, effective, easy to query, and most importantly correct and reliable. Hierarchy was respected all agg sourced from fct all fct from stg and all stg from source. It built a few robust core fct tables that then serviced multiple aggs for each analytical use case I outlined. I was using DBT so in my prompt I stressed data quality and trust so it added tests. \n\nWith 10+ years of experience it would have probably taken me a week to build, what claude code did in an afternoon. While this data mart still would still require further testing and QA before I would be confident in rolling it out to the broader org it made me realize that AI can in fact write high quality SQL.\n\nThis experiment got me thinking... As these base models keep getting better (this was on Opus 4.6) the research, reason, explore, build, test loop that I prompted my claude code to do for this project is only going to get better. So that means 1 DE who knows what they are doing and understands core data modelling principles really well can in fact replace an entire DE team and move much faster **IF** they are able to harness the true power of these AI agents.\n\nMy next experiment is going to be trying to bundle my learnings from this project into a skill and just letting loose on a new data source and seeing what comes out.\n\nCurious has anyone else done something similar? Would also love to hear peoples thoughts on AI agents in the realm of DE where mistakes are really costly and you basically cant afford even 1 because stakeholders will loose trust instantly and never touch your data assets again.\n\n\\------------\n\n***Technical Notes***\n\n* AI Agent = Claude code/Opus 4.6\n* Source data was in a MSSQL Server\n* Relevant source tables extracted to a duckdb database in their raw form\n* Final DB was another duckdb db\n* DBT used for transformations\n* Motherduck Duckdb MCP server so the AI Agent can query the db's (although sometimes I noticed Claude just resorted to using the duckdb cli or running via python -c) \n* High level workflow; \n   * Explain to agent what produced the source data, what analytical use cases we want to service, what data modelling patterns to follow, ask it to do research and come back to me. \n   * Go back and forth clarifying a few things\n   * Ask it to use the MCP server to explore the raw data and run exploratory queries so it can get its bearings\n   * Enter plan mode and ask it to start designing the data mart, review the plan, discuss as needed, and then let it execute\n   * Ask it to use the MCP server to QA the data mart it produced (apply fixes if needed)\n   * Ask it to verify metric values sourced from data mart vs. raw data (apply fixes if needed)\n\n[DBT produced lineage graph \\(sorry for it being unreadable but this was for a client and they would like table names to remain private.... green = source tables\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gl5bvx8hn2jg1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=305954d6c8b0edf58138568f87c0f8e61cbf1482)\n\n",

        "author": "DuztyLipz",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Alright, let me preface this by saying that I'm not a software engineer by profession, but I have been coding for \\~6-7 years. I came to an epiphany/connected the dots. This post may not fit everybody, but hopefully, this can get *someone* out of a rut. Apologies for non-technical refinement/terms in advance.\n\nSo, when I used to watch fundamentals tutorials or lurk Reddit, people would always say something to the effect of \"just build stuff\"... I always wondered why that was or why they would say that without the reason why. I had a tough time grasping object-oriented programming (non-sequitur: we gotta stop using the Animal -> Dog -> Labrador example for OOP... I think it confuses people), but I kept building with OOP--and with the help of others' code in The Odin Project and seeing how it was **actually applied**\\--I had the \"aha\" moment needed to understand OOPs purpose. Here's the kicker though: **there are actually terms for this and why building is so crucial**. Now, it's an adjacent field, but these terms also apply to how programmers think... The terms are: [mathematical maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity), ***mathematical insight***, and [mathematical intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition). It's crucial to tell you--or whom it may concern--exactly what they are.\n\n***Mathematical Maturity*** is basically someone's experience with math, *especially mathematical understanding that is not directly taught*. Mathematicians seriously have to grind math problems because being instructed by teachers only goes so far. You gain more maturity via repeated exposure. Grinding enough problems over and over again makes you reach ***mathematical insight***.\n\n***Mathematical Insight*** is where you have that \"Aha!\" moment, that \"oooooh, that's what that does\". This happens when you \"build stuff\" or solve problems. This happened with me stuck in \"OOP hell\"... After finally applying it in an appropriate way (instead of Animal -> Dog -> Labrador) and applied it to different things, I gained a deeper understanding of it that I could **never** get from a tutorial.  Mathematical insight can't be directly taught. You grind problems/build stuff to get that \"Aha!\" moment.\n\n***Mathematical Intuition*** is where you've grinded the concept so much, it's apart of your repertoire. You don't even need to think of \"how\" it works because you upped your mathematical maturity and insight through applying what you've learned, *instead of watching tutorials;* therein deepening your understanding. This also helps with you understanding the range of projects you can do. It's just a matter of \"how to logically structure \\[insert program\\]\".\n\nThat's basically it. \"Building stuff\" actually makes these programming concepts stick in your mind. The reason I posted this is two-fold: 1.) It would, hopefully, get someone out of a rut and 2.) Give those who say \"build stuff\" a few terms that can exactly describe how crucial it is... For anyone in the industry/do this professionally... What are your thoughts on this? All criticism is welcome",

Pulling 13 hour shifts and working on weekend became normal at this. I deployed  stuff for production for front, back, various microservices and new projects. I would love to learn to code myself more, i thought thats what internships were for, but every day we are set insane deadlines that are impossible to meet without ai and all nighters. Is that supposed to be normal for internships lol. Labor protections suck ass in my country. Honestly, every day i feel like as a junior this industry sucks ass and every day junior developers are more and more devalued due to ai. Funnily enough, this job overall is still better than what i had before (i worked at food delivery with a scooter and as a waiter before this, holy shit its bad)\n\njust some venting. cheers",

I was trying to use AI as a career advisor and it sent me on the QA path, to find the job in iGaming, since I have 10 years of gaming industry experience (Casinos mostly) but I am not sure. Is it the right choice to squeeze into the tech world? Spend hundreds on courses and certificates? (I will be relocating in Europe, Lithuania)  \n I was learning frontend several years ago and I got stuck, but i genuinely enjoyed the challenge. Am interested in Python but since it's almost impossible to get the job in a year as a backend newbie, I am planning to pursue it after I get the stable job. What do you think, will the certificates be useful without the college degree? Is the QA Manual a good choice? ",

Any advice for those of us past junior level but struggling to find the knowledge to become a senior?\n\nI hear often that senior roles require a greater understanding of company goals and cross team functionality - I understand the importance of that - but I am purely just asking about the technical level and how to gain that in depth knowledge of systems and tools.\n\nThank you so much!",

        "author": "normantas",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Preface. I have 4YOE as backend engineer. I use Azure with some tiny experience with React + TypeScript when I worked in teams that had some React components or a webpage. I have used RabbitMQ and Mass Transit with PostgreSQL.\n\nI still can't wrap my head around why use Message Brokers (MB). Sometimes I find their use. You have an API and a pods for long jobs. The ones that take at least few seconds. So let's say API takes in a massive file and does a request for a long calculation operation which queues a task to the Pods.\n\nWhere my issue falls is when the operation is short so giving it to a message broker does not seem to make sense. It feels a lot of times it is not worth to create the logic for message brokers.\n\nI was reading about making a URL shortener. One person said if you want metrics you will want to use a MB to log statistics and usage. Why not just push the request locally on same instance of a service just different process/thread. I do not thing logging statistics take that much resources? Would it not slow down giving the request and add costs for running 2 services instead of one? A lot of programs nowadays run on 1 thread and just use the async/await pattern as creating a new process is costly.\n\nThe primary values I find in message brokers:\n\n1. Separation of intents and simplifying services. So basically microservices. Though a lot of people are moving to \"modular monolith\" structure where you create a new service when it is needed.\n2. Orchestrating long running tasks.\n3. If you have few seperate services on same machine, some MB can read the RAM data and reuse it which lowers the memory usageand speeds up the process by not sending the data but just re-reading the same data from RAM.\n4. There is probably a case of improved Horizontal scaling.\n\nBoth can be done with an API (without the use case of RAM), though API adds some bloat but so do message brokers and not sure if managing something more complex is worth the investment. I guess also small benefit of some MB is sequentiality of tasks or in case the process fails, it stores the tasks. Though not all MB do that.\n\nIt just creates me  lot of confusion (as my writing is probably all over the places so the confusion is shown). To me it has tradeoffs though I see a lot of people putting MB where they can instead of evaluating if it is worth it.\n\nCan someone give me good project ideas, examples to master the value of MB? Message broker usage is so far and wide and sometimes I do not understand why not just have an API that is closed to external traffic?\n\nI'll give an example of a project I think could use MB: A web Crawler. There is a crawler that collects web pages. Fills the queue with URLs and the Workers consume the URLs and extract data. That is how I would do a basic crawlers for data collection. Data collection like metadata, Urls can take multiple DB queries and such so it can take up to 100ms on a massive page. Though I have to take into account if the Web Crawler can't do the same. If the added time for sending the request take a while. Why use workers? I just add more time to work by sending the request and waiting for it to be consumed.",

It’s basically an automated form where you enter your name, the station, select a specific part from a dropdown, and add a short description of the issue (after it’s fixed) so the next shift has proper documentation and certain parts can be monitored.\n\nI work with Excel on a surface level and thought this would be something like:\n\n“Delete a few unnecessary dropdowns, add some new ones, rename a few labels — done.”\n\nSince nobody else was interested, I said I’d give it a try. I made it clear that this would be somewhat experimental on my end. My boss was totally fine with that and said I could take as much time as I need. We currently use our own list, but it’s all free text, which makes filtering difficult. For example, one station is officially called “03st02,” but colleagues enter things like “3st2” or “3-2”… you get the idea.\n\nAnyway — I received the file and the password for the VBA project.\n\nAnd wow. I completely underestimated it.\n\nThe file basically contains a full program running in the background, constantly cross-checking every input. I can’t just remove, add, or rename anything without breaking everything else. And honestly, for our department’s needs, it feels way overengineered. The deeper I dive into the code, the more confusing (and unnecessary) it seems.\n\nI’ve told my boss that I don’t think adapting this file makes sense and that I’d rather build something new from scratch. He’s fine with that — no pressure.\n\nBut if I’m going to do this, I want to do it properly. So I need to actually learn VBA.\n\nCan you recommend some good beginner-level YouTube tutorials to get started? German or English is fine. I also wouldn’t mind paid courses if they’re really worth it.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAI-Usage for grammar etc",

I was making a simple program to just ask for a users age, and then name. The age section worked perfectly but for name it automatically is assuming nothing and moved ahead without input. Just putting nothing where I put the variable name. Is getline(cin, name) ; not correct? I am sorry if this is a simple answer, I looked stuff up but wasn't finding answers to my specific problem. Any and all help is appreciated :D",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m planning a small, local delivery platform inspired by Wolt/UberEats, but starting very lean. The idea is to have three roles: customers who can browse products, add them to a cart and place orders, stores/restaurants that only see and manage their own orders and products, and in-house couriers who get assigned deliveries and update their status through a mobile-first interface (likely a PWA).\n\nI want to avoid reinventing basic e-commerce logic, but I also don’t want to be locked into a heavy platform that fights against delivery-style workflows. I’ve looked at Bagisto and similar full platforms, but they feel very e-commerce-centric. Lately I’ve been considering Laravel with LunarPHP (core + Filament admin) and building the store, courier and dispatch logic on top of that.\n\nDoes LunarPHP sound like a reasonable foundation for this kind of project, or would you recommend a different stack or approach? I’m mostly interested in starting with a clean architecture that can scale later.\n\nThanks!",

I'm trying to make a game engine but I don't know how to correctly serialise meshes and their references. The issue is that a mesh is contained inside another model file so I can't just save the file path and call it a day. So far I've been extracting out all the individual meshes into their own files and saving that filepath, but I've reached the point where I'd like to keep all the meshes in the same model file again. Any ideas as to how I can do this would be great, thanks! ",

While searching, I came across a few options like the Full Stack Developer course by Angela Yu and some other free courses on YouTube. When I checked Angela Yu’s course, I found that its duration is 62 hours. However, some of my friends suggested that it might be too short and that I should look for courses that are more in-depth.\nRight now, I am really confused. Can you please suggest which course I should follow? Should I go with Angela Yu’s course, or are there any better alternatives that you would recommend? Your guidance would be a great help.\nThank you.",

I started by playing around in the console, recording the steps - then decided that I'd write the bootstrapping code for the project (set the context, create the storage account, create an identity for automation, create certs and keys, etc., etc...) using Powershell (I was familiar but not strong when I started). Then I decided I'd try using TDD for this - something that I know in theory but have never really practiced...\n\nSeveral months later, \\*just\\* the bootstrapping of the project is taking up all my spare time - admittedly, that's not a huge amount of spare time as there is a lot going on in my life at the moment. Granted, I've learnt an absolute shit-load about Powershell and Pester - and i'm still really enjoying it - but how do you stop this happening? Any hints and tips for limiting the rabbit-holes on personal projects like this?",

The quality gap has narrowed. \n\nWith Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitHub, and real-time dashboards, accountability is no longer the barrier it once was. \n\nWork is visible and there are tons of tools in place for checks and balances before code gets deployed. \n\nAdd AI to that stack, code review tools, copilots, automated testing, and suddenly the difference in execution shrinks even more. \n\nOffshore teams are no longer turning out to be unreliable. They're writing code with AI and increasing velocity. \n\nProduct strategy and client-facing roles are still staying in the US, but a large portion of engineering execution, the high-paying core, is increasingly moving out. \n\nIf a company can get comparable output at a fraction of the cost, the incentive is obvious. How are US developers supposed to compete in that environment?",

From the moment of waking up, until going to bed, I would stay anxious, would keep on getting teams messages from my manager and director, and would always be worried and anxious about delivering my work.\n\nSix months ago my team got internally switched and not only my tech stack changed, but also I was unable to understand anything in the new team -- how deployment worked, unit testing, which person takes care of which thing, whom to reach out when people have a disagreement on the approach you used, etc etc.\n\nIn my previous team, there was a collaborative environment. The team knew there are things that I don't know, because they have never been properly communicated, so I was helped with that. There are changes in the team or deployment process? communicated. Some new framework? communicated. Some update in our best practices? communicated too.\n\nBut in the new team, the approach turned out to be very much 'sink or swim'. You are told some things initially but then rest of the things, even processes, even whom to reach out and even what to do when there is a conflict with someone else, everything was left on you. Your ticket/task was handled to you and it was said to be your ownership \n\nThe moment you are assigned your task, you treat it like a sword hanging near your neck and you do everything possible to deliver it on time. Something unexpected causing delays? Some other component which you rely on, not working properly? Nobody cares. You need to deliver on the deadline anyhow.\n\nI don't really like this kind of a culture, really. I loved the old, collaborative culture where it felt like we are working on a mission together with our team. Where our team is not our enemy, but they are comrades. But my director told me that if I don't become highly independent, I won't survive the industry.\n\nHas it become become the norm lately that sink or swim is the only approach to work being adopted in the tech industry? Is there no scope of collaborative and friendly cultures anymore?",

There's also mandatory 5-day RTO (with rumored hourly minimums).\n\nThe offer for the new job starts in June, 2 day hybrid office requirement, and is 15 minutes from home. The question is, how do I actually make this transition? Do I do as much work as possible to offset my team having to essentially interview, hire and onboard someone new? When should I let my manager know? The priority is minimizing the impact my early departure could potentially have.\n\nThank you.",

It’s not a big prestigious company like amazon but im literally so happy and cannot complain.\n\nIm like one of the dumbest people I know so if I can do it, SO CAN YOU. DONT GIVE UP!! if you are still struggling to find an internship, here are some tips that helped me:\n\n* use linkedin to network but not for applying to jobs. they repost jobs and it’s just a waste of time because everyone is applying to those postings\n* surround yourself with ambitious friends. im so thankful that my friends are so smart and supportive because they helped me fix my resume, and seeing their success just motivates me to do better\n* in the job interview, you need to show some personality. lots of candidates focus too much on GETTING the interview but remember you also need to pass it, show that you are someone enjoyable to be around\n* try to find internships the moment they get posted, literally the day of. constantly refresh github repos, intern insider, discord, etc. or stalk company sites directly\n* stay consistent and protect your mental health. I kept applying even when nothing was working, but I also made sure I had hobbies and friends outside of job hunting so rejections did not completely wreck me\n\nAt the end of the day, i think it’s just a game of luck. Keep putting shots up and eventually one will fall in.. or something like that. Happy to answer any questions about my job search and help give more advice if youre struggling!",

        "content": "Hey all. So I was thinking on how I may have made a mistake. I started as a CS major and completed one year, then took about a year and a half off for work that required me to be out of state for a small period of time, that also had impractical hours. I’m back in school now, but I feel like CS might not be for me.\n\nI thought I could handle coding, but I’m struggling. I’m behind in math after the break, which I will work on. Also struggling on programming, especially debugging and thinking through logic. It takes a lot of time and mental energy, and I’m not sure if I can improve. I only have about a year left before transferring to a university, so I feel pressure not to waste time or money.\n\nI feel like I’m more hands-on. I do well with clear instructions and practical tasks. I am considering something more hardware-based, IT, wiring, or a technical field that’s less focused on pure coding. Now, I can’t tell if this is self-doubt or a real realization. Should I push through, switch to something related but more practical, or explore a different path entirely? I never really knew what to do, but went on to choose CS due to its job outlook back in 2023. \n\nI really just need some honest advice.\n\nEdit: I may have not chosen the best words. When I say I’m more hands-on, I don’t mean I can only follow instructions. We all can do that. I just tend to perform better in practical, structured environments. My issue seems to be specifically with coding.",

The upside is that I’ve gotten broad experience across the entire software lifecycle: building features, fixing bugs/hotfixes, writing tests, doing code reviews, managing CI/CD, handling releases (dev/prod + mobile builds), planning, etc.. I’ve learned a lot and have had a lot of ownership. We are trying to do everything according to best practices, if we can.\n\nThe downside is that I’m significantly underpaid for the scope of work, and the company has become increasingly chaotic. A few months ago I realized I should probably move on.\n\nRecruiter outreach has been decent (a few LinkedIn messages per week), and I’ve started applying and studying to fill in gaps. Still, I’ve been feeling oddly demotivated and worried that starting at a messy startup might hurt my long-term prospects.\n\nStill, I feel pretty demotivated and I’m not sure why. I’m hoping that my experience and time are on my side, and that sooner or later I’ll end up at a better company. I know, some people can't even get experience, so I'm glad for that at least.\n\n  \nOne thing I’m sure about is that at this startup I gained experience that I would have had no chance of getting at a large company, so I’m happy about that.\n\n**So the main question of this post:** are there people here who started at a “shitty” or low-quality company and later made it to FAANG or just built a solid career overall?\n\nWould appreciate hearing some success stories or perspective from people who’ve been in a similar spot.",

Long time ago when I was unemployed making posts here, I had people say things like \"You sound like you deserve to work in FAANG, give me your resume\" you don't work in FAANG get the fuck out of here. \"Yo send me your resume. I'll give you much better advice than the people commenting on your post. They don't know anything 🤣🤣\" No you won't. You won't say anything different from the other 100+ comments. Fuck off.\n\nI had to enable the hide all posts feature on my profile because of this sub. I would post something on a completely different sub and someone from this sub will then go over there and comment \"Did you hear back from xyz's assessment?\" referring to a post I made here like 2 years ago...like what the fuck is wrong with some of you? I had one guy send me his LinkedIn after sending me a few messages I never responded to a long time trying to become best friends through Reddit dms. Most of us on Reddit use this platform anonymously. We're not trying to show our real identity. The other issue I have with this is that some of you are currently in uni. Why don't you guys try to interact with CS people in your lectures, tutorials, labs, or the tech club at your uni? For all you know, you could be talking to some guy on this sub who's living on another continent who you will never meet in real life. At least interact with your community at uni/college.\n\nI should've made this post a long time ago but better late than never. The main thing to be careful is to watch out for the people trying expose your identity through something like \"send me your resume\".

My old job as an SWE was genuinely like the only redeeming quality I have. I'm not cool, charismatic, skilled, or attractive like other people. I'm trying to change that, but no matter what I do, I just lack in comparison to other people online and IRL. Most of the people I live have tech jobs still – hell, I see a few still wearing their badges from my old company. I'm kind of tempted to try a career pivot and get a master's because of the whole AI thing, but I don't know if I can get into that great of a school (and in turn, I don't know how accomplished I could get to feel).\n\nI don't have a job like other people I know now. Outside of my team, almost all of the people I know at my old company still have their jobs. I also feel even more envious than usual of people that were able to get into really prestigious companies that I've gotten rejected from multiple times (namely Google and Apple). Every time I meet someone new, there's that inevitable circle of everyone saying what they do for a living. It honestly feels like I'm lying if I were to say I'm still a software engineer, so I usually end up caving and saying that I got laid off and am searching. I was debating whether to try to hang out with my friends, but I can't help but feel somewhat avoidant since I'd be the oddball.\n\nI know it's technically not my fault (it was a mass layoff of thousands of people, then half my old team including my manager), but as is, I still don't have a job anymore. Beyond getting another position (which I'm of course, working on), I don't really think there's a way to feel better. I wish I could rewind – maybe I could've made it to another company out of college that didn't do mass layoffs..",

It’s not just AI taking everyone’s jobs (maybe some of them, sure), but a lot of work is simply being outsourced to cheaper labor markets : Eastern Europe, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc.\n\nI’m pretty active on a bunch of subreddits, and the difference is obvious. You’ve got people in the US and Western Europe saying they’ve applied to 100+ jobs and can’t even land an interview. Meanwhile, people in places like India or the Philippines talk pretty casually about getting IT jobs, call center work, remote contracts  and earning high income ( relative to their country’s norm) .\n\nIf someone like Trump argues that protectionist policies are necessary to protect Western industries,  workers and western dominance , and points to China building its economy off the back of offshored manufacturing , then why isn’t this treated the same way? Offshoring these tech jobs might not look as dramatic as factories moving overseas, but it’s shifting income, skills, and long-term capacity to other countries. It should be treated as a threat to western dominance \n\nAnd the bigger picture is this: when you offshore work, you’re not just saving money in the short term. You’re helping build those countries skilled workforce. Over time, those countries  will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.\n\nIt just feels like we’re watching the same pattern repeat, only this time with tech and services instead of manufacturing. Maybe it’s a bit wild to say but I don’t think companies that offshore lots of their jobs like this should be allowed to operate in the country or at the very least they should face much higher taxation that makes offshoring unattractive ",

The job is way chiller than I ever could have expected. I'm fully remote, on a team of five (with some very experienced people), On Call weekend once every ten weeks or so but it's generally very uneventful. Leadership is thoughtful, people get along, WLB is amazing (working hours are working hours, 4 weeks PTO, etc). It's really a genuinely great situation. \n\nThe bad is that the work isn't really challenging or interesting. We maintain probably 20-30 different legacy Java applications, frequently that just looks like small little feature or workflow changes, database work, or some kind of server script that needs to be done. We're in the process of modernizing them - but the vast majority (which truly are very simple boring CRUD workflows) are getting moved into a proprietary \"pro-code\" platform (a convuluted, absolute mess of a thing that uses java objects in a bizarre way) with the remaining 5-6 of them being rewritten as cloud native react apps. \n\nRight now, we're inbetween that. Theres a few developers that are staying pretty busy doing deep dives into a high impact java app that was originally written around 2006, but the rewrites haven't started yet and I find myself doing super low impact work and trying to \"look\" busy because theres just not much to do. For a while I was enjoying that - doing projects around the house or the yard but now I'm over that. I want to do something interesting and I have NO interest in taking part in the low code nonsense. I'm being underutilized. I also only get paid around 65k (LCOL area so whatever, but even the \"leads\" are barely pushing 100). \n\nIt seems obvious to look for something else but I work with awesome people, have a ton of free time, fully remote, AND good management? I'd hate to leave and go somewhere else thats miserable. \n\nBackground: 31, Career changer, went to an average state school after high school for accounting, proceeded to go work at a car dealership because I liked cars and hated taxes. Did pretty well, moved through the ranks, wanted to do something more intellectually challenging, went back to school (WGU don't flame me) to get a CS degree (honestly I was always a nerd who understood computers well and tinkered with stuff so I was more looking for the HR checkbox, I know it's not great though). Decent soft skills, better than a lot of my coworkers for sure, could probably do well at leetcode mediums if I gave it some effort, but no strong interest in relocating. Would consider myself competent and a strong employee but I'm probably never going to be the guy coding on the weekends because he just loves it that much. Have considered signing up for OMSCS to lose some of that wgu stigma and open up possibilities but with AI here it kind of feels like: why? ",

        "content": "This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.\n\nSoftware engineering used to feel like the golden path. High pay, tons of demand, solid job security. Then bootcamps blew up, CS enrollments exploded, and now it feels pretty saturated at the entry level. On top of that, AI tools are starting to automate parts of coding, which makes the future feel a bit uncertain.\n\nNow I’m wondering if machine learning is heading in the same direction.\n\nML pays a lot of money right now. The salaries are honestly a big part of why people are drawn to it. But I’m seeing more and more people pivot into ML, more courses, more degrees, more certifications, and some universities are even starting dedicated AI degrees now. It feels like everyone wants in. People from all kinds of backgrounds are moving into ML and AI too, math majors, engineering majors, stats, physics, and even people outside traditional tech paths, similar to how CS became the default choice for so many different majors a few years ago. At the same time, tools are getting better. With foundation models and high-level frameworks, you don’t always need to build things from scratch anymore.\n\nAs a counterpoint though, ML is definitely harder than traditional CS in a lot of ways. The math, the theory, reading research papers, running experiments. The learning curve feels steeper. It’s not something you can just pick up in a few months and be truly good at. So maybe that barrier keeps it from becoming as saturated as general software engineering?\n\nI’m personally interested in going into AI and robotics, specifically machine learning or computer vision at robotics companies. That’s the long term goal. I just don’t know if this is still a smart path or if it’s going to become overcrowded and unstable in the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nWould love to hear from people already in ML or robotics. Is it still worth it? Or are we heading toward the same oversaturation issues that SWE is facing?",

Obviously, job hunting is a numbers game, and there's a random element to it. But I genuinely haven't had a **single** organic interview during this entire period. Even some years ago, when I was unemployed for an extended period like this, I was still able to land an interview every month or so.\n\nFor context, I have over 6 years of professional experience and a background in React, JavaScript + TypeScript, Python, and more. These are, no doubt, heavily crowded tech stacks in the market right now. Additionally, I used the phrase \"organic interview\" earlier, since I did have a few interviews early in my job search, but only after reaching out to some old connections about openings at their companies. None of those interviews led to anything.\n\nThese past 8 months (with some breaks in between days/weeks), I've applied to over 600 openings and tried what feels like everything. I've rewritten my resume about 6 times, and at one point even hired a professional resume-writing service to tailor my resume to my background and target roles. But still nothing.\n\nI'm just so lost at this point in terms of what to do now. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd greatly appreciate it. So far I've tried:\n\n* Rewriting my resume multiple times, improving keyword targeting, human & ATS readability, and quantifiable career achievements.\n* Revamping my LinkedIn profile multiple times.\n* Optimizing my portfolio multiple times.\n* Applying to jobs on niche job boards and common job boards like Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor.\n* Applying to jobs at different times of the day and week.\n* Reaching out to CTOs, CEOs, or Hiring Managers of the companies I'm applying to.\n* Applying for jobs with salaries well below market value.\n* Using various filtering options to target jobs posted within minutes, hours, days, or at most weeks.",

I've never gotten a formal onboarding into my SWE role and it's been rough trying to understand the codebase (product is older than me). I have been exploring an out (low pay here so I want to leave), but my resume is not getting hits and I am assuming it's because my bullet points aren't exactly \"wow, we should hire this guy,\" due to the nature of my career development here. I've changed the title of the first job to SDET instead of QA since that was the nature of my job.\n\nThe tech stack is pure Java (no Spring or anything), but it's rare to even have tasks where I'm actively implementing Java code; due to my nature of swapping from QA to SWE, I end up doing things like working on Jenkins stuff or writing Python to improve pipelines/QA tasks, etc.\n\nI've tried reaching out for more development-related tasks but it doesn't result in any learning opportunities (\"it'd be better to assign this to (other SWEs on team) and it'll be done faster\" or I'll genuinely have no idea how to even approach a task) and I'm usually shuffled off to do more automation/non-development work. On the offchance I do get a development related task and I have questions, I try to ask to further grow my understanding but what usually ends up happening is that they just end up implementing it for me, or the task gets broken apart and suddenly it's a 3 line PR from me, while the actual higher complexities of the original task is assigned elsewhere.\n\nI am working on the leetcode grind, I tend to solve most easies and can handle mediums generally (just rusty with some DSA). I do have a CS degree from a mid tier UC. I am just wondering if my career is fucked (I am <30 lol so this is probably an overexaggeration but with the current state of hiring I feel like I'm falling behind hard) or it's a skill issue by me (imposter syndrome? not smart enough to learn the codebase? others formally hired as SWE with similar YOE seem to be doing amazing) or any words of advice.

Is 2.5k USD okay for \"Senior C# SQL Developer Remote Latam\"?\n\nContext: 10 years coding as hobbyist (not for companies). Got a couple projects in production making some extra cash monthly. Moved from Venezuela, trying to enter IT industry now. (I know, sounds crazy)\n\nI'm clearly not a junior, but not really a senior either. I tried CS in 2011, quit due Venezuela chaos, went self-taught while working to survive.\n\nApplied as Full Stack .NET Software Engineer (9 years .NET doing: CLI apps, Worker Services, Web APIs, Blazor Server/WASM, even a bit of IoT with ESP32). My main project has been online for 8 years straight, niche market, but no scaling budget (that's why I'm looking for job).\n\nIs it a mistake applying as Full Stack SE .NET? Should I stick to backend and mention Blazor as skill instead? My projects uses Blazor for FE but I see almost 0 offers for Blazor out there.\n\nI tried 30 applications last week, got 1 interview tomorrow for a small US company that needs a \"Senior C# SQL Developer\", remote, 2.5k/month (I'd happily take it as first professional job).\n\nThey want: Sr C#/SQL, Azure is a plus, good English required.\n\nEFSET says I'm C1/C2 but honestly I'm not sure, never took any courses in my life, yet I've spoken with some friends via discord and they understood me just fine so I guess I'm going to be fine here.\n\nI know the Azure basics (Key Vault, VMs, Azure SQL with Entra ID). No certs yet.\n\nBut I fear I'll fail the technical interview because it's been years since I solved any DSA/leetcode, never worked with real distributed systems in my life. I've built my apps with layered architecture, used EF Core, handled race conditions with semaphores, but never touched Kafka/RabbitMQ/CQRS in production and my projects never hit 1k users. Handled JWT for auth most times and my own auth system as I never hit so many users.\n\nSo... my question: Does a small company paying 2.5k remote really expect leetcode mastery? Or maybe just \"can you build features and not break things and pass the following basic DSA excercises\"?\n\nAlso: Should I switch to Backend only and keep Blazor as skill? Feel like I wasted 3 years learning Blazor instead of React/Angular since jobs are rare to find with Blazor.

I ask \\*how\\*\n\nI've grown a lot in this career, I know how to push back and assert myself. I've come to expect companies to ramp up pressure (even without deadlines, just constantly hammering with wanting something ASAP). I've come to expect tech debt to keep climbing unless I sneak it in here and there on other tickets.\n\nBut I guess I am tired of it?\n\nI'm trying to \"not care\" but I just won't? I want to do a good job and write good code. So abandoning that and putting out lackluster results both scares me and feels like a betrayal to my core needs as a person. Plus it feels so reckless when I know that pressure will just end up with my colleagues instead of me. Or I worry that I'll come off badly to the customer (despite assurances from my manager that I'm very good at what I do and that I'm valued). And I KNOW that companies play ball this way, with manipulating emotions for benefit. I KNOW it's fascist bs...I just don't know what to do anymore about it.\n\nI dunno... I've also never quit without prospects lined up. I'm interviewing, people contact me without me needing to reach out and that's cool... But to be brutally honest, I am not sure if I should stick in this career if I can't figure out how to \"not care\" enough to resolve this pressure problem.\n\nEsp with all this AI bullshit... I feel it has gotten esp worse with that. I've done my part to communicate the problems and have been grateful my colleagues express similar concerns... It feels good to reclaim some power and remind them (and me) that you don't have to accept this BS and that if you can push back on it then you absolutely can and should.\n\nBut it's hard despite that not to unsee the writing on the wall and not feel like I'm  wanted... Because if places were willing to ship slop and horrific tech debt into prod before, now they can just do it for free. And now one of our customers wants a discount if the engineers don't use AI in their daily workflow. Like... that's a sinking ship for sure, and I worry it's not the only place working that way.\n\nAnyone have some advice on this?\n\nOr am I in denial, and maybe dropping out is the best choice atm?\n\nTrying to identify maybe where I am seeing this in black and white, because there are plenty of people doing fine in this industry too, and I don't want to doompost because it may not be helpful. Most of the assignments I have had have been with larger private companies, which has me wondering if a smaller private company or government job would have less pressure and be a better fit?\n\nI am in Europe, and I have savings...so not really worried financially. But my mental health is far far far more urgent and suspect I've hit burnout (or will soon).",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI am here because I am in desperate need for some help. It seems like my mind has stopped functioning and I can't find a solution on my own so I really need help from wise strangers on the internet.\n\nSo here goes my story: I am a 34 years old man (birthday in about a week from now). I was born and raised in a third world country. I completed my BS in CS in 2013 and I have worked as a software dev until 2019 when I started my own business (not related to tech) so I kinda gave up on my career.\n\nMy business was doing good and everything was fine until in 2025, I moved to the US. My family is here and I was alone back in my country so it made sense to move here. I thought I could keep my business running remotely but unfortunately, due to some issues I couldn't and it all came crashing down.\n\nNow, I dont have anything. I no longer have a career to get a job in IT here nor do I have a business to support me. I am also in $19K of debt. I have started working an odd job to survive here which pays $19/hour but I am even unable to meet my basic need as I need to pay the rent here. I am unable to find a job with better pay. My resume is a disaster.\n\nI desperately need to revive my career but I don't know how. I was a .NET (C#) dev back then and I use to work on MVC & Web forms projects. I also use to make REST & SOAP APIs. I did dabble in a little bit of [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) core too. I used to work on MS SQL too.\n\nI asked ChatGPT and it recommened to start with Azure cloud as I can leverage my background in .NET & C#. Although I have no experience in cloud, do you think it is a wise suggestion? I have started prepping for AZ900 (which I know, doesnt help in securing a job as its just fundamentals but its a necessary step to cloud). Its been so long since I coded that I have forgotten almost everything about it.\n\nOr should I look into AI and Data Science stuff? Feels complicated but since there is all the hype about it and how AI is the future, I am not sure. I was never good at maths so I am not sure if I will be able to grasp it.\n\nSo can anyone of you please help me in guiding towards a path (in detail please if possible) where I can potentially have a financially stable life? I have always been a hard worker and have been praised for my work ethics, even in the odd job here. So I know with a little bit of help, I can rise again.\n\nRight now, I feel broken. I have nothing to show for 34 years of my life. All my friends/ex-colleagues have good careers and are married, have their own house, cars, kids and living a stable (or close to it) life. I can't go back to my country as there is absolutely nothing there for me and I am finding it extremely hard to survive here. After bills, I dont have enough money for basic groceries here. I had a comfortable life back home and was earning well and never had a physical/laborious job in my life. Here I am working 12 hours shift as a warehouse worker. I dont mind it but it feels like I am wasting away my life.\n\nI am sorry if my post looks like I am looking for pity. I am not. Its just that I do not have anyone to talk to about this and I am not in a good state of mind right now.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I would really appreciate your help.\n\nTLDR: .NET dev who abandoned his career in 2019, is now looking to go back to his career in tech and asking for the correct path.",

And if I do pick up back end, could I transition to sec in the future? Would that be viable?\n\nJust as an added info: I'm not trying to \"get rich quick\" here.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey,\n\nI graduated with a CS degree two years ago, and have been working for 1.5 yrs now in an SME.\n\nThe first year was fairly typical. There were some web development projects for a client, where I was a junior dev in the team doing fullstack. Although there was some crunch, I got to learn a lot of skills hands-on.\n\nThe last few months however, the company has begun to lay off most devs. There's 3-4 devs on this product, and what concerns me is that we're now building it pretty much entirely with tools like Claude and Antigravity aiming to get it done fast. Granted, the lead is experienced and knows his fundamentals very well, and he did lot of the development himself before I came onto the project, so the project is likely not a lost cause.\n\nI'm mainly concerned about my own career growth. Don't get me wrong, I use Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity a lot when I'm stuck, and try to learn the concepts from there.\n\nBut I feel like I don't really learn as much about the fundamentals, languages and frameworks used, etc. when I just spit prompts to Antigravity to fix errors, build this or implement X feature - and for that to be the development process. I don't know if it'll be good for my career development in future. I kind of have to vibe-code for now though, since deadlines are tight and I'm expected to be 10x more productive with AI.\n\nThe working hour expectations are a secondary thing - there's been periods throughout of working on weekends, after hours, maybe public holidays. I think that's a give-or-take thing though, where I've got to set my own boundaries. Besides, my friends in other industries seem to have it worse.\n\nTherefore, I'm kind of considering looking for another software dev job where I have the leeway and time to do things more manually and learn skills better. Heck, pivoting and being a BA is something I've been interested in doing for a while now. But how widespread is kind of AI usage in other companies? If many companies are doing this, maybe I shouldn't rush into things.\n\nAny advice for me to proceed from here? I've also got a side project going on, if that helps.\n\nThanks!",

After graduation, I stayed in that country for 9 months.

But got\n\n- Ghosted after technical assessments.\n- Ghosted after final rounds.\n- Rejected with generic emails.\n\nFresh out of university, I only had one unpaid frontend internship. I realized that probably wasn’t enough. So I doubled down.\n\nI started learning backend, then discovered DevOps and cloud. I genuinely loved it. I invested money I barely had into certifications and learning materials. I passed:\n-AWS Cloud Practitioner\n-AWS Solutions Architect Associate\n-CKA\n-KCNA\nI know it's not impressive.\n\nI built projects. Documented them. Kept applying.\nAt one point, I got into a graduate program at a big company. Passed the assessment. Completed the internship. Submitted extra documentation no other applicant was asked for. Then they told me they couldn’t offer full time because the law changed and they wanted permanent residents.\n\nShortly after that, my visa expired and I had to go back to my home country.\nI struggle with Major Depressive Disorder all my life, so my energy and consistency aren’t always perfect. But I kept pushing anyway.\n\nRecently, I made it to another final on site round. At the end, I asked the tech lead what I could improve. He said technically he had no comment and that I clearly knew what I was talking about. He just suggested I follow CNCF on YouTube to stay updated.\n\nTwo weeks later, generic rejection. No feedback. I even asked politely. Nothing.\n\nI tried freelancing on Upwork. But I burned through 100 connects. with no responses.\n\nNow I’m working remotely as a real estate agent from my home country. I never imagined working in sales. I still want to work in tech. I still want to work in cloud or DevOps. But I’m exhausted and confused.\n\nWhat hurts the most is seeing people I personally know, with weaker profiles, landing roles or making money freelancing. I know comparison is unhealthy, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m doing something fundamentally wrong.\n\nAt this point I’m wondering\nWhat would you do in my position? what is it that I'm missing.",

        "content": "I am panicking about my future because opportunities seem so tight these days, and I think it is unfair. Here is my story.\n\n  \nI am a 23-year-old software developer from a third world country. I graduated from a top university with a good GPA (3.9/4) in 2024. I interned at two machine learning software companies before I graduated. I also took an interest in LeetCode problems and solved over 1000 of them. Now I work for a mid-tier trading firm as an Odoo developer with a not-so-great salary.\n\n  \nI was brought up in a family where math was considered very essential for a good career. As a result, I am good at math. My high school science fair projects were often applications of machine learning I discovered independently. I wrote a bunch of manuscripts on math topics throughout high school and college. This is all to say I am passionate about math, and being good at it is really a core part of my identity.\n\n  \nI feel like I have an advantage here. Not many people identify as a \"math person,\" whereas I prefer jobs where I can do more math. My educational background is good enough, and I have an okay history of work experience. The reality is I am earning less than $1/hr, and better-paying entry-level jobs are impossible to find these days. The worst part is I am not doing something as meaningful as I want. I despise this phase of mediocrity, but I don't know what to do about it. I feel like a failure because people (including me) expected I would be in a good position in life by now, but I am nowhere near there.\n\n  \nThe point of the post is that I am lost. Maybe I was wrong about my expectations, and I invested too much in a skill that is no longer as relevant. So I am curious what people suggest I should explore with my skill set. \n\nPS: Academia is not an obvious choice for me because it doesn't pay remotely well where I live, and I am applying for opportunities abroad, though that also seems a long shot. There are not many open positions for software developers other than web developers here so I am open (prefer) remote roles. ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi the following wall of text is just me whining about my luck running out, whoa is me, yada yada. But I would appreciate advice after reading between the lines.  \n  \nRecently I was turned down for a job specifically because they said I lacked a bachelor's degree. I have an associate's degree from a community college, and some 4 year university for a mechanical engineering before I ran out of money. I got an insanely lucky break at a small startup anyway for roughly 6 years, then a year at an enterprise position. Both of them remote which is insanely lucky because I live in south PA, hours away from most tech centers. I should have saved up and moved but I was making pretty below average pay so it never really added up. Plus family things kept me rooted where I am. I should have jumped ship from my job sooner but I thought all the experience would look better rather then job hopping. I also had a weird sense of loyalty since they took me on without a bachelors in the first place. The stupid part is I was trying to save up to return to college at that enterprise job but then I was laid off.   \n  \nThat was a year ago. I got an entry level helpdesk position at an old job for about half the pay I was making and I've been trapped here ever since. I got maybe 8 interviews total last year and half of them the companies disappeared overnight. The other half went with what unicorns I assume the market is oversaturated with now. At least that's what it felt like.\n\nAt this point I am at a loss of what to do. I've been up and down the existential nightmare of the AI hype and have safely arrived at the \"it's a tool nothing more\" stance but it feels like it's going to be another couple years before CEOs recognize this. I know most of this thread is in the same boat dealing with that aftermath. But what do I do in the meantime? I get small one off \"maintenance\" with my old company's software I play up a bit on my resume and I'm \"technically\" still registered with them but I feel like it's hurting more then helping. I only play it up because I was under the impression it's much harder to get hired in software if you haven't been doing it recently. If I say I've been doing 99% tech support for the past year that makes it sound like I'm not even an engineer anymore. I had a recruiter straight up ask me \"why'd you leave to do tech support instead\" like I did this on purpose. It's demeaning. It's not that I mind IT but I don't have the certs to move up in it, and I always wanted to build software for a living. It's part of the reason I started having trouble with my bachelor's degree originally, because I wanted to change trajectory and it ended up being too expensive to.\n\nI have a handful of active personal projects, including a rust library, a game engine, and a joint one with a dev friend I've been working on that's more of a SaaS. I feel like entrepreneurship might be my only hope at this point but I don't consider myself business brained, nor do I necessarily consider myself a designer. Even my system design is probably just mediocre at best. I feel gross using AI to churn out slop. I am trying to figure out a way to use it productively like i know peers of mine manage without feeling like I'm building on top of popsicle sticks. I think I'm better then AI but by how much i couldn't tell you.\n\nAnyway I know this is a bit of a sad sap ramble but really it comes down to income. I love software development, I've been doing it since I was a kid, but I also need money. I have mouths to feed and a mortgage and entry level jobs aren't cutting it. My credit card is almost maxed out and the interest is enough I can never pay it off. I'm hoping the answer isn't just to take up a trade like my dad and father in law did. I always felt like software is what I'm meant to do and it kills me that I can't make it happen anymore. If I could even just get some gigs like the good ol days I could hunker down until the economy corrects, but the gig market is basically dead from what I've found. And I haven't had a single bite on Fiver/Upwork. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation?",

Because of my history with the company (basically rotating between teams in my department), I’ve had the chance to touch basically everything: Frontend, Backend, Databases, Devops pipelines, K8s/containers, Cloud infrastructure, AuthN/AuthZ, API gateways/reverse proxies, and Messaging (Pub/sub). I’ve become the \"jack of all trades\" in our department.\n\nManagement is now aggressively pushing me toward a Tech Lead/Lead developer role. They want me focused on unblocking other developers, guiding engineers, and handling the \"big picture\" stuff. This would drastically reduce my time \"in the trenches\" where I'm basically delegating the day to day stuff.\n\nThe issue is that I’m already losing my time to code. My typical day now includes: mentoring other junior developers/interns, discussing integration points with other systems, stakeholder meetings with my EM, sprint planning, and removing blockers for other engineers - for example, getting our authN/authZ infra setup or API routes design done so that implementation can begin on a new module.\n\nI’ve only been coding seriously for 5–6 years (including personal projects and my college degree) and only have \\~2 years of \"professional\" industry experience. I feel like it is **way too early** to stop being an Individual Contributor (IC). I want to experience being a \"Senior dev\" and build true deep technical expertise. Basically I foresee my career moving towards the \"IC\" path rather than the \"EM\" one.\n\nEven worse, I’m starting to feel anxious (like I'm not ready for this step up) and feel like a fraud. Because I’ve been a generalist, I look at our dedicated Backend engineers and realize they are better at their jobs than I am. They have depth I don't have in terms of programming and db design.\n\nHas anyone else been fast-tracked like this and am I right to think that \\~2 years of experience is too shallow for a Tech Lead role?",

I literally haven't touched a thing with tech in almost 5 years though.\n\nI did a lot of leadership work as well (scrum master for 2 years on top of full time dev) and worked with the end user heavily on my projects for years. \n\nStill struggling with medical but private disability runs out next month and my SSDI may not continue which came as a surprise to me but lifetime limits are apparently a thing. So I'm scrambling to figure out how to best approach this!\n\nAdvice?",

Ever since I did my second semester spring I have come to the belief that this major has become more taxing than interesting. I think honestly it is because I went into college after high school without a plan and have based on halo scripting skills believed I could maybe make some habit out of it. \n\nFreshmen year was undeclared so really I went into it 2nd year (except for a intro to CS). I have learned basic C++ logic along with discrete, matrix I and calc I. By second semester I ran into data structures, webdev frontend and intro to AI (it was not just those 3 but those were the CS classes).My college offers core classes, and honestly it has gotten to a point that without them I probably lose it because it seems I am just sick and tired of the major and was incredibly burnt out. Reckon despite the grades I got being pretty good like As and Bs I still just sick of the major. First semester junior was not so bad but now in my second I got Backend Webdev, Programming Languages and Software Architecture and it has gotten to a point where I am really questioning if this major is worth anything.\n\nOther things to note, I have 3 minors (math is freebie I technically get that regardless) but I have one in History and Theology for the sake of not losing it. They are not at all a problem for me it is just for a break from code. I also seem over the years been very good at being creative with code like stories and whatnot (Data structures we made a text based RPG and the story plot took me 5 minutes to make) along with webdev having like the vision for it.\n\nI just wanna know more or less, based on those out there in job fields already is just having a bachlor's degree worth it anymore. I keep hearing about how bad the job market is and well honestly I just believe I am in it to get the degree and then just get out there doing some form of job instead of just school. I also ask those who perhaps had a CS minor or no CS experience in college but a bachelors degree too",

Plus, you can’t really afford to in this economy.\n\nI’m a self-taught developer. I have a bachelor’s degree but it’s not technical. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. I obtained a marketing degree because, to be honest, I didn’t know what I wanted to do at the time.\n\nI realize that technology moves fast, and going back to school will likely slow me down. Most of the stuff taught at school is theoretical. And, as far as the practical stuff goes, that will essentially be useless by the time one graduates.\n\nStill, I feel like there’s a big gap of knowledge that I’m missing. Especially foundational stuff like how operating systems work, how compilers work, and computer architecture. I also feel like I’m missing a lot of math as well.\n\nUltimately, I’d like to become a ai systems architect. One who knows not only how to strategically implement ai models, but also  how to create the models and teach them.\n\nIf i were to go back to school, I’s likely wouldn’t be able to just jump into a masters program. I’d need to end up taking a bridge program. I’d likely apply to a post bacc cs program, like OSU. And then, a few years down the road, if things go well, enroll in Georgia Tech and earn a masters program emphasized in machine learning.\n\nUltimately, im wondering if this is a good idea or just a waste of time and money. Considering how much material is out there, it might be better off just teaching myself these things. Yes, it’ll take longer and it’ll be unstructured, but, I’d be saving money, I’d be able to upgrade myself with hands-on on practical skills, I’d get more hands-on experience while making money, and let’s be honest, I’d be able to have more of a social life (which i could use right about now).\n\nBut, what fears me is the slight chance that not having any technical degree will prevent me from leveling up as an engineer. Obviously I know there are certain fields which almost certainly require an advanced technical degree like robotics or self-automation engineering and ml research. But I’m not too interested in those fields. What i am interested is backend development, cloud infrastructure, systems architecture, applied machine learning (maybe), and maybe dabble in cybersecurity.\n\nSorry for the long post, but it’s just something that’s been lingering in my mind these past couple weeks. And, yes, i do know how fortunate i am to still have a job. Thank you. Wish u guys all the best",

For background, I work in a remote marketing company in the US that pays 18 dollars an hour that has been a bizarre experience (in a very bad way). They fired their employee that trained me right before they offered a paid position too. Probably not a coincidence.\n\nMy work expectations went from conducting audits for social media accounts with Excel and Python (in the first week) to doing a ton of stuff that does not involve coding. I am now expected to manage all 52 of their social media accounts. I have to edit and add captions to videos along with scheduling them, coming up with titles, descriptions, hashtags, tagging people, thumbnail design, etc. I have to be tech support and solve every tech problem they have. I have to manage their database and answer some of their client’s phone calls too regarding whatever questions they have. I am now expected to be their project coordinator too.\n\nRegarding coding related things, they want me to automate employees’ entire workflow, be a cybersecurity expert, design user interfaces, automate website creation for clients, and build AI agents. I do not have the experience, knowledge, or time to do many of these tasks and despite trying to explain these concerns to my employer, it goes on deaf ears as “it’s critical for the company as clients come first.” I only have so much time out the day to do things. It gets worse though.\n\nI am expected to attend the employer’s conferences they host or attend for hours of my weekend for free and they keep handing me entrepreneurial books that I have to read on my own time (I spark noted all of them) and then I have to join their book club for those books. I am getting messaged on night after working hours constantly inquiring about various tasks too.\n\nThere is excessive micromanagement in my opinion that just makes my life miserable. I am expected to give a detailed report every hour (yes, every hour) on what work I’ve done, what work I’m currently doing, the work I have remaining and it’s ETA, what setbacks I’ve had, and proposed solutions. At the end of the day, I’m expected to give a report on what I’ve learned for the day. I also have keep time of every task I have done. There are constant impromptu meetings asking all of this information above along with the fact that we have a Jira like website that has this information already which makes it insanely redundant.\n\nWhat is the craziness level here? Have any of you experienced this before? This does not seem normal to me whatsoever.\n\nEDIT - I am the only tech worker in the company.",

Long term goal is to move into private industry.\n\nSince my schedule is manageable, I’m thinking about doing Georgia Tech OMSCS. The cost is reasonable and I like the idea of strengthening CS fundamentals and having a Master degree under my name (my undergraduate CS degree is from a lesser known state school). I hope the degree can boost my resume when apply for more senior roles.\n\nMy main concern is ROI.\n\nI often hear that experience and practical skills matter far more than degrees for senior roles. So I am trying to decide whether my time would be better spent on:\n\n* OMSCS (10 to 15 hrs/week for several years)\n* deeper projects/open source\n* system design study\n* real world architecture experience, pick up gigs\n\nFor people who did OMSCS/any master programs (or chose not to):\n\n1. Did it actually help your career or job transitions?\n2. Was the knowledge useful day to day?\n3. Looking back, was the time investment worth it?",

I’m at a crossroads and need some honest advice.\n\nThe situation at my current company has become a bit demotivating:\n\n* **No PF/Benefits:** There are no PF deductions or standard benefits.\n* **Tech Drift:** I was hired for Android, but lately, I’m being asked to do random tasks, like **PHP/Web Dev/Dev-Ops**. I feel like my mobile skills are rotting.\n* **Zero Mentorship:** The team is tiny. There's no one more senior to learn from, so I’m just \"figuring it out\" without knowing if I'm following best practices(using AI models every day to do extra tasks).\n* **The Dilemma:** The market feels rough right now, and I’m not currently seeing many bites on my resume.\n\nIs it better to stay here just for the paycheck while my specialized skills stagnate, or should I quit/aggressively hunt despite the current job market? For those who stayed in roles like this, did it hurt your career long-term?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For context: I’m graduating my undergrad this April, and I don’t have any job lined up for me afterwards. I did a one-year internship at a non-top-tier company, but they told me that due to budget issues, they primarily hire coop students (since the company’s focus isn’t software). I have two part-time jobs so I think I’m fine for the most part in terms of finance, but this isn’t good for long-term.\n\nBack to the main-point: I feel very dumb. During my first two years, I’ve been doing everything properly and actually understanding my code and principles. Once I did my one-year internship and then started my final year of uni, I saw myself using AI a lot and even stopped doing stuff on the side.\n\nI feel very dumb because of this since I just don’t know what to do when someone asks me to do something. I feel like I stripped away all my knowledge  of coding because I know I have a method that can allow me to do it faster and easier.\n\nI told myself that I have a few goals aside from focusing on my final courses, and that is applying to jobs, practising leetcode, getting certifications, and working on side projects that are actually useful/impressive. But then comes my ‘undiagnosed adhd’ where I just can’t sit still without needing to randomly search up thoughts of “oh I wonder what the price of Apple stocks are now.”\n\nIdk it all feels like a mess and, while the pressure of being the only child of two immigrant parents is there, it’s hard for me to know what to do. I think I’m feeling too comfortable right now, and I feel dumb every time I try to get outside the bubble.\n\nI want some of your advice and tough love. I’m looking for something that I can drill into my head to keep me going.\n\nThanks everyone!",

        "content": "I recently applied for a System Admin role (enterprise application) at Company X. The job posting listed a salary range of $85K–$157K per year. Based on my experience and what I know about the market in my area, this type of role usually pays around $90K–$100K for someone at my level.\n\nDuring the initial screening call with a recruiter, the topic of compensation came up. I asked whether the posted salary range was accurate. He said the $157K would be for someone with 8+ years of experience, and that for my background, something around $135K/year would be appropriate.\n\nThis raised a couple of red flags for me. First, recruiters don’t usually throw out specific numbers that early in the process. Second, $135K seems significantly above market for someone with my experience in my location.\n\nI’ve decided to continue the process and meet with the hiring manager to see how things unfold, but I’m curious what you all think. Does this sound normal, or am I right to be cautious?\n\n  \nThanks!\n\nNote : I have used AI to improve my writing :)",
