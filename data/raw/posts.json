We've got way more servers than we need and we're keeping data for 30 days when most of it gets used in the first few hours, basically everything is over provisioned.\n\nI've tried to bring up optimizing this like 5 times and everyone just says \"what if we need that capacity later\" or \"what if something breaks when we change it\". Meanwhile, we're losing money on servers that barely do anything most of the time. I finally convinced them to add gravitee to at least get visibility into what we're actually using and it confirmed what I suspected, we're wasting so much capacity. The funniest part of it is we started using kafka for pretty simple stuff like sending notifications between services and now it's this massive thing nobody wants to touch\n\nAnyone else dealing with this? Big kafka setup is such an overkill for what a lot of teams need but once you have it you're stuck with it",

What I can’t get from blogs or job postings is real, current, hands-on experience, so I’d love to hear from people who are currently working (or have recently worked) in either role: how has your job actually changed over the last 1–2 years, do the expectations match how the role is advertised, which role feels more stable and valued inside companies, and if you were starting today, would you choose the same path again?

After a couple of years of self-teaching (programming, SQL, data fundamentals) and some freelancing, I landed a role about a year ago in a large company (hundreds of millions in revenue).\n\nWhen I joined, there was zero data culture. No team, no processes, just a lot of manual work and fragmented info. My official title is \"Data Manager\", but since I’m building the function from scratch, I’ve been doing a bit of everything:\n\n* Automation & ETL: Writing Python scripts and using Power Automate to kill manual tasks.\n* Infrastructure: Designing and building business-oriented databases from the ground up.\n* BI/Visualization: Creating the first actual dashboards.\n* Optimization: Cleaning up the \"Excel Wild West\" and setting common data policies.\n\nMy question: Imposter syndrome aside, I’m struggling to map this experience to the actual market. I love the \"ideation\" and architecture part—designing the pipelines, thinking through the data flows, and making things work automatically. But I sometimes worry I’m doing a lot of useful things, but not building a clean and recognizable profile.\n\n\\- What term would you use to describe this type of role? I'm not sure if I'm closer to data engineering or analytics...\n\n\\- Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\n\n\\- What would you discover next if you were in my shoes? I want to switch from band-aid solutions to more reliable, scalable procedures. At this point, what would you learn first: DBT, cloud architecture, orchestration tools like Airflow, or something else?\n\nMy current stack is Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Automate, and some legacy VBA.\n\nI genuinely love this job—it's a world away from my previous life in humanities—but I want to make sure I’m steering the ship in the right direction.

I have been in this role for 1,5y and before this for 3 years I worked part time in more technical roles which included c#, git, azure devops, ssis, ssrs, qlik sense.\n\nI have been offered a position to move to our central analytics & bi team, they basically serve all the smaller units in our org (like the one I am in) and help with BI stuff. Not sure how many units there are but this is a large company with very regulated industries (like nuclear power). This role would introduce fabric to my daily tools and sql and python based on the conversation I had with the manager. The role listing also mentions that knowledge of etl/elt and ci/cd processes is required. But it also mentions on-prem gateways and fabric tenant admin.\n\nIn addition to this, I have been offered a position at a very good consulting company. It’s a data engineer position but it starts with a 4 week bootcamp to get me going in the DE skills (they mention tools like dbt, databricks, snowflake, fabric, python, sql etc) and then I start with customer projects. The caveat is that I get a \\~10% net pay cut. But they offer a ton of possibilities for growth, internal academies and they pay for certifications etc. I currently have none.\n\nI have to do my decision next week and I’m not sure what to choose. I know DE can open architect roles in the future but I have no idea what in-house fabric can do for me if I want to progress. From what I have read this subreddit I have gathered that Fabric isn’t that liked but I’m hoping if someone can give neutral opinions. Right now the situation is that I’m really bored with my job. I dislike the dashboard building, it’s boring. And talking with business why my numbers dont match their excel is well… also boring. I like the modelling part and the back end side but I also enjoy optimizing and trying different solutions and understanding how much our reporting costs us (computationally).\n\nFor context: based in EU, no kids, less than 3y of part time experience and now 1,5y full time\n\nEdit: I chose the Fabric role :)",

        "author": "Groove-Theory",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Long ass post sorry. Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR questions if you don't want the backstory.**\n\n# Backstory:\n\nHowdy... not entirely sure this is the right subreddit for this (between here and the BI sub) but figured I'd start here.\n\nOk so... I'm a tech lead for our engineers working on our core product in a startup. I am NOT on the data engineering or BI side of things, but my involvement in BI matters is growing, and this is me sanity-checking what I see.\n\nOur data stack is I think ok for a startup. We source our data, which is mostly our main Postgres DB plus with a few other third party tracking sources, with 5X into our staging tables in BigQuery. Then we use dbt to bucket our data into dimensions, fact tables, and what are called \"reporting tables\" which are the highest 1-to-1 tables that are used in whatever presentation layer we use (which is Looker). Our ingestion/bootstrap logic all exists in a GitHub repo.\n\nThis entire system was originally designed and put together by a very experienced senior data engineer when we were in a scaling phase. Unfortunately, they were laid-off some time ago cuz of runway issues before they could completely finish everything. Since that time, our management has continually pushed for additional and additional reporting, but we haven’t replaced that position. And it's getting worse.\n\nToday, we have ONE business analyst (not on the eng team) with no tech skills, having learned SQL basics from ChatGPT. They create reports as best as they can, but idk how correct they are in querying stuff from the BI layer (frankly I don't care tbh, not the eng team's concern)\n\nAnyway, the business comes to us with a regular set of new reporting requirements for tables, but many of these do not make sense. At all.\n\nFor example: *\"I’d like a list of all cars, but also like a column for how much spaghetti people eat per day, and then a column of every fish in the sea, and we need a dashboard for the fish-spaghetti-car metric per month \"*. That kind of bullshit\n\nSince we still have a reduced team post-layoffs, product management has started working on sprint stories for any product improvement we do such as *“Create a reporting table for the spaghetti bullshit above\"* despite the underlying data structure being ambiguous or incorrect (and not being a spaghetti company). Which I think is pretty fucking weird that they're telling us what the actual implementation should be.\n\nWe, as software engineers, are comfortable designing application schemas and writing database queries against Postgres (and the PG layer is well formed imo). We, however, are not professionals in business intelligence, and we are facing more and more questions about dimensional design, report structure, which are questions we feel uncomfortable answering.\n\nThe most aggravating part of this process is the business will attempt almost anything rather than considering adding another senior BI or data engineering person to the staff. They have attempted to draw general engineering talent into doing business intelligence tasks when that isn’t their technical niche. They have attempted to use short-term or lower-quality consultants. Many times, they have simply pressed onward with what we understand to be an iffy model.\n\nIncreasingly I spend my time fighting off requests against our team or explaining to others why some of those requests are simply nonsensical (in a polite manner of course) but I feel I'm slowly losing that fight over time, and my head of Product/Eng is not helping me here.\n\nI always knew the business was crazy when just dealing with product AC, but I've realized they really go fucking bonkers when you talk to them about anything related to a dashboard.\n\n# My questions to ya'll\n\n*(skip to here if you didn't want to read my sob story above)*\n\nMy questions are about whether we have a common concept of \"good\" data modeling and who really is responsible. The engineering department is picking up all of this slack, and BI isn’t really our expertise. So...\n\n* When is the time for the BI/data modeling necessarily a full-time endeavor and not something that should be accomplished as part of the product engineering team, if at all? Are there any heuristics that you have observed for smaller startups?\n* Is there ever value in planning or building \"bad\" or ugly reporting tables to meet current business requirements, or is it almost always harmful?\n* If leadership wants speed and they do not have data modeling knowledge, what data governance patterns work well for you?\n* How do you communicate concepts of dimensional modeling to non-technical business audiences in a way that leads to lasting behavior change? (If at all lol)\n* Finally, if leadership is flatly unwilling to engage experienced BI/DE talent, then what is the least worst alternative you've encountered?\n\nI'm way outside my lane here as a non-DE so any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been building [SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB), for most of this year and I wanted to share what we’re working on and get genuine feedback from people who are interested in databases and distributed systems.\n\n*Sevendb is a distributed cache with pub/sub capabilities and configurable fsync.*\n\n# What problem we’re trying to solve\n\nA lot of modern applications need \\*\\*live data\\*\\*:\n\n* dashboards that should update instantly\n* tickers and feeds\n* systems reacting to rapidly changing state\n\nToday, most systems handle this by **polling-** clients repeatedly asking the database “*has*\n\n*this changed yet?*”. That wastes CPU, bandwidth, and introduces latency and complexity.\n\nTriggers do help a lot here , but as soon as multiple machine and low latency applications enter , they get dicey\n\nscaling databases horizontally introduces another set of problems:\n\n* nondeterministic behavior under failures\n* subtle bugs during retries, reconnects, crashes, and leader changes\n* difficulty reasoning about correctness\n\nSevenDB is our attempt to tackle both of these issues together.\n\n# What SevenDB does\n\nAt a high level, SevenDB is:\n\n**1. Reactive by design**\n\nInstead of clients polling, clients can \\*subscribe\\* to values or queries.\n\nWhen the underlying data changes, updates are pushed automatically.\n\nThink:\n\n\\* “Tell me whenever this value changes” instead of \"polling every few milliseconds\"\n\nThis reduces wasted work(compute , network and even latency) and makes real-time systems simpler and cheaper to run.\n\n**2. Deterministic execution**\n\nThe same sequence of logical operations always produces the same state.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n*  crash recovery becomes predictable\n*  retries don’t cause weird edge cases\n*  multi-replica behavior stays consistent\n*  bugs become reproducible instead of probabilistic nightmares\n\nWe explicitly test determinism by running randomized workloads hundreds of times across scenarios like:\n\n*  crash before send / after send\n*  reconnects (OK, stale, invalid)\n*  WAL rotation and pruning\n\n\\* 3-node replica symmetry with elections\n\nIf behavior diverges, that’s a bug.\n\n\\*\\*3. Raft-based replication\\*\\*\n\nWe use Raft for consensus and replication, but layer deterministic execution on top so that replicas don’t just \\*agree\\*—they behave identically.\n\nThe goal is to make distributed behavior boring and predictable.\n\n# Interesting part\n\nWe're an in-memory KV store , One of the fun challenges in SevenDB was making emissions fully deterministic. We do that by pushing them into the state machine itself. No async “surprises,” no node deciding to emit something on its own. If the Raft log commits the command, the state machine produces the exact same emission on every node. Determinism by construction.\n\nBut this compromises speed significantly , so what we do to get the best of both worlds is:\n\nOn the durability side: a SET is considered successful only after the Raft cluster commits it—meaning it’s replicated into the in-memory WAL buffers of a quorum. Not necessarily flushed to disk when the client sees “OK.”\n\nWhy keep it like this? Because we’re taking a deliberate bet that plays extremely well in practice:\n\n• **Redundancy buys durability** In Raft mode, our real durability is replication. Once a command is in the memory of a majority, you can lose a minority of nodes and the data is still intact. The chance of most of your cluster dying before a disk flush happens is tiny in realistic deployments.\n\n• **Fsync is the throughput killer** Physical disk syncs (fsync) are orders slower than memory or network replication. Forcing the leader to fsync every write would tank performance. I prototyped batching and timed windows, and they helped—but not enough to justify making fsync part of the hot path. (There is a durable flag planned: if a client appends durable to a SET, it will wait for disk flush. Still experimental.)\n\n• **Disk issues shouldn’t stall a cluster** If one node's storage is slow or semi-dying, synchronous fsyncs would make the whole system crawl. By relying on quorum-memory replication, the cluster stays healthy as long as most nodes are healthy.\n\nSo the tradeoff is small: yes, there’s a narrow window where a simultaneous majority crash could lose in-flight commands. But the payoff is huge: predictable performance, high availability, and a deterministic state machine where emissions behave exactly the same on every node.\n\nIn distributed systems, you often bet on the failure mode you’re willing to accept. This is ours.\n\nit helped us achieve these benchmarks\n\n    SevenDB benchmark — GETSET\n    Target: localhost:7379, conns=16, workers=16, keyspace=100000, valueSize=16B, mix=GET:50/SET:50\n    Warmup: 5s, Duration: 30s\n    Ops: total=3695354 success=3695354 failed=0\n    Throughput: 123178 ops/s\n    Latency (ms): p50=0.111 p95=0.226 p99=0.349 max=15.663\n    Reactive latency (ms): p50=0.145 p95=0.358 p99=0.988 max=7.979 (interval=100ms)\n\n# Why I'm posting here\n\nI started this as a potential contribution to dicedb, they are archived for now and had other commitments , so i started something of my own, then this became my master's work and now I am confused on where to go with this, I really love this idea but there's a lot we gotta see apart from just fantacising some work of yours\n\nWe’re early, and this is where we’d really value outside perspective.\n\nSome questions we’re wrestling with:\n\n*  Does “reactive + deterministic” solve a real pain point for you, or does it sound academic?\n*  What would stop you from trying a new database like this?\n*  Is this more compelling as a niche system (dashboards, infra tooling, stateful backends), or something broader?\n*  What would convince you to trust it enough to use it?\n\nBlunt criticism or any advice is more than welcome. I'd much rather hear “this is pointless” now than discover it later.\n\nHappy to clarify internals, benchmarks, or design decisions if anyone’s curious.",

I will mainly be learning on the job, but seeing as my company provide free coursera licenses, I figured I could use it and get some structured learning as well to complement my on-the-job learning. \n\nCurrently I am deciding between IBM’s data engineering  specialization and Joe Reis’s Deeplearning Ai data engineering 4-course series. I have heard negative things about IBM’s course but also that it could be good as an overview if you’re a beginner. \n\nSeeing as I would have no mentor (I am the only analyst there and the only person there to even know what data warehousing and dimensional modeling is), what I ideally want is a course that will inform me on best practices and any tradeoffs and edge cases I should consider. My organization is pretty cost sensitive and not very mature analytics wise, so in general, I really wanna avoid just following trends (e.g. using expensive tools that my org doesn’t necessarily need at this stage) and doing anything that would add technical debt. \n\nAny advice is welcome, thank you!",

        "content": "Teams meetings with transcription enabled. One hour of discussion quickly turns into 10k+ words of unstructured text.\n\nExtracting decisions, action items, and open questions manually doesn’t scale. The common approach is to push the full transcript into a large cloud model and hope for a usable summary.\n\nThat approach breaks down for a few reasons.\n\nLarge transcripts often exceed context windows. Even when they fit, you’re dependent on external infrastructure, which can be problematic for sensitive meetings. Most importantly, you lose determinism: the same input can produce different outputs.\n\nI ended up treating the transcript like any other batch-processing problem.\n\nInstead of processing the full text in one go, the transcript is handled incrementally:\n\n- split into manageable chunks\n- each chunk summarized independently using a stable structure\n- clean intermediate results written out\n- a final aggregation pass over those intermediates to produce the high-level summary\n\nIn practical terms:\n\n- the model never sees the full transcript at once\n- context is controlled explicitly by the pipeline, not by a prompt window\n- intermediate structure is preserved instead of flattened\n- the final output is based on accumulated, cleaned data rather than raw text\n\nThis reframing changes the requirements completely.\n\nOne interesting side effect of this approach was realizing that model size stopped being a deciding factor altogether. Once the task is constrained and the workflow is explicit, even relatively small models perform reliably enough for this kind of summarization.\n\nOnce handled this way, transcript size stops being a concern. A small local model is sufficient, because it’s just one interchangeable component in a controlled pipeline. The value comes from explicit inputs, deterministic steps, and reproducible outputs, not from model size.\n\nThis runs entirely locally on a modest machine, no GPU, no cloud services.\n\nI’m curious how others here approach large meeting transcripts or similar unstructured text when the goal is a clean, deterministic result rather than maximal model capability.",

Here are some proposals and I want to hear any tradeoffs between them. \n\nS3 Sink connector - lands the data in s3 in parquet files in bronze layer. Then have a secondary glue job that reads new parquet files and writes them to Iceberg tables. This can be done every 2 mins? Can I setup something like a microbatch glue job approach here for this? What I don't like about this is there are two components here and there is a batch/polling approach to check for changes and write to Iceberg. \n\nGlue streaming - Glue streaming job that reads the kafka topics then directly writes to Iceberg. A lot more boilerplate code compared to the configuration code above. Also not near real time, job needs to be scheduled. Need to see how to handle failures more visibly. \n\nWhile near real time would be ideal, 2-3 mins delay is ok for landing in bronze. Ordering is important. The same data also will need to be cleaned for insertion in silver tables, transformed and loaded via rest apis to another service (hopefully in another 2-3 mins). Also thinking to handle idempotency in the silver layer or does that need to be handled in bronze?\n\nOne thing to consider also is compaction optimizations. Our data lands in parquet in \\~100 kb size with many small files per hour (\\~100-200 files in each hourly partition dir). Should I be setting my partition differently?

I want to add per-row annotations (llm-as-a-judge scores), ideally without touching the original text data. \n\nSo for a given dataset, I want to add a new column. This seemed like a perfect use case for Iceberg. Iceberg does let you evolve the table schema, including adding a column. BUT you can only add a column with a default value. If I want to fill in that column with annotations, ICEBERG MAKES ME REWRITE EVERY ROW. So despite being based on parquet, a column-oriented format, I need to re-write the entire source text data (gigabytes of data) just to add \\~1mb of annotations. This feels wildly inefficient.\n\nI considered just storing the column in its own table and then joining them. This does work but the joins are annoying to work with, and I suspect query engines do not optimize well a \"join on row\\_number\" operation.\n\nI've been exploring using little-known features of parquet like the file\\_path field to store column data in external files. But literally zero parquet clients support this.\n\nI'm running out of ideas for how to work with this data efficiently.

Using my experience and lessons learned from manually flatten countless dataframes I have created this package. \n\nIt works pretty well in my situation but I would love to hear some feedback from others (lonely warrior at work). \n\n  \nLink to the repo: [https://github.com/bombercorny/flatspark/tree/main](https://github.com/bombercorny/flatspark/tree/main)\n\nThe package can be installed with pypi.

        "content": "Hello,  \nI would like to learn how does people ingest SCD2 Dimensions from OLTP to OLAP.  \nFor e.g. my OLTP system is CloudSQL PostgreSQL on GCP and OLAP system is BigQuery.  \nI have some big table(having 200GB of data) and some very small tables in MB but I want to track every change happening in their columns.  \nI have done it previously using incremental load from source table using BigQuery scheduled queries using a specific date time column but that makes lots of duplication in target table. for small tables it can be ok. Now I can do logical replication on PostgreSQL and GCP provides data stream and I can capture those changes on BigQuery. Challenge is I can't setup logical replication on read replicas, Datastream will replicate changes from Master Instance but that can be deal breaker as it is operational instance and can suffer some performance issue due to sharing it with analytical workload. Another challenge is number of replication slots and managing them. If I have many tables on one PostgreSql server then I am limited by setting up this replication to Analytical Store.\n\n  \nIt would be great to understand how are people managing this ingestion in general at scale ?",

We are working on the customers environment so we don't have much of a choice here. \n\nThere were multiple times where the process simply did not run for no apparent reason. What I would like to do is to use the task schedulers function of \"retrying\" the task in case of a failure for multiple times. The issues are most often resolved by just restarting the application.\n\n However task scheduler does not seem to be able to really \"read\" a task as failed even if I am returning error codes other than 0x0. Does anyone know how to fix this or are there alternatives which can handle these type of problems much better? \n\nThe main issue is that this process needs to run and in any case of problems we often had to monitor it really early in the morning and restart it by hand which is stupidly annoying.",

The idea is that some of our operators should be able to check things like how much revenue they’ve generated this month, how many clients they’ve converted, etc.\n\nAs you can imagine, we’re currently discussing the best way to bring Data Warehouse data back into the app. So far, for our first use case, we’ve built a data microservice that queries tables containing the KPIs. In this setup, the Data Warehouse almost acts like an API, providing the data that the dev team can then display on the frontend with full control over colors, layout, and whatever custom UX our designers come up with.\n\nHowever, looking ahead, we plan to add many more charts to the product. This made me wonder whether there are already solid embedded analytics tools that allow a high level of customization so the look and feel can match our app’s design patterns. On top of that, it seems much easier for a data team to develop and test a dashboard and then embed or share it inside the app, rather than producing multiple KPI tables and wiring all of that through the app’s backend.\n\nI’d be interested to hear how others have approached this and what tools or architectures have worked well for you.",

It's binary!\n\nIt appears irregular though. I'll attach an image to demonstrate but it looks like a weird mix of FSK modulation and ASK modulation?\n\nUse of a radio hacker doesn't seem to pick it up so I'm wondering if it's a standard system or something private by leapfrog, which responded to my email inquiry rather cryptic.

I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. \n\nI have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. \nBut it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.\n\nAs an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.\n\nI think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using. \n\nBut now I feel so exhausted just by the thought of studying. It feels endless. I feel that I’m a terrible engineer and that I’m paying the price of not working hard for the past few years. \n",

My goal is to build a field-agnostic foundation that allows me to eventually pivot into any specialty (AI, Systems, Web, etc.).\n\nMy plan is to use C as my primary vehicle to learn the following:\n\n1- C Fundamentals: Pointers and manual memory management.\n\n2- Computer Architecture: How C maps to the CPU/RAM.\n\n3- Linux/OS: Learning system calls and process management.\n\n4- Networking: Socket programming and protocols.\n\n5- Databases: How data is structured and stored at a low level.\n\nMy goal isn't to become a kernel developer, but to understand the \"magic\" happening under the hood before I move to higher-level languages like C++, Python, or Go.\n\nIs this \"Systems-First\" approach still the best way to build a long-term career? Or is it better to learn these concepts later in one's career? Any specific resources for learning these via C would be appreciated!",

Like I think I know the majority of \"basic\" html (things like h1 tags, sections, etc), but I want to get more into using frameworks and things like FlexBox, React etc to make a better website. However when I go to say a tutorial on FlexBox I feel like I am missing something from the basic section, but when I go to the basic section I feel like I am either skipping around a lot or switching off and not paying attention to the tutorial cause brain goes \"yup know that\"\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\n**Edit:** Coming back to this post after reading the comments, I will take them all in consideration (*minus \"Scrimbassador\" lmao*).

Not impossible and I like the memory safety things.\n\n**- Use C#:** good documentation and toolchain but maybe I will feel I want something lower.\n\nDo you have any advice about what would give me the best experience? What about other paths? I don't want to rush and I will do it in my free time.\n\n**P.S.:** before telling me to do things, I've been doing little programs these days, mostly with rust and I made a webpage with react.\n\n**TLDR:** for someone with basic knowledge of programming that is interested in animations using libraries, simulations, gui apps, engines, etc., which of the languages do you think will bring me the best experience?

I want to choose C or C++ over python. What I've found looking at a lot C++ vs Python first questions on this reddit is that, Python makes it easier to pick up programming in general, but if you're willing to take the harder start then it's way more beneficial to your long term understanding of coding to learn C/C++ first because your brain solidifies good traits that are really hard to relearn from python.\n\nIf any one has any comments on this specific parity that'd be cool. The formatting of Python also seems to be a cheat that isn't as healthy as having your base reference in C/C++'s symbolic referencing over indentation.\n\nMy real question because it does seem C style is better for long term than python first and I intend to learn both, is it best to learn C or C++? It appears C and Python are around the same learning time and C++ is way longer than learning C. Should I do C first then Python to get the benefits of understanding C style code with Python's greater utility and universal usage, or should I tough it out and do C++ , which I guess is extended C, then Python? So essentially my perspective is C is much shorter and faster to learn, but C++ has much more use case, despite the fact they both equally prime you for more \"close to the metal\" thought than high abstract languages like python, what's more worth it first?\n\nThank you\n\nTLDR; I think the first impression and perspective solidifying advantages of C and C++ beats the ease of introduction with Python for first language, thoughts?

I would consider NeoVim but I feel like it is troublesome to learn and I also have Arch which I recently switched to.\n\n  \nI would really appreciate your opinions on what you have been using if you were in a similar case as mine.\n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm trying to understand why I can pass arrays into functions by declaring a pointer parameter. I've done this several times to pass arrays of different lengths into general purpose functions (along with their lengths) for software that I've written, but although I thought I had a grasp on the inner workings, I've found I'm unable to fully explain what's going on.\n\nHere's my understanding, using a simple example. \n\n    #include <iostream>\n    \n    using std::cout;\n    \n    float averageScores(float* scores, int length) \n    {\n        float sum;\n       \n        for (int i=0; i<length; i++)\n        {\n            sum = sum + scores[i];\n        }\n        float average = sum/length;\n        return average;\n    }\n    \n    \n    int main()\n    {\n        float testScores [] = {81.2, 90, 91.8, 76.3, 78.4};\n        int numScores = sizeof(testScores)/sizeof(testScores[0]);\n        float classAverage = averageScores(testScores, numScores);\n        cout<<classAverage;\n        return 0;\n    } \n\nMight not be the most efficient way to do this but you get the idea. What I've done is passed an array of test scores into a function that calculates their average. However, to my understanding, when I declare an array variable, it's actually interpreted as something like &testScores\\[0\\], or the memory location of the first float variable in testScores. \n\nFirst question: the entire array is stored at that memory location, correct? So if the memory location is something like 0x5ffe60, that's where the entire array is stored?\n\nNow, in my function I have declared the parameters float\\* scores and int length. float\\* scores is a pointer. So, this to me seems like creating a pointer to a memory address, similar to the classic example folks usually show when discussing pointers:\n\nint x = 6;  \nint \\*pX = \\&x;\n\nWhere pX is a pointer to the memory location at which the value of x is stored. So, similarly, it seems that \n\nfloat \\*scores = &testScores\\[0\\].\n\nNow, my ultimate question: given that C++ is particular about variable types matching, does this mean that &x and &testScores\\[0\\] are \"pointer types?\" Like, \\* and & are just inverses of the same variable type, and that's why I can write a function that expects a pointer and pass it a memory address.\n\nSo both \\*scores and &testScores\\[0\\] are float\\* numbers? \n\nI think I'm missing something because my explanation feels inconsistent. If anyone could clarify what I have right and wrong about this, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

As much as I hate to admit it, I am overreliant on AI and wanting to break that habit. So, I've taken the time to set up Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi, changed the web interface password to a randomly generated string and blocked most chatbot websites (ChatGPT, Claude, etc), and also setup blocking via browser extensions. That's a discussion I'm sure all of you have heard so I won't say anymore about that.\n\nI am posting because I really struggle with ideas for projects that can actually teach me something. Sure, a todo app can teach me something but I want something practical and that I (or other people) can use. I also struggle with planning/designing the projects so I am looking for help on that as well. \n\nI do have an example of a practical project I want to finish that I've been working on, but I am really struggling with breaking it down into manageable parts. I am a music producer that posts my type beats on YouTube and Beatstars (beat selling website), and I found that uploading things is starting to become increasingly annoying as I need to click through a ton of menus and upload files and such, so I wanted to streamline that. The idea is a desktop GUI app that uses web automation to upload to Beatstars, and then Google's API for uploading to Youtube. \n\n  \nWhat I've done so far is defined Pydantic types (I'm using Python) and started work on a setup wizard screen, but I feel like feature creep is really hitting hard so I wanted to step back and plan more. Any tips?\n\n",

My main issue is how we learn stuff and the testing model. In classes like Calculus, electronics, or physics, you can add more, it feels like we just memorize algorithms to solve questions. I can learn the 'why' from external sources, for example books or Prof.Leonard for calculus but at uni, if you solve 100 past years questions or questions from books, you still can get a good grade, without truly knowing the material. This means that you cannot solve a different kind of problem that involves the integral that you learned 1 week ago and passed the exam, because you didn't understand what you doing, just memorize algorithm.\n\nI have many friends, even when they got a good grade, they still lack an understanding.

I was promoted and inherited my IT Department. \n\nI’ve always loved tech and was a gamer when I was younger. I wasn’t a programmer but I could google and Reddit through technical issues. I never called IT because I usually figured it out (I learned that’s why they liked me - I always had new stuff without asking for it). I wanted to make sure I could relate to my people, so I decided to do some homework on IT related stuff. My love of math and problem solving combined with undiagnosed adhd kicked in and I found myself in a Python course. \n\nBecame a bit obsessed because it felt natural. I am using AI to answer questions about why things operate the way they do and to assist, but only use it now for smaller blocks because it gets dumb really fast. I find myself correcting it when I get it to write blocks for me now. \n\nFast forward to the future. I’ve been building apps at work (mostly power apps, power automate - but learning Python made learning these EASY) and my database is now active. I’ve also built standalone tools with Python at work that are being used. \n\nI’ve got no formal education in technology. But I clearly understand the concepts that have been introduced to me. I find myself now gravitating towards a career in technology. I could do this all day. Managing people is great when things are going well but……there’s downsides. \n\nI guess I’m wondering what I should learn next to level up and make me valuable to a software development company? I’d even do simple things as a side hustle to level up my experience. \n\nMy journey so far is Python (object oriented programming, pyqt -> still learning), sql, JSON, html. Where would an experienced professional tell me to research next?\n\n",

I try to take part in almost every opportunity I get.\n\nThe biggest benefit for me has been the exposure. You meet new people, work with different teams, and learn new things beyond regular classroom coding. Hackathons improve not just coding skills, but also communication, collaboration, and networking. You also get to know about new platforms, tools, and technologies, which is really helpful. What makes hackathons exciting is the experience of solving a real-world problem within a limited time — whether it’s a 24-hour or 36-hour hackathon. Thinking of an idea, building a solution from scratch, and implementing it under pressure is challenging but incredibly fun and rewarding.\n\nOverall, the experience is top-notch and honestly enjoyable. I personally recommend college students to participate in hackathons along with their regular studies. They help improve coding knowledge, problem-solving skills, creative thinking, and even leadership skills.\n\nFor me, hackathons have been one of the most valuable parts of my college journey.",

Been lurking around, haven't posted though.\n\nI've been wondering about my career and its direction for about a year at least and I felt that's it would be good to share and ask for advice and opinions.\n\nSome background.\n\nI'm a programmer with about ten years of experience. I come from a math background. Never completed my uni studies but I was fortunate enough to build somegood foundations that helped a ton in programming. \n\nProgramming for me was also my only hobby for most of the last decade. Read many books, tried many tools and languages. Had tons of fun on many late nights home.\n\nRecent two years the excitement dropped off and I've been enjoying non programing stuff a lot. I've organically ended up doing team lead/tech lead stuff for the last five years and I've accustomed to that. My job is primarily reviewing, mentoring, planning and estimating effort.\n\nDue to the recent advancements in AI I've started feeling the heat. It seems to me that much of the toolset that used to make us competent as programmers is fading away. Now, as a team lead/tech lead I feel that I do a good job exactly because I've spent so many hours fiddling with stuff from many different angles. But in the age of AI I have much less consifidence in my ability to reasons about those genai system that I think we'll be dealing with in the upcoming years.\n\nI've tried to move to areas of game development and design, graphics programming but I gave up after a while. I did not feel the urge to pursue and do what it takes to jump to another field. \n\nRight now I'm asked to design systems based on AI which, I don't feel equipped to do.\n\nAnd even though I know that I'm through a burnout for about three years now, I appreciatey job. I appreciate how it has transformed my life and I've seen able to do and own things I never would have if I did not spend so much time studying cs and programming. \n\nThis is why I decided to create a self made curriculum of data science, machine learning, deep learning and finally genai in order get myself familiarize with those concepts. This is something that's I evaluate to take at least a year. I think that if I am to continue managing development teams and since I seems to a place in our toolset, I think it makes sense. I feel it would boost my abilities and therefore my confidence in order to continue doing a good job.\n\nI don't feel like I'm going to definitely lose my job to AI. But I feel like that if I don't expand my knowledge in any way, I leave it to chance. I don't know if I'm maybe too pessimistic about this, but my gut call is saying that it's to re evaluate some things and it's time to be proactive again.\n\nThought I'd share with you, I expect that many might have somewhat similar thoughts, with all this ai madness going around constantly. Would really like to read your experiences and point of view. ",

My background isn't technical although I work for a software company where people are nice and usually happy to answer noob questions when they have the time. \n\nOver the years, I have learned some basics: Very basic Java and C++, what logic gates are, been messing around with Arduino, breadboards and chips, binary numbers, algebra and a bit of precalculus. But whatever information I have gathered seem pretty trivial and overall I feel like I don't \"get it\".\n\nRecently someone recommended that I start from the basics again and just focus on one gate per month before I go any further: write the truth table, the HDL description for that gate, and what the gate is made of (for example an OR gate is two NOT and one NAND gates) every day of the month and then do the same for the next gate the following month, until I have covered all the gates. The goal being that this becomes \"automatic\" for me.\n\nI am 38 and want to learn out of interest/hobby although part of me is secretly hoping to either make a bit of money with it in the future or even a new career. But I'm not in a rush and willing to take the time to make sure I understand what I'm doing.\n\nWhat's your take on the recommendation that was given to me? If you don't agree, what would be your strategy if you were me?\n\nThanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read and/or answer!",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI have been at my job as a Frontend Developer for the last 4.5 years. In this time, we have built the same product twice with fresh UI and some other things to rebrand it. \n\nI was hired as a mid-level React developer, and have seen the team grow and shrink. We got acquired last year and now I am the only person in my team with a couple of outsourced devs.\n\nNaturally, due to people leaving, I have been promoted to lead but I am hardly able to concentrate or produce any work. I am just cruising on the work of others and I feel like I have lost all interest, or forgotten everything I have learnt. My motivation is dead, every day I am on some calls, fix some small bugs and do some PR reviews which also I rarely read through.\n\nI thought it was burnout and took a 2 weeks break, but came back to the same empty feeling that I am just existing at this place, the joy I had when I first joined is dead.\n\nIt's a nice remote job, they pay on time and given the market right now, I am in a pretty comfortable position. I have tried interviewing at other places in hopes that maybe a new environment will help me, but I rarely prepare for them either, which means I fail them constantly then just stop giving anything a shot. \n\nAdd to the fact that coding agents are quickly catching on, some days I just use it to do my work, I feel like a fraud and don't know if I should continue down this path, or try to learn something new, maybe some other stack or completely distance myself from programming.\n\nHas anyone been in similar situations? How did you make it out? Thanks!",

I had a great 3 months and got strong incline and got told I was the best intern they had and built good connections with the team i would return to, but I guess wlb is the big con\n\n\\- I reneged a Warner Bros. Discovery (HBO Max) (NYC) SWE return earlier for Bloomberg.\n\nUpcoming interviews:\n\n\\- Google SWE final (on site beginning of january): worried about team matching and timeline uncertainty I heard it takes forever.\n\n\\- Meta Production Engineering (PE) interviews in a week or so, not sure if PE aligns with my long term goals, so not sure if i should do the interviews\n\nI was able to get a sense of the bad Esh work life balance this fall at AWS, even though I had a great 3 months and was raised constantly for the work I was doing, it was a lot of work I owned a lot more than a “project” and seen the other full timers around me (was there during reinvent times which are known to be most stessful). I know it is better career growth and I would learn more than if I was at Bloomberg which is why I am considering it, but would love any advice from people at Bloomberg or know in general about the company. Sage maker is pretty secure no one gets affected from lay offs but thats just in the present, BB is known for way better security. Also should I still do the meta interviews which seems to be a long process and I am pretty happy with aws/bb or google if it happens. Also heard meta isnt the most secure. Thanks a lot in advance!",

Overall the search went much better than last time. With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.\n\nA few clarifying points about my labels:\n\n* \"Reached out to my network\" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.\n* \"AI agent applied for me\": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).\n* \"Withdrew after accepting other offer\": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the \"Declined\" label after \"Offer\".\n\nI've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.\n\nMy offers:\n\nSeries A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon\n-------------------|--------------------|------\naccepted | declined | declined\n$205k base | $200k base | $188k base\nno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonus\nOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)\n2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-Fri\n\nSome quick stats from the Sankey:\n\n* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)\n* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)\n* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.\n* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...\n* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had \"AI\" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.\n\nOverall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",

        "author": "MarathonMarathon",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm soon to become one of those \"unemployed CS majors\" everyone keeps talking about once I graduate. I've been struggling to find meaningful employment, and don't have a job lined up. The way things are currently heading, after graduation I'm likely just heading back to my mom's house and maybe working some shitty retail job with 0 upward mobility. This is a future some people (including some friends) from my high school have achieved without attending college, and if that's my future, it means my mom will have wasted 4 years on an expensive degree that ended up being worthless.\n\nI'm well aware that it only gets harder and harder to find a full-time job the longer you wait after graduating. Which is why I'm frightened of being jobless or underemployed once that happens, and then having an awkward gap in my resume to have to explain, which only gets more and more awkward the longer I wait.\n\nThe roles I've been applying to include SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science. While my undergraduate internship grinds have been very hit-or-miss, I have some \"roundabout\" experience (multiple unpaid internships + paid research) on my resume, some of it ongoing (and my performance there has been satisfactory), which I've been told is enough to land me interviews, which I have. It's just that I've been struggling to pass these interviews. I've known people who've managed to hand-wave themselves in through interviews just by talking a bit, but I've somehow failed even one of those when given one (though that was partially my fault since my reference waved me through without even giving me the JD).\n\nMy clear metric for \"success\" is having enough money to *be able to* move away from home and afford a non-shitty apartment if I wanted to (and in the event I don't, it'll be because the job is in my metro area, aka NYC). If I don't achieve this, I'll have failed. I wouldn't say I'm asking for much, and I feel like this is a quite reasonably low bar to clear, and if I don't clear it, I'm a failure.\n\nNow that it's Christmas already and I still don't have any kind of post-college offer in hand, things are not looking up. I've barely applied to any positions between Thanksgiving and Christmas and have secured 0 new interviews therein. I barely even grind Leetcode anymore, since it just makes me disappointed whenever I fail questions that are supposedly \"Easy\" or \"Medium\". If you gave me a Leetcode-style interview or OA right now, I'd probably fail it. I've yet to actually receive such an *interview* (OAs I have, with mixed performance), but I'm well aware that many companies do ask them. A lot of what I've failed so far is behavioral, though I've passed a few.\n\nI've received mixed messaging on whether to consider grad school. My parents aren't going to pay for it and I'll have to take out expensive loans if I do go for it. And I know cheap online programs like OMSCS exist, but I don't know if they're right or if it'll be too challenging, and I'm not even sure if it's something I'm seriously invested in either. The whole field just seems like a sinking ship with AI and all, and people seem to be right about there being no need to hire any more juniors.\n\nI just want to know what to do, because things seem absolutely grim, and people who've been through 2008 keep calling me entitled and telling me that the job market now isn't nearly as bad as 2008. Keep doing what I'm doing and hope something lands? But if nothing lands, what then? Certmaxx and pivot to IT? Push boxes in some Amazon warehouse alongside people without college degrees, rendering the degree worthless?",

And by impact, at the end of the day, one could say I mean money. Nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on has ever helped anyone and in turn made money. Simultaneously, every project, every product I have ever worked on was heavily overstaffed and with extreme food envy among developers.\n\nIs there anyone out there that actually works on something that people need? Is there any project out there that actually needs me?\n\nI've been interviewing for over a year now too and I ask the interviewers:\n\n\\- \"What are you working on?\"\n\n\\- \"Why are you hiring for this role?\"\n\nNobody can answer these questions. It's always some hand wavy explanation. You know, the kind you usually get from people lying about their resume. \"Oh this and that bla bla...\"\n\nAt the same time, as we all know, life has gotten so expensive that, at least I, personally, cannot really say \"Oh I will just do this job and in 5-10 years I can buy a house or something.\" Because I cannot. Where I live houses now go for about 20x - 30x the local average yearly income. I just don't know what I'm doing with my life here.\n\nNot that it ever really mattered to me anyhow. I don't really want to own a home. I got into this field, because I wanted to build something that helps people, that makes their lives easier or more enjoyable. Something that is valuable, that creates value. What I've seen instead is that we are our own stakeholders. We build for ourselves.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m a first-year CS student, and honestly, the job market has been stressing me out. Between tech layoffs, market saturation, and the rapid rise of AI, it’s hard not to feel anxious about the future of this field.\n\nLuckily, I’m still a freshman, so if shifting to another degree would truly offer better job security and a more stable income, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I genuinely love tech. I can see myself studying and working in this field long-term because of how vast and interesting it is. But we also can’t deny reality: the industry feels oversaturated, entry-level roles are extremely competitive, and the barrier to entry is relatively low. Anyone who self-studies can technically enter the field (even if they don’t have the same depth as someone who studied CS formally), and that definitely affects competition.\n\n\nSo my question is this:\nIf you were in college right now, still studying CS and not yet graduated, would you consider shifting to a traditional engineering degree instead?\n\nI’m talking about fields like:\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nElectronics Engineering\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nCivil Engineering\n\nDo these degrees actually offer better long-term job security compared to CS today? Or is the grass just greener on the other side?\n\nPS: I know some people will say, “If you’re doubting CS, then it’s not for you,” or that those who truly grind will succeed—or that this is just a way to reduce competition. That’s not my intent. I’m just trying to be realistic and pragmatic. I still see myself pursuing CS, but I want honest perspectives before it’s too late to pivot.\n\nWould really appreciate your thoughts.",

        "content": "I’m trying to break into tech, and given how difficult the job market is right now, I keep wondering why more people aren’t trying to build things together instead of endlessly waiting for opportunities.\n\nMy background is a bit non-traditional. I have an education and basic proficiency in software engineering, but I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in transportation and diesel mechanic environments. In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers. From the outside, it feels like there are real opportunities for software to improve productivity in industries that aren’t “tech-native.”\n\nI have an app idea based on problems I’ve personally dealt with, but it’s too ambitious for me to realistically build alone. In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often? Why do so many people, especially those trying to break into tech, stick to LeetCode, personal projects, and the job application grind instead of collaborating to build products that solve real problems and potentially create their own jobs?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAs someone trying to break into tech, I don’t understand why more people keep grinding interviews instead of teaming up to build software that solves real problems in non-tech industries and potentially creates their own jobs?",

Thought I would take it up as I was looking at moving there anyways since the job market in Houston is really bad (I know it's bad everywhere, but there are barely any job postings to even try to apply for outside of things like the occasional JP Morgan posting, space related companies and small businesses). Especially for the stack I have experience with (Node.js), everything in Houston seems to be .NET. From what I'm seeing on linkedIn, there are like 3x the job postings in Austin as Houston despite having a way smaller population and more jobs that have the tech stack I am familiar with.\n\nThe only offers I seem to be able to get right now in Houston are typically remote jobs with some sort of significant catch like early-stage startups, or something weird like a company owned by private equity with really bad glass door reviews. Not really looking for that at the moment as I need a bit more stability... and health insurance. \n\nI know Austin has been going downhill for the past couple years and lots of jobs are leaving the city, but I'm not sure if it's gotten as bad as Houston yet. I also don't want to move to another city and if it's going downhill, end up somehow being worse than Houston 5 years from now. Thoughts? ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nI’m looking for some perspective and advice from people who have been in similar situations.\n\n\nI joined a small startup about three months ago as a *full-stack developer*, although in practice I’m doing almost entirely front-end work. The company has been around for about 7 years, ~20 people total, and only 3 developers:\n\n\n* One backend developer\n* One senior developer who is currently transitioning into a Customer Success role\n* And me\n\n\nBefore this job, I did a bootcamp and a lot of self-study, but I’m very aware that I’m still junior. I’m learning every day, but there’s a big gap between where I am technically and the level of responsibility and trust they’re giving me.\n\n\nThat said, the company has been incredibly supportive so far:\n\n\n* I asked for Frontend Masters access and they approved it\n* I asked to understand more about the business beyond pure frontend, and they gave me a project building JavaScript automations in Airtable, touching operations, product, inventory, etc.\n* I asked for regular time with the senior dev to review things together, and that was also approved\n\n\nFrom a support and trust point of view, I honestly couldn’t ask for more.\n\n\nThe company is very product-focused and mainly B2B. They sell hardware and services to other businesses, but they also have a SaaS product. Around 80% of customers actively use it and pay for it, yet there’s no clear long-term SaaS strategy or roadmap. It feels more like “it exists and works” than “this is a core growth engine.”\n\n\nHere’s where my internal conflict starts:\n\n\n* On one hand, I know I’m still junior and should probably focus on fundamentals, shipping solid frontend work, and not overthinking things.\n* On the other hand, I see a real opportunity here to grow the SaaS side of the business, help shape a more structured software team, and eventually take on more responsibility if things go well.\n* I’m interested in full-stack and system complexity, not just UI work, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself or become “the guy with ideas but weak execution.”\n\n\nSo my questions are mainly:\n\n\n* Is this a good environment for a junior dev to grow, or is the lack of senior technical leadership risky?\n* How would you balance learning deeply vs stepping up when the company clearly gives you room?\n* Should I focus narrowly on becoming a very solid frontend engineer first, or is it reasonable to also invest energy in understanding the business and SaaS side early on?\n* Any red flags or opportunities you see from the outside?\n\n\nI’m genuinely grateful for the chance I’ve been given, but I want to be intentional about how I grow and avoid making preventable mistakes.\n\n\nThanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read or respond.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m going to college next year and have been having multiple changes of heart regarding my future career prospects and my major. For context, I learned how to program when I was 8, and now I would consider myself a pretty well-accomplished programmer with many great projects to boast. I’m excellent at Rust, C++, C, and JavaScript, and proficient with Java, Python, and other C-like languages. Since ages 8–15 I built multiplayer games, full-stack websites, physics engines, and ECS frameworks, with some projects having thousands of GitHub stars.\n\nBy 15, I discovered I really liked systems programming and learned theoretical CS topics like OS theory, compiler theory, networking, and embedded programming through open courseware. At 16, I made a dynamic memory allocator that rivals the speed of tcmalloc and jemalloc using a decentralized approach with journals, embedded metadata, and slabs. At 17, I built an ahead-of-time compiler for a Rust-like language with a complete frontend, a robust type checker handling traits and generics, a MIR system with monomorphization, and an LLVM backend generating cross-platform IR.\n\nVery recently, I’ve had an intense desire to learn math. I’ve already studied Calc 1–3, linear algebra (Axler is great btw), real analysis (baby rudin, abbott, fitzpatrick), abstract algebra (d&f, aluffi), and category theory, and this interest sharpened after reading Ahlfors' Complex Analysis starting in September, to the point that I'm now seriously considering majoring in it.\n\nMy mind has been flipping between studying math, CS, double majoring, or minoring in one. Given my extensive programming experience and familiarity with upper-level CS, I feel I’d rather spend college learning something I’m less proficient in (math). Double majoring in Math&CS might make it difficult to take all the math courses I want due to CS requirements, and I dislike entry CS courses like DSA that I likely can’t test out of.\n\nI don’t currently have job prospects (they keep changing), but I want to keep SWE jobs as an option after graduation, and I will 100% continue programming and building projects throughout college. If it helps in your consideration, I've been admitted to MIT and will likely commit there, and I might pursue a PhD afterward. My main question is whether majoring in math without a CS major/minor would be bad for SWE jobs given my experience and projects.\n\nEdit: I'll be majoring in pure math, not applied math that's nonsense.",

        "content": "I received a fully funded PhD scholarship in Mathematics. Originally, I applied for a PhD in Computer Science, but since the PI is affiliated with both departments, the scholarship was formally offered under Mathematics instead.\n\nMy main motivation for pursuing a PhD has always been industry research, not academia. I’m particularly interested in roles at places like DeepMind, FAIR, or smaller, niche AI research labs. From what I can tell, these positions typically expect a PhD in CS / ML (or very closely related fields), and a PhD in Mathematics does not seem to be the standard, or even explicitly listed, in most cases.\n\nI am not interested in becoming a professor. I see the PhD primarily as a means to access research-oriented industry roles, not as an academic career path in itself.\n\nThat said, there are several red flags that are making me hesitate:\n\n1. The PI is very new. I would be their second PhD student, and the first one is now a postdoc, still in academia.\n2. The PI has few publications, mostly in mathematics, and a very low h-index.\n3. The scholarship itself has some worrying conditions:\n   * Internships are not allowed.\n   * If I decide to leave the PhD early, they may require full reimbursement of the scholarship.\n\nThe internship restriction is especially concerning, since I want to move into industry research and not stay in academia.\n\nAt this point, the only reasons I still see for going forward are:\n\n1. Is it realistically possible to enter big tech / AI research labs without top-tier publications and without internships?\n2. Gaining research experience and living abroad.\n3. I genuinely find the research topic very interesting (I can share more details via DM; I’d prefer not to be too identifiable here).\n\nOne more important piece of context: I am already working as a software engineer, although with a very old tech stack and in a sector I don’t enjoy (defense). Because of this, an alternative plan would be to decline this scholarship, keep working for now, and apply again next year, which realistically might be my last chance, since I’m already 28.\n\nGiven all this:  \nWhat would you do in my position?

I'd like try o figure out ways to deal with these / overcome rather than give up / leave, for now.\n\nI myself am a senior, experienced engineer, we both have decades of experience, relatively successful careers.\n\nThe challenge with working with him, though, is that its like \\_he\\_ has a difficult time working autonomously. \n\nAs examples... he'll write a library for some good in principle idea of his, generally with an ambitious and elaborate implementation, a few ok unit tests, etc... then ask me to integrate some applications with that library. Fair enough. After I do that, he'll look at the integrated application+library combo, say it's not working as expected... and that its basically my job to diagnose/troubleshoot the whole combination. If I ask, well, has this library functionality been tested, has it \\_ever worked\\_, generally the answer is no. Now, sure, it is \\_possible\\_ for me to take over and figure out what's wrong with his library, but it's kind of inefficient, since its all fresh in his head, and I'm coming at it from it uninitiated, so maybe it's a few days work just to figure out how it's \\_supposed\\_ to work., etc.\n\nOther examples are, there are tasks assigned to me, I do them, send a PR, he approves the PR, I put the PR in a weekly status update, the ticket gets updated and closed... then a few weeks later, he'll be like \"what happened with ticket 1234? did that get ever get done? was it lost, i don't see it when running the app\". I do some basic looking around... turns out the app has been rolled back to an older version by someone else in the team. It's frustrating, though, because that would be pretty trivial for him to look into via either email, the ticket system, looking at the app version, asking other people in the team, etc etc... but he chats straight to me like drop everything, work got lost, etc.. which can be disruptive.\n\nOverall, I feel like, if I had junior-ish developer reporting to me that started out like this, that would be ok, but I'd be focusing strongly on getting them up to speed, self-sufficient, and past this stage over the first year or two, and if they didn't, I'd consider that to be a problem. Along the way, I'd be asking questions like \"What have you tried so far to diagnose this?\", \"Do you have everything you need to solve this kind of issue yourself in future, etc.\".\n\nOverall, it just feels like he is intelligent, but also kind of \"needy\", lacking in attention to detail, and ultimately that's going to stop us both from being able to do our best work, but it's kind of difficult dealing with this as the report rather than the manager in this situation. Ideas welcome!\n\n",

        "content": "  \nI have struggled figuring out how to manage this since high school.\n\nBecause the software engineering industry was changing so fast, I wanted a full understanding of the fundamentals of program design and computer science.\n\nI had done clone-tutorials and courses to learn how to build projects that came to mind such as 2d game engines in SDL2 or an app clone, but I would always forget the code I learnt because I was \"studying\" a bunch of programming libraries and the program design of the tutorial by trying to copy line by line, after I see the working project I try to google each part of the code in the documentation, get lost googling more concepts without understanding the big picture, then I had to go back to my schoolwork and would forget everything I \"learnt\". It was as though there was a big valley between:\n\n (intro to/ intermediate /advanced xyz programming language + intro to object oriented programming course structure  then getting into a specific software programming discipline such as \"intro to app development\" and being overwhelmed with the sheer amount of libraries and how exactly these tools are designed in order to implement anything. I had no idea how to reach the point to even just read the documentation and code from scratch without having to read half of the entire class  attributes while still confused.)\n\n  \nI felt insecure about this learning style and decided I would focus more on trying to study mathematics and computer science topics before college, an effort that just amounted to doing a bunch of practice problems and khan academy constantly as per my math teachers instruction.\n\nI wanted to be able to design programs and dissect pre-existing designs, to be able to understand research on algorithms if not to design my own, to explore future applications of CS research or at least to be a software engineer that could make something without relying on a tutorial with code to copy. \n\n  \nIn college I had to split my focus between biology, chemistry, anatomy, anthropology, discrete math, calculus, linear algebra, bioanthropology.. as you can see, a lot of topics required by my CS degree before I could even think about programming, yet pre-existing programming knowledge was expected and  in our CS classes our assignments would consist of fairly complicated 'real world projects' to implement the concepts we were learning but we never talked about any code in class. Most professors were laissez faire in defining how students should learn to program. \"Just code\" which made it hard to see why I was doing so poorly compared to other students.\n\nMy cohort consisted of:\n\n people who had parents who were in STEM/programmers  or very STEM oriented schools so they had learnt programming & CS a structured environment for so long they couldn't really define their curriculum beyond \"I just learnt it\" compared to me who just struggled on youtube & stackoverflow without any help.\n\npeople who were using GPT  & friends for all assignments and somehow getting away with it, but I didn't want to risk it and I had no friends either way. \n\n  \nPeople who seemed to make \"just  think of things you'd like to make, watch tutorials and ask questions\" work, but I still don't understand the specifics of how they learnt to dissect program design from tutorials without flailing around in the documentation taking notes on a dozen functions and variables that still don't tie together conceptually,  especially while dealing with schoolwork at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs professionals, how are students supposed to manage learning software engineering and computer science + other coursework independently?\n\n",

I’m prioritizing depth, clean design, and being able to clearly explain tradeoffs rather than learning many stacks superficially.\n\nMy question is not about whether I should learn more languages.\n\nI’m specifically wondering:\n\n* Is it generally acceptable to list a single main tech stack on a resume if all projects use it but demonstrate different problem domains and complexity?\n* For companies like the ones mentioned above, do recruiters/interviewers care more about stack diversity, or about project quality and engineering decisions?\n* At what point (if any) does repeating the same stack across projects become a negative for full-stack SWE roles?\n\nContext: first year student in Canada\n\nWould appreciate perspectives from people who’ve reviewed resumes or interviewed candidates.",

I'm based in London, and here's my situation:\n\nMathWorks has their Cambridge office, which is an easy commute from London, and they're paying around 20% more than Autodesk. Cambridge is also a city I'd genuinely be happy working in long-term if I received a return offer.\n\nAutodesk has their office in Birmingham, which isn't particularly appealing as a place to live or work. However, Autodesk has stronger brand recognition in the industry.\n\nI'm torn because while Autodesk's name carries more weight, MathWorks offers better compensation, a preferable location, and I'd actually be open to staying there post-graduation. The pay difference and location quality seem significant, but I'm unsure how much the brand difference matters for my career trajectory.",

        "content": "Hey all, \n\nI'm currently working as a software developer as a contractor in U.S. government.\n\nThe job is alright. I can't really complain as I have a job, but I've been here for a few years and I'm starting to think more directly about the future.\n\nFor some context, my background is not a traditional CS degree pipeline. I have a Bachelor's Degree in English and I taught for about 5 years. I enjoyed teaching, but the pay wasn't cutting it for me or my family and I made the switch to CS. I attended a 9-month bootcamp and got the job I'm currently at a little over 2 years ago. This means I have 2 years in software work experience but no CS degree on my resume.\n\nWhile my job seems pretty stable right now (at least for this upcoming year), I'm always considering the next steps and the potential for increased pay. That said, I really don't want to take on loads of new debt and derail my financial progress. \n\nWhat is the most cost efficient way to get a more relevant transcript on my resume? I was looking at online options like WGU but I've been told that wasn't well-regarded and is even blacklisted by some companies. Is this true? Are there similar options that are more highly regarded?\n\nJust trying to see my best option or if it's even worth pursuing a master's degree right now. I've seen a few other online programs, but they are priced to the point where I'll need to take out more loans than I'm comfortable taking.",

        "content": "I’m in a really weird spot career wise and I’m not sure of what I should do to get a job. I have my CS degree, certs, projects and 2 YOE but the work I did was very light weight. All I did was make a few react components and do regression testing. I was at a consulting company so for 8 months or so all I did was training at the company.\n\nI really don’t know how to list this on my resume. I tried embellishing my resume but when questioned on a recent interview it was clear I was lying, I genuinely felt like I was gonna pass out from the anxiety.\n\nAfter 1k+ apps and no job, I’m not sure what to do. It’s been over a year since my last job laid me off. I went to a community college and then an online university so my credentials aren’t great. Both degrees are in CS.\n\nI was accepted into OMSCS last year but I didn’t attend because I thought it would’ve been smarter to get cloud certs and make projects then mass apply. Well that obviously didn’t work.\n\nNow It seems like it’s impossible for me to get a job. Now I’m going to go back to work on a bachelor’s in accounting but I also want to stay relevant in tech. So I’ll be doing two programs part time.\n\nI’m thinking of attending OMSCS again or joining UMD as a transfer student and finish a bachelors in information systems. I think it would take me less time for the information systems degree because I can transfer in my credits.\n\nThanks for reading and I appreciate your advice.",
