Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \\~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.\n\nA little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.\n\nThe core issues:\n\n* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output\n* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy\n* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity\n* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable\n* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview features\n\nThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.\n\nComing from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.\n\nI'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.\n\nDE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.\n\n  \nEDITED: Because there was too much details and colleagues.",

The organizations's data volumes are small - I only need single-node compute, not distributed Spark clusters.\n\n**Polars** looks perfect for this scenario. I've heard a lot of good feedback about Polars. But I’ve also heard some warnings that it might move behind a paywall (Polars Cloud) and the open-source project might end up abandoned/not being maintained in the future.\n\n**Spark** is said to have more committed backing from big sponsors, and doesn't have the same risk of being abandoned. But it's heavier than what I need.\n\nIf I use Polars now, am I potentially just building up technical debt? Or is it reasonable to trust it for production long-term? Would sticking with Spark - even though I don’t need multi-node - be a more reasonable choice?\n\nI’m not very experienced and would love to hear what more experienced people think.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a little over five years of experience. I started my career as a Software Engineer working on Python-based full stack applications for 2 years and later moved into a Data Engineer role at a new company because there were very few Python backend opportunities at the time.\n\nOver the last three and a half years, I’ve realised that I never really got to work as a “proper” data engineer. Most of my work involved data administration, Python automation, some cloud services, cloud data warehouses, basic data modelling, and a few simple Airflow pipelines that pulled data from APIs and loaded it using pandas. I never worked with Spark or large-scale data pipelines.\n\nNow that I’m trying to switch jobs, I’m in a confusing spot. Based on my experience, companies expect me to be a Senior Data Engineer, but I don’t have hands-on experience with many of the tools they expect at that level. At the same time, when I get considered for junior  roles, the pay is around 50 percent lower than what I make today. It’s also hard not to compare myself to people with fewer years of experience who seem to have worked on far more complex data systems.\n\nI’m willing to start now, learn Spark seriously, build strong projects, and put in the effort. I’m just unsure if it’s too late at this stage or if taking a pay cut is the only way to reset my career. Is there a smarter way to transition into real data engineering without completely derailing things?\n\nAny honest advice would really help.\n\nTL;DR: 5+ YOE with a Data Engineer title but limited real DE experience. Now expected to be senior without Spark or large-scale pipeline work. Junior roles mean a big pay cut. Looking for guidance.",

The point of this project was to actually deploy something real while keeping the costs close to 0 and to design an actual API. The DE part is getting the data from GitHub, storing it in S3, aggregating and then visualizing it. My worry is that this project might be a bit too simple and generic. \n\n[**Study-Time-Tracker-Python**](https://github.com/simon-milata/Study-Time-Tracker-Python)  \nThis was my first actual project and the first time using git so the code quality and git usage weren't great. It's also not at all something I would do at work and might seem too amateurish. I do think it's pretty cool tho as it looks pretty nice, is unique and even has a few stars and forks which I think is pretty rare.\n\n[**TkinterOS**](https://github.com/simon-milata/TkinterOS)  \nThis was my second project which I made cause I saw GodotOS and thought it would be cool  to try to recreate it using Tkinter. It includes a bunch of games and an (unfinished) file system. It also has a few stars but the code quality still is still bad. Very unrelated to work too.  \n\n\nI know this might feel out of place being posted on a DE sub but these are the only presentable projects I have so far and I'm mostly interested in DE. These projects were mostly made to practice python and make stuff.  \n  \nFor my next project I'm planning on learning PySpark and trying Redshift / Databricks. My biggest issue is that I feel like the difficulty of DE is the the scale of the data and regulations which is very hard / very expensive to recreate. I also don't really want to make simple projects which just transform some fake data once.  \n\n\nSorry for the blocks of text I have no idea how to write reddit posts.

I’ve been applying to roles, and I’ve been custom-tailoring my CV for each one trying to  highlight similar tech, workflows, and the kinds of data projects I’ve done specifically relating to the job spec  but I’m not getting any shortlists.\n\nIs it just that crowded? I sometimes struggle to hear back even if it's a company in my sector. am I missing something? need advice\n\nEdit: I do mean data engineering for a games company ",

        "author": "SoloArtist91",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm running into bit of dilemma with this bronze level table that I'm trying to construct and need some advice. \n\nThe data for the table is sent hourly by the vendor 16 times in the day as a CSV that has transaction data in a 120 day rolling window. This means each file is about 33k rows by 233 columns, around 50 MB. There is no last modified timestamp, and they overwrite the file with each send. The data is basically a report they run on their DMS with a flexible date range, so occasionally we request a history file so they send us one big file per store that goes across several years.\n\nThe data itself changes state for about 30 days or so before remaining static, so that means that roughly 3/4s of the data may not be changing from file to file (though there might be outliers).\n\nSo far I've been saving each file sent in my Azure Data Lake and included the timestamp of the file in the filename. I've been doing this since about April and have accumulated around 3k files.\n\nNow I'm looking to start loading this data into Databricks and I'm not sure what's the best approach to load the bronze layer between several approaches I've researched.\n\nOption A: The bronze/source table should be append-only so that every file that comes in gets appended. However, this would mean I'd be appending 500kish rows a day, and 192m a year which seems really wasteful considering a lot of the rows would be duplicates.\n\nOption B: the bronze table should reflect the vendors table at the current state, so each file should be upserted into the bronze table - existing rows are updated, new rows inserted. The criticisms I've seen of this approach is that it's really inefficient, and this type of incremental loading is best suited for the silver/warehouse layer.\n\nOption C: Doing an append only step, then another step that dedupes the table based on a row hash after a load. So I'd load everything in, then keep only the records that have changed based on business rules.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm hoping to orchestrate all of this through Dagster and then using DBT for downstream transformations.\n\nDoes one option make more sense than the others, or is there another approach I'm missing?

Iceberg tables with partitions just aren’t properly supported by Terraform, so we ended up with a pretty ugly workaround that’s hard to read, reason about, and debug.\n\nI’m curious: Do you run a similar setup?

On each notebook run - one run each hour - the notebook makes 1000 API requests. \n\nIn the notebook, all the API responses get combined into a single Dataframe, and the dataframe gets written to a bronze delta lake table (append mode).\n\nNext, a gold notebook reads the newly inserted data from the bronze table (using a watermark timestamp column) and writes it to a gold table (also append).\n\nOn the gold table, I will run optimize or auto compaction, in order to optimize for end user queries. I'll also run vacuum to remove old, unreferenced parquet files.\n\nHowever, on the bronze layer table, is it necessary to run optimize and vacuum there? Or is it just a waste of resources?\n\nInitially I'm thinking that it's not necessary to run optimize and vacuum on this bronze layer table, because end users won't query this table. The only thing that's querying this table frequently is the gold notebook, and it only needs to read the newly inserted data (based on the ingestion timestamp column). Or should I run some infrequent optimize and vacuum operations on this bronze layer table?\n\nFor reference, the bronze table has 40 columns, and each hourly run might return anything from ten thousand to one million rows.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your advices and experiences.",

So for example we have about 150k orders per year and I don't need line items because Shopify does that deeper analysis really well. BigQuery would eat that up out volume.\n\n**Why Looker**\n\nI think Looker is very cost effective and can plug in lots of stuff. For eg I can have Spreadsheets for some data and join it in Looker to BigQuery.\n\n**Why AirByte**\n\nA big part of this is deciding on an ETL. When I started we were using Celigo but found them to be pretty inflexible on billing. It's just a good example of lock-in I want to avoid.  \n  \nSo I've been testing the Airbyte Shopify->BigQuery connector and it seems to do what i need. While it has the commercial solution, I feel confident I can switch to the community (open source) version later if I wanted to self host an ETL (which i think is a good long-term strategy in this day and age).\n\n**Lock-in thoughts**\n\nWe are a Microsoft/Sharepoint place and while I don't dislike Azure I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft. We happened to already have Looker and GA because our Shopify vendor preferred it, and the business has never questioned this. So essentially I've put a Google Cloud strategy around these tools, and adding BigQuery is a bit of a no brainer. Obviously there is cloud lock-in to Google here, but in the massive event of Google dropping Looker/BigQuery I reckon we would survive as a business since most of our operational stuff is over in Shopify.\n\n**Doubts**\n\nThe Shopify analytics platform is insanely good. If I could add some custom data to it I wouldn't be here writing this post. But I don't think that's in their business strategy to be a generic BI tool.\n\nUnexpected costs are always a concern. Monitoring unexpected cloud costs, or regretting a SaaS product when you see \"Contact Sales for Pricing\" on some feature. I dunno if I can avoid that.\n\n  \n\n\n",

I did go through the search by on this page, and found a decent amount of answers - however I honestly need it explained like im 5 and then I have some follow ups.. and then FAQ won’t open for me. So I’ll start with my background and situation -\n\nI’m 29 years old, and I am a EHS (environmental health and safety) manager for a FAANG company. It’s a stable career. However I am not very content there. I kind up ended up in this career on accident, and then ran with it. I used to be a computer science major, and spent a year or so learning coding through books and online programs as well. I  withdrew from the course, because honestly I siked my self out of it. I convinced myself the market for that field is just too competitive and that it would be a waste of time for me. Reason I felt I didn’t have a chance is because I’m not really in a position to be able to internships as I cannot leave my job to do any (sole provider family of 5) so I felt I was at too big of a disadvantage.\n\nWell I finally decided, I do want to pursue tech because that field is what I truly enjoy. This is part where I need help, I’m having a hard time figuring out exactly what role I should pursue/what the natural progression is for these roles? So to breakdown my interest - I am really interested in all things data, I love engineering/coding, and I’m a big excel nerd. I would like to get into power BI as well, just haven’t jumped on. I do a decent amount of data work at my role now, because my company is huge on metrics/data. I use excel daily to deep dive data and analyze trends and what not on there, and I’ve made a lot of tools/trackers as well.\n\nSo what I’ve kinda narrowed down for the main data roles are\n\nData Analyst\n\nData Scientist\n\nData Engineer\n\nBusiness Intelligence Analyst\n\nSo do all these roles progress together like advance through them, or are they all entirely separate paths? I wanted to see if someone could explain them to me like I’m 5, and then maybe tell me which kind of degree is recommended for each one? I have a decent understanding of data analyst/BI Analyst- so are those starting points to eventually become data engineers? Im also confused on this, because everything I’ve read online is that it seems none of them are entry level, so how would I start?\n\nThe two degrees im tossing around right now are from WGU - either Data Analytics or go back to Computer Science. Are there other/better degrees out there  I should explore for this field?\n\nTLDR - Questions:\n\n\\- can someone break down the main different data roles simply and how/if they progress together?\n\n\\- What’s the better option for a degree - Data Analytics, Computer Science, or is there something else I should explore?\n\n\\- Which degrees are beneficial for each different data role?\n\n\\- Is it dumb for me to want to leave my stable career to pursue this?\n\n\\- Do I even have a chance without really being able to any internships?\n\n\\-What’s the best role for breaking into this field?\n\nSorry guys I know this a lot! Just trying to get the next steps figured out!",

I once upon a time loved my company, it was actually a great place to work, until they called us back in office 5 days a week and the owner was literally counting heads to see who was all there.\n\nThen all of a sudden the policies change, we have to put in for PTO to go to the doctor for an hour, they're watching cameras to see who's coming in. Not to mention the only other dude on the data team literally comes in at 9am, leaves his computer on his desk and walks out at 11am, and I don't see him again until 6pm. So we're all being scrutinized because of him. Everyone has to be there for 8 hours except for him. Management is aware but won't do anything about it.\n\nI work hard, I enjoy doing good work and trying to make a difference at my company. I just can't help but to feel this isn't the place for me anymore. I love what I'm building, I'm basically building our data strategy from the ground up. But I can't stand how we're being treated, and it's very difficult for me to go in 5 days a week because one of my dogs has special needs.\n\nBut it's a toss up because the job market is very bleak right now. So I can try to find a remote job, but who knows what kind of company I'll end up with. With my luck I'll end up at a horrible company.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

        "author": "BuissnessRake",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello! This is my first post in this sub. I’ve seen a lot of strong practical advice here and would like to get multiple perspectives on how to approach a messy data cleanup and modeling problem.\n\nUntil recently, I worked mostly at startups, so I never dealt with serious legacy data issues. I just joined a midsized private company as an “Analyst.” During the hiring process, after hearing about their challenges, I told them it sounded like they really needed a data engineer or more specifically an analytics engineer. They said nope we just need an analyst, which i thought was odd. FYI: They already have an ERP system, but the data is fragmented, difficult to retrieve, and widely acknowledged across the company as dirty and hard to work with.\n\nOnce I joined, I got access to the tools I needed fairly quickly by befriending IT. However, once I started digging into the ERP backend, I found some fundamental problems. For example, there are duplicated primary keys in header tables. While this can be handled downstream, it highlights that even basic principles like first normal form were not followed. I understand ERPs are often denormalized, but this still feels extreme.\n\nSome historical context that likely contributed to this:\n\n* In the past, someone was directly injecting data via SQL\n* The company later migrated to a cloud ERP\n* Business processes have changed multiple times since then\n\nAs a result, naming conventions, supplier numbers, product numbers, and similar identifiers have all changed over time, often for the same logical entity. Sales data is especially messy. Some calculated fields do not align with what is defined in the ERP’s data dictionary, and overall there is very little shared understanding or trust in the data across the company.\n\nConstraints I am working under:\n\n* I have read-only access to the ERP and cannot write data back, which is appropriate since it is the raw source\n* of-course the ERP is not a read-optimized database, so querying it directly is painful\n* There are over 20,000 tables in total, but after filtering out audit, temp, deprecated, and empty tables, I am down to roughly 500 tables\n* Total row count across those tables is likely 40 to 50 million rows, though normalization makes that hard to reason about\n* I am the first and only data-focused hire\n\nThe business context also matters. There are no real long-term data goals right now. Most work is short-term:\n\n* One-week automations of existing manual processes\n* One to two month dashboard and reporting projects\n\nStakeholders primarily want reports, dashboards, and automated spreadsheets. There is very little demand for deeper analysis, which makes sense given how unreliable the underlying data currently is. Most teams rely heavily on Excel and tribal knowledge, and there is effectively zero SQL experience among stakeholders.\n\nMy initial instinct was to stand up a SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance and start building cleaned, documented models or data marts by domain. However, I am not convinced that:\n\n1. I will get buy-in for that approach\n2. It is the right choice given maintainability and the short-term nature of most deliverables\n\nAs a fallback, I may end up pulling subsets of tables directly into Power BI and doing partial cleaning and reshaping using Power Query transformations just to get something usable in front of stakeholders.\n\nSo my core question is:  \n**How would you approach cleaning, organizing, documenting, and storing this kind of historically inconsistent ERP data while still delivering short-term reports and dashboards that stakeholders are expecting?**\n\nIf I am misunderstanding anything about ERPs, analytics engineering, or data modeling in this context, I would appreciate being corrected.",

We have a DA but there's no alignment at the senior leadership level across product and architecture so their priorities are elsewhere\n\n\\- Analysts sit in another department \n\nThe engineers on my team are understandably advocating for bringing in some foundational modelling, standards work but the company expects quick outputs. \n\nI want to avoid over-engineering but I'm concerned we will incur a lot of tech debt later on down the line that will need to be unpacked - that's on top of the company not getting the value it envisioned with a platform.\n\nFor anyone who has been in this situation do you have any guidance on whether you have:\n\n\\- Taken a step back to focus on foundational work? I know a full-scale enterprise data model is not happening at this point but is there something we can begin to bring into our sprints for our higher value use cases? \n\n\\- Do you have a definition of 'good enough' to help keep you moving while minimising later pain? \n\nI really want to do the best for the team while bearing in mind the questions I know I'll get from leadership in the value of this kind of work.

        "content": "Where I work, there is no Scrum. Tickets keep coming in, and the coordinator distributes them and sets priorities. There are no sprints, because management frequently overrides priorities due to requests from the board and other management areas—almost on a daily basis. It’s basically a ticket queue that we execute as it comes.\n\nDuring the day, I receive many different demands: validating data, mapping new tables, checking alerts from failed processes, discussions about possible data inconsistencies, reviewing PRs, helping interns, answering questions from people on other teams, etc.\n\nSometimes more than 10 people message me at the same time on Teams. I try to filter, organize priorities, and postpone what is not feasible to do on the same day, but more demands arrive than I can realistically handle, so tasks keep piling up.\n\nWe do have a team board, but I don’t like tracking everything there because some tasks are things like “talk to person X about Y” or “validate what person X did wrong,” which I don’t want to expose directly to colleagues and managers. So on the board I keep things more generic, without many comments\n\nLately, I’ve been putting everything into a single markdown file (tasks and personal notes). The most urgent items go to the top of the list as a simple TODO, but it keeps growing and sometimes it becomes hard to manage tasks and priorities\n\nNaturally, there are tasks that never get done. My manager is aware of this and agrees that they should only be prioritized when it makes sense, but new ones keep coming in, and I miss having a tool where I could search for similar tasks or something along those lines\n\nHave you ever faced this difficulty in organizing tasks? Do you have any tips for a simple workflow? I tried using some tools like Todoist and Taskwarrior, but I ended up preferring the ease of searching in a single file, even though it grows very large very quickly and eventually becomes messy and difficult to manage.

This reduces the risk of data being lost during processing.\n\nThe changing data would be stored in a new table every month, and once that data is around five years old it would be deleted (or handled in a similar way).\n\nI know this sounds fairly simple, but there will be thousands of data entries in the CSV files every 10 minutes.\n\nDo you have any tips or advice? Is it a bad idea to split the unchanging string data into a separate table to save space? Once I know how the business actually wants to use the data, I’ll be back to ask about the best way to really wow them.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I’m a 2025 graduate in Big Data Analytics and currently looking for my first job. It’s been about 5.5 months since my internship ended, and during this time I’ve been doing a lot of reflection on my academic journey. The program was supposed to prepare us for roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist, but honestly, I have mixed feelings about how effective it really was.\n\nOver three years, we covered a huge range of topics: statistics, machine learning, big data, databases, networking, cybersecurity, embedded systems, image processing, mobile development, Java EE/ spring bot, SaaS development, ETL, data warehousing, Kafka, spark, and more. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, it often felt scattered and a bit inefficient.\n\nWe kept jumping between multiple languages (C, java, python, javascript) without enough time to truly master any of them. Many technical modules stayed very theoretical, with little connection to real-world use cases: real datasets, real production pipelines, proper data engineering workflows, or even how to debug a broken pipeline beyond adding print statements. Some courses were rushed, some poorly structured, and others lacked continuity or practical guidance.\n\n\n\nI know university is meant to build foundations, not necessarily teach the latest trendy tools. Still, I feel the curriculum could have been more focused and better aligned with what data roles actually require today, such as:\n\n* strong SQL and solid database design\n* Strong python for data processing and pipelines \n* Real ETL and data modeling projects \n* Distributed systems with clear, practical applications\n* A clear separation between web development tracks and data tracks\n* Better guidance on choosing ML algorithms depending on the use case\n\nInstead, everything was mixed together: web dev, mobile dev, low-level systems, data science, big data, and business, without a clear specialization path.\n\nNow I’m trying to fill the gaps by self-studying and building real projects, mainly with a data engineering focus. For context, here are the main projects I worked on during my internships:\n\n1. Machine test results dashboard  \n\n* A web application to visualize machine test results.  \n* Stack: Django REST Framework, MongoDB, React.\n\nIt was a 2-person project over 2 months. I was responsible for defining what should be displayed (failure rate, failure rate by machine/section, etc.) and implementing the calculation logic while making sure the results were accurate. I also helped with the frontend even though it was my first time using JavaScript. A lot of it was assisted by chatgpt and claude, then reviewed and corrected with my teammate.\n\n2. Unix server resource monitoring system   \n\nA server monitoring platform providing:\n\n* Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network via websockets  \n* Historical analysis with time-series visualization\n* ML-based anomaly detection using Isolation Forest\n* Server management (CRUD, grouping, health tracking)\n* Scalable architecture with Kafka streaming and redis caching\n\nStack: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, redis, Kafka, Angular 15, all containerized with Docker.\n\nI admit the stack is more “web-heavy” than “pure data engineering,” but it was chosen to match the company’s ecosystem and increase hiring chances (especially Angular, since most of their tech team were web developers). Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to a position.\n\nNow I’d really need advice from people already working in data engineering:\n\n* What core skills should I prioritize first? \n* How deep should I go into SQL, Python, and system design?\n* What kinds of projects best show readiness for a junior data engineer role(and where can i get the data like the millions of rows of data aside from web scraping)?\n* How do you personally bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations?\n*  What are your thoughts on certifications like those on Coursera?\n* And for the love of god … how do you convince HR that even if you’ve never used their exact stack, you have the fundamentals and can become operational quickly?\n\nAny advice, feedback, or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\*  \n\nMy data program covered a lot but felt too scattered and too theoretical to fully prepare for real data engineering roles. I’m now self-learning, building projects, and looking for guidance on what skills to prioritize and how to position myself as a solid junior data engineer.",

In fact, we can't guarantee that we'll be able to keep this history forever.  \n\nWe'll always keep active records and can always re-build bronze with active records.  \n\nHowever, we do have gold level data and aggregate fact table, and it's possible that some of the records in gold could be from a snapshot in time.  \n\nLet's say there are 3 records in a gold fact that summarize a total.  \nRecord 1: ID=1, ver=5 ,Amount=$100  \nRecord 2: ID=2, ver=5, Amount=$100  \nRecord 3: ID=3, ver=3, Amount=$50\n\nThere will be a point in time where this gold fact will persist and not be updated even if Record with ID=1 has a change in the amount in bronze layer.  This is by design and is a business requirement.\n\nEventually in bronze, record with ID=1 changes to ver=6 and Amount now=$110.\n\nThis time, we don't want to update the gold fact for this scenario, so it remains as ver=5.\n\nEventually, in bronze, due to retention, we lose the bronze record for ver=5, but we still keep v=6.  The gold still has a record of what the value was at the time and a record that it's based on the record being v=5.\n\nThe business is fine with it; and in fact they prefer it.  The like the idea of being able to access the specific version in bronze as it was at the time, but if it's lost due to retention then they are ok with that because they will just trust the number in the gold fact table; they'll know why it doesn't match source by comparing the version value.  \n\nAs a data expert, I struggle with it.  \n\nWe lose row-version lineage back to bronze, but the business is ok with that risk.  \n\nAs data engineers, how do you feel about this scenario?  We can compromise on the implementation, and I believe we are still ensuring trust of the data in other ways (for their needs) by keeping the copy of the record (what the value was at the time) in gold for the purposes of financial review and analysis.  \n\nThoughts?

We are currently recruiting and amount of junior, mid and sometimes even senior developers, who cannot write a simple code by their own without using AI is absolutely ridicoulous.\n\nAI can be helpful at work, but when you learn, it can hurt you more than it helps. It gives you answers too fast. You paste the code, it runs, and you feel good for a moment… but you don’t really know why it works. Then later you get a different problem, something small changes, and suddenly you are stuck. And the worst part is: you don’t build the “debug muscle”, and debugging is a big part of programming.\n\nI see this with juniors sometimes. They can produce code, but when I ask “why did you do it this way?” they can’t explain. When tests fail, they panic. When an error shows up, they don’t know what to try first. It’s not because they are not smart. It’s because AI took the hard part away, and that hard part is exactly what builds skill and confidence.\n\nWhen you learn, the best thing is to struggle a little. Write the code yourself. Read the error message. Try to understand what the program is doing. Use print logs or a debugger. Read docs. It feels slow and annoying at first, but this is how you become strong. This is how you start to “see” problems.\n\nIf you really want to use AI, use it like a helper, not like a driver. Ask for a hint, not a full solution. Ask what an error means.

I know I’m still a junior, but it really annoys me that I’m so slow. And in meetings, when I say that I’m still not finished, he sometimes looks at me like I’m stupid. Maybe I’m just overthinking it, but it really gets to me. Another thing is that when I try to learn something new, it takes me a really long time to understand it. If a “normal” developer needs maybe 1–2 hours to get it, it often takes me 4–5 hours. That makes me feel even worse, like I’m just not smart enough for this field.\n\nI know that programming is not for everyone, and sometimes I’m scared that I might be one of those people who are just not made for this job.

I even started a project at home (a small Mini CRM) to improve my skills, and I want to learn Azure and later move more into cloud / cybersecurity. That’s my long-term goal. But another problem is that after work I’m often so mentally exhausted and demotivated that I don’t even want to touch my own project anymore. Instead, I keep thinking things like:\n“Why did you choose this path?”\n“You will never be a good developer.”\n“You can’t even handle C#, why do you want to learn Azure?”\n\nI don’t want to be a “meh” developer. My dream is to become a really solid senior-level developer in 2–3 years. I know that’s ambitious, but I’m willing to work hard for it.

Noticed clear patterns across all successful implementations that our initial design was completely missing.\n\nThey make sharing incredibly easy with pre-written messages and one-click options, show clear benefit to both referrer and referred person like \"give $10 get $10\", display progress toward rewards so you know how close you are, prompt sharing at natural moments like after completing task not randomly, make rewards actually valuable not just badges or points.\n\nApplied all these patterns to our feature by simplifying sharing to one click with customizable message, implemented two-sided incentive with real value, added progress tracking prominently, triggered share prompts after positive experiences like successful workflow completion.\n\nFeature launched 3 weeks ago and referral rate is 23% meaning almost quarter of users refer at least one person, PM says that's way higher than initial goal of 10%. Honestly just copied what works for other products instead of making up our own approach, turns out proven patterns exist for most features and following them works better than trying to be original.\n\nBiggest lesson is when building growth features research is more important than innovation, these patterns have been tested millions of times already so just implement what works.

I used to think being able to write good code is pretty much everything. And this is even more difficult to notice when you're self taught because codebases are pretty much the only metrics you have to measure yourself against.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I think learning to program isn't even about reading documentation. The docs could perfectly explain what a function is/does, but almost nothing about \\*why\\* it would even be used. I only learned this after I spent months iterating on the same project and weighing tradeoffs against one another.\n\nTo keep this short, I want to know what else you can add to my observation. I don't think of the years I spent misapplying design patterns as wasted time, but I want to make sure I recognize what truly matters for professional growth and delivering actual value.\n\nOf course, none of this matters for toy projects. But I pursue programming as a profession so this matters to me :)",

        "content": "Been teaching myself javascript for about 6 months now and I kept running into this problem where I'd learn something, use it in a project, then completely forget it.\n\nI realized my issue was that I was just passively reading tutorials and documentation without actively testing my knowledge.\n\nOne thing that helped was connecting new concepts to stuff I already knew. Like when learning promises, I'd link it back to callback functions and explain how they solve callback hell. Building a web of connected knowledge instead of isolated facts.\n\nI also keep a running list of common mistakes I make in a separate doc. Like forgetting to return in array methods or mixing up async/await syntax. Reviewing my actual errors is way more useful than rereading correct examples. Stack overflow obviously helps when I'm stuck but I try to understand WHY something works instead of just copying the solution.\n\nMy current setup is a mix of tools that work together pretty well. I use vscode obviously for coding, github for version control and tracking my projects. For learning and retention, I keep my notes in remnote cause it automatically makes flashcards and quizzes from my notes. I also use codepen for quick experiments when I want to test something without setting up a whole project.\n\nStill got a long way to go but at least now I'm not forgetting everything I learned last week. If you're struggling with retention maybe try something similar, just actively test yourself instead of passively rereading notes. MDN docs are great as reference but terrible for remembering stuff.",

I’m concerned that I’d be wasting my time only focusing on front-end and not have it pay off. I like programming because you have to keep up with emerging technologies and always have to improve. With that said I have some questions:\n\n1. Will getting a cs degree actually help me find a job? From what I read on this subreddit it seems like everybody recommends that you have a degree to stand out and land a job. \n\n2. Should I continue my self study and switch to a full stack learning program to stand out? (Which I’m seriously considering) And if I do what additional learning should I do? I’ve read on here that DSA is something that companies look for when hiring, should I add that to things I should study? What projects should I create that will help me stand out to companies when I feel competent enough in my skills? (Again under the assumption I switched to full stack) \n\nI welcome all feedback! Don’t hold back, I need the REALITY of what I need or should do. I’m fully committed continuing learning, I just need a better idea of the path ahead of me. \n\nThanks \n\n\n",

        "content": "I'm a manual QA who is interested in learning to code with the purposes of moving out of QA and into a jr role (eventually. I know it's a long game.) My unit is going to be downsizing over the next year or two as our automation platforms increase in scope weening out the need for largescale manual testers. \n\nThis will be the second time I'm going to get downsized out in replacement for devs. I want to avoid going through this cycle a third time, so I'm making it a priority to start learning development so perhaps I can move into something a little more stable longterm. (Let's pretend AI isn't a thing at the moment.) \n\nHere's the issue: I don't really own any personal computers. I've always had work issued machines, and I can't use it for personal projects. What I do have is an old thinkpad (I'm talking really old.) I've since swapped the old harddrive out and replaced it with an SSD and doubled the ram so it's at least functional... I then installed Ubuntu on it. \n\nWith legacy hardware such as this (it's a thinkpad x220 from 2011....that keyboard tho!) what are my actual options? I know I won't be building native iOS apps on this brick.... but what are some domains I could actually consider working towards some subject matter learning? Coming from a windows only work environment, I'm actually very excited to work in a *unix environment proper. \n\nHere are things I'm interested in:\n\n* Ruby / Rails (ruby is so funky)\n* Webdev in general (html/css/js + framework of choice)\n* C development / OS dev / Kernel Dev (out of my league difficulty wise but probably the most doable on legacy linux machine)\n* infosec / security (I can mangle this laptop, nobody will care.)\n* stretch option: windows app dev with c# and visual studio\n\nI'm very curious about programs like The Odin project for one of the first two points. Looking through it, its interesting that it forces you to use git and pull down and push up your work into a github repo which is FANTASTIC to replicate a real life workflow. I really don't like writing in the browser based editor for freecodecamp (though, it might migrate me to an editor later in the program I dunno)\n\nGiven that linux is a brand new thing to me, I'm finding it to be an amazing environment to move around in. It's just so fascinating. It would be a good place to learn C because I'm not afraid of blowing up the machine by messing with a kernel file or something. (I have ubuntu on a bootable USB and can full wipe/install in about 20 minutes)\n\nAS someone who only has cursory domain knowledge of these areas of interest, there are likely things I'm not fully aware of, or considering when making a decision. \n\nIf you or your best friend asked you \"I have this old POS laptop with linux on it and I want to turn it into a second career eventually. What should I do?\" How would you answer? \n\nThanks so much!",

So far, all my suggested (theory) code have all been great and very efficient, but I am so slow at translating them into good code that it almost doesn’t matter.\n\nSafe to say I feel way more confident in discrete math, algorithms, and even pseudocode than here because it just feels like a new language I need to learn (which it is lol).\n\nSo I was wondering if Codecademy could help me sharpen those missing syntax skills or if it’s just a waste of money.

        "content": "In 2022 I graduated with a Biotechnology and Biochemistry degree from Thomas Jefferson. I wanted to go into research originally, but soon after graduation realized I hated it. I also was diagnosed with many different chronic illnesses, and these make it difficult to stand for long periods of times. Since 2022, I have been working in a medical pathology lab working in many of the different departments. I currently am a night supervisor there, and I act as a pathology assistant for the pathologist/doctors.\n\nI don’t necessarily want to stay in the medial field, hence why I have been looking into new career fields. I recently came across computer programming and seemed to really like it. I also get bored very easily with mundane tasks, and I like the idea that computer programming is constantly fixing bugs, making new codes, and problem solving, even if it’s semi-similar.\n\nI am asking for advice since I am not sure where to start. After some research I have noticed that many people have not gone to school for computer science, yet still work as a software engineer.\n\nI have already stated Coursea and their computer programming workshop that gives me certification at the end. I know this is not much and will not just get me job. I know I will need to work hard to learn at least Java Script and Python very well and build a portfolio.\n\nI sadly can’t really go back to school with my current situation, plus it’s not something I can afford. Therefore, I really am trying to find online resources or programs. I am willing to join a fully online program since I can deal with that along with my work schedule, as long as it’s under 5k.\n\nMy main question is pretty broad, I am looking for any advice, resources, realism/realistic thoughts, and possible areas of computer programming/software engineering that I should focus on. Thank you to anyone that read all of this and please wish me luck! 🤞☺️",

        "content": "Hi there! I'll try to be as brief as possible.\n\nI started working as a software developer at a small start-up in February 2025 and ended up leading a small project that's more or less a small fleet manager. There are many things that apps like fleetio have that the client does not require so please keep that in mind. Our team is of two people and a PM.\n\nI'm the one that leads the meetings and decides on architecture basically. While I know it sounds completely insane that someone with such little experience is doing this, it has been working well so far and the client is really happy.\n\nWith that in mind I started reading DDIA because as I have no senior to learn from, it's quite difficult to know how to scale things, how, when to scale, etc. it might not even be necessary that we scale out, but it is a topic I'm super interested in so the book is super helpful.\n\nMy question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?\n\nI had a quick idea to spin up an app like Pastebin to generate unique links of text, just for fun!\n\nMy idea is :\n\nRedis for generation of unique links with snowflake IDs and TTL to reduce bloat and guessable IDs.\n\nKafka for event streaming and eventual consistency among replicas (in different AZs/regions)\n\nI am thinking of simulating this by having a primary db and a few read only replicas around the world from AWS. I'm also thinking of adding a load balancer just to learn that too.\n\nIs this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.\n\nIf this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?\n\nMy apologies if I sound ignorant about these concepts, I just don't talk to many senior folk, and the ones I know don't have distributed systems experience.\n\nLastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.\n\nThank you for any input you may have and I hope you started the year great!",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’m running into a time-based data processing problem and would love some design advice.\nI have two modules: one imports raw punch events from biometric machines (just employee ID + timestamp), and the other lets me define shifts. Using these, I try to figure out which shift an employee worked, whether they were late, overtime, etc. Day shifts work perfectly fine, but night shifts and overlapping shifts are causing issues.\nShifts are very flexible: some start early, others late, many cross midnight, and some overlap. Because of this, grouping punches by calendar day doesn’t work. Processing is done by a scheduled job that must run at a specific time. The problem is that at that moment, some shifts are still in progress while others are starting, which leads to incomplete or incorrect grouping—for example, a punch during a night shift might be interpreted as a full shift or a very short one.\nI’m looking for a general approach to assign raw timestamped events to shifts when shifts can overlap or be incomplete at processing time. Any patterns, strategies, or best practices would be super helpful.",

I don’t have a strong background in search / constraint solving / routing algorithms, so explanations at a conceptual or introductory level are very welcome.\n\nThis link should show the geometry of the problem and some attempts I made with explanations of why I rejected them, but hopefully the problem makes sense without it. \n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gzLPFA9ZrpQOugkBr52p6JK2eQdSiilcl0bp4G\\_O7tM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gzLPFA9ZrpQOugkBr52p6JK2eQdSiilcl0bp4G_O7tM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\n# Problem overview\n\nI have **69 battery cells** arranged in a mostly regular 2D layout:\n\n* A **6 × 11 grid**, plus **3 extra cells at the front**, centered\n* Total = 69 cells\n\nI need to design a **purely 2D metal interconnect** (laser-cut nickel) that connects these cells electrically under very strict constraints.\n\n\n\n# Electrical constraints\n\n* Cells must be grouped into **23 groups of 3 cells in parallel** (3P “bricks”)\n* Those 23 bricks must then be connected **in series** (23S)\n* The result is **23s3p**\n* The series connection must be a **single continuous path** (no branches)\n* Both electrical endpoints (“in” and “out”) must be located at the **front** of the layout\n\n\n\n# Physical constraints\n\n* There are **only two conductor layers**: one on the top of the cells and one on the bottom\n* No jumpers, flyovers, or insulated crossovers are allowed\n* Each cell has **one terminal on the top and the opposite terminal on the bottom** (polarity matters, + must connect to -)\n* Connections must be short and local — no long traces across the pack\n\n\n\n# Fuse constraints (the hardest part)\n\nEvery cell must have its **own fuse link**, and these impose very strict geometric rules:\n\n* Fuse links must be **very short** adjacent or diagonal at most (this somewhat emerges from other requirements about fuses not crossing, not going over or near cells, etc)\n* Fuse links **must not overlap or cross** any other fuse or conductor on the same layer, fuses on the top layer can be routed independently of bottom layer (they end up coupled because the cells connect them)\n* Fuse links should not share narrow corridors where a blown fuse could melt into another conductor\n* Larger bus connections are allowed to merge into pads or nodes, but **fuses are always individual**\n\n\n\n\n\n# Why I’m stuck\n\nAt a high level, this seems to combine:\n\n* grouping items into exact sets (each cell used exactly once)\n* choosing an order for those sets (a single series path)\n* and routing many short, non-overlapping connections in a tight 2D space\n\nI've tried a bunch of solutions and to manually generate a solution and keep ending up stuck on something.  I don't **KNOW** that there exists a solution with the constraints I've set forth but i think there probably should be.  If anyone can show that there cannot exist a solution for some reason and suggest alternate constraints that most closely match what I have while having a solution that would be appreciated too.\n\n\n\n# What I’m asking for\n\n* Is this a known class of problem (or combination of problems)?  I've looked at a number of approaches but none of them seem to fully encapsulate the problem.\n* Are there standard algorithmic approaches or heuristics for problems like this?\n* Is this usually approached with backtracking, graph search, maze-routing ideas, constraint programming, or something else?\n* Are there examples of similar problems (even outside batteries) that might be good references?\n\nI’m not (necessarily) looking for a turnkey solution (though if i was provided with a simple answer I would not be upset) I’m trying to understand **how people normally reason about and structure problems like this** so I can move in a productive direction.\n\n\n\nThis kind of combinatorial / routing problem is *not* what I usually work on, so I may not know the right terminology or standard methods. If you have suggestions, explanations, or even “you should look up X” pointers, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nThanks for reading, and I’m happy to clarify details if needed.",

Roughly 1,500 were affected, ~~mostly in the Bay Area and London~~ (striking this out because it’s anecdoal)\n\nThis landed at the same time as a pretty major change to the perf system. They’re moving away from the annual, soul-crushing calibration where \\~20% of people landed in one of two negative buckets. Going forward, only 10% are considered not-ok. CME and EE were effectively merged, and the multiplier on that bucket was increased.\n\nPeople are actually pretty happy about this.

It turns out my instincts were right, I mostly got lucky. I didn’t really earn this.\n\nI was hired into a branch that I have no experience in (embedded software) after assuring the hiring manager / senior developer that I would work hard to catch up with the expectations. I genuinely meant that. However, it has been much harder than I anticipated.\n\nYesterday, I had a call with my team lead and another developer, the one who hired me and is essentially involved in everything (his cracked). They told me that my performance has been slow, especially during the last sprint, and that I’m very close to getting fired. They’re not the ones who make that decision, but they were passing the message along.\n\nThe cracked one basically told me (unofficially): If I want to keep my job, I need to work on my free-time. According to him, there’s no way to both catch up and deliver expected work within the official eight-hour workday. I don’t think he’s being unreasonable or malicious, he is just a developer after all, he just wants to protect me. I’m willing to put in extra time, but the problem is that I’m also a university student. Realistically, I can only manage an extra two to three hours a day.\n\nThis sprint fucked me up. It’s Saturday today, and I have homework due next week that I won’t be able to complete properly because I’m spending the weekend trying to avoid getting fired.\n\nI feel like I was hired at the worst possible time. The team was already behind schedule, management is panicking, and I’m expected to deliver at an unrealistically fast pace. I don’t like blaming others, maybe I’m just not learning fast enough, but this still feels off. From the start, it felt too good to be true, fully remote, good pay e.t.c. I have a feeling that it won't end well.",

For those of us who don't have plenty of YOE, you will get drowned out by other candidates who do. That's the reality. There are simply too many people applying to public job postings for the odds to be in your favor. It's possible to make it this way, but highly unlikely.\n\n**If you are a new grad, junior, or intermediate, networking is the key.** You must lean on your network. Tell your family, friends, and the people you bump into what you're looking for. Take that step, make the cringe LinkedIn post to announce your job hunt is underway, mention what you're good at, and ask your peers to chime in and leave a nice comment.

        "content": "The number of jobs in the past few years has definitely gone down and it is far more difficult to get an interview call today.\n\nBut on the other hand, I have been rejected without an interview call from jobs that I would be a perfect fit. I have exactly the skills they want. And at times, it feels like it's these recruiters who are making the decisions on who is a good fit for the job or not. They call you, discuss with you and write some notes for the hiring manager. And the hiring manager sometimes blindly trusts the notes that the recruiter is giving them.\n\nFor example:  \n1. I told a recruiter I have 6 years of experience in Java. Then her immediate question was \"How many years of experience do you have in ExpressJS\". I said I am not that experienced in Javascript/typescript. To which she responded with \"But you said you have 6 years of experience in Java\". This was one of those job postings that are really vague and don't specify which programming language experience they want. \"Need to have at least 5 years of experience in a modern programming language like Java, Golang, Rust or Javascript/Python\". I applied for the job and had the first screening call with the recruiter.\n\n2. Another time I had a call with a recruiter who asked me what I was doing. I told them that I am working in ARM there is an open source library called DPDK, people use it to be networking stacks in userspace. I am working on bench-marking some of the functionality of that library on ARM processors. We are trying to change some of the functionality of that library to use Arm Neon SIMD instructions.\n\nShe let me blabber on for like 15 mins and then she said \"Alright I need you to repeat everything you told me so far. I need to write notes for the hiring manager\". I sighed and then started repeating everything. And then the second time around she is like \"What is a library?\". \"What is ARM?\". \"Does ARM make processors?\". \"What does it mean that you are optimizing code in a library? Are you a Frontend engineer or a backend engineer?\".\n\nAt that point, I was like let me write those notes for you. And she was like I need to write these notes myself. And then out of politeness I said \"Look I am not a native English speaker. Let me type out some text for you. You can copy that into your notes. I am not that good at verbal communication.\" This was around the point in the call where she asked me to explain to her what SIMD instructions are. She declined that offer.\n\nAnd after the call, I got rejected. This was specifically for a job that required people with experience in ARM Neon.\n\nSometimes I wish I could directly talk to the hiring manager or a software engineer in the team. Sometimes it really feels like these recruiters don't understand what the hell I am working on. And they are the people who are rejecting me :|",

Do projects like this move the needle at all? I'm mainly doing them keep up with my skillset. Also, does doing an OMSCS help early-career people, or does it not really help? If you were in my position, what would you focus on and what would you stop wasting time on?\n\nHere's my resume if anyones wants to take a look,\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2gnaiaecnwy5r6fnpu159/Copy-of-Resume_2026.pdf?rlkey=ehvvv3wlqof0ufotzmlhurkfv&st=bc8z8kt2&dl=0\n\nI can link my portfolio to folks if that's useful either",

They said at this stage they needed less development and a sales guy in my spot.\n\nI ask if it was performance related but they said no and only offered a little criticism that the only critique i had was I couldve understood certain parts of the app more but I literally built a big chunk of it so idk. The ceo even undercut that criticism by saying i certaintly could do my job better and look even if it was perfect I dont think it would effect this decision. Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back. he said he thought the world of me and said i should know hes not the type to mince words but he said he would give a recommendation to whoever. My manager was all quiet in the corner and kinda just said he echoed what the ceo said and just said at this stage of the development we expected to be in a certain spot and it didnt happen.(I almost took that as a personal critique but idk its just raw right now). Apparently they made the decision during christmas but didnt want to tell me until now. I told them I would just walk out quietly at the end of the day(we only had 10 minutes left.) they both seemed genuinely sad but idk I expected my manager to say more knowing he knew but he was just tucked away quiet. Anyway im ranting but I guess thats just the nature of these types of jobs I guess. I kinda saw it coming when we were burning money and they couldnt get people fully on board with the beta. I just feel kinda used.\n\nJust kinda wanted some advice on what jobs are more stable. Ive literally done product oriented jobs with a established product. Consulting and now a start up.

So its January and I just got off a call with my company where I was told they like me in this role and are giving me the title and a pay raise to go with it. However, the pay raise was only 7k a year, my total pay is now 85k a year for a technical lead position. I have people below me in this position that make more than I do. Not only is the pay way less than I expected, but my company had a job posting for a Technical Lead where the listed salary was 120k, which is still low but 35k more than I was offered. I feel incredibly insulted by the offer they gave me.\n\nI have a few thoughts on what I should do:\n\n1. I am thinking about messaging them back and asking for either 130k a year or my old role back. The extra work from the role is worth way more than 7k extra a year, so if I can't get more pay I would rather just be in an individual contributor role and not leadership.\n2. Or take the offer and try and job hop as soon as I can. While the pay sucks the title is good and could help me land a new role somewhere ill actually get paid well.\n\nWith that said I am not really in a position to lose this job unless I have something else lined up and while I have been looking for a new role already, I haven't had much luck at all with the market being so bad. I would hope the new title would help, but I am unsure with that. So what do you think I should do? Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add that I never really wanted this role either, the only reason I accepted it to begin with is because I thought it would have nice pay and my family and I could purchase a home. Now it just feels like a role I don't like and the pay sucks, this is why I might ask for my old role back.\n\nEDIT 2: I have 6 YOE as a developer almost half of which is with this company. My title before this promotion was junior developer so the jump is pretty significant and why I was expecting my pay to have a significant jump as well.\n\nEDIT 3: This is my final update, I spoke with my company and got an extra 10k added to my salary. Its still not where I would like to be but it is better at least. I will probably stick it out another year to have a full year with the title then I will bounce to somewhere that will pay me more.

Just give me space to breathe and solve problems and think in ways that suite me. Seriously hate this industry now. End rant. ",

Based in NYC. I've been interviewing for junior and mid-level Data Analyst, Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer, and Backend SWE roles. I pretty much gave up on landing a DS role for now but I have been pretty open to any data adjacent role. Most of my interviews have been for analyst and analytics engineer roles though.\n\nLately, interviews themselves haven't been the issue. I'm consistently making it to final rounds, and the feedback has actually been positive. Stuff like great culture fit, strong skillset, asks the right questions, etc. No glaring red flags. But… I keep getting rejected at the very end. Usually it's the classic: \"The other candidate had more experience with X tool\" or \"We went with someone with a PhD.\" Sometimes, it'll be \"The role was closed due to budget.\" \n\nI'm honestly getting a bit jaded. I don't think I've ever had this hard of a time and it feels like there are way more interview rounds now than when I first started my career.\n\nWhat's stressing me out more is my personal situation. My girlfriend and I live together, and she's worried we might have to move out of our apartment because retail income just isn't covering the bills. Been stretching my savings from my last job and now the pressure is starting to hit hard.\n\nI'm not really sure what else to do to finally get an offer. Do I just keep grinding and hope timing lines up? Am I aiming at the wrong roles? Is this just how bad the market is right now?\n\nAny advice (or even just commiseration) would be appreciated. ",

Back then, creating things made me feel alive. During COVID, I started learning programming, and it felt like everything finally connected. I truly believed this was my future.\n\nI joined engineering college with huge dreams. I thought I would figure things out, land a good job, earn well, and finally change my life. I worked hard and got my first internship through a senior—it was unpaid, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to learn.\n\nLater, I got another internship that paid ₹15k per month. After three months, they offered me a junior developer role at ₹40k per month.\n\nI rejected it.\n\nI believed I was meant to build something of my own. I didn’t want to settle too early. I joined someone who was building a product, fixed bugs, improved features, and gave everything I had. I worked for six months and was paid $1,000 in total. I told myself this was a sacrifice, not a mistake.\n\nBut after that, everything slowly collapsed.\n\nEvery SaaS idea I tried failed. I couldn’t focus. I was distracted, overwhelmed, and stuck in constant noise instead of real progress. Days passed. Then months. Now years feel gone.\n\nToday, I’m completely stuck. I apply for jobs every day—no replies, no rejections, just silence. I feel like I’ve gone backward while everyone else moved forward with their lives.\n\nThe worst part is my own mind. It keeps calling me a loser. I regret rejecting that job. At the time, I thought I was being brave. Now it feels like I was just naive.\n\nI’ve had big dreams since I was 12. I always believed my life would change one day. Right now, it feels dark, directionless, and heavy. I have about 10 months left, and it honestly feels like my last chance to turn things around.\n\nI don’t know what I’m capable of anymore. I just know I don’t want this to be the end of my story.",

I would have to travel for this role though but it would be in a very exciting industry that would make most envious I imagine. At the same time, the idea of taking the severance and braving the market is tempting, even knowing how tough hiring is right now. What would you do in my situation? Reddit tells me to hold on no matter what, but will it really take me longer than 6 months to find a job? I have significant savings so I could last much longer than my severance if need to, but I would prefer to stay employed and not draw down my savings. \n\nIf you are wondering I would say my leetcode skills are weak to moderate.

I had amazing people in my team my seniors have taught me stuff about architecture, decisions, patterns, technologies, every day I was asking less questions and everyone said I was doing fucking amazing and rocking everything, they even let me be on business meetings to discuss business logical decisions and they let me run the project alone for a week. They’re extremely happy with me.\n\nThen after one year I started to introspect and look into the present and future and came to some conclusions…\n\nMy job is fucking easy. I get figma designs, use storybook to pop components and use props to build UIs, then organize stores, hooks, forms, validations, tealium for analytics, A11Y, simple state management and maybe a few edge cases… but it’s a traditional bank not rocket science, SPAs are as simple as they get. And things in banks go veeeeeeeery slowly, therefore sometimes I’ll go a week or so with a blocked API  that blocks my team.\n\nTherefore I am starting to get this feeling…\n\nI am easily replacable by AI…\n\nSo here I am, stuck in a job that isn’t making me an AI-proof Frontend engineer.\n\nCant go to another Frontend job in this market cuz no one will hire.\n\nMy idea was to stay for 3 years here to be able to meet the 3 year + most offers post but tbh I’ll leave with tons of soft skills and lacking technical skills.\n\nFrontend is already very replacable with AI, therefore I was thinking about learning backend to make a switch (more AI safe). But who’s going to hire a backend with 3 YOE as a Frontend, it’s a joke.\n\nSorry for the rant, I’m just worried I’m not upskilling enough in my job to make me a Frontend which is beyond AI capabilities. I love the idea of backend but I just can make simple CRUD a little auth and no one will hire me without experience (I’d need to take a pay decrease to start again)\n\nAnyone got any advice on how to proceed?

I mostly have been applying to full time jobs since I have the degree, but I decided to apply to few internships. There was one for a QA internship at a company a few miles from me and they wanted to schedule a phone screening. I had actually had a phone screening with this company before with the same recruiter back when I was looking for internships as a senior, but she ghosted me. However, I have more experience now and was hoping that I would be a better fit. She sent me her Calander a week ago, so I picked a time earlier today and I waited, but nothing. I sent her an email after 15 minutes of waiting, but no one responded. I decided to go back to the calendar link and schedule another one, but then I got a rejection email 15 minutes later. This is not ok. ",

I usually answer it in an honest way and say that I am looking for more challenging engineering opportunities, faster pace environment etc.\n\nThe recruiter will say that they will review my resume with the hiring manager and if they want to move forward they will set up an OA or move to a technical round.\n\nHowever, I haven't been able to move forward to the next round 3 times in a row now and I don't think it is an issue with my resume if I am getting noticed by the HR. Could it be that I answered the \"Why are you looking for a new role\" part incorrectly and I need to lie instead of being honest?

        "content": "This was for Delivery Consultant. My understanding, is that it's like a consulting arm of AWS where consultant go to clients and act as temporary employees more or less.\n\nHave 5YOE, been out of work for a year. Just got the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification and then applied to the role. 2 months ago, contacted by recruiter after applcation and passed OA. My recruiter asked me to prep 10 STAR stories as well as LeetCode and to wait 3 weeks before scheduling the phone screen which I thought was overkill, but could appreciate that she wanted me to be as prepped as possible. Phone screen was with a chill friendly guy I believe one of the hiring managers for this department. We did 1 STAR with some follow ups, as well as a AWS system design problem which went over smoothly, and then a basic coding challenge which was easy to complete. He hinted that I would be moving forward, which I did 2 days later. Scheduled the final loop for a month right after the holidays.\n\n1st interview guy seemed chill and only asked LPs. Ended 15 min early.\n\n2nd interview, was with a woman who at end informed me she was not part of this department (so the bar raiser), had a friendly introduction. Again, only LPs where she did some follow up, but no hardcore grilling. Ended about 20 minutes early.\n\n3rd interview, was the hiring manager who also did only LPs with me. Again follow ups which I answered, but was prepared for. Halfway through the interview, she all of a sudden asks, you have experience working in small teams, but tell me about roles with big teams and organizations. I was a little off guard and asked if we were still doing the STAR format. She said if I wanted to. I gave a brief story about 3 years of my experience working at a large telecomm comapny (which I already answered with STAR stories from), and mentioned about the dozens of teams I interacted with, and how I worked in a major lift and shift project with microservices with over 50 services and 200 people. She went on and said how as an L5 they were looking for someone with experience leading large organizations, etc. even though at the beginning she said the role varies a lot (startups, large companies, short term and long term contracts)  \nShe then asked me the final LP. I asked if she wanted as story from the telecomm company. She glared at the screen and sharply answered \"sure\". I wasn't sure if this was hostility, or her following interview protocol, but I just mentioned I didnt have any stories left that I havent told her or answer that question, so I talked about one from my 1st job at a 6 person startup. At the end, she did a q and a, and then just said my recruiter would be the point of contact from now on. Again, didnt really read into it, but everyone else just mentioned \"oh, you got 3 interviews left, good luck\" or somethign like that. Ended 20 min early.\n\n4th interview next day, was friendly guy who did 1 LP, followed by some Leetcode. The coding was quite easy (easy/medium) and didn't really have much issues other than some syntax (like making sure 'self' was used when setting up the function). He was friendly and enthusiastic about me getting the optimal solutions. Ended on time.\n\n5th interview the following day was chill guy who did a few LP in the first half. The second half was a barrage of questions in sytem design. I got maybe 75% of them, especially the ones I remember from my SA Pro cert. The ones I didn't, he assured me it was ok, nobody gets them all. But who knows, maybe I missed some that I shouldn't have. We only had a minute left at the end for q and a, but he was willing to stay a bit overtime to answer questions for me.\n\nNext day, get the automated reject email. If I were to guess, it might have somethign to do with the 3rd interview with the hiring manager. From what I've read, most people feel they do well on their LPs, but who knows, maybe I didn't. I prepped the 10 STAR stories, and didn't reuse them for the same interviewer, but maybe I needed more across all of them? Researching, I've heard varying opinions. Finally, I dunno if I was just outclassed by another candidate or an internal candidate I don't know about.  \nJust a bit down since I spent 2 months prepping LeetCode and refining and rehearsing my STAR stories.",

        "content": "I would like to preface this by acknowledging that I'm in a fairly privileged position and I don't want this to sound like I'm not grateful for it. I've been working as a full stack engineer uninterrupted since early 2019. I started at a major US bank, went to a streaming service and now I'm working in ecommerce for a mid-major regional retailer; I don't think I'm anywhere near being a 10X whiz kid dev but I've never had anything less than Above Average ratings on performance reviews and I would say I'm generally perceived as competent at the least. \n\nMy problem comes in that none of these jobs, tasks or projects have given me anything close to resembling satisfaction. I think I've come to realize that while I like solving problems, building tools for people to use and seeing all the cool things we can do, I don't like basically everything else that makes up our jobs as engineers. I don't find joy in upgrading Node versions or repositioning a button to increase customer retention; optimizing our add to cart functions feels like a waste of time to me when it already works and we see no impact on metrics in the slightest. I have trouble bringing myself to care about code coverage in tests for features that no one actually wants and likely only a handful of folks will ever use. I exercise, I eat enough, I drink water and pay my bills on time but I can't imagine myself doing this for the next thirty years of my life. So what's the \"escape plan\"? \n\nI've considered going back to school for an MBA but having spoken to many consultants who have taken that path I don't think it's for me. For a while I also looked at going back for a Masters in CS but that felt like a great way to further pigeon hole myself into only being seen as Guy Who Codes. It also seems silly to just move laterally and become a pure 'product/manager' person who comes up with or supervises the new features that bum me out so much to build. Speaking to folks older than me, the common advice is go speak with a career counselor but the two experiences I've had with them reminded me far too much of those quizzes you had to take in middle school that suggested career paths. \n\nThis forum has helped me out a lot in the past by giving good feedback, tough love, and even just hearing that others are in the same boat so I come to y'all hat in hand wondering - am I crazy for feeling like this? How does one take these skills into some other direction? Is the best advice here to just suck it up and double down on my hobbies, finding joy outside of work? Has anyone here successfully pivoted out of being told to 'stay in your lane code monkey'?",

This includes Big Tech (tech companies such as Google, Datadog, OpenAI, FAANG etc.) but also includes big non-tech companies (think Walmart, Target, Ford, Epic to a certain extent). However, be prepared to never get responses from these. The conversion rate of responses from these is a lot lower than other companies. This is due to both the amount of people applying, you applying later than other people (they may just only look at the first X number of applications), but also the amount of company leadership, direction, and planning changes that are typical with these big companies (these are expected). You may not get a response and that may mean nothing with your resume or applications. Which leads us to...\n* Apply to startups and / or small businesses. There are a lot of startups out there that may benefit from your specific experience or skills. Where do you find these though? ycombinator, workatastartup, builtinnyc, wellfound are good places to start. More than applying, here is where you might need to \"network\". Look at the founders, look at the people working there. Referrals here are a lot more helpful than in Big Tech companies, because things at smaller companies are a lot more personal and less automated. This is how I found my early-stage startup job. So you might want to look at founders / early employees; see if you have any connections on LinkedIn or went to the same school. See if you have any secondary connections. Reach out to people. Even if not, you can cold message on LinkedIn. You may not get a lot of responses. That's ok / expected. \n* Startups are less cyclical in their hiring, meaning they may hire at random times / year round / for the right person / after fundraises.\n\n  \nMy experiences:\n\n* Have gone through extensive job searches 3X. This helped a ton. Each cycle required 300-700 apps each. Got a random job in 1, an early stage startup the 2nd time, Big Tech the 3rd time.\n* Anecdotal evidence:  Applying with or without a cover letter does not seem to matter in my case, at least it didn't in my experience. The places I got interviews I didn't use a cover letter.\n* For startups, things are a lot more informal... even cold reached out to someone on LinkedIn (alum from my school) once to ask about their experience at their startup, and it turned into an interview lol (for which I got to the final round). They didn't even have a position open, but were willing to hire for the right engineer.\n* Have gotten Amazon, Datadog offers (and currently work at Datadog)",

I recently came across an opening at a local company looking for a Junior to Mid-Level SRE. Reading the description, it seems like there is not a lot of coding in this role, mainly some automation stuff, scripting and CI pipeline work, plus some \"technician\" type work e.g. hardware troubleshooting. It seems like a cool company, pretty small too. However, I am aiming for SWE type roles where I can build features and things like that.\n\nI know I cannot be picky in this market, especially since I was not given a return offer from my last company (I believe they only hire senior level people, from what I could observe.) However I would be more inclined to start off in SWE and potentially branch off into SRE, as I am worried that staying as a SRE for too long would close doors to SWE especially if I start my career as a SRE without much real SWE experience.\n\nI am able to apply through their site or via email. I was considering sending an email, stating that I'd be open to a hybrid of SRE and SWE work if its available. Is this a good idea? Any suggestions?\n\nThanks",

The job is advertised as just mostly prompting, and then cleaning up the output, and I’m not sure if this is common practice nowadays. I know this isn’t a new approach for a company to adopt, but if I get the role it will be my first FT SWE position barring an internship I had a couple years prior. Given this, I want to ensure this is a role I can grow in and actually learn. Another thing they emphasize is how they want to go all-in on AI. I’m no doomer, but I do think a bubble will pop at some point, and I don’t want to be left on the short end of the stick here. \n\nDo any of you have jobs like this? What is it like?

        "author": "ewheck",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm reading John Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design* and Chapter 3's discussion of the \"tactical tornado\" led me to think about how we use LLMs and agents in our profession. The relevant section of the book goes as follows:\n\n>Most programmers approach software development with a mindset I call tactical programming. In the tactical approach, your main focus is to get something working, such as a new feature or a bug fix. At first glance this seems totally reasonable: what could be more important than writing code that works? However, tactical programming makes it nearly impossible to produce a good system design.\n\n>The problem with tactical programming is that it is short-sighted. If you’re programming tactically, you’re trying to finish a task as quickly as possible. \\[...\\]\n\n>Almost every software development organization has at least one developer who takes tactical programming to the extreme: a *tactical tornado*. The tactical tornado is a prolific programmer who pumps out code far faster than others but works in a totally tactical fashion. When it comes to implementing a quick feature, nobody gets it done faster than the tactical tornado. In some organizations, management treats tactical tornadoes as heroes. However, tactical tornadoes leave behind a wake of destruction. They are rarely considered heroes by the engineers who must work with their code in the future. Typically, other engineers must clean up the messes left behind by the tactical tornado, which makes it appear that those engineers (who are the real heroes) are making slower progress than the tactical tornado.\n\nI do not work at a company that has widely adopted the usage of agents (a handful of people in my department have access to Devin), but I have noticed most pro-agent discourse revolves around how you can improve the speed of development and ship faster. From the passage I quoted, it seems like speed of development is not considered a universal good by all and focusing on it can have drawbacks.\n\nSince I do not have the experience to comment on this, my question for those who have heavily adopted the usage of agents themselves (or work on teams where many others have) is have you seen any of these negative outcomes whatsoever? Have you experienced any increase in system complexity that may have been easier to avoid had you iterated more slowly?\n\nOusterhout's alternative to tactical programming is strategic programming:\n\n>The first step towards becoming a good software designer is to realize that **working code isn’t enough**. It’s not acceptable to introduce unnecessary complexities in order to finish your current task faster. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system. Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a developer is to facilitate those future extensions. Thus, you should not think of “working code” as your primary goal, though of course your code must work. Your primary goal must be to produce a great design, which also happens to work. This is *strategic programming*.\n\nWhen I see the power users discuss how they operate with several different instances of Claude working concurrently, I can't help but think that it would be nearly impossible to work with a \"strategic\" mindset at that level. So again, a question for those who have adopted this practice, do you attempt to stay strategic when basically automating the code-writing? As an example of what I'm asking, if you feed an agent a user story to implement, do you also try to ensure the generated code will easily facilitate future extensions to what you are working on apart from the user story itself? If so, what does that process look like for you?",

        "content": "So in this past December i’ve completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from a T20 (I think) with a 3.0 GPA (not on my resume)\n\nI didn’t have any Swe internships. All I have is around 2 years of IT experience (service desk at school) and some web development experience I got from developing for a friends business. (Which I have included on my resume as work experience) \n\nI have some projects, but obviously am working on building better ones that align with jobs I apply for. \n\nI will have acquired Sec+ by the end of this month. (Will explain why I’m getting this cert) \n\n So I’m just wondering if I am too cooked for this field and should pivot to IT, or keep trying?\n\nMy current fallback hopes are that with my 2 years of entry IT experience and Sec+ that I can at least land some sort of IT role and pivot to something better after that if I can find something that can sponsor me for a clearance. \n\nI want to know if it is a realistic goal for me to land something in software in the defense industry because I live in the DC area and I assume that these jobs will have a lower barrier to entry. With Sec+ and my experience, is this still an attainable goal? Or is the industry just too cooked for hoping that this is even an option anymore?\n\nI’ve also started studying for Aws certified cloud practitioner as recommended by my employed friends. Is this worth my time? It does seem like a very easy cert. \n\nI do have a decent network (many friends, mutuals and relatives in tech in my area), really thankful for that. I hope to utilize it as much as possible for referrals. I have done tons of resume review and I believe my resume is solid. \n\nI am also interested in getting into Tech consulting as that is a big field in this area. Can anyone give me tips for that? \n\nSide note - I am a US citizen, born and raised, and should have no problems with getting a security clearance. \n\nMy questions:\n Are my goals still realistic?\nShould I change anything?\nAm I cooked?\nAnything else I should know? \n\nMy plan now is to: \n1. Apply aggressively for any entry level IT positions to secure some type of a fallback by June-ish and hopefully have some way of getting sponsored for a security clearance. \n\n2. Also apply to defense software roles for the chance to go straight into my dream field. \n\n3. Keep my skills sharp with Leetcode and projects \n\n\nTLDR: Am I cooked for software jobs? New grad. No internships in swe, 2 years entry level IT experience, Sec+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "author": "QuantumQuack0",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, finally the vacancy I thought I had been waiting years for, has appeared. It's in a certain deep-tech field, on the crossroads of physics, embedded, and networks engineering. The vacancy itself is for embedded software.\n\nProblem is... while I have actual experience with the physics (down to the literal same kind of physical system), I _want_ to work on the control/embedded side of things. But I have no C++ experience, and they explicitly ask for that.\n\nProfessionally, I've only worked in python. I've dabbled a bit in Rust, a tiny bit in C++, and embedded C. I've played around with microcontrollers for a bit, but there aren't really any projects I'd like to do here at home so I didn't stick with it. I'm just afraid that, if they somehow pick me, I will make critical mistakes very early on in the product development (as the <10th employee).\n\nThe other thing is that, for me, it's _yet another_ startup in this field. I've worked at two similar startups now, where I've started bright-eyed and bushy-tailed only to absolutely f%%%ing hate it after 2-3 years. My first job was a very similar, very young startup, where I worked more on the physics-side of things. Given that it was a young startup and I was full of ideas, I worked myself to death. And in the 3rd year, due to that and the fact that I started disagreeing with the direction, I quit.\n\nMy current job is at a more mature startup, on paper not a startup anymore now. Much better WLB, but the startup-like shenanigans are also getting to me here. Tons of technical debt, move-fast-and-break-things, poor communication because we've grown fast but not matured... everything is a mess and it's killing me.\n\nI don't know if I should apply. I actually know the founders/current employees (not super-close but I was a MSc student under one of them, and worked with 2 others during that time) and I'm honestly pretty good at interviewing, so I think I actually have a chance. But part of me just wants to get out of this startup life and the hype around this field. I feel like work has occupied my life far too much ever since my graduation.\n\nI just want to chat with you guys and ask, what would you do? What advice do you have?\n\nEdit: I realize the reason for this post may be a bit unclear. For context, I've actually really come to hate my current job and want to leave asap, but don't want to jump from the frying pan into the fire.",

I’ve considered starting from scratch and doing stuff like TryHackMe and Hack the Box. I know eventually I’d need some certs. I’m just curious if it would be worth doing to move into that career while I also desperately try to find any job. I think I’d be happy if I could make it a career. ",
