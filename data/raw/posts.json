        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work with datasets that are not huge (GBs to low TBs), but the pipeline still needs to be reliable. I used to overbuild: Kafka, Spark, 12 moving parts, and then spend my life debugging glue. Now I follow a boring checklist to decide what to use and what to skip.\n\nIf you’re building a pipeline and you’re not sure if you need all the distributed toys, here’s the decision framework I wish I had earlier.\n\n1. Start with the SLA, not the tech\n\nAsk:\n\n* How fresh does the data need to be (minutes, hours, daily)?\n\n* What’s the cost of being late/wrong?\n\n* Who is the consumer (dashboards, ML training, finance reporting)?\n\n\nIf it’s daily reporting, you probably don’t need streaming anything.\n\n2. Prefer one “source of truth” storage layer\n\nPick one place where curated data lives and is readable by everything:\n\n* warehouse/lakehouse/object storage, whatever you have Then make everything downstream read from that, not from each other.\n\n\n3. Batch first, streaming only when it pays rent\n\nStreaming has a permanent complexity tax:\n\n* ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills. If your business doesn’t care about real-time, don’t buy that tax.\n\n4. Idempotency is the difference between reliable and haunted\n\nEvery job should be safe to rerun.\n\n* partitioned outputs\n\n* overwrite-by-partition or merge strategy\n\n* deterministic keys If you can’t rerun without fear, you don’t have a pipeline, you have a ritual.\n\n5. Backfills are the real workload\n\nDesign the pipeline so backfilling a week/month is normal:\n\n* parameterized date ranges\n\n* clear versioning of transforms\n\n* separate “raw” vs “modeled” layers\n\n6. Observability: do the minimum that prevents silent failure\n\nAt least:\n\n* row counts or volume checks\n\n* freshness checks\n\n* schema drift alerts\n\n* job duration tracking You don’t need perfect observability, you need “it broke and I noticed.”\n\n7. Don’t treat orchestration as optional\nEven for small pipelines, a scheduler/orchestrator avoids “cron spaghetti.” Airflow/Dagster/Prefect/etc. is fine, but the point is:\n\n* retries\n\n* dependencies\n\n* visibility\n\n* parameterized runs\n\n8. Optimize last\n\nMost pipelines are slow because of bad joins, bad file layout, or moving too much data, not because you didn’t use Spark. Fix the basics first:\n\n* partitioning\n\n* columnar formats\n\n* pushing filters down\n\n* avoiding accidental cartesian joins\n\nMy rule of thumb\n\nIf you can meet your SLA with:\n\n* a scheduler\n\n* Python/SQL transforms\n\n* object storage/warehouse and a couple checks\nthen adding a distributed stack is usually just extra failure modes.\n\nCurious what other people use as their “don’t overbuild” guardrails. What’s your personal line where you say “ok, now we actually need streaming/Spark/Kafka”?",

        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\n  \nFeeling a bit demoralized today and wondering if anyone else has come to a similar realization and how they dealt with it. Approximately 6 months ago I left a Sr. DE job on a team of 5 to join a startup as their sole data engineer. \n\n  \nThe last job I was at for 4.5 years and helped them create reliable pipelines for \\~15 sources and build out a full QC process that all DEs followed, created code standards + CI/CD that linted our code and also handled most of the infrastructure for our pipelines. During this time I was promoted multiple times and always had positive feedback.\n\n  \nCut to my current job where I have been told that I am not providing enough detail in my updates and that I am not specific enough about what went wrong when fixing bugs or encountering technical challenges. And - the real crux of the issue - I failed to deliver on a project after 6 months and they have of course wanted to discuss why the project failed. For context the project was to create a real time analytics pipeline that would update client reporting tables. I spent a lot of time on the infrastructure to capture the changes and started running into major challenges when trying to reliably consume the data and backfill data.\n\nWe talked through all of the challenges that I encountered and they said that the main theme of the project they picked up on was that I wasn't really \"engineering\" in that they felt I was just picking an approach and then discovering the challenges later.\n\n  \nCircling back to why I feel like maybe I'm just a mid-level engineer, in every other role I've been in I've always had someone more senior than me that understood the role. I'm wondering if I'm not actually senior material and can't actually do this role solo. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my ramble and let me know if you've found yourself in a similar position.  ",

We are experimenting with a builder instead of rolling everything from scratch, partly to avoid becoming a full-time CRUD developer.\n\nUI Bakery is one of the tools we are trying at the moment because it can sit on-prem, talk to our DB and some OpenAPI-described services, and still give non-technical users a UI with roles/permissions. Too early to call it perfect, but it feels less scary than handing out SQL editors.\n\nCurious what the rest of you are doing:\n\n* Do you let business users touch warehouse data at all, or is everything ticket-driven?\n* If you built a portal / upload tool / internal UI, did you go custom code or something like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery / similar?\n* Any “we thought this would be fine, then someone updated 50k rows by mistake” stories you are willing to share?\n\nTrying to find a balance between safety, governance and not spending my whole week building yet another admin panel.",

I was comfortable working with python, docker, a few frameworks like Airflow, Spark, Dagster, DBT etc. and of course git and Java + a few tools that nobody uses in DE from the job that I was doing.\n\nDid about 100 applications, spending a fair bit of time tweaking applications to match every job that I applied to. Did not apply for stuff that I wasn't interested in. Got pretty much nothing.\n\nI did however also applied to a few software dev roles too. Ended up landing one and got incredibly lowballed but I was so tired of my previous job, I had to take it like an idiot.\n\nWell, started the new job and the work was pretty fun. But colour me surprised, the thing that pushed me out from the previous job wasn't the culture or the work just being boring, it was the cycle. I'm only 26 and honestly, I can't imagine working 9-5 until I turn 50 or 60. \n\nI'm drafting up some ideas, learning and researching what's required to create products on my own. Once I'm confident enough in an idea and the progress, I'll probably quit. Or get fired because I'm distracted. Staying for a few for months because of financial constraints.\n\nAnybody else have similar experiences? I find it so weird that I was so interested in DE just a year ago, still confident that I can perform well in it, but completely lost interest to put in the effort because in the end I know I'll just get paid peanuts for the actual amount of work I'll do (pay in my country is garbage). \n\nThe only thing that might change this would be life changing compensation, but obviously that requires much more prep that I don't know if I have the time for (or the ability for that matter). Even that wouldn't be a sustainable way out of this dumb rotten week cycle we humans invented for ourselves. Work like a mchine for 5 days and be tired for the rest of the day after work? Recover from that shit for 2 days and then get back to it again? Fuck. That.\n\nThanks for listening to my rant, please share your own thoughts, because obviously there's lots of people who enjoy what they do and have much more \"work endurance\" than me. Also curious to see if there's more people who feel the same way as me too.",

Engineers are arguing that they are already on AWS and Redshift natively integrates with VPC, IAM roles, etc. And with reserved instances, cost of ownership looks cheaper than showflake.\n\nAnalysts are not cool with it however. They complain about distribution keys and the trouble with parsing of json logs. They are struggling with Redshift's SUPER data type. They claim it’s \"weak for aggregations\" and requires awkward casting hacks. They want snowflake because it works no frills (especially VARIANT and dot notation) and they can query semi structured data.\n\nThe big argument is that savings on Redshift RIs will be eaten up by the salary cost of engineers having to constantly tune WLM queues and fix skew.\n\nWhat needs to be picked here? What will make both teams happy?",

One option would be to add the DuckDB extension to PostgreSQL; another would be to use DuckDB as an analytical engine interfacing with PostgreSQL, keeping PostgreSQL as the primary database while layering DuckDB on top for OLAP queries. However, I am unsure whether this solution is mature and stable enough for production use, and whether such an approach is truly recommended or widely adopted in practice.",

        "content": "I’ve written about my job on this sub before but I really am at a loss at times and come here to vent frequently. I am fine with hearing it’s a me problem, I really am. But I don’t know how to work faster when everything feels so chaotic upstream of me. I am not eating well, working 8+ hours and finding myself really sleepy (taking 2 naps a day these days) that are signs of burnout I’ve been experiencing especially over the last few months. \n\nI’ve been given feedback about not being as fast as the team anticipates on projects. Currently, I’ve been focusing on migrating old projects to a new architecture we plan to use by early next year. I really started being 100% dedicated to this work as of October/November of this year, which gives me 2-3 months to migrate my old projects to this new architecture. \n\nIn theory it sounds easy to my higher up: all I have to do is copy + paste and tweak my old code to new architecture and that’s it. Except it’s not that easy:\n\n1. In current architecture, I built several views that depend on each other. When deploying on this architecture, nobody made me aware (bc nobody seems to know) that changing things in upstream views causes deployment failures until I started working on this and my only workaround is to delete downstream views -> push -> confirm deployment successful -> make changes to upstream views-> push -> confirm deployment -> bring back deleted views -> push -> confirm deployment. This has caused a lot of delays and plenty failures that made me have to go to SWE team to fix that sometimes took the whole day to resolve \n\n2. Naming conventions and the way the data is stored have changed in new architecture with no documentation about this, leaving me to figure out using “eyeball” technique to see where new data is stored and changing my code accordingly \n\n3. Data in old architecture is not always coming through new architecture and I have to just figure this out by checking discrepancies and opening tickets for missing data that doesn’t get resolved no matter how much I ping people to look into it or fix it (I also don’t blame them because I feel other people are inundated too)\n\n4. Validation is a nightmare, I’ll have 30+ discrepancies and after checking code and data is there, I have to go through these records one by one to see why it’s not there by comparing tables. It turns out that some records are not meant to be in the new architecture, which I was not told until later when I did validation and had to compare what info from our schema tables was missing between the two. I have to look for specific clues between the old and new dataset for indication whether something is valid or not so I can document there is a reason for discrepancy  \n\n5. Documenting all of this and more is a task of its own \n\n6. Ongoing enhancements are expected to be added to some projects \n\nI have one project that is comprised of 10 SQL views. The expectation was this would take 2 weeks but it took me a month: 1. creating the views and aligning them to new data model 2. dealing with random/unanticipated failures because of how these views are connected that I can only ask the SWE team to because they can tell me what things in my code that used to be compatible with this new architecture aren’t anymore 3. Validating data and having discrepancies no matter how many times I’ve fixed any errors because some things are “discrepancy by nature” of this new model which I either document and write an explanation of why it’s valid or a something I have to open a ticket for 4. The new way we’re modelling data sometimes doesn’t work for existing projects and I have to add more lines of code to work around that \n\nThis is not new of the culture of my team. They give me several projects at a time thinking it will take 2 weeks. It takes longer for me and I have been told I have a consistent issue with slowness that makes me feel it’s a me issue. I explain to management my process, I started documenting all issues way more, but nobody gives me constructive advice on what I can do differently to work “faster” and it makes me feel like a failure. \n\nOne of the advices I was given was “ask for help” but whenever I do, nobody is able to help. When there were holidays, I asked overseas employees to help me investigate a discrepancy an came back to see nobody was able to do it no matter how many people I pinged and explained the issue in detail. \n\nAs a side note, some of the code I’m migrating now was a nightmare to develop in the first place - it was projects I inherited with no documentation, no idea what the project outcome should look like or what “acceptance criteria” deems the project complete or not. The code was 1000 lines and took several minutes to run with poor performance issues. Like a million full joins, sub queries within subqueries. I was once asked to add something to a where clause in this query and unknowingly broke something that I didn’t realize was a break bc I have no idea what the end result is supposed to look like. I was told to reverse it immediately and asked the SWE team who told me we can’t simply reverse our daily pipeline. The colleague who asked me to made the change became furious and this is where negative feedback about me started. I later worked hard to re-develop this whole project, breaking down the code into separate parts in order to join these separate views together at the end to make cleaner, optimized code. The team did like that work, but even then, issues would arise - upstream pipeline would fail, I have to interrupt my 10 projects to manually get a dataset, upload it through our transformation tool, export and manually put back into S3 that takes 30+ minutes. Later, it turns out that simple joins to create the end table aren’t enough per requirements because of unanticipated quirks with the data that requires a full join and 2 additional CTEs to get right. \n\nBasically, I’m just really tired. The business requirements are really ambiguous and a work in progress, our data is in different constantly changing formats and we have failures or changes of me upstream of I have to keep track of while working through other projects and stop everything to fix it. Of note, most of my team members are not strong technically but do have domain knowledge, yet I feel domain knowledge is not enough because the way we do things technically feels very poor as well. Sorry to make everybody read all this, I don’t have any other friends who work in data who I can vent to about this. ",

        "content": "Just wanted to share my experience with Snowflake Openflow.\n\n  \nThe client i work for relies heavily on CDC replication for their data ingestion to snowflake. We mainly bring in data from SQL server and oracle database to our snowflake data lake.\n\nOur client is using many different ETL tools mainly Firvetran's HVR, IICS and AWS DMS and in some cases snowpipe when they want to ingest data from s3 to snowflake.\n\n  \nWhen snowflake announced openflow which supports CDC replication we were excited. Out of the box it was supporting SQL Server CDC replication and Oracle connector was soon to be released. We were very excited as our client wanted to move away from IICS and HVR due to licensing costs.\n\n  \nWe immediately started working on a POC when the openflow was available in private preview.\n\nPOC Area: - CDC based replication from SQL Server to snowflake.\n\n  \nIts fairly very easy to setup the connectors and start using it. We were able to configure the connectors and start ingesting the data within couple of hours and mind you none of us had used apache nifi before.\n\n  \nPros: - \n\n1. easy to setup and use.\n\n2. Replication latency is pretty low. Plus it can be configured as well to fit your use case.\n\n  \nCons: - \n\n1. Cannot configure target snowflake schema : - biggest downside we have found out yet. We were using the default workflow for SQL server CDC and there is no option to ingest the data into desired snowflake schema. By default Openflow is creating a schema in snowflake database with the source SQL Server schema name. We were pulling the data from SQL server schema \"DBO\" and Openflow was creating the same schema inside our snowflake database.\n\nWe updated almost all the processors inside the workflow to use the custom schema name, for most part it worked. we were able to create tables and journal tables etc inside our custom schema in snowflake. But there is one processor which merges journal tables to permanent table which was not supporting to use custom schema name. Somehow it was still using \"<DB\\_NAME>.DBO\". DB name is configurable in this processor but not the schema name.\n\n  \nWe connected with the snowflake internal team regarding the same and the guy said they working on it after receiving complaints from lots of other clients. \n\nLater he suggested us to not configure/updated the workflow which comes with database connectors. If we do update it, it's gonna be considered as a custom workflow and it will be locked out of future updates.\n\nSo, customizing the pipeline is out of the picture.\n\n2. Environment variables and JVM variables: - there is no one stop UI to manage all these variables inside the workflow. You need to navigate to each processor to manage these variables. \n\n  \n3. Error logs: - not a fan of how openflow manages error logs, its very janky to navigate  and use.\n\n  \nthese were the stuff we found out in the last couple of weeks. We have stopped our POC midway due to con 1. And we and the client are totally dissappointed with how openflow is working as of now.\n\n",

I don’t really need the heavy-duty power of Databricks because I’m not processing massive datasets these scripts can easily run on a single machine.\n\nWhat I’m looking for is a platform or a setup that lets me:\n\n1. Run these scripts on a schedule.\n2. Have some basic monitoring and logging so I know if something fails.\n3. Avoid the complexity of managing a full VM, patching servers, or dealing with a lot of infrastructure overhead.\n\nBasically, I’d love to hear how others are organizing their Python scripts in a lightweight but still managed way.",

        "content": "I've been tasked with modernizing our ETL. We handle healthcare data so first of all, we want to keep everything on prem, so it limits some of our options right off the bat.\n\nCurrently, we are using a Makefile to call a massive list of SQL files and run them with psql. Dependencies are maintained by hand.\n\nI've just started seeing what it might take to move to DBT to handle the build, and while it looks very promising, the initial tests are still creating some hassles. We have a LOT large datasets. So DBT has been struggling to run some of the seeds because it seems to get memory intensive and it looks like maybe psql was the better option for atleast those portions. I am also still struggling a bit with the naming conventions for selectors vs schema/table names vs folder/file names. We have a number of schemas that handle data identically across different applications, so table names that match seem to be an issue, even if they're in different schemas. I am also having a hard time with the premise that seeds are 1 to 1 for the csv to table. We have for example a LOT of historical data that has changed systems over time, but we don't want to lose that historic data, so we've used psql copy in the past to solve this issue very easily. This looks against the dbt rules.\n\nSo this has me wanting to ask, are there better tools out there that I should be looking at? My goal is to consolidate services so that managing our containers doesn't become a full time gig in and of itself.\n\n  \nPart of the goal of modernization is to attach a semantic layer, which psql alone doesn't facilitate. Unit testing across the data in an easier to run and monitor environment, field level lineage, and even eventually pointing things like langchain are some of our goals. The fact is, our process is extremely old and dated, and modernizing will simply give us better options. What is your advice? I fully recognize I may not know DBT enough yet and all my problems are very solveable. I'm trying to avoid work arounds as much as possible because I'd hate to spend all of my time fitting a square peg into a round hole.",

How can this be achieved in less than 15 ms latency ideally? I tested Rising Wave's Continuous Query with Materialized Views but the fastest I could get it to run was like 50 ms latency. That latency includes from the moment the Kafka message was published to the moment when my business logic could consume the sliding window result made by Rising Wave. My application requires the results before proceeding.\nI tested Apache Flink a little and it seems like in order to get it to return the latest sliding window results in real time I need to build on top of standard Flink and I fear that if I implement that, it might just end up being even slower than Rising Wave.\nSo I would like to ask you if you know what other tools I could try.

My role doesn't have much opportunity for me to get experience on the job without switching teams, but that would require uprooting my family's life and moving to another city due to RTO.\n\nI'm planning to spend time over the next few months outside of work building projects with AWS, Snowflake, Airflow and other modern tools, so I can speak more to it during interviews.

Our data mainly lives in product DBs (Postgres), BigQuery, and our CRM (SFDC). We want agents for lightweight automation and reporting. \n\nCurrent approach:  \nInstead of giving agents any kind of direct warehouse access, we’re planning to run them against an isolated sandboxed environment with pre-joined, pre-sanitized views pulled from our DW and other sources. Agents never see the warehouse directly.\n\nOn top of those sandboxed views (not direct DW tables), we’d build and expose custom MCP tools. Each of these MCP tools will have a broader sql query- with required parameters and a real-time policy layer between views and these tools- enforcing row/column limits, query rules, and guardrails (rate limits, max scan size, etc.).\n\nThe goal is to minimize blast radius if/when an LLM does something dumb: no lateral access, no schema exploration, no accidental PII leakage, and predictable cost.\n\nDoes this approach feel sane? Are there obvious attack vectors or failure modes we’re underestimating with LLMs querying structured data? Curious how others are thinking about isolation vs. flexibility when agents touch real customer data.\n\nWould love feedback - especially from teams already running agents against internal databases.",

Whereas with S3 tables, you use a native AWS catalog, and maintenance is automatically handled. When would someone choose one over the other? \n\nIs there anything fundamentally wrong with the self-managed route?

        "content": "Working on one of my first bigger data projects as a junior and I’m a bit stuck.\n\nThe source system stores timestamps in CST (no DST); the target tables must be UTC.\n\nI extract data using a rolling 7–14 day window, filtered by a business date (midnight-to-midnight in CST) as these are essentially log tables. This is necessary because there’s no last-modified field in the source tables and yet records can be updated up to 7–14 days after creation.\n\nThe target tables are partitioned by the business date, and I overwrite partitions on each run. This works in theory when extracting full days, but timezone conversion complicates things. When converting CST to UTC, some records shift into the next day, meaning a “full day” CST extract can become partial days in UTC, potentially overwriting partitions with incomplete data.\n\nI’m avoiding MERGE because there’s no reliable primary key and analysts want to keep duplicates (some are valid), so partition overwrites seem like the best option. Essentially I just want to clone the source tables into BigQuery.\n\nOne idea is to extract data as UTC midnight-to-midnight, but the only apparent option in the source is extracting as GMT Monrovia (which I think maps to UTC). This is what I’m edging towards, but not sure if extracting data in a different timezone to what it’s natively stored as is a recommended approach?\n\nCan someone please sanity check my approach and let me know if it’s a bad idea, or if I’m missing anything?",

Despite that, I still think it offers a lot of value as a fast, easy way to explore data files of various formats - even ones with millions of rows. So I figured I'd share it with this community, as you might find it useful :)\n\nBeyond just viewing files, you can also sort, filter, calculate new columns, etc. The documentation is sparse (well, non-existant), but I'm happy to have a chat with anyone who's interested in actually using the app seriously.\n\nEven though it's browser-based, there's no sign up or server interaction. It's basically a local app delivered via the web. For those interested in the technical details, it reads data directly from the filesystem using modern web APIs, and stores projects in IndexedDB.\n\nI'd be really keen to hear if anyone does find this useful :)\n\n**NOTE:** I've been told it doesn't work in Firefox due to it not supporting the filesystem APIs that the app uses. If there's enough of a pull to fix this, I'll look for a workaround.",

Currently, we're being billed around $550/month for RDS MySQL, and I want to know if switching to Snowflake will help reduce costs and overcome bottlenecks like slow queries and concurrency issues.\n\nAlternatively, I’ve been thinking about using Lambda functions to move data to S3 and then pull it into Snowflake for analysis and Power BI reports.

Our data \"team\" is basically just me, plus my manager and coworker - both of whom are mostly comfortable just with data visualization in Tableau. Our data comes in from various vendors (20+) in the form of flat files in SFTPs or API endpoints. Nothing overly crazy, no streaming, no more than 1-2 GB over the course of a day.\n\nWhile Alteryx has been \"good enough\" the last 10 years, their rapidly rising costs has led us to research various options at how we can modernize our data stack and keep costs low. My manager has given me free reign to research various options and come up with a plan that we can execute over 2026, just with the understanding that our company has a footprint in Azure, so I shouldn't branch out to AWS or GCP for example.\n\nProposal:\n\n+ Azure Blob Storage to ingest and store all our vendors' files and data on a daily/hourly basis\n+ Dagster+ (hybrid) for orchestration\n+ Deltalake tables created/updated in blob storage for staging, warehouse, and marts layers using delta-rs and polars for transformations\n+ For serving to BI tools, use external tables in a Databricks SQL warehouse pointed to delta tables\n+ Keep Tableau as is, reduce our need for Alteryx over time to just last mile transformations/adhoc analysis for my other team members\n\nOther considerations:\n\n+ DBT: I did some of their courses and tried to recreate an existing pipeline using dbt-core orchestrated by Dagster and it seemed overkill for my purposes. Everything I liked in it was already covered by Dagster, such as data lineage, testing, and the features that might be nice require cloud. I'm also more comfortable writing transformations in Python rather than SQL.\n\n+ Table maintenance: I'm aware that external tables are not managed by DBX and it's on me to manage the tables manually (optimize/vacuum). I figure I can set up a script that runs once a month or something to automatically do it.\n+ Why delta-rs? Again, we don't have overly complex data needs or sizes that require Spark computing costs. Our machines are perfectly capable of handling the compute requirements that we need. If we get to ML models down the road, then I'd probably run those in DBX notebooks and rely on their computing power.\n\nHas anyone else ran a similar design before?

        "author": "poopdood696969",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m running into a Snowflake permissions issue that I can’t quite reason through, and I’m hoping someone can tell me if this is expected or if I’m missing something obvious.\n\nContext: we’re on Snowflake, tables are built with dbt and orchestrated by Dagster. Tables are materialized using DBT (so the compiled dbt code is usingcreate-or-replace semantics). This has been the case for a long time and hasn’t changed recently.\n\nWe effectively have two roles involved:\n\n* a read-only reporting role (SELECT access)\n* a write-capable role that exists mainly so Terraform can create/provision tables (INSERT / TRUNCATE, etc.)\n\nImportant detail: Terraform is *not* managing grants yet. It’s only being explored. No Snowflake grants are being applied via Terraform at this point.\n\nHistorically, the reporting role had database-level grants:\n\n* usage on the database\n* usage on all schemas and future schemas\n* select on all tables\n* select on future tables\n* select on all views\n* select on future views\n\nThis worked fine. The assumption was that when dbt recreates a table, Snowflake re-applies SELECT via future grants.\n\nThe only change made recently was adding schema-level future grants for the write-capable role (insert/truncate on future tables in the schema). No pipeline code changed. No dbt config changed. No materialization logic changed.\n\nImmediately after that, we started seeing this behavior:\n\n* when dbt/Dagster recreates a table, the write role’s privileges come back\n* the reporting role’s SELECT does not\n\nThis was very obvious and repeatable.\n\nWhat’s strange is that the database-level future SELECT grants for the reporting role still exist. There are no revoke statements in query history. Ownership isn’t changing. Schemas are not managed access. Transient vs permanent tables doesn’t seem to matter.\n\nThe only thing that fixes it is adding schema-level future SELECT for the reporting role. Once that’s in place, recreated tables keep SELECT access as expected.\n\nSo now everything works, but I’m left scratching my head about why:\n\n* database-level future SELECT used to be sufficient\n* introducing schema-level future grants for another role caused this to surface\n* schema-level future SELECT is now required for reporting access to survive table recreation\n\nI’m fine standardizing on schema-level future grants everywhere, but I’d really like to understand what’s actually happening under the hood. Is Snowflake effectively applying future grants based on the most specific scope available? Are database-level future grants just not something people rely on in practice for dbt-heavy environments?\n\nCurious if anyone else has seen this or has a better mental model for how Snowflake applies future grants when tables are recreated.",

I did a bunch of data engineering-adjacent things (\"make a pipeline to load stuff from this google spreadsheet into new tables in the DB, then make a report about it\" and such)\n* Then I got sick and had to take medical leave. For several years. For some reason, my job didn't wait for me to come back.\n* Eventually I got better. I learned Python. I'm really much better at Python now than I ever was at .NET, though I'm better at SQL than at either. \n* I built a stupid little [test project](https://github.com/manya-t/infinitecraft) doing some data analysis and such. \n* I started looking for jobs. And continued looking for jobs. And continued looking for jobs.\n* Oh and btw I don't have a college degree, I'm entirely self-taught.\n\nIn the long term, I want to break into data engineering, it's... the field that fits how my mind works. In the short term, I need a job, and any job that would take me would rather take a new grad with more legible qualifications and no gap. I'm totally willing to take a pay cut to compensate for someone taking a risk on me! I know I'm a risk! But there's no way to say that without looking like even more of a risk.\n\nSo... I guess the question I have is, what are some steps I can take to get a job that is at least *vaguely* adjacent to data engineering? Something from which I can at least try to move in that direction.",

We have clear vision for what a finished software package is and does and looks like. We get our work tested, packaged, and across the finish line. \n\nAlong the way we write some code.  The thing is, if we can do the other things well, the code is (usually) pretty easy, comparatively. \n\nAt the same time, pure code isn't finished and doesn't have any users. That gets very boring very fast.\n\nWanna see some examples of software packages of a scale that one person -- you -- can make and publish and try to attract live people as users?\n\n* These are Javascript utility packages. https://www.npmleaderboard.org/\n* These are plugins for WordPress:  https://wordpress.org/plugins/\n* ...for Python.  https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Artistic+Software \n* Indie games. https://itch.io/\n\nThere are other lists and repositories of packages out there for the searching. \n\nLaying down lines of code is just a part of our trade. The programmers of many of those packages did the whole job: explanation, instructions, code, testing, packaging, publishing, and then bug fixing.  Read through some of the package descriptions; they'll give you a feel for what a piece of finished software looks like.\n\nDon't be too intimidated by the packages that turn up on the first page of these lists.

With that in mind, I’ve been wondering if I could have been at least a mid-level developer if I hadn’t relied on AI that much while learning, even though it’s a tricky topic because a big part of our job is learning constantly.

People who don't program won't know the difference, and experienced programmers genuinely won't give a shit (and might in fact think your code is inferior, since it's less readable now).\n\nBut most importantly, memorizing lots of tricks won't make you a good programmer. You know what makes you a good programmer? Understanding fundamentals and learning creative problem solving, that's what you really need.\n\nPlease, for the love of God, stop following pop-coding \"coaches\". Their advice is often useless, and can waste your time by making you focus on the wrong things. As far as they're concerned, they WANT you to waste your time on them because it gives them more watchtime. Spend your time by instead working on projects you're interested in and reading up on the fundamentals of coding.\n\nRant over.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI need some help in choosing the right learning platform for web dev. I've been using freeCodeCamp since 2023 and I loved its structure: learn a concept -> guided project -> unguided project. That format works great for me and I learned a lot of stuff that I still remember.\n\nThe big problem is: FCC removed its video content. Staying focused on long lectures is a huge problem for me, because of that I can't learn on freeCodeCamp anymore.\n\nSo now I’m looking at alternatives:\n\n* Scrimba: seems interactive and video-based, which I need, but from what I've understood there are no projects where you actually get to write *everything* on your own and it's really shallow in terms of libraries and general depth\n* The Odin Project: To me personally it seems impossible to learn here, because there's lots and lots of text which is just a big no-no for my small clip thinking brain (thank you, tiktok).\n* freeCodeCamp: still amazing structure, but now mostly text-only which also makes it hard. The bite sized video lectures were perfect, but they're not there anymore.\n\nI’m not a total beginner. I know vanilla JS pretty well (up until DOM stuff from FCC), but once frameworks, Node libs, databases, backend tools, etc. enter the game, I stops working. So I'm searching for a deeper dive into the full ecosystem:\n\n* JavaScript & TypeScript\n* Node.js + Basic libraries like os, fs, http\n* React + Tailwind\n* Git, Linux, Docker\n* SQL\n* possibly Kubernetes and CI/CD\n\nIdeally, the platform should:\n\n* go really deep, not just scratching on the surface-level\n* include project-based practice (guided and unguided are nice)\n* offer both frontend and backend (can be in two different places) or full-stack\n* videos would help a **lot** (<- underline that twice)\n* certificates are a huge plus but not required, if it's a good course then certs aren't important at all\n\nBudget isn’t the deciding factor. I just want the most effective structure for actually retaining and practicing the material.\n\nFor people who’ve used these platforms or any other platforms: which one fits this learning style best?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for good learning resources (books, articles, courses, videos, blog series, etc.) that focus on the *underlying mechanics of web development*, rather than on specific frameworks or how to write code. I’m currently working as a working student at a software company, and most of my day-to-day work is focused on implementing features and writing code. While this is valuable experience, I don’t really get the opportunity to deeply learn or reflect on the underlying concepts and mechanics of the web. The problem I see here is that there are things I dont even know about and I would I need a good overview about the things that they even exist, like a book for example. Of course, I could just google individual topics, but the problem is that I don’t always know *what* I should even be googling. That’s why a well-structured roadmap, book, or resource where the relevant information is collected and explained in a coherent way would be extremely helpful.\n\nBecause of that, I want to be very clear: I’m **not** looking for tutorials on JavaScript, CSS, HTML syntax, or how to use frameworks like React, Vue, etc. I already work with those technologies on a daily basis.\n\nWhat I’m interested in are topics like:\n\n* Authentication & authorization (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.)\n* Cookies, storage, and state management\n* Caching strategies (browser, CDN, server-side)\n* HTTP fundamentals and request/response lifecycle\n* Security concepts (CORS, CSP, CSRF, XSS, same-origin policy)\n* How browsers and servers actually interact\n* General web architecture and system design concepts\n\nI want to better understand *why* things work the way they do, not just *how* to implement them in a specific stack.\n\nIf you know any resources that explain these concepts well (beginner-friendly but not superficial is ideal), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I'm in a CS adjacent program, but it's emphasis is heavy on programming. So CS for people that are bad at math. \n\nThis program, and maybe entire curriculum, is a joke. So far my Python and Javascript classes have been pretty alright but the HTML/CSS and SQL/Bash classes have been literally just freeCodeCamp and that's it. Nothing else. No feedback, course material, and bare minimum communication. The professor for both of those classes teaches 12 (!!!) classes in this department.\n\nI've only done a summer session and the fall semester so far, so I'm still early enough to jump ship to a different institution, but I'm wondering if it's going to matter in the long run or not. The only advantage that this college has over others is that it's comparatively cheap.\n\nDo I just tough it out and get the degree while teaching myself other languages, toolchains, and build my portfolio or do I run and find an different accredited 4 year that put more effort into their CS/adjacent programs?",

        "author": "Aguadecoco-bacano07",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\nHi everyone, I’m looking for honest advice and different perspectives on a possible career change (or career expansion).\n\nI have a degree in International Business, but after graduating I worked in roles unrelated to my degree, so I don’t have professional experience directly connected to it. At the same time, I’ve become genuinely interested in learning programming / software engineering — not only as a potential career switch, but also as a new skill I could combine with my business background in the future and as a strong plus on my resume.\n\nHere’s my situation and my doubts:\n\n• I can’t realistically commit to a full-time traditional university (time + cost).\n• A bootcamp appeals to me because of the structure, guidance, accountability, and also the opportunity to meet people and network.\n• English is not my first language, and although I use it daily, I want to keep improving. Being in an environment where I’m pushed to communicate more in English feels like a plus.\n\nSo far, I’ve started learning on my own:\n\t•\tfreeCodeCamp\n\t•\tPlanning to try The Odin Project next\n\nI’m realistic about expectations:\n\t•\tI know a bootcamp won’t guarantee a job\n\t•\tI know the market is competitive\n\t•\tI understand I may not get hired right away\n\nMy goal is to build real skills, start with solid foundations, and keep studying long-term. Even if I initially apply for jobs related to my original career\n\nOne important factor is that I currently have the option to stop working for about 6 months, since my husband can support me during that time. That’s why I’m seriously considering an intensive learning path like a bootcamp, so I can fully focus during that period.\n\nI looked into Hack Reactor, but my experience has been concerning:\n\t•\tI was told about a full scholarship. I applied and 3 weeks later they informed it wasn’t available for now. \n\t•\tI pass the CCAT test, contacted them to know about the next steps. Someone told me they will contact me but is been almost a month a haven’t heard for them. \n\nBecause of that, I’m unsure whether Hack Reactor — or bootcamps in general — are still an option right now.\n\nSo my main questions are:\n\t1.\tBootcamp vs community college vs online university — what would you recommend in 2026 for someone in my position?\n\t2.\tIs a bootcamp still worth it mainly for structure, foundations, and momentum?\n\t3.\tAre online universities that people often recommend on Reddit actually a good option?\n\t4.\tIf you were in my situation — limited time/money, strong motivation, and a non-tech degree — what path would you choose?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences. I really appreciate it.",

We are currently have modules regarding databases, advanced programming and api development with a client app. The problem is that the database lectures was so theoritical but for the assignments we had to create 2 DB systems with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, without learning any of these languages during lectures. I hardly managed to do the assignments since it was the first time I had to write postgre and mongo and they assessments required to apply advanced knowledge to code the systems. On the API module it was the same. The professor focused on teaching material regarding how to complete the weekly assignments but the final one was doable since the most of the part covered from the weekly tasks. On advanced programming we had to use c# that we used in the previous years but we had to create a cross platform app with blazor and we never saw examples during lectures on how to set up a blazor app and I felt overwhelmed from the amount of reseach I had to do myself. The following semester we have an IoT's module and the prof told us we will create an IoT device in a simulator with python for the final assessment. We never touched python before. The other module is about game development and they changed the curriculum to use unreal engine with c++ instead of unity, we never wrote c++ before. The last module is about penetration testing and the module guide says that we will have to write bash scripts and python to simulate some attacks on our Uni's servers. What do you recommend me to study during our next semester's gap in order to cope with the assessments and not get frustrated again?",

Part of it is learning to use the numpy library for drawing a really simple graph. I ran into an issue with one of the exercises, where I couldn't add any lines to adjust any parameters because every time the finished graph was closed, everything I entered into the REPL was deleted from the queue and I had to enter the whole program into the REPL again.\n\nI went to AI to find this out, and asked about putting this all into a script. Two days later I have a script, an understanding of why I would have multiple files for a script (for separation of concerns), why I would put these files in the project directory and not a \\~/bin directory, and a few other things that I can't recall atm, but that I did not know before, or without, AI.\n\nI had to do some thinking to figure out what the script was doing, but not much thinking. I asked the AI a ton of questions along the way. I didn't simply copy-pasta the whole thing, but that only sounds like I'm justifying after-the-fact. Am I doing myself a dis-service?

        "author": "TypingTadpole",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I confess that I have a standard / frequent question around \"how do I create X type of app\", but there are three twists to the question, I promise! The FAQ helped, but before I go off and running, I want to \"test\" my hypothesis.\n\n**First, I'm old**. Not too old to learn (approaching 60), just that I have old programming experience. So I typed programs from computer magazines in BASIC into Commodore VIC-20s and PETs back in the 80s and saved them on cassettes; I learned BASIC and STRUCTURED BASIC in high school in the 80s; I took BASIC/FORTRAN/COBOL courses in university in the 90s. I learned enough to write a menu system in BASIC for running in DOS back in the '80s that allowed me to add/subtract items, write batch files that would launch when the menu closed and then reopen the menu when I was done running whatever program was, compile it and run it in DOS. Used it for years. So I have \\*\\*\\*SOME\\*\\*\\* experience. Just nothing recent. Oh, and I also can debug basic HTML / CSS issues on websites but avoid javascript stuff at least for now. I'd rather run WordPress with free plugins than program my own. I'm more of a user than a developer. \n\nThe second twist is that I have **two very specific needs** in mind, both of which could perhaps be done with a robust GUI and back-end database instead of programming it. But well, I want something a bit more customizable to my specific issues to solve. So, like the videos recommend, I have specific problems to solve that will keep me interested! The first is harder and I have more passion for it; the second is easier and maybe where I should start, even though I'm not as excited about it.\n\nAnd the third twist is that I am **NOT trying to build a revenue stream**. I'm open to having a small revenue stream tied to it enough to buy myself a coffee if someone wants the extra \"bits\", but just looking to use the apps myself, $$ is not my goal. If others in my immediate community find it useful, I'd be open to sharing the apps everywhere for free and with no advertising. Maybe some \"extras\" available in a pro version for $1 or something.\n\nThe first need would be a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts like a **field recorder** as if someone was doing a survey or recording a business transaction BUT without local wifi/internet access. So, like you were out in the woods, say, doing biology research and you wanted to record which birds you saw, and the date/time/interesting details. BUT you also want to be able to record the equipment you were using and the place/location with sort of default \"profiles\". Like, \"Profile 1\" says you're using equipment X, Y, Z; Profile 2 says you're using X, A, B; Profile 3 says Y, Z, B, etc. But I want to load the default profiles in as starter info. \n\nThere are existing database apps that do this, but I have some unique usage links that I'll need to pull from unique style databases too, which the database apps didn't have the power to do. Ultimately, I need the initial recording apps (mostly dumping info into a set of fields in a database) and then once I'm back in civilization, uploading them to a more powerful PC app that would be almost the same software in PC form, with some extra printing, formatting, layout features. I confess I have no idea where that info is saved on the phone, or the PC, or the inbetween bits (common upload to cloud when there's a connection? Like synching photos?). Just that I want the data to eventually be in the PC for more processing. It's not very complicated for operations (input screen, load profiles, enter data, save data, load previous records, etc.), and the graphics needs are not very sophisticated (very functionally focused). If it was the early 90s, I'd be tempted to even use COBOL. The app will do no calculations or advanced graphics; it's almost entirely a text-based database entry and retrieval function with some flex on forms.\n\nThe second need is similar but even simpler in design. It's like **a quiz game.** Questions, with 4 possible answers, timed. It could be used as a game or as a flashcard-type study aid. I have a specific purpose in mind, but the functionality is basically that of a trivia game -- load small database (say 25 Qs about topic 1), go through the Qs, have options for hints or retries, get score at end, equivalent of a global leader board (so some internet required). But all single player, not live games with others, no live online element. And the extra twist for this one is I would love to be able to do it in iOS, Android, AND a version for my website for those who DO have access. The mobile apps would work differently, and I don't NEED a website version, but I'll keep my options open. \n\nThe FAQ tells me to use Kotlin or Java (for Android); Objective-C or Swift (for iOS); C#, VB or JS for Windows Phone; or use PhoneGap / Titanium in HTML/CSS/JS. Oh and C# for the Windows PC version (no, I am NOT going to try MAC too). \n\nBut with my specific two-use functionality...is that the way to go? I'm fine to learn new tricks, just want to make sure I'm learning the right tricks.",

A simplified example:\n\n`SomeClass::unit_under_test()\n{\n    this->f();  // changes the state of this   \n    // ...    \n}`\n\nI've used C++ syntax since that's the language I'm using, but the question itself is not specific to C++. For those unfamiliar, `this` refers to the current object of the class that you are in scope of.\n\nMy question is: how do you properly test `unit_under_test`? \n\nI am not really that interested in testing `f()`, because there is a separate unit test for that. I also can't mock it without making changes to source code, because there is no way to link in a mock for `f()` that will end up getting called here instead of the actual member function.\n\nYou could also imagine that `f()` could be fairly complex. It could itself call a bunch of other functions that do various things and which should themselves be unit tested. Digging into the implementation of those functions starts to feel like it's getting outside the scope of the test of just this function.\n\nSo, it seems hard to know how best to test this kind of thing, and I wanted to know what others' thoughts are.",

This means fewer page->frame translations need to be stored in the TLB, making the array implementation more efficient.

        "content": "HarfBuzz experts,\n\nI’m trying to use HarfBuzz 8.3.0 with FreeType 2.13.2 and LVGL 9.2 on a bare-metal embedded target and I’m running into hard faults during Indic (GSUB) shaping. I want to check whether this is a known limitation or something wrong in my build/integration.\n\nTarget:NXP [i.MX](http://i.MX) RT1064 (1 MB internal SRAM + 4 MB Flash) on bare-metal\n\nToolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc with newlib-nano\n\nDisplay: 16x128 LED matrix\n\nUI: LVGL with a custom HarfBuzz text shaping hook\n\nStack: size - 64kB ; stack region: SRAM\\_DTC\n\nHeap: size - 128kB ; heap region: SRAM\\_OC2\n\nLibraries:\n\nFreeType 2.13.2 (static) + HarfBuzz 8.3.0 (static, Meson build)\n\nFont: NotoSansDevanagari, AnjaliOldLipi and so on as a C array\n\nAll threads, atomics, glib, ICU, getenv, etc. are disabled. No pthreads, no OS services.\n\nI have two build setups with very different behavior.\n\nCase 1 (non-cyclic build):\n\nI build FreeType without HarfBuzz, then build HarfBuzz with FreeType, and do NOT rebuild FreeType again with HarfBuzz enabled.\n\nResult: English text works and Indic gives me hard fault at GSUB.\n\nCase 2 (cyclic build, as described in FreeType docs):\n\nBuild FreeType without HarfBuzz.\n\nBuild HarfBuzz with FreeType enabled.\n\nRebuild FreeType with HarfBuzz enabled.\n\nResult: English and Indic text breaks, hard fault or hb\\_font\\_destroy gives error.\n\nThe fault consistently appears somewhere in the GSUB path. The backtrace usually goes through hb\\_shape(), hb\\_shape\\_full(), hb\\_shape\\_plan\\_execute(), hb\\_ot\\_shape(), and apply\\_forward() in GSUB. In some runs the crash appears closer to hb\\_font\\_destroy(), in others during hb\\_shape(), so I suspect memory corruption or an assumption violation rather than a single bad call.\n\nImportant observation:\n\nWhen FreeType is NOT rebuilt with HarfBuzz, English works but Indic fails.\n\nWhen FreeType IS rebuilt with HarfBuzz, both English and Indic fail and I get a hard fault.\n\nOccasionally, I also get an access violation and I found this:\n\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation)\n\nMy understanding (please correct me if wrong):\n\nHarfBuzz does all shaping (GSUB/GPOS, Indic, Arabic, etc.) and FreeType loads glyphs and rasterizes them. The FreeType ↔ HarfBuzz cyclic dependency mainly exists for auto-hinting improvements, not for shaping correctness.\n\nSince my display is a very low-resolution 16x128 LED matrix, hinting quality is not very important, but correct glyph order is.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Is HarfBuzz GSUB shaping expected to work on bare-metal targets with no OS and newlib-nano?\n2. Is rebuilding FreeType with HarfBuzz actually required if shaping is already done by HarfBuzz?\n3. Are there GSUB code paths that assume stack size, libc behavior, or memory features that may not exist on embedded targets?\n4. How much stack and heap would be required for proper Indic rendering?\n\nI have attached an image from the IDE incase anyone wants to check.If you happen to know someone who might be familiar with this issue, I’d really appreciate it if you could share this with them. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEven a confirmation that this configuration is unsupported would be very helpful. Thanks a lot for any pointers you can share.

Junior Devs Often Know AI Tools Better\n>“Number one, my experience is that many of the most junior folks are actually the most experienced with the AI tools. So they're actually most able to get the most out of them.”\n\n2. Junior Developers Shouldn’t Be The Default Cost-Saving Move\n> “They're usually the least expensive because they're right out of college, and they generally make less. So if you're thinking about cost optimization, they're not the only people you would want to optimize around.”\n\n3. Removing Juniors Breaks the Talent Pipeline\n>\"At some point, that whole thing explodes on itself. If you have no talent pipeline that you're building and no junior people that you're mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that's where we get some of the best ideas.”\n\nWhat do you think of his arguments?",

        "author": "extechmachina",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It seems to me that in the past few years a lot of developers and engineers working in the industry became the equivalents of \"passive, people pleasing doormats\" who value their jobs ways above their personal integrity and morals. \n\nI commented on a post recently that said \"I gave up on concert tickets because of an emergency at work, is that normal?\" (asked by a junior developer).\n\nAlong my comments there, I'm writing this post to say that, NO, that is not normal. And it  should not be the norm either. Boundaries matter, our personal lives matter, and the engineers who do not enforce or put up said boundaries create a worse environment for the rest of us.\n\nI'll double down by sharing a personal story that happened to me just a few months ago.\n\nbackground: I am a senior backend/data engineer with about 8 years of total industry experience. I've been working at my current company for 4 years now. We are a consultancy firm with large (mostly corporate) clients from around the world. My main client at the moment is a large non-tech company. I've been with this client since the beginning of my employment in the current company.\n\nA few months ago my PM passed on a new ticket that required me to create a process that formats and sends personal data of tens of millions of private clients (who are people like you and me) to a third party for a vaguely written cause (that was clearly along the lines of ad targeting).\n\nPossibly a violation of GDPR, but I am not a lawyer, so I cannot be sure. Either way it was morally disgusting to say the least.\n\nI refused to do it. I refused to plan, execute or have anything to do with that ticket. I knew clear and well the risk I was taking, they could have fired me for refusing, but they didn't.\n\nI pissed my PM off, I pissed my direct manager off (although they all agreed with me at first, that this was a problematic feature--until I refused to go along with it, then they flipped).\n\nI even heard this has reached my CEO, who was also, in fact, pissed off.\n\nBut I stood my ground, I knew they COULD fire me, but I hoped they would not. I explained myself as politely but as firmly as I could, stating \"I do not want to do this\", \"this is wrong\"', etc. \n\nI knew I could not stop the company from doing it, because there was probably a legal loophole, or some shady terms of service agreement that would allow them to go along with it. But I did not want it on my conscience. They ended up giving the feature to a different engineer, marked it as \"priority: emergency, must happen now\", and I ended up keeping my job.\n\nThe bottom line of the story is that I refused to give up my personal boundaries for money, and you should too. I am not telling you to ignore risks, or to be stubborn for no reason. I am however asking you to respect yourself, your boundaries, your limits and your personal life. Your personal life, and your personal boundaries are reason enough to politely refuse when the rope tightens for no valid reason.\n\nIf you live in fear of losing your job, you are by definition a slave of whoever is signing your paycheck. You must believe, even in times like this (when the market is truly horrible), that you will land a job no matter what. You will make enough money to live comfortably no matter what your situation is. If not this job, then the next one. If not this profession, then something else. Once this mindset sets, you can develop personal boundaries, and live, frankly, a much happier life in general.\n\nEverytime we allow corporations and managers to push our boundaries, it becomes the norm and spreads like wildfire. Let's use our combined power as valuable engineers to engineer a better environment for all of us.\n\nRant over, have a lovely weekend.",

One was from an early seed stage startup and the other was Meta. I accepted Meta for more immediate TC and stability, but then I got laid off again just before hitting my year mark. I just finished interviewing again and this time the results are much better. Waiting for the last potential offer/rejection to come in before I post that Sankey.\n\n  \n\n\nOverall the system design interviews were my biggest weakness again like in my previous search. Hellointerview helped a lot with that and I ended up paying for two mock interview sessions with them. Those are painful but worth it.\n\n  \n\n\nBesides system design interviews, though, I got rejected a lot in the initial round for not having enough depth in particular tools. I’ve been working in developer tools and infrastructure for most of my career and a lot of places I was applying to wanted much deeper experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. I had worked with all of those at the previous two jobs I had in the 6 years prior to this search, but hadn’t really dug in deep on them and it showed in those early screens.\n\n  \n\n\nI also got several rejections in the final rounds towards the end where the feedback was that I did very well but someone else just had a bit more relevant experience so they were getting the offer. I even had one recruiter say that the hiring manager tried to get headcount approved to extend offers to me and the other candidate but got denied and I was the second choice.\n\n  \n\n\nHere’s the details of the two offers I did get:\n\n  \n\n\n**Seed stage startup**\n\n* Salary: $190k\n* Target bonus: 10%\n* Equity: $88k in options\n* Remote\n\n\n\n**Meta**\n\n* IC5\n* Salary: $215k\n* Target bonus: 15%\n* RSUs: $710k over 4 years\n* TC: ~$425k\n* Hybrid 3x/week\n\n\n\n[Sankey source](https://sankeymatic.com/build/?i=IIBxBsEsFMBMAIDaA2AHAXXgOQPbwE7QDOIOAdkdAFCgQwKIDsArJgErQBW0AxgC5wqAeiHwAhkSIBXALaQyAc3Hhw8HADN4fABbRxPHtBACEYsFB5i%2BkckQLEp4E%2DHnxLKogBp4UkLCt6kJpkvMREYvgAnjTm9EgATBjwAMJiKvAA7qKEPPhSkAL4MXRwCZgA8mRQIeKSYTLQZHzFUKWIAIyYABJipuCEvZEuTdD4AG4wGaXqOPhaugQ44NS0rQzx7Lx5BaP2JOSwgqtxHZgAkmQFkGlavNqX7otSZLBUVD19A7BD8oUT0FMEDM5jo9PglnpTvAONx%2BIIqBxcvlCntSC82ht4ABxbQ4IgmN6I7YohqSMQKUoNJDtZAAFkwAHUCtpYIQMgitsjdqTwhSEFSUElUuksvYkTsikSuXMeeTKZDaUkcXiCVKJfBZXyNZD2vToVxeKrOerNfKkHrKtU9BJKJIGk0OeKSWE5fydedLtYbgIePdII9wc9XlRhapRTlibsoQAVMQAaz0uKpNsgCjI9uaocy2WNKI6AE5NrCCVnw7mo8xOvALldvXcHjdAy8Q2kwzmnVGAMyM5msgEtkXtyNzJgVKrya11O2NTOt7Ni4fU1jY3H4%2BGxhPwJOToip9MzsrwJk6PvsjeJnDJyR7jPUouGwTnreXnc3g%2BITEAMXkjZwQaoT7brUu5preULHiybLiOoKJiAYRjWIoajqOooyEtAcG6Agf58FoeAyEMIR8Bksxxne%2BrFoIHCYaUOF4RqhHQMRpHkbgqK2NQVA1l6qg%2Bn6AZ%2Di8CTIPecKvNx1y8fW%2Dq%2DkG1J6t%2BZCyc2El1r6DaqE2DDtAADJgypruJnqSbc6kyZpgkMMugEvsBb4OqpUlmQJcngb2bJccZan8cp2ljlawH1DObyWhOgXTk0SDdhRD6vKFNQ2kFkWIHqEGnlQ8U7kluEpR6tZOT5Fn%2Dpl4VEGB0WKb5byVUVQkdMuMKxVQNVPHVmJpVBYgwbscGGMY8hKBoqFFC1WnkeUKFoaNlnkdGGEyBqVi%2BgNbxzWIC0yEt2gDeNk1FBle3kcA8HGIIE3DeRAAivBWsGABcjVifAADEyTJDpH06VQd1sYQ%2BwUHoz2MLSwPA99pZDtKL0AEbMDwtLxIw30dQCL35vmqDqIwnbfcdfXOM9H2fp%2BH3feduyEzpPD5qTd2OaZhWtQglO0swtPTXJlOMLAtPXTwt0vR9CO0yjGTQbBJ2IYNh3PYcYg0%2DmuOxKUlOfV9D0Yb6tFSLhfD4YxzH4GRqufd9arOmSWpUibtMlYlEW4c9nbxNDnY6Ujd0GQTyDc8g0DqzZV4gfukVOy7btI7uABeehi%2B0%2BbxF9W7wLpqBfZt%2BAKK4qjtPEVAECnedaCnqD59D8CJ1Q0NKDwSyzC9KGN%2Bo%2Bd8PgYgUCAEQHlgVBkDghyZIX%2BfaPAbP5yQcE7SwZezIccxJ6Cyb57X4D189qAb5v%2Bc4J3PAFEM7RUOoq9izwUjjFY596DpAB0zD5%2DIuj4AU6jggtfARBSzRuHXczPejADFZqF3vveAt9WZUHAGISIdFZ49R1peKw%2Dp86cCkPiIIMDn5ZwoNgFBaDrDqEiI0WAdge72DGKMSgCg24gBHmQqwH9lpkFrjICATFiB63gCELu%2BJIFiGhtAcAdgV5rzVqTLckAB5kO2gobQUBZG4VvtPeAMwmjqDgnocIFAAC0lBn7N3gFaCee8kK3yLoQKB1gKHRz0O0XS%2BdNppgwSnUmUCBHgCUsmMAGF8B2AAJrj0gDHFOyB85TFTNoXCtJXH8MEWMNIUhrTeIiP4%2DO6hHDgBADkSAu5yDwACfAUgu5rB5PcTgdkmRoARKiTE9xRSrh5LEAgtIe4wHjy1smBBaTIC%2BNwgI4E1B4DQwGHGUgvwK5fXieARJKjZibVwgAck8DfBZ%2BcsnQHUJAAAHvABZqz4DSBQts3ZqzF7QCGpQXCYh4ChKGW0tw9yEDpyYtcjMNgKDtwTJEeZ%2Dp8n5ygOgmQ0M0jt0MKkmQOAKHwGOKUbRt8dK6R0swbwcKb66niCDKgEKoW%2DWIGiSgYCb5Ip0p2fMKLb66WYLSLFkK9Dm25C6K2ehtHtDvp2ZAyBvAUpBtS7FdLNZYTUDreiBEuFMRIkbQlH12ioGRfAVFnZUCJBxnylIc4ywdjmKitO8R8ztC5WihFOk86qrtlOMqB5UXMHzMwZAnZyU3zdgik1tLqxeQKhpJm8rb7WvZfEA18R44%2BxpVCr2pR4U2vzLSA17RGAIvvqq0W4seqSx2kNXYqK7HxFtTG5AGND6qo5kJBVMrs0Gp0nqzsvLXWB1fKBS14DaT5kVQGukjBQmqses4eF7Qq3lsVcwF1UKk3worS2qVaBEghr0OTLV8LkAVrlai41iRS6qrxghcNRKkXsodanZgCbXV8wFqOn2DqdKs3aIeqFHxlBfB%2BCMcYkxpj11BIsZY3qb60jzagaNn6PqJEVqqtaG0to7UzagTs1rz0XtQAW119K5h%2DTRIcBAqLkDxE7O2h1aBkDWqAA)\n\nEDIT: Explaining my terrible labels: \n\n* Withdrew after accepting offer: I used this for the companies I withdrew from once I accepted Meta's offer.\n* Rejected: means the company rejected me at some point\n* Ghosted: the recruiter stopped responding to me without an outright rejection\n* Call w/ recruiter: Only used this if it was the first step before anything else after either applying or getting their email or LinkedIn message.

Two reasons:\n1) as I mentioned, I never struggled finding a job.\n2) when I talk to senior developers and leads in different companies, they always say: no qualified developers or current developers in the company should be fired because they are not doing their jobs well for many reasons.\n3) in the past 3 years, I've noticed a decline in the quality of the employees in general. They either lack skills, or they are lazy and we can't depend on them.\n\nMy guesses: the location is a major factor in the availability of jobs. Outsourcing may have affected some jobs. Jobs are available but salaries are not enough.\n\nI may be wrong or maybe my circle is not big enough to judge, so correct me if I'm wrong and tell me your stories and facts I may have missed.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "At this point I am pretty much not applying/barely applying to SWE jobs. I rarely see any that are entry level and when I do I never get a response. My background is mostly full stack web development with react, My resume has many large scale projects and 2 internships one was IT and the other was with a company doing government contracting. Here's the main issue:\n\nI have zero desire to grind leetcode or interview questions (frankly burnt out from this sort of stuff when it already feels hopeless applying). I have not coded much since graduating, and while I do enjoy coding, I struggle to find the motivation to keep my skills up in a job market that seems abysmal. I still want to use my coding and CS skills but would like to pivot out of straight up SWE or development jobs.\n\nI've considered creating my own digital products to sell, starting my own business, maybe going into IT, and more. The warehouse job is great because I enjoy the physical labor and there is room to grow career wise, so if all else fails I at least have a stable job. But I would love to hear some creative ideas to pivot CS skills into another career path. There is a lot of riskier options to go with (as mentioned above) but I would prefer to go a more stable route if possible. I'm open to any and all ideas.\n\n  \nSmall sidebar: I have no college debt and good savings. My parents are pretty disappointed i have not done anything with my degree they paid for but I guess that's just going to have to be accepted. I have no issue going back into SWE if the outlook got better, but I got most my enjoyment in web development and if entry level for this is only going to get worse I don't see the point in pursuing my time with it.",

        "content": "My question is, what CS jobs aren't as cooked as SWE? Job market wise that is. I feel like everything I see online is how bad the job market is for SWE's, and the only hopeful posts are ones about how the job itself is changing. I personally would rather not work in the field if the job truly becomes something akin to managing a team of AI agents. If I'm building something I want to actually build the thing. The degree I'm currently pursuing is in Data Science and the curriculum is still basically the same thing as a normal CS degree except a bit more math. I did this with the hope that the data science job market would be a bit better, but even now I'm hearing that the market is becoming over flooded. One might also think that MLE would be the way to go since that's what's taking over jobs right? But similar to DS I hear that those jobs are changing rapidly and are flooded with applicants. There's not as much need to custom train a model from scratch so most just use API's for the big names. It seems like the only jobs holding up are more Sys Admin and general cyber security roles. Personally, that realm isn't my thing and I'd much rather be programming something even if it's just a couple lines of SQL and Python. Is programming really just dead? At least in the way that it once was? I'm only 18 also, so I'm sure my view is just a bit too narrow. I'm sure that a lot of sectors are feeling this as well. I think just with AI being the new big thing and Computer Science jobs being so adjacent to this new advancement that we catch a lot of the heat because of it.\n\nFor context on who I am, I'm an undergrad student at a T100. My high school offered free CompTIA certs, so I have the A+, Network+, and Security +. I've been programming since high school, and I did a software dev competition where I placed 5th nationally. I also worked essentially a help desk job my senior year of hs as well.\n\nIf anyone has SWE adjacent jobs please let me know! Either just ones in general or ones that fit my experience. Also, if you think SWE isn't changing and will be fine I'm also curious to hear why.",

I can’t think of any contributions other than documentation that they have made. Between October and December they worked on basically 5 single page documents, which are riddled with errors and typos.\n\nWe have daily stand ups every day, but out of everyone this person misses it the most. With no explanation.\n\nThey sometimes have 10 tickets assigned to them but in their update only update on 1 ticket. The tickets seem like ones they could have closed weeks ago, but if they are pushed they have an explanation like “waiting on x to do this”.\n\nIt’s all smoke and mirrors with them.\n\nWhen they did have a task 10 months ago, I helped them so much with it, and it really bothered me bc it wasted so much time. Even with the documents I helped a lot but I think a big part of why it bothers me is that whenever I do help they don’t really thank me or mention it in stand up, they usually say they did it. They also debate with me about the information I’m giving them. Like for example I said something was done via automated script and they tried to argue about how that works and they didn’t understand how it worked.\n\nThey are a drain on my energy and I would really just rather they weren’t on the team. How do you deal with someone like this? Just ignore them? As I have been for 2 years?\n\nI’ve actually been keeping a parchment path on this secretly.

Then manager made us (me and Person C) work overtime to cover person A's part to meet deadline. I had to “transfered” parts of the task to Person C so he can shared the workload that person A left. Juggling between coding and communication/transferring knowledge and Q&A with another dev really made me unable to focus. Also I was being questioned nonstop and pressured by managers to finish quickly and it worsened my mood and life quality due to pressure and unbalance work hours.\n\nUser story 2 is assigned to me and person B. Person B didnt really care and did a bad job, and I had to review and corrected his mistake, because I knew in the end if the task isnt done, then I will have to work overtime or being questioned and pressured again. Managers only looked at the surface and whenever theres something not meet deadline, he assigned other members of the team to cover the lackluster member. I don’t know what they do to the particular member in the dark and it is not disclosed.\n\n\n\nOriginal:\n\n\nHi guys, I wonder if theres some coworker that I have to team with and he is either lazy or irresponsible, should I tell the manager or not.\n\nI feel like if I always tell the manager, then it would look like I am the problem, who can not work with anyone and always badmouth.\n\nAlso it may not be wise, since we might have the same paycheck but I am working with all my effort, and someone else is slacking of at work and have more time and energy for his personal life. I'm afraid I will somehow “raise the bar” for expectation and makes all the developers suffer under the  already exploitative system.\n\nBut if I kinda “side with him” and relax, the task will be late or has not very good quality.

In August of this year, I was laid off after the federal government canceled all the contracts I was working on, and there were no other positions available for me. I had been at the company full-time for almost three years before being laid off.\n\nI have been applying for jobs for almost five months now, and I have had no success. Most of the time, I do not even get interviews. When I do get interviews, I have reached the final round at Meta but did not get an offer. The same happened with Fanatics. At IBM, I failed the first programming interview after the coding assessment. I was interviewing for a C++ role but had limited experience. I have also interviewed for three local roles and made it to the final round in all of them.\n\nThe only feedback I have received came from my two most recent interviews. For Company A, they said I did not perform well in the programming project during the interview because I focused on new Java features. However, they also said positive things. They thought I had the right culture fit and technical skill, but I lacked experience in DevOps, which I believe was not part of the job description, and I was relatively slow. For Company B, they said, \"We do not think your skillset is the best fit for the fundamental development tasks that will be our primary focus in the months ahead.\"\n\nMy experience at my former employer was mainly with legacy systems, which is typical for government contracts. We used AWS for the entire system: ECS, RDS (Oracle SQL), DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3. But all the backend code, where I worked full-stack, was in Java 8, later upgraded to Java 21, SpringMVC (no Spring Boot), Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, SVN, and Git. The frontend consisted of JSPs that loaded XML files with vanilla JS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, along with CSS and HTML.\n\nIt seems many companies are looking for reactive websites, which I have no experience with, or Spring Boot and more modern tech stacks. I am getting almost no interviews, and the process can take a month or more just to end in rejection. I know the job market is very difficult right now, but this is taking a serious mental toll on me. I already have disabilities and mental health issues, and I feel like my life and career are falling apart. I do not have skills for \"normal\" non-tech roles, and I do not know what to do. I know the obvious advice is to improve my resume and interviewing skills, but at some point, even getting an interview feels completely random, and the same goes for the interviews themselves.\n\nEDIT: Resume https://imgur.com/a/j1UZQnQ",

To no ones surprise, even very basic entry level developer roles are getting 1000+ applicants as soon as they are posted. As an example, one role I saw, showed 85% of applicants had masters degrees, and 73% were senior-level applicants, while the rest of the figures (bachelor's, mid-level, entry-level) were in the teens.\n\nGiven these metrics, recruiters and hiring managers, how is your process with choosing candidates in this situation? if it is an entry-level position, do you prioritize who is more experienced in years or do you opt to choose best fit based on the posting level? Is there a different guideline you follow?\n\nIt would be interesting to read some perspectives on the hiring process. TIA!",

I quit my non technical job in Dec 2024 to focus fully on building my resume and learn web development. \n\nI have been applying to roles since January of 25' but it wasn't until August ish that I actually had a decent resume with Full Stack projects, 2 hackathons(including a 3rd place overall), I did a small internship at my school where I used Wordpress. I then also launched a startup solo, I have about 10 non paying users but hopefully it keeps growing. At the same time I have been doing freelance work, from landing pages to SaaS stuff. \n\nI have also been networking a lot, been present in almost all cs school events. I got referrals for Microsoft and other local companies(no luck). All while applying to 50 ish jobs per week since April-May.\n\nI have only been able to do like 5 phone screenings, a few follow up interviews, 1 technical at a startup and a final non-technical round at a f500 company but for a web marketing role(no leetcode). I have great soft skills and a lot of projects I can talk about so that is really not an issue for me. I have been griding leetcode on and off and I hate it too but what can we do.\n\n  \nNow that I graduated this december, I decided that I dont want to keep waiting, so I took a role at the GeekSquad and am studying for my CompTIA Network+. I also won a coding event at my school and got a free voucher for the AZ-500 for next year.\n\nI do enjoy development but the market has been terrible for me. I was thinking that maybe It will be a good idea to try to go the IT route and eventually aim for DevOps roles or SRE. I also have a minor in PM so those roles work as well for me.(I have been applying for all sorts of roles)\n\nHas anyone done anything similar? Will going into IT now be a good strategy to ride out the job market?\n\nThank you all in advance!!\n\n  \nTL:DR  \nBeen applying for tech roles without luck for about a year and heavy for about 6 months, no luck. I just graduated and instead of waiting I decided to break into IT, get some certs and apply hard for entry level roles. Was wondering if anyone has done something similar and if this can be a good strategy to ride out the market?",

Our tech stack is Java/Kafka/RPC/S3/Logging tool to fetch S3 logs/UI to interact with APIs.

Learn nuances to the product itself\n2. Learn Java coding more deeply with dependency injection (by doing personal projects 2 hours a day on work computer using work tech stack)\n3. Learn architecture of our main repos(all our repos follow general architecture of having organized modules where some are data, some are RPC, some are Kafka, etc.)\n4.

More personal thoughts:\n\n\n\nI interned at AWS, but I didn’t really connect with my team, and my project was pretty separate from what they actually worked on. Because of that, I still don’t have a solid grasp on what the full-time role would feel like day to day. I also didn’t love the overall Amazon culture, which makes me a bit hesitant about returning.\n\n\n\nLocation is another factor. I’m from NYC and very used to walkability and easy access to everything. Seattle seems closer to that lifestyle, while San Jose feels much more suburban. I’m trying to figure out how much that should weigh into my decision since I plan to move back to NYC eventually.\n\n\n\nI’m also unsure which role sets me up better long-term (prestige/growth). I’m curious how hiring managers view early-career experience at AWS vs Adobe and which one tends to offer more mobility down the line.",

        "content": "I am an SWE with 4YOE (all at my current place of employment) in a LCOL city. Where I work, software is a cost center.\n\nFor most of my time at this company, we were a team of 4-5. Over the course of this year, the team has shrunk to just me with HR saying they have no intention of opening up or hiring for the lost positions. This means I am salary with 24/7 on-call (no payment for OT or call-outs).\n\nI recently became a team of 1 as of mid-september. Based on the concerns I brought up with my manager, I was recently presented with a raise and title change. I went from \\~$80k -> \\~$91k. This is in effect as of now.  This raise also makes me ineligible for the normal end-of-year raise considerations. \n\nIn addition to the raise, a retention offer was just made for $9k but I would have to remain with the company for 18months. Accepting or rejecting this offer does not effect the title change or raise that I already got.\n\nThey have already stated that negotiating any of that 9k into base salary is not an option nor lessening the time frame. HR got quite aggressive when I inquired about that. The offer says I would get the net post-tax money, but would have to pay back the gross amount if broken.\n\nLike many of us, I have already been applying for other jobs. And honestly, if I had a choice, I would not be here in even 6 months. But with the current job market, especially in a LCOL city, Im not too sure if the option of another job in 18 months is realistic.\n\nI've read there is some tax form that could be filled out to essentially get the tax difference between the net and gross so I don't suffer a loss if I break the contract.\n\nBut my question to you is - how have you handled retention offers like this and what is your opinion on it?\n\nAccepting it feels like it might turn into handcuffs of a sort... but rejecting it feels like it puts a mark on me as a flight-risk when I might be stuck there anyways due to the current market.",

I decided to take it as I had literally nothing to do but I'm not sure if this is going to hinder me long term.\n\n\n\nI went into my degree with the intent of becoming a SwE, I know SwE pretty well and I'm pretty comfortable writing code. Platform is all brand new to me & I'm struggling to really grasp the scope of what this team does. There's tons of different repos, lots of different tech, pipelines, bash scripts, terraform whatever the fuck else but its all one big blur to me. \n\n\n\nI know I'm new to the role and all but part of me has this feeling that I'm wasting my potential. I spent 5 years learning to code, I got pretty good at it, I worked hard to get a first in my degree and there's this voice telling me I'm wasting it all in this role. \n\n\n\nCould anyone more experienced in the DevOps/Platform side of things let me know what the role is like? Do you feel this is a solid role long term, with progression and transferable skills or is it just another buzzword that will quickly die out? \n\n\n\nI feel like I see software engineers everywhere making lots of money, little money, big companies, small companies, there's tutorials everywhere but with Platform all I see online is grifters trying to sell courses or hyping it up as \"the next big thing\". I don't really have a sense of the importance of the role the same way I did about SwE",

        "content": "January to May 2025 was a bit bittersweet. Was a college junior at the time, and I had just molded my resume into something semi-satisfactory after sticking a bunch of school projects onto it. I had pretty much locked in with applying to tech-adjacent roles like data analysis at this point, and was prioritizing local companies. I kept applying through the spring, long after many might've given up or accepted offers. And while most of the internships I'd applied to were duds, a few did reach out to me. None of them were really technical, and yet I managed to fail many of those. For some I feel like I came painfully close to an acceptance, only for the door to be slammed in my face never to be opened again.\n\nCome May, I was at wits end, and dreading the possibility of having to work at my church friend's father's store and get paid in cash for the second summer in a row. But eventually, I found a company which onboarded me at the last second for the summer. Their office wasn't far from where I lived, so things did go smoothly. Unfortunately, though, they didn't give me a return offer even though they were satisfied with my performance.\n\nFor this fall I've landed a tech job through my school's research department that pays like 16 an hour. And while I've received glowing reviews for this, it's just through the school. In the meantime I've applied to a few tech jobs, and have even secured a few interviews. My resume looks a lot better now than it might've 1 year ago, people have reviewed it and told me that I'm well qualified for new grad. And yet, I'm like the world's worst interviewer. One guy ended the interview 10 minutes in because he didn't like my responses. Another gave up on me despite me being a referral. I've failed an OA they were asking for a \"winter help desk intern\" even though it's literally help desk.\n\nThe last month of class I didn't even apply to anything at all, it was just depressing. I just feel like an idiot. I haven't leetcoded in ages, and if you throw LC at me right now I'll probably fail at it miserably. You can do everything with AI nowadays so that's literally what I've been doing for some of my work, like come on even many companies are doing it. I don't even want to leetcode. I don't even want to work. Some days I literally just want to sleep forever, to tell the truth. Once I literally ranted to some of the people on campus so badly after bombing one of these interviews that they had the cops called on me and forced me to go to the hospital to make sure I wasn't planning on unaliving myself.\n\nHopefully I can lock in well enough to land something by the time I graduate may 2026. But something tells me I'm probably not. And if I don't the battle will just grow more and more uphill. You literally cannot afford to live life unless you're at the top of the world. The sooner I leave my shitty parents the better, but the world is conspiring to hate me so badly that they're probably going to force me to live with them for the rest of my life and probably even die with them. It's like the curse of unbinding from minecraft.\n\nI absolutely hate all of this, and I'm going to absolutely hate next semester of college because it'll be my last, and I'll have to do and go through with all the routines and actions knowing it'll soon be over which'll just ruin the fun. To paraphrase Calvin and Hobbes, it's like trying to enjoy one's final meal before the execution. I'll have spent what's supposed to be the best time of my life to get a boy/girlfriend and exit it without one. Who the fuck is going to date me if I'm flipping burgers since it's the only job I'll be able to find even with a degree in CS, or if I'm stuck living with my parents in an unwalkable typical American suburb because it's the only home I can afford?\n\nHonestly, if the world is going to hate me, I might as well hate the world.",

Performance reviews are strong (“exceeds expectations”), but there’s essentially no room for advancement or technical growth. Long-term, my goal is to land a FAANG / FAANG-adjacent role targeting \\~$300k+ TC, and I’m willing to extend my time horizon to get there.\n\n**Background:**\n\n* Bachelor’s degree in a *non-CS* field, earned \\~13 years ago with a poor GPA\n* Previously made \\~$138k at another non-tech company, but was laid off in April 2024\n* Didn’t land my current role until August 2024\n* Currently working in a consultant-style role across two projects\n\n**Current role details (and why I’m concerned):**\n\n* Main project is an R Shiny dashboard with a bloated but functional frontend\n* Backend is Python scripts in Azure Data Factory + Azure SQL (tables/views/stored procs)\n* I inherited the project after the original developer left\n* I’ve successfully:\n   * Troubleshot pipeline failures\n   * Added new dashboard features\n   * Managed stakeholder relationships independently\n\nThat said, I feel like my *actual* technical fundamentals are eroding. I’ve leaned far too heavily on ChatGPT to do my coding, to the point where I’d describe myself as a “prompt engineer” rather than a strong engineer (and yes - I used ChatGPT to help me write this post, lol). There’s:\n\n* Zero technical mentorship\n* A disengaged manager (old-school DBA, 20+ years at the company)\n* No push toward system design, algorithms, or deeper CS concepts\n\nI want out of this role in the near term (ideally back closer to my previous comp), but beyond that I want to **rebuild my foundation properly in a structured environment**. Self-study hasn’t worked well for me — I do better with accountability, deadlines, and external structure.\n\n**Mental health context:**  \nThe layoff last year triggered a rough bout of depression/anxiety. I’m currently medicated and in therapy, and things are stable now. I’m trying to be realistic and intentional about my next steps instead of reacting out of panic.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* Does it make sense to take CS fundamentals courses at a community college to demonstrate readiness and improve my chances for something like **Georgia Tech’s OMSCS**?\n* Is a formal CS master’s actually a good path for someone in my position aiming for high-end tech roles, or would I be better served focusing on:\n   * LeetCode + system design\n   * Targeted projects\n   * Switching to a more technically rigorous job first?\n* For someone mid-career with weak formal CS fundamentals but real-world experience, what’s the *highest leverage* way to move forward?\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts — I’m okay with a multi-year plan if it’s the right one. I just want to avoid wasting time or going back to school if it’s unlikely to materially change my trajectory.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight.",

        "content": "I recently applied to a job on LinkedIn that I'm beginning to think is not legitimate somehow. The role is for a remote junior SWE position, and the listing seemed like any other one I've come across on the site. I hadn't heard of the company before, but I quickly scanned their website to check for legitimacy before applying. I heard back from the company about a week later asking if I was interested in completing a quick assessment via interview questions. I was so excited to finally hear back about a potential role so I emailed them back within an hour. Let's call the guy that I'm emailing with Ron.\n\nRon's email wanted me to reply YES if I was interested in the assessment. I haven't seen this before, but I brushed it off as just a little odd. I responded with a YES, and a few hours later, I got another email from Ron with the interview questions attached in an .rtf file. He gave a little blurb about how there are no right answers and the test is to gauge if my skills and approach to the role are a good fit. He let me know that I could reach out with any questions if I had them and wished me luck on the assessment. This was on Friday.\n\nI browsed the \\~20 questions of the assessment so I could be prepared and started brushing up on some of the topics. They seemed like very normal questions for a junior SWE role. Explain the difference between these two technologies, some DSA, some behavioral, etc. Nothing strange other than an address by their logo at the top that I looked up. It's for a big office building in a major US city that had no record of them having a space in.\n\nI completed the assessment over the course of the weekend and emailed Ron back first thing Monday morning. To my surprise, he got back to me within half an hour of my response. He told me that he received my message and that their team will review my answers, then forward them to the hiring board for their decision. He said I'd hear back from him when a decision is made and asked me to acknowledge I received his email. I sent him a message back thanking him for his acknowledgement, and said I looked forward to hearing back. This is where things go downhill.\n\nI went to the company's site again to find some more information. Unlike the first time I looked around, this time I was closely reading the information on the site and clicking around. The first thing that raised an alarm was how unprofessional their about us section is. It has a really long run-on sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with three exclamation marks. This prompted me to do a real deep dive on them.\n\nAfter more time on their site, things really started to unravel. Social media buttons that link to nothing. Those buttons you see on the bottom of most web pages about privacy policy, ad choices, etc? All lead to blank pages. Inconsistencies with spacing and grammar. An address that looks to be a residential home in Canada. A portfolio page that has a nice flashy intro, but nothing else. Nothing on the site is selectable text. All very strange for a company that supposedly provides tech solutions.\n\nThen I did some research on Google. They have only a few people affiliated with them on LinkedIn, only 2 of which are people have any sort of information about themselves. One is a guy who seems to be a real software developer, complete with a personal website and a lively GitHub. Another is a woman who allegedly started working there years ago as a PM, but only just a few weeks ago posted an update sharing that she started there. She lists herself as still working there, but also has another current job listed. The other people affiliated with the company have no profile picture or anything, but I did find out one of them is Ron because he has a very distinct tagline that came up when I looked up his name as well.\n\nMultiple websites that report company information list them as having fewer than 10 employees, most of which are located in Canada or Africa. The company is credited as the designer and developer on a few dozen sites that I can find, but most of them seem to be associated with one specific church in one way or another. They do have a few social media accounts with not much on them. Also, the page for the LinkedIn posting I applied to is gone. Not marked as filled, but entirely gone.\n\nI'm just so confused about this whole thing. It seems so sketchy. But why send over a technical assessment if it's a scam? Why put up so many fake sites? It seems like a lot of effort just to get some data. Unless they're going even further and will try to offer people employment to get their bank data and/or social security number. Is this really how far scammers are going now? I'm already exhausted enough looking for an entry-level SWE role in 2025, I don't need scams that look this believable at surface level to waste my time.\n\nWhat do you all think? Has anyone seen anything like this before?\n\nTL;DR- I applied to a company for a junior SWE role and they sent over a technical assessment. After doing more research on them, I'm not sure if they are legit due to some sketchiness and inconsistencies.\n\nEDIT: Yeah it turned out to be a fake check scam as everyone was saying. There is at least 1 other person I’ve seen post about it with the same story. Now I’m not worried to say the name of the company, it’s Velte Technology Solutions. Beware!",

A lot of what exists out there is rather old/outdated and our team has been sort of tasked with figuring out the \"new way\" as we move into uncharted territory.\n\nNow normally companies have like a manager, IE: QA manager/Devops Manager/etc..., however there was some restructuring and a lot of people have been confused at who makes decisions.\n\nAnyways, I've been one of the people experimenting  with newer Devops tooling and newer CI/CD pipeline/processes. I've sort of taken it upon myself to get a lot of the \"unknowns\" figured out, since eventually legacy applications will move to this.\n\nI have the support from devops, as well as my manager/project manager. I've made sure to clarify that I am not coming in to make decisions, but more-so show what has worked for our team (Which I was sort of the guinea pig with a lot of the Terraform/AWS stuff) but really just wanted to get a list of what \"needs to be done\" and what \"needs answers/conventions\". Mainly just sort of \"organizing\" everything and tracking it.\n\nI've made sure to say as much as possible I am not trying to take over anyone job, and everyone seems supportive. I feel like one large downside to our company is a lot of indecision on stuff.\n\nWould you consider this annoying? or like a good initiative?",

        "content": "TL;DR: I’ve been resting and vesting at work, and I’ve ducked impactful projects for 4yrs. Will that really affect me much in a job hunt (for junior to mid-level SWE roles in a new field), if I can get solid at coding/system design problems?\n\nI’m a mid-level SWE (4 YOE) at a popular company that was bought by a FAANG before I started. I don’t do much and have basically been coasting, doing just enough to meet expectations in perf reviews. This is in part due to a lack of opportunity to lead projects or do high-impact work (when it is available, it is usually given to seniors). But, being honest, I don’t seek those opportunities out either. In fact, I actively avoid them. I don’t really want to work here and got trapped by the golden handcuffs. So I’ve been saving most of my mental capacity for personal studying, as I dream to transition out of web dev to a different field (still early SWE). My New Year’s resolution is to get really good at coding/system design problems and start applying. But I’m worried because I don’t have much to speak to as far as impact/metrics from my current job. I’m wondering if that matters much as long as I have solid whiteboarding performance?",

I’ve been here for around 3 and a half years, and it’s fully remote. The salary is 100k, although it’s extremely uninteresting and there’s no growth.\n\nConsidering all that, I feel like I should take the offer. However, I have severe social anxiety, and I’m extremely worried about how I’ll fit in with the new team. I think my current position being fully remote has made my social anxiety even worse, but the thought of going into the office at the new company terrifies me because of all the social interaction.\n\nShould I just get over it and take the offer? Or is this a valid concern?\n\n",

And ofc he his kinda arguing with the non-hierchachy stuff and that we are all responsible... \n\nLately, in the weekly meetings, he is helding 2 hour long monologues about how he wants us to behave. The recent talk was all about just to accept his critique and not to give any professional advice from my perspective as professionally trained CRM-Manager, Copywriter and Graphicdesigner. \n\nOverall he is kinda stuck in this idea, that he can do anything, while the team is just there to  realise his 'vision' (of earning more money). \n\nI know this isn't a healthy workplace and I am working on finding a new job (which these day isn't that easy). \n\nDo you have any advice on how I can protect myself while working for a toxic and narcissistic Manager?

Note that this would be my first ever job change.\n\nNow *IF*  I do get the offer, I'm kinda unsure whether to take it or not, for 2 reasons:\n\n1- My backend stack is mostly Node.js/.NET, with AWS for cloud. The new company uses Python with FastAPI and GCP, both of which I have no prior experience in.\n\nI'm not scared to learn new things however I don't know if having so many different languages and tech stacks will make my resume look all over the place, cause i already have bullet points highlighting my work with React, Next.js, React Native, Express, Fastify, .NET, AWS... So I feel like adding completely new things like Python, FastAPI, GCP... Will make me seem all over the place.\n\n2- I would be switching from a startup to another startup, and this time it's not a tech based startup. I think the engineering team consists of like 2 or 3 people only.\n\nHowever it would be a pretty good jump in payment, what do you guys think ?\n\nFor context, I'm 20 and have been at my current job for around 1.5 years.",

No CS degree, and while I can troubleshoot API’s, DNS, HTML/CSS/Javascript, I am nowhere near a true dev role. \n\nWe were a small team to begin with, but after the layoffs I am the only one left outside of the founders. Atleast 1 founder has gone back to a 9-5 to pull in more $$$ for the startup. Outside of support, I’ve taken on the roles of success, onboarding, marketing, demos, design, and the day to day operations. Given that I don’t have anyone I’m managing, is that a hinderance to a Senior Support Engineer/Manager at a bigger company? Are there any other roles outside of support that I can pivot into? I’m very overwhelmed with what steps to even take next since I haven’t interviewed in years. \n\nAny advice/referrals is appreciated. ",
