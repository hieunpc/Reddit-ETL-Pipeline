If you are worried about how a given tool works, you aren't doing data engineering. Engineering is so much more and tools are near the bottom of the list of things you need to worry about. \n\n<rant>The one thing this subreddit does tell me is that the Databricks marketing has earned their yearend bonus. The number of people using the name medallion architecture and the associated colors is off the hook. These design patterns have been used and well documented for over 30 years. Giving them a new name and a Databricks coat of paint doesn't change that. It does however cause confusion because there are people out there that think this is new.</rant>",

I’d love to start a casual weekly call where we can talk data engineering, swap stories, and learn from each other.\n\nOver time, if there’s interest, this could turn into things like a textbook or whitepaper club, light presentations, or deeper dives into topics people care about. Totally flexible.\n\n**What you’d get out of it:**\n\n* Hearing how other people think about DE problems\n* Learning stuff that doesn’t always come up in day-to-day work\n* Getting exposure to different career paths and ways of working\n* Practical ideas you can actually use\n\n**Some topics I’m especially interested in:**\n\n* Performance and scaling\n* Systems thinking\n* Data platforms and infrastructure\n* FinOps / cost awareness\n* Reliability, observability, and ops\n* Architecture tradeoffs (build vs buy, etc.)\n* How data stacks evolve as companies grow\n\nThis is mainly for early-to-mid career folks, but anyone curious is welcome. If this sounds interesting, reach out and we’ll see what happens.\n\n  \n",

I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.\n\nUnfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.\n\nI was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources.  \n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\n\n\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I was reading through Kimballs warehouse toolkit, and it gives this beautiful picture of a central collection of conformed dimensional models that represent the company as a whole. I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.\n\nI'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like \"how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?\" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. \n\nThe idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.\n\nOn the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.\n\nIn the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a  healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.\n\nThere seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",

At some point , my boss decides he wants to “centralize the company data” and hires some agency out of the blue.

So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again,  (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of) ",

Our basic use case include bringing data from rdbms sources, APIs etc. batch processing, job scheduling and reporting.\n\nCurrently we use sqoop, spark3, impala hive Cognos and tableau to meet our needs. For scheduling we use AutoSys.\n\nWe are planning to have Databricks with GCP.\n\nThanks again for every brilliant minds here. ",

Along with CV, I think the issue is also depth, not exposure. I have exposure to other tools through my job, but to go in-depth, most online resources (YouTube, Coursera, etc.) I found are very high-level.

Build was tested on linux (amd), macOS (arm) and windows.\n\nI though that maybe some of my fellow data engineering redditors might be interested in the library although it is quite niche project.\n\nSo if anyone is interested check the Gituhub repo : [https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet](https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet)\n\nI look forwarding your feedback for features suggestions, integration questions and code critics 🙂\n\nHave a nice day!

        "author": "wei5924",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,\n\nI am building a databricks notebook that joins roughly 6 tables into a main table. Some joins require some of the main table, whilst other joins will use the whole main table. Each join table has a few keys.\n\nMy question is what is the best architecture to perform the join without having an out of memory / stack overflow error?\n\n  \nCurrently I have written a linear script which sequentially goes through each table and does the join. This is slow and confusing to look at. As such other developers cannot make sense of the code (despite me adding comments) and im the main point of contact.\n\n\n\nSolutions tried:\n\n* I had tried to write a function that performs multiple joins using a while loop. However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error. Sometimes i get a driver error and the whole notebook fails to continue to run.\n* I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted. As such we had to roll back to the linear way i wrote before.\n* I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact.\n* Caching after some joins but problem persists.\n\n  \n\n\nOther information:\n\n* Small tables - row count roughly 50-100\n* main table - as of now row count roughly 50k\n* join type - left join on main table \n* All tables are already cleansed and are delta tables \n* Technologies: databricks, pyspark, ADF, ADLS\n\n\n\nSide question: I used to be a software engineer and now moved to being a data engineer. Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without? in terms of time complexity and clean code writing? My assumption is the former but after a few months of writing pyspark code i believe the correct answer is the latter? Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?\n\n",

Heavy upfront work but then light maintenance every month.\n\nHowever, I am struggling to advertise myself and my skills to get started. I think this is more intense than your average fiverr posting, and I created an upwork account but can't seem to get traction. I have reached out to friends and family but no one around my is in a situation to need this type of work, or anywhere close to being the decision makers.\n\nAny advice, or things to read, or communities to join would be greatly apricated!\n\nEdit: I am trying to build my own freelance or small data consulting service.  I still have my full time job as a leader in the data space at my company but want to do more on my own and one day break out on my own.  But finding the first 1-2 clients is a challenge",

The proyect I'm developing is a data architecture applying medallion. So I created 3 docker containers:\n1. Pyspark and Jupiter lab\n2. MinIo (I don't want to pay for Amazon s3 storage so I'm simulating it using minio. I have 3 buckets landing, bronze and silver)\n3. Apache airflow (its monitoring the landing bucket and when a file is uploaded it calls diferent scripts if the name of the script starts with tc it start the pipeline for data catalog file  if it start with atus it calls the pipeline for processing the data files with the accidents records any other name just move it to bronze bucket.\nOn the silver quality I implemented a delta lake 4 dimension tables and 1 for the facts.\nMy question is how con I improve this proyect so it stand out more for the recruiter and also that I can learn more. I know that maybe I did overkill for som parts of the proyect but I did it to practice what I'm learning. I was thinking to develop an api that reads the csvs and create a Kafka container so I can learn about streaming processing. \nThank for any advice ",

Please be aware of:\n\n* merge() is not implemented in this version\n* DuckDB doesn’t allow mixed types like Pandas does, so you may need to clean messy CSVs before using them.\n* Currently optimized for reading and analyzing. Writing back to Parquet/CSV works by converting to Pandas first.\n* Advanced methods (rolling, ewm) will fall back to standard Pandas, which may defeat the memory savings. Stick to groupby, filter, and agg for now.\n\nAny feedback on handling more complex operations like merge() efficiently without breaking the lazy evaluation chain is appreciated.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* PyPI: pip install pdboost\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost](https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost)\n\nIt’s still early (v0.1.2), so I’m open to suggestions.

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.\n\n\n\nThe idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.\n\n\n\nYou can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.\n\n\n\nI hope some of y'all find it useful.\n\n\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",

I'm looking to make a move over the the DE side of things and wondered if I had a place long-term with my experience, but without a degree.\n\nI got into the data team from an administrative role and had/still have no degree, just a lacklustre secondary school education (high school level). The department is a mix of those with stellar academic records, random degrees and people like me who fell into the work - I've found a similar split at most organisations and businesses I've worked with or met at conferences.\n\nI've experience working with a ton of different systems and a variety of stakeholders both within the organisation and externally such as software companies, central government departments etc. to tackle complex operational problems.\n\nI started my career using basic SQL, Excel and VBA. Currently I'm using advanced SQL (including performance tuning, building pipelines and data warehousing), Python (mainly pandas, numpy and matplotlib), Power BI (with a great understanding of DAX and TMDL, plus I do some platform administration). I've a sound(ish) knowledge of stats, though we don't really using anything too advanced. I'm considered mid-senior atm and paid £47k, which is quite typical for the public sector in the UK \\*Americans recoil in horror\\*.\n\nOutside work I mess around with my home server to expand my wider IT knowledge and explore some more modern tooling and cloud platforms.\n\n\n\nMy organisation are moving to Azure next year and I'm lining myself up for a DE role (there's no bump in pay) as that's where my interest lies.\n\nWould it be worth me getting a degree at this point in my career? My employer has offered to put me through a degree apprenticeship (not sure how familiar people are with those outside the UK), with the Open University, a distance-learning university.\n\nRecently, I applied for ten BI/DA jobs in other companies (just to test my marketability) and was invited to eight, so I'm not worried at all about the immediate term in my current area of work, I'm just concerned about whether I'd have a place in DE over the long term?

Most of my work so far has been very technical: pipeline development, data handling, tool testing, Docker/Apptainer images, Git, etc. I’ve rarely worked on actual data analysis.\n\nI recently changed jobs (about 6 months ago), and this experience made me realize a few things: I don’t really enjoy coding, working on other people’s code often gives me anxiety, and I’d like to move toward a related role that offers better compensation than what’s usually available in public research.\n\nGiven my background, I’ve been considering a transition into data engineering. I’ve started learning Airflow, ETL/ELT concepts, Spark, and the basics of GCP and AWS. However, I feel like I’m missing structure, mentorship, and especially a community to help me stay motivated and make real progress.\n\nAt the moment, I don’t enjoy my current tasks, I don’t feel like I’m developing professionally, and the salary isn’t motivating. I still have about 15 months left on my contract, and I’d really like to use this time wisely to prepare a solid transition.\n\nIf you have experience with a similar transition, or if you work in data engineering, I’d love to hear:\n\n* how you made the switch (or would recommend making it),\n* what helped you most in terms of learning and positioning yourself,\n* how to connect with people already working in the field.\n\nThanks a lot in advance for your insights.",

        "author": "iamspoilt",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "First of all, Happy New Year 2026!\n\nHi folks, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and a fellow Data Infrastructure Engineer. I have been working as a Software Engineer for 8+ years now and have been entirely focused on the data infra side of the world for the past few years with a fair share of working with Apache Spark.\n\nI have realized that it's very difficult to manage Spark infrastructure on your own using commodity cloud hardware and Kubernetes, and this is one of the prime reasons why users opt-in for offerings such as EMR and Databricks. However, I have personally seen that as companies grow larger, these offerings start to show their limitations (at least in the case of EMR from my personal experience). Besides that, these offerings also charge a premium on compute on top of the charges for using commodity cloud.\n\nFor a quick comparison, here is the difference in pricing for AWS c8g.24xlarge and c8g.48xlarge instances if you were to run these for an entire month, showing the 25% EMR premium on your total EC2 bill.\n\n**Table 1: Single Instance (730 hours)**\n\n|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|c8g.24xlarge|$2,794.79|$3,493.49|$698.70|\n|c8g.48xlarge|$5,589.58|$6,986.98|$1,397.40|\n\n**Table 2: 50 Instances (730 hours)**\n\n|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|c8g.24xlarge|$139,740|$174,675|$34,935|\n|c8g.48xlarge|$279,479|$349,349|$69,870|\n\nIn light of this, I started working on a platform that allows you to orchestrate Spark clusters on Kubernetes in your own AWS account - with no additional compute markup. The platform is geared towards Data Engineers (Product Data Engineers as I like to call them) who mainly write and maintain ETL and ELT workloads, not manage the Data Infrastcructure needed to support these workloads.\n\nToday, I am finally able to share what I have been building: [Orchestera Platform](https://orchestera.com/)\n\nHere are some of the salient features of the platform:\n\n* Setup and teardown an entire EKS-based Spark cluster in your own AWS account with absolutely no upfront expertise required in Kubernetes\n* Cluster is configured for reactive auto-scaling based on your workloads:\n   * Automatically scales up to the right number of EC2 instances based on your Spark driver and executor configuration\n   * Automatically scales down to 0 once your workloads complete\n* Simple integration with AWS services such as S3 and RDS\n* Simple integration with Iceberg tables on S3. AWS Glue Catalog integration coming soon.\n* Full support for iterating on Spark pipelines using Jupyter notebooks\n* Currently only supports AWS Cloud and the us-east-1 region\n\nYou can see some demo examples here:\n\n* [Developing Spark applications using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/)\n* [Using Iceberg tables with Spark](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/iceberg-hello-world/)\n\nIf you are an AWS user or considering using it for Spark, I would request you to please try this out. No credit card required for using the personal workspace. Also offering 6 months of premium access for serious users in this subreddit.\n\nAlso very interested to hear from this community and looking for some early feedback.\n\nI have aslo written [documentation](https://docs.orchestera.com/) (under active development) to give users a head start in setting up their accounts, orchesterating a new Spark cluster and writing data pipelines.\n\nIf you want to chat more about this new platform, please come and join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9TXybZcd).",

But this is slow compared to when I work on pure python projects in PyCharm, which take full advantage of claude code.\n\nI'm using git folders and my code is checked into source control, but I'm not using an IDE when developing in databricks. I just use the web UI.\n\nWhat I would like to set up is:\n\n\\- claude knows all steps in my pipeline (maybe by exporting the pipeline using 'view as code')  \n\\- claude can see the latest files and understand the types involved, etc  \n\\- bonus: claude can access some tables in read only mode\n\nMy hunch is I need to use VS code with the databricks extension so that I'm in a legit IDE rather than the Databricks UI. But I'm not used to testing notebooks, etc with that setup. Also, to keep the pipeline definition up to date I will need to export that manually and add it to source control when there are changes.

Forgetting syntax, confused about how to use a given framework, not knowing why something works even when I'm able to get it working, and constantly needing help just to move forward, it felt like this every step for a long time.\n\n\n\nRecently, something finally clicked. I can sit down, think through a problem, and actually build the solution without feeling like I’m fighting the language or tools the entire time. One of the biggest changes is how I use documentation now. What used to feel unreadable suddenly makes sense, and I almost always prefer reading docs over asking GPT because it’s faster and clearer.\n\n\n\nI’m still very much a beginner at the end of the day, but programming is finally fun.  I can move past small toy programs that are under a thousand lines of code and start building things that feel real and challenging in a good way. Posting this for anyone who’s been stuck wondering if things ever start to feel natural, they do, even if it takes longer than you expect.",

A year starts with day 1 until it hits day 365; a book starts with chapter 1 until it reaches the ending chapter. Almost everything has a sequence. Programming does not have that; you have to have the ability to learn things out of sequence. You can't wait until you have the entirety of JS learned before you move on to something like React. Heck, you will probably never get there in a lifetime, as there will be new additions to the language and deprecations. I have a degree, I have been self-studying, and I am still unemployed. When I start learning a library, it is hard to sort of know what to pick up and then move on and hit the library only when you need it again.\n\nThis is a barrier, or at least one of the barriers that makes programming a high-paying job. We need to have a different kind of approach to learning to code. I have been trying to adapt my brain's wiring so that I only learn what is important and move on. But from my question to senior programmers here, how do I overcome this? I am 29 years old; for reference, I have never been employed.",

Want to learn programming for game dev. Don't care that they're not entry level languages. \n\n\nOkay, I know, I know, neither of these are beginner friendly at all but honestly I dont care. Im just wanting to learn game dev and I want something I can use for logic that needs to be quick and efficient, like terrain gen, etc. I have some experience in the really basic shit like Processing, Scratch, and Java by taking comp sci in HS but I was an awful student. I also took a 4 week summer camp between my freshman and sophomore years of HS that was for learning simple game dev through C++ but it was REALLY basic and I just made a short 10-minute text adventure. That being said, I have learned about Rust recently and everyone fuckn loves it and I've seen people making some really interesting things with it using its extension for Godot. \n\nFrom my ignorant perspective, C++ seems like a good option to understand more what's going on under the hood, having to manually manage memory and shit, and also has much faster compile times (which ive already experienced when compiling Rust demos in Godot Jesus christ), as well as possibly better job prosepects and translates easier to other languages as I understand Rust is a fairly unique language. With Rust it seems like it's more annoying because you HAVE to handle your memory errors SOMEHOW because the borrow checker thing just doesn't let you fuck that up, as well as maybe being more difficult to understand because of its owner-borrower system or whatever its called, but the whole thing makes sense to me conceptually, not sure how easily I'll be able to implement it tho. (But it seems like it would at least be easier to debug, no?) I've watched videos on both and I haven't been able to find a great answer as to whether one would be better for a beginner. \n\nAgain, I dont care to learn something more basic, I'm already going to be using plenty of GDScript so I will be learning a simpler language anyway so anything I just simply can't do at my skill level at the moment I'll just fall back on that till I sharpen up with Rust/C++.\n\nAppreciate any advice or insight into this question and sorry for the long ass post.

I always relied on AI to deliver something, didn’t know how to start a project from scratch. \n\nSo, in November I decided to “start again”. Focusing on getting the basics well and enjoying coding again. And it has been a quite fun journey! In fact, I’m liking studying and trying some stuff. I got a membership on Frontend Masters (mostly because of the algorithm course) and gifted myself with some books for Christmas. \n\nI’m relearning (or learning in fact) Javascript, algorithms, some cloud computing (aiming for AWS SAA-CO3) and eager to learn DBs and Golang. \n\nChallenges are getting fun again, struggling is getting fun again and, more importantly, learning is getting fun again. \n\nI’m still doing some gigs (mostly because I really need the money), but I’m planning on diving deep in interviews at June.

        "content": "Yes, I know, Assembly isn't used much these days outside of a few cases and reverse engineering, probably easier to learn C or Python, etc. But I want to learn ASM because I've always been intrigued and for some of the stuff I want to do, I need to know how to read it.\n\n**Edit:** My goals are to be able to read assembly so I can disassemble, reverse engineer, or edit some games. The Playstation 1 and 2 use MIPS architecture, the Gameboy and GBC use z80, and most modern applications and games use x86-64, which is why I'm torn between the three.\n\nI don't have a computer science background and my career isn't anything close to CS unless you count working in excel. I also don't anticipate switching careers. This is purely something I want to do in mh free tkme. I understand basic computer concepts but don't know how to code or program. I've made a few game mods, I can look at code and change a thing or two, and I can locate some stuff in memory to freeze or edit via emulator or CE, but that's probably as close as I've gotten. \n\nAnyways, I am wondering if there are any great online courses or books I can follow that are good for people with little to no CS background? I'm torn between x86, MIPS, or z80, but leaning towards x86 since it seems more comprehensive and I would think going from CISC to RISC would be easier than the inverse. \n\nI rented the book *Assembly X64 Programming in Easy Steps: Modern Coding for MASM, SSE and AVX* from my library since that was all they had. Not sure how that compares to some of the other resources out there. ",

        "author": "BrosVGK",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "so for context, when i was in first/second year of middle school, i meet some people who were good with pc's / know how to program. I talked to them a bit about it and it managed to get me into programming and learning about pc's and on and off for a few years, i would try and learn C# because i was curious to try and learn how to make a game, and i was into pc's because i wanted to know how pc's work (hardware wise, not software). Fastforward to graduating high school recently (i graduated in june). When it was time for me to pick my future career i decided i wanted to go to computer science (a bit off topic but i was also into music, specifically playing the guitar and wanting to learn about music theory, and i like to learn to draw) and even though i was into those other hobbies, i picked computer science because i thought i could make some decent money from it, however thats when things went down the hill. When i first started, things weren't too hard, i managed to understand some early stuff. I was learning C++ and general computer theory, and when it came to computer theory i was good at it, because in my mind it was easy. Then when November / December came, everything just didnt make sense. I couldnt even pay attention in classes because i just couldnt understand it and when i try and learning it on my own i still couldnt get it. It got pretty bad because i would cry many nights and being constantly stressed at me not understanding the subjects and that i didnt want to fail my classes. Eventually my school finally had christmas holidays and im still having them as im writing this, but yesterday or before yesterday (it was on jan 2) i got an email from two of my professors (one for programming and another for computer theory) where the computer theory would make a test on things that we learnt for a bit before christmas holidays and from my programming teacher where we would get a midterm on stuff we did from november / december. At that point i just started breaking down because i just dont want to go through that awful experience anymore of being constantly worried and stressed, feeling as if i was on the edge, and one screw up would ruin everything for me. So i guess what im asking is should i even continue my course or should i pick a different career for my life (i was thinking of maritime studies because my dad is an expert in maritime since he worked for 40+ years in it) at this point, im lost and i dont know what to do with my future.\n\nthanks for anyone who read the whole essay of a post. But to give a TLDR version:  \n  \nwas into computers since middle school, graduated high school, got into compsci for my career, in the beginning understood the material but later i didnt get it, started having panic attacks and stress, dont know what to do.",

        "content": "Just wrapped up a month-long project using C++, SDL2, and ImGui. I set out to make a simple app that has the very basic features of Lightroom, but I quickly realized that architecture is a completely different beast than programming the logic. It only does the bare minimum of what I originally planned, and I’m struggling with the feeling that I should have pushed harder. But at this point, the passion for this specific codebase is gone, and I just want to move on.\n\nI learned a lot about the build process and package management, but the codebase ended up as a bit of a spaghetti mess. I’m at the point where I’ve learned enough to see exactly why my current design is flawed, which makes it feel impossible to keep working on it without a 100% rewrite.\n\nI underestimated how hard it would be to design the software. It took me a while to actually set all the dependencies up. Then came writing the pipeline for it to actually be usable. But with each thing I added, I realized another thing had to be fixed or improved. By the time I had implemented the basic features, I'd gone through countless rewrites. Despite my efforts to keep it as decoupled as I could, the codebase was never as clean as I had wanted it to be.\n\nI don't exactly regret making this project since I learned a lot from it. However, I feel like I'd feel a lot better right now if I put that effort elsewhere, or if I actually completed all the features I'd planned on implementing. But I just can't bring myself to work on it any longer. If I want it to be well made then I would have to rewrite the whole thing. It also sucks because as shallow of a reason as it may be, I was looking forward to having something to show off on my GitHub :(",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I am trying to learn programming and have a question about frameworks/programming languages.\n\nI have made a simple HTTP-based API in both python (using fastAPI) and java (using Spring Boot).\n\nIn fastAPI framework, I notice that I mainly write functions which are either passed in as parameters into other functions or called by other functions. To me, this makes sense from my perspective, or at least feels intuitive. I can literally see the programming \"primitives\" I wrote interacting with each other in my source code. \n\nFor example, I build an endpoint like\n\n```python\n@APIRouter().get(\"/blah\")\ndef get_blah():\n  return \"blah\"\n```\n\nthen I must tell my main FastAPI() object about the routes using `.include_router()`. Nice. I can also somewhat imagine whats going on in my head, like the `APIRouter` object has some record of all the routes I defined via the decorator and that object is being passed to my `FastAPI()` object.\n\nSpring Boot, on the other hand, I notice that I create classes, and some of these classes are never instantiated! At least they're certainly never called in my source code. I can run my application with Gradle and the class I created that was never instantiated actually did something. \n\nE.g., I make this class\n\n```java\n@RestController\npublic class TextController {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/texts\")\n    public List<Text> getTexts() {\n        return service.getTexts();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nbut I never wrote \"TextController blah = new TextController()\" anywhere?\n\nLike, I feel more in control of my FastAPI application than I do with my Spring application? Do others feel like this? Do I just chalk up the framework differences to \"thats how the authors who designed each framework intended it to be\"?",

I was doing assignments but completed till 7th module only. I also bought strivers tuf+ in 2024 aug then i was solving questions from there but i was not doing good in dsa i was looking for something thne i bought algozenith for dsa i practiced with that in 2024 and also i got an internship my friend's friend startup in feb 2025, so i was working in fastapi and react but i didn't build any project in react and was new to python. So i used ai to write code it was going like this the comapany was trying to build a project but not stressful environment. Thne in Aug 2025 i joined another company they were paying good so i joined for money here the tech stack was php i knew nothing about it. But again i used ai to write code by this time i knew a bit about backend. Because in may or june i started a nodejs course on udemy by Joseph Heidari. I worked in the php company in aug, sep and oct was month i didn't work the boss was on vacation and in nov i worked. I told him i won't be able to continue it's hectic for me i am not able to work i need time for learning.\n\nSo my situation is i can solve easy leetcode i am not practicing dsa since july 2025\n\nI can write backend apis,\n\nI also learned react this year from scrimmba but didn't build much.\n\nThis year i also build some projects like live log analyzer, file organizer, expense tracker both frontend and backend of these projects. Right now i understand that i should not use ai to make my project no matter how much i struggle.\n\nBut now my question is when i go to twitter i see people with 2/3 years into coding are building cool websites with lot of animation, building thier own saas projects, some have good hold on dsa. I see myself i struggle basic ui, I struggle in backend i don't know if my website is secured, is it optimized or not, i don't know why are we writing certain things in the header, why should i send data in json etc etc.\n\nI know my mistakes, I am thinking i don't know anything, i am not intelligent, i am not able to find motivation.

        "content": "Hello! So I've recently been working on a simple test game with Monogame. After some trial and error, I made a collision detection system based on several parts:\n\n\\> under Scenes class, I load textures for obstacles in each scene and create a dictionary to map each scene to the obstacle textures to be drawn. Also created a dictionary to map each texture to its position.\n\n\\> in my Map class, I create a 2d array of zeros to represent terrain; then, a method loops thru the dictionary from Scenes, to place 1's on all array elements corresponding to the texture's width&height on the grid.\n\n\\> In the map class, I create methods like this for each direction, which are called in the main Update() method later when the arrow key is detected: (EDIT: position and tex1 in CanMoveL() refer to the player)\n\n            public bool CanMoveL(Vector2 position, Texture2D tex1)\n            {\n                bool check = true;\n    \n    \n                if (position.X == Xbounds[0]+10)\n                {\n                    return false;\n                }\n    \n    \n                for (int y = 5; y < tex1.Height-1; y++){\n    \n    \n                    if (terrain[(int)position.Y+y, (int)position.X +1]==2)\n                    {\n                        check = false;\n                    }\n                }\n                return check;\n    \n    \n            }\n\nNote: I know there are built-in detection methods in monogame, but I'm not really interested in refactoring in the best way possible, I just had the objective of figuring it out from scratch in a way that makes sense. But, if you have some ideas on how you would have approached it/whether my method is way too inefficient, I'd be happy to hear them!\n\nMainly, I'm concerned about the loop that looks through each \"row\" of my character's height, seeing if it hits the obstacle when projected. I was thinking of Numpy style slicing but I couldn't figure that out in c#?\n\nSecondly, It seems like this method is kinda fragmented, with the scene textures loaded in Scenes, but the actual mapping of them in Maps. Should both those be in Maps?\n\nThanks!",

That makes me wonder whether SvelteKit is mainly intended for cases where you don’t already have a backend.\n\nIf I already rely entirely on a separate Go backend for APIs and business logic, would plain Svelte with TypeScript be sufficient, or does SvelteKit still provide benefits in this scenario? I’m trying to understand when it makes sense to use Svelte versus SvelteKit, especially for someone coming from a more traditional frontend-backend separation.

No cloud costs.  \n  \n  \n\\## How it works  \n  \n1. Run \\`./play.sh\\` - game starts, breaks something in k8s  \n2. Open another terminal and debug with kubectl  \n3. Fix it however you want  \n4. Run \\`validate\\` in the game to check  \n5. Get a debrief explaining what was wrong and why  \n  \n  \nThe UI is retro terminal style (kinda like those old NES games). Has hints, progress tracking, and step-by-step guides if you get stuck.  \n  \n  \n\\## What you'll debug  \n  \n\\- World 1: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, pending pods, labels, ports  \n\\- World 2: Deployments, HPA, liveness/readiness probes, rollbacks  \n\\- World 3: Services, DNS, Ingress, NetworkPolicies  \n\\- World 4: PVs, PVCs, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets    \n\\- World 5: RBAC, SecurityContext, node scheduling, resource quotas  \n  \n\\## Install  \n  \n  \n\\`\\`\\`bash  \ngit clone [https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git](https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git)  \ncd k8squest  \n./install.sh  \n./play.sh  \n\\`\\`\\`  \n  \nNeeds: Docker Desktop, kubectl, kind, python3  \n  \n  \n\\## Why I made this  \n  \nReading docs didn't really stick for me. I learn better when things are broken and I have to figure out why. This simulates the actual debugging you do in prod, but locally and with hints.  \n  \nAlso has safety guards so you can't accidentally nuke your whole cluster.  \n  \nFeedback welcome. If it helps you learn, cool. If you find bugs or have ideas for more levels, let me know.  \n  \nGitHub: [https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest](https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest)",

I am used to creating new objects in OOP programming. Then after consulting with AI I realized that React Native is probably the best choice of framework for mobile android development. In around mid December I decided that in 2026 I am going to start learning it. However I found that even the configuration (or setup) for React Native is super complicated. For example the JDK has to be between 17 and 20, and installing something on Android Studio SDK manager. Fortunately I sorted it all out with the help of AI's assistance  \nin a few hours struggling attempts and managed to install React Native apps on my phone. React Native's code structure reminds of HTML at first glance. Hopefully in this year I will be able to independently write code for android apps through React Native.

Even in large code bases, my co-workers and I have fixed complex bugs without manually writing a single line of code. The LLMs understood parts of the project we've never seen before and were able to fix the issues with more holistic approaches.\n\nMuch less skill is needed for solving problems that used to involve years of study. I'm worried the main three areas (coding, domain knowledge, system design) that made skilled workers more desirable will no longer matter. Now, workers can simply add the domain knowledge to the context window, use well-established system designs, and generate code adhering to standards with existing prompt templates.\n\nThe knowledge barrier once attracted me to this profession because of the differentation from low skilled labor. I'm considering switching into a different career with more human judgement involved but it feels pointless. Now anyone, including unskilled workers, can automate their tasks well enough without manual coding.\n\nI would like guidance on what paths I should considering switching into, or topics of upskilling, if any, that aren't easily replaceable by unskilled laborers overseeing the work of AI.",

        "content": "I'll try to be concise and explain what I mean by \"hiding\" as best I can - bear with me folks.\n\nI remember starting my career in the summer of 2024, with hopes that I'll progress into senior after 2-3 years, and maybe go to a different company that aligned more towards my interests.\n\nI knew AI was a \"threat\" in terms of reducing the number of engineers (do more with less - the mantra of corporate America, etc.), but didn't really take it seriously.\n\nFlash forward 18 months later, and I am taking it much more seriously. I don't think AI will eliminate software engineering, but I do think it'll change the number of people who need to it to achieve very good outcomes. With each iteration and vast amounts of training data, the AI models to get better - and honestly, I'm part of the reason, I have to hold my hands up and say I've used GPT a lot since it came out - it synthesizes anything on Google, SO, documentation, etc. so why not use it to get to the bottom of what I need to know way quicker?\n\nAnd I think this is the general consensus - AI will never do away with software engineering, software will always exist, but it will change who does it, and the number of those people.\n\nMore relevant in 2026 though is offshoring. For better or for worse, I understand the rationale of offshoring labor, particularly junior positions. Companies exist solely to deliver profits to their shareholders, investing a lot of money into an \"unproven\" college graduate is far less appealing than investing that same amount of money into 3-4 new graduates.\n\nSo as offshoring accelerates, and AI becomes better and better, I'm \"hiding\". I do my due diligence at work, and I learn what good software is.\n\nBut no matter how many times I implement a strong observability backbone, no matter how many times I write CDK code and deploy to AWS, no matter how many times I implement authentication middleware, etc. - I have the same feeling that I'm on borrowed time.\n\nI'm \"hiding\" in the sense that there will be a time in the future, how soon, I don't know, but there will be a time when my leadership thinks, \"We don't need him anymore\" because I cost them too much, and my work can be consolidated into an offshore option or a senior engineer that is producing more with AI. It'll be a simple decision for them, and honestly I'll be the first to say that their intention aligns with the purpose of a business in the first place, which is to churn a higher profit.\n\nBut until then, I have no choice but to hide, I can upskill and get as good as I want, and believe me I will try to, but there's going to be an inflection point where I can't hide anymore, and by then who knows what the world will look like.\n\nBut do any other juniors sort of feel this way, this sort of existential dread, but also acknowledgement that that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles? In the meantime, I hope we can both be grateful for having a job at a time so difficult. Take care, my friends :)",

Are there any options which don’t throw away all the work I’ve done?\n\nTLDR: I’d be an ehh candidate in a healthy market, what can I do from here?",

That in-human connection is invaluable when networking. But the trade offs just seem to get larger each year and the difference between living in a tech hub / not seems to lessen too, opportunity wise.\n\nIf we look at the primary reason for moving to a tech hub (I.e. Seattle, SF, NYC) it comes down to:\n\n- more job opportunities\n- ability to grow a larger network\n\nWith the advent of online applications & speaking to recruiters virtually, many roles aren’t relegated to those living in a specific city anymore. There may be some preference from certain companies to choose locally, but that’s about it.\n\nNetworking is a big one, but if you were really dedicated to building a solid network, you could do lots of cold outreach on LinkedIn and attend virtual conferences in the industry. Not saying it would be as effective, but the tradeoff of uprooting your whole life and paying a premium (higher COL) just to network a little more efficiently doesn’t seem to weigh in evenly.\n\nFrom people who have moved for these reasons, curious to hear your opinion.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I work for a FAANG company as a SWE, 3 YOE, got promoted to mid-level 7 months ago and then switched to a chill team. The work is more boring than I expected coming from a fast-paced, cutting-edge team building brand new services leveraging AI agents to now maintaining legacy services written over a decade ago - very simple services but with high scale (millions of transactions per second).\n\nThe path to senior engineer here is slim, maybe even non-existent because we already have one on the team and there isn't any real scope in terms of next-level projects for promo. My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them. The pace is slow and the work is quite mundane and nothing to do with AI - it feels like I'm missing the AI wave. So there's minimal career growth here.\n\nBut apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)\n\nBut yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.\n\nSo I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that. I'm also interested in maybe going to a startup, but perhaps that's best to do once I have 5 YOE and can apply for senior instead of chasing promo here which is quite difficult irrespective of team. I could also try switching internally to a team with better work and better promo prospects but not sure if it's worth giving up all the good things here for career growth - vs. just rest and vest... what would you do in this situation ?  \n",

        "author": "Cheap-Sparrow",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I (31m) am the tech lead of a small \"sub team\". We have 3 different groups reporting to the same manager. This manager is not a software engineer. I work at a FAANG company.\n\nMy coworker (25m) is incredibly toxic. They have had multiple blow ups at others and myself. They won't use jira, they won't make merge requests, and every meeting with them is like walking on eggshells. They are late with all their code and it's very buggy. \n\nIn order to not go through the MR process this coworker created their own repo and pushes directly to main. When we asked them to combine repos they get very agitated. We asked them to start making MRs for review and they flat out refuse and it causes the meetings to become very tense. My manager doesn't understand why merge requests are important and sees no issue with the coworker's behavior. \n\nWe recently hired 2 new senior engineers. Within 1 month, both engineers have had issues with this person. They are both actively involved in the behavioral coaching of this person. One new hire told me \"this guy is the single worst behaved engineer I've ever worked with.\" He expects me, as tech lead, to deal with this situation. I think that's understandable but I have strict instructions to not get involved.\n\nI asked my manager to affirm my position as tech lead so I can get this coworker to make MRs and document their designs. My manager said \"No, if I do that then [coworker] will lose their shit and this is a really delicate situation right now.\"\n\nThis young coworker hates me in particular. Probably because I am in charge? My manager has asked me to stay out of it so he can coach this guy himself. My manager told me \"I've never met someone like this in my entire career. I am completely flummoxed and I have no idea what to do.\"\n\nDuring one very public blow up, my manager was slacking me privately saying \"I'm confused why he's mad\" and \"just drop [this requirement]. You're right but we need him to feel like he's saving face\".\n\nThe approach that we're taking is to let this coworker fail on his own. We aren't supposed to save their code when we find bugs, we aren't supposed to push for improvements. We are supposed to let them fail so they realize they need help. Our project is off track.\n\nOne of the new engineers told me they are having a \"very hard time\" on the team because of this person. I feel a responsibility to respond to that but I have strict instructions to stay out of it. \n\n***\n\nOkay. So here's my question.\n\nI'm being positioned to become the manager of this team. I said No a year ago because this engineer would have been my only report. My manager thinks I have the wrong attitude and \"[I] need to work with [coworker] because we can't just give up on everyone under the age of 30\". I think this person probably needs to be PIPed and let go. At my previous company (also faang) this would have resulted in a pip a long time ago, both for the attitude but also the sheer lack of deliverables.\n\nI can stay on the IC ladder and climb this way, but then a new manager will be hired. This hurts my chances of moving into management later. It also annoys my boss who wants me to just deal with the engineer by coaching instead of a PIP.\n\n* Should I take the manager position and have this person as my report, knowing my hands are tied when dealing with them? Or should I try to stay as an engineer?\n* Do I have an obligation to work with this person, like my boss is telling me? Or is this situation already beyond what is acceptable in the workplace?",

I am working on internal developer tools. For example, this team is instrumenting custom dev container solutions to create remote dev environments. This involves writing shell scripts, understanding daemons / processes. I had a few projects so far, but these have been relatively unrelated and disjointed. For example, I implemented a small improvement to some scripts. I also migrated some CI / CD pipelines from 1 vendor to another. These projects are also always consistently out of my experience. I don't know anything currently about working with daemons / processes and usually I don't have a point of contact to talk to.

I wear a lot of hats, presales, solution design, implementation, and work independently most of the time. I am also fully remote, which is a big part of why this setup works for me.\n\nI have had multiple opportunities to move into more “senior” or leadership roles but have consistently declined. In practice, those roles usually mean hybrid work, more meetings, more politics, less hands-on delivery, and often more exposure during layoffs. I have seen plenty of people make that move and then get cut early during restructures.\n\nThe downside is burnout. Covering multiple phases and constant context switching takes a toll, especially as I get older. I am trying to think about sustainability and career longevity rather than titles.\n\nFor those who have been at this a long time:\n\nDid switching roles actually reduce burnout?\n\nDid you feel more exposed during layoffs?\n\nHow did you make your value visible when outcomes were less tangible?\n\nLooking for real-world experiences, not theory.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm 23 years old, and I've had several part time/contract jobs for indie game development studios, and a wealth of programming projects. However, I have never had a full-time job. Unfortunately, my current part-time job has had struggles with finances, leaving me unable to afford paying bills for myself and my long-distance girlfriend without posting on social media begging for donations, even with both of us having part-time jobs. I've been searching for a job as a programmer for 3 years now, with no luck due to the major crash in both the game development and general software scene.\n\nI don't have a degree, but I've taught myself programming over the last 5 years and have what I'd consider pretty decent knowledge for a junior. I have 5 years of C++ and Python and 4 years of C#. I'm also quite experienced in Unreal Engine, and to a lesser degree, Unity. Additionally, I am versed in x86 and ARM assembly, as I spend a lot of time reverse engineering binaries in IDA Pro/Ghidra/Binary Ninja. \n\nHowever, I'm struggling to find jobs that meet my relatively lower-level language experience while hiring a junior dev in terms of workplace experience. Game development and malware analysis are probably where I'd do best, and I could definitely handle general software engineering, but the game development scene is obviously fucked, malware analysis jobs are extremely hard to come by, and my skillset doesn't include web development yet. I'd be fine with learning on the job, but it seems that these days, job postings require experience in almost every aspect to begin with.\n\nI'm aware that contacts are usually the best way to get a job in this industry, but all of my job-related contacts exist in the game dev sphere, and no one's hiring for roles that I'd meet in that scene at the moment. I don't have much connection to people in general software engineering or malware analysis. I cannot afford to travel even close distance due to lack of funds and physical disability, so I don't have much of a chance going to in-person developer meetups. My parents seem content to keep me stuck inside their house while having me pay rent monthly, so I cannot rely on them for funding or travel.\n\nThis has obviously been taking a severe toll on my mental state, as I'm struggling to find work that pays me enough to allow me and my girlfriend to survive, let alone move in together. I'm pretty desperate for a job that pays half-decently, and due to my disability I don't think I could physically handle a minimum wage job, never mind the fact that it probably wouldn't be able to pay the bills where I live, around the Seattle area. I'm already barely earning more than minimum wage for where I live to begin with.\n\nIf anyone is curious, [here's my GitHub page.](http://github.com/WistfulHopes)",

I plan to take 2-3 years to finish the program then apply for new jobs once complete. \n\nI’m having some second thoughts about whether my time would be better spent working on personal projects relevant to my desired position instead of the degree. I have a pretty clear target area that I know I could work on side projects for, but I don’t know if this will be taken less seriously than certified courses. For anyone who has been in a similar position as me, do you think the degree was key for boosting your career? \n\n(I’m not worried about time commitment differences as I would be working the same in either case. The cost of the program is also not a factor.)\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

I generally love my job—I own features from backend to frontend, write my own Terraform, manage GCP resources, the works. It feels fulfilling to ship stuff that people actually see and use.\n\nThe problem I’m experiencing is trying to get an internal promotion. I’ve been acting at a Senior level for a while. My manager pushed for my promotion last year, but the Director blocked it because they haven’t heard enough about me to deserve it and my manager cited \"people outside the team don't know me\" (I'm fully remote and introverted, don’t get a lot of opportunities to network). Now my manager wants me to rotate to another team for a quarter just to \"prove visibility\" before they consider the promo again. It feels like moving goalposts and political hoop-jumping, and hasn't been sitting well with me since.\n\nRecently, a recruiter reached out to me about a job at a late stage health tech startup, I went through the whole interview process not expecting to get it, but I did receive an offer. I negotiated it up and signed, but now I’m having intense buyer's remorse.\n\n* **Positives:** Senior title, good pay bump. Marketable tech stack.\n* **Negatives:** The work sounds like it could be pretty dry, mostly data processing and generating reports. No Greenfield development and I’d be working in a monorepo. I’m worried I’ll lose that spark I get from building new features for the website.\n* **Some weirdness:** I’d be reporting to a “manager” who is also an IC on the team. He’s never managed before and is new to interviewing. I’m worried he won’t have the clout to advocate for me or help me grow.\n\nHas anyone made a jump like this? Is reporting to a fellow IC on my team a massive red flag?\n\nI’m afraid I’m leaving a job I enjoy (mostly) for a place where I’ll be bored and stuck, just for money and to chase a title my current company is gatekeeping.",

        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm 30, from Portugal, did a cs licence and master's and started working last year in a big 4, so I only have 1 year of experience doing data engineering. My goal has always been to be a versatile software engineer, I've always wanted to work with data, cloud, machine learning, devops (later in my career), qa and so on. But lately, my mind has been plagued with insecurities and I feel worried about my future. I'll try to provide as much context as possible.\n\nFor starters, I have no idea where AI will take us and I'm starting to feel dependant on it after going through 4+ years without using it in college. The fun part of this field, for me, has always been to think and develop a solution to a problem, but I'm not a fast learner or fast thinker, and by the time I think of something, Copilot is giving me a much better answer in less than a minute. I don't know when and where to draw the line, when do I start to think \"Maybe I'm using too much AI now\" or \"I'm an engineer, I shouldn't be asking AI to help me solve this\"?\n\nSecond, I feel like this field is starting to become a bit of everything, everywhere, all at once. There's constantly a new tech or stack to learn, then there's AI that you either embrace or refuse (with no clear winner here), then you also have to learn stuff from other subfields because they lay off people and you have to do the job of two, and the list goes on. I get home tired from +8h of work, I don't want to look at a screen and think \"Oh let's build a fun project or learn a new stack!\". I do try to get as much cloud certificates (aws, gc etc) as possible, since our company provides us the vouchers, but that's as far as I can motivate me to go.\n\nThen, I also feel like I'm trapped in this job because it's a project lottery and the market isn't looking fun for juniors. I'm working on building agents for our company and while this feels very up to date, I'm afraid it's only another hype that will fade with time and not get much use in the future. Somehow, due to the fact that I'm not coding much, I feel like I'll unlearn everything I've worked on for the past few years (and I did forget most of the stuff from college already) and then I won't have the required skills for better jobs in the future.\n\nI also really dislike the country I live in because of our extremely high rent prices and very low salaries (a 1bedroom apt is 50% of my salary right now). This makes me want to move to another country, but I don't know if it might be a good fit, if the market is also terrible there or if I even have a shot with all the competition.\n\nBottom line of all of this is: **I never know if what I'm doing will help me grow and prepare me for a better future, and I don't know what's the right path to follow because I'm in constant doubt and uncertainty. I can't get motivated to work because I don't know if what I'm doing is meaningful to my future and I can't focus on one thing at a time.**\n\nHave any of you felt like this or have any advice to help me address this?\n\n",

Like at a certain point in a problem, no one knows why it is happening or how to solve it and you end up just trying random things in prod? I'm a Sr Software Backend Engineer and I'm leading this one project. I have a thread pool that in production one of the queues randomly filled up and caused the rest endpoints to timeout. Why? No idea. How do I find out? No idea? It feels like our distributed system is so complex that no one knows. We had to severely limit the size of our thread pools because that is how the database is supposed to work most effectively. But if the thread pool queue is filling up what am I supposed to do? I don't see the stress on the database, but there are some errors that we weren't printing out that we are working on surfacing.   \n Then I go to try to talk to other seniors about it or people above me and they kinda give me advice but in the end its me stuck looking through logs and talking to AI about what could possibly happen.   \nI feel like our whole product and codebase is so confusing that no one really knows how to solve this problems. But since I'm the lead on this project, I have to figure it out. I wake up with so much anxiety about this project and just getting out of it. I wish I had someone to come help me and just tell me whats wrong, but I don't know. I have to lead a presentation on this soon and it just feels like I wanna give up. I'm not sure how to answer these questions.  \nI need to get off of this project and maybe just distributed systems in general? I feel like I'm doomed to feel anxious about my projects. How do I get off of leading this sinking ship of a project? Is the only way to leave the company?",

I have no internships. The only CS-related experience on my resume is a couple semesters of frontend-focused undergrad research and a software position for a satellite lab at my school, where I haven't yet written a single line of code. My projects are mostly school projects, and nothing that would stand out too much. I do have several years of non-tech job experience, but I'm not sure how impressive that looks to recruiters.\n\nI've worked with most popular programming languages in some capacity (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, etc), but I haven't mastered any. I've also not done any Leetcode practice, so I wouldn't feel confident answering hard interview questions yet.\n\nAs a freshman majoring in computer science, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. Even though I was following along with the coursework, I always felt that I was a bit behind my peers in terms of internships, projects, and real-world CS skills. It's taken me too long to recognize how hard it is to find a job as a new grad, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Is it worth grinding for months trying to land a job in this field given how non-competitive my resume looks? Is there even enough time before I graduate? Or should I just switch fields? There's jobs out there that give $55-60k/yr, are much easier to get, and teach you everything you need to know. When I started college, I had dreams of making six figures working from home, but now I really just want to make a livable wage and not hate my job.\n\nSorry for the bit of venting at the end, but any advice is appreciated. And for any freshman reading this, use me as a lesson of what not to do. Just going to class and being average in everything will not set you up for success in this field.",

        "content": "Some background: Bachelors in CS, and I was a full-time SWE from 2013-2017, worked at Amazon right out of college then at a trading firm for a few years. Got laid off in 2017, but just as I was starting to look for a new job, my father unexpectedly passed away, and I had to step away from engineering to help support a family real estate business. I was never really passionate about the business, and frankly had to teach myself everything to make it work. I've been able to keep the business afloat, but just barely, and as I'm looking to get married and have a family soon, I know the income from that business just won't be able to support a family. So I've decided to sell the business and try going back to SWE. The problem is, from what I can tell, the job market is horrible, and it's even worse with an 8 year gap in my resume. My background was primarily as a Java developer, but my last couple years at the trading firm I did a fair amount of work in Spark, so I've decided to lean into the data engineering angle and have been teaching myself modern Spark and cloud computing to brush up on my skills in my free time. \n\nI know I will probably have to start back at a level 1 or maybe 2 role given my resume gap, and I've already sent my resume out to a few companies I thought might be a good fit through linkedIn, but have gotten zero calls back. I'm reaching out to the community here to see what everyone's advice is on what I should do to maximize my chances of getting my foot in the door. Should I look for recruiters? Take some sort of certification course? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

It's been a combination of factors including two family deaths around the same time that's not helped motivation in early interviews so probably killed chances with the better companies that were hiring at the time, my being laid off around the intermediate / mid-level which is already short of recruitment due to those roles usually being filled internally, (edit:) and half the work I did being under NDA so I have to be stupidly vague with what I did (with the tech I used being too generic to even be worth mentioning).\n\nI have tried to apply to senior roles as my experience should qualify me, but the death knell there is I have experience in leading a team which most of them are looking for. And I'm being denied for junior roles because recruiters say I'm overqualified (which I kinda figured). In both cases I'm almost never getting to the interview stage, I've had less than 6 over the past year and all but 2 of those were in late 2024.\n\nIn late December and late last week half the jobs I'm finding on recruitment sites are for frontend, which I have partial experience in from my last job thanks to the (frustrating) push for everyone to be full stack. At this rate I'm considering retraining or learning FE stuff and making the switch, but that feels like it could be just as difficult to find a job with when not working because I'd lack the pretence of \"experience\".\n\nTldr; backend job market in the UK sucks, considering retraining in / learning frontend to improve my prospects. Anyone have experience or advice?",

I’m now looking for gigs in tech that’s not entirely coding (junior spots I guess and yes it would be a salary hit but might be better than staying still here), but still open to leveling up in coding positions itself, is all I can do to upgrade there just projects and leetcode?

Got hired at the end of first year for one of side projects of community member. Fell in love with coding and worked really hard through the summer. Afterwards got an offer into well-established YC-backed company and currently working there as Software Engineer.\n\nAnd honestly - I love every bit of it. But I see two very big problems at the horizon which  am not sure how to tackle yet:\n\n\\- Working with AI is too much. Since I started my serious commitment on a very early stage kind of project - I got used to the principle of speed is the key. And because of that I did a lot of coding with AI (cursor). I didn’t cut it off correctly early enough, and now when I am trying to write code on my own - it takes much more time I feel like I am falling out if industry-needed pace. I can’t say that I am vibe-coding, because I am still very responsible for my code, and I know precisely how something is implemented, and I am not doing “Claude pls code feature” as well, but still like I am feeling that I won’t be able to write code if I don’t have access to AI instruments. So there’s my first question. How normal it is? How do you define an edge between AI slob and speed ups that AI can provide?\n\n\\- Vector of further development? I am trying to study the stuff beyond my actual responsibilities, and I feel like my next big choice is choice of supplementary skills: doing distribution (sales, marketing, PMF and all that kind of stuff) VS digging deeper into architecture, devops and deeply engineering kinds of topics.\n\nArgument of first approach for me are the fact that I can be more independent, but that’s not something I particularly like.\n\nArguments for the second approach are the fact that I love it, but again I love it because I am able to move with fast pace because I have AI. Also, I am not sure how relevant those skills are compared to distribution (e.g Technical guy who can sell is much more desirable part of a startup than just deeply technical guy)\n\nYour feedback is very important to me and is truly appropriated",

        "content": " am about to start applying to new jobs again after being at my first job out of school for 4 years. My question is this, if you apply for multiple SWE positions at a company and one recruiter gets back to you first and you start the process but fail at say the 2nd round, if another recruiter for the other position you applied to at the same place reaches out could you just start the process again and hope you get a better problem that you can solve. I am asking this because a few years ago I did this scenario where I went through one cycle and got to the 2nd round but did not pass, then that same week another recruiter for the other position I applied to reached out to start. Being the naive new grad I was, I thought I was being a good boy by being honest and telling the recruiter I had already gone through the process recently and if I could still proceed with his cycle. Obviously he did not let me lol. Looking back I am wondering if I should just keep my mouth shut and not said anything. I know this might vary per company depending on how generic early round interviews and if they keep you in a general pool and then narrowing the team at the end vs a place where each job posting going down separate cycles. I know companies have a cooldown period when you can apply again but I’m wondering if you fail early enough in the cycle could you test your chances again in this scenario.\n\nI would appreciate hearing peoples’ experiences on this, thanks!",

        "content": "I’m late 20s now, psychology & data science degrees and considering a maths masters.\n\nWorked throughout education. Initially started as a IC analyst, later promoted to senior/engineer. I spent the majority of my time at that company in a hybrid technical/leadership role (5 years). \n\nMoved to a government department in 2021 as a data scientist, quickly promoted to leading the DS team and worked in senior DS leadership positions since, mostly management responsibilities with some technical data science work. \n\nAt the moment I wear a lot of hats and am good at everything, but not a specialist in anything. Basically anything remotely linked to data becomes my remit. Plus, a lot of my time gets soaked up in HR issues & firefighting. so I can’t focus as much with being a technical specialist as I am spread thin although I’ve always wanted to progress as a data engineer. \n\nI have had a good career with executive level responsibilities and I am wondering if I should just fully pivot into pure leadership now, and maybe make it a goal to get a “head of” or director position in the next few years. I’m hesitant because I still feel fairly young and that I have more to give when it comes to engineering but I’m not sure what the best path is for me. It’s just becoming abundantly clear that I can’t do it all and I probably should narrow my focus. Interested to hear from anyone who made a similar decision and what swayed you. \n",

        "content": "I am a mid-level SWE, and 3 months ago I made the jump to a different company. I got a nice pay bump out of it, but my primary motivation for leaving was to seek more learning opportunities as I felt I was no longer learning much in my previous company.\n\nAt my current company, even though I am only 3 months in, I feel like I have even less opportunities to learn here. For starters, engineers on my team work in isolation. We are a small team, and each individual handles a few services on their own. This means there is virtually no reason for the engineers to collaborate, and in fact, there is barely any code review done since they have no reasons to. \n\nThere is very little guidance as well, as the team expects you to seek answers out yourself. I understand the principle behind it, however as a new joiner, I'm struggling to adapt as I don't know what I don't know, or even don't know what I need to know.\n\nI have been assigned 2 projects - the first is an existing full stack web application where the codebase is in a pretty sorry state, and the second is something agent related that they are exploring and which I personally do not believe in.\n\nI am thinking of jumping again, however, I really want to stay at least a year to beef up my resume and look less like a job hopper. But I feel increasingly unmotivated to work. My team is actually great in the sense that my teammates are very friendly and helpful, and there is no politics or ego issues. The company itself also offers great benefits - we have WFH, office pantry is great, we have flexible working hours. So I like the company and my team, just not what I'm doing.\n\nTo experienced SWEs, do you have any advice for me? Should I stay and soldier on a year, or should I jump now? Should I rethink my circumstances, and that it's actually not bad at all? I have spoken to my manager about this before, but the answer I got was pretty much this is how the team has been operating for years and it has worked for them.",

I currenlty make 41k (in Portugal) and I truly feel like I'm loosing passion for developing. I'm tired of implementing dashboards and CRUDs and not going anywhere.\n\nI've volunteered to implement the CI/CD pipeline at my currect company, as well as participating in the solution design of a new system, just to get more experience in cloud and Solutions Architect and maybe land a well paying job.\n\nAm I doing the right thing in trying to disperse even more? I feel like I haven't found my \"dream job\" that will make me stay up (more) nights studying and trying to become better every day.\n\nI have a bachelor in software engineering and a masters in information management, I've even studied things like business process management. On paper my profile is a good hybrid one that merges technology and management, but I feel like I'm wasted just doing developer work, and I would be wasted if I'd accept any of the job offers on Linkedin.\n\nFor reference, I have put a lot of effort on my CV and have a more product owner oriented CV that I submit to companies. But not all companies want a \"junior\" product owner or a \"junior\" solutions architect.",

        "content": "Hi all, I'm looking for some career advice from people who’ve been in similar situations.\n\nI’m currently working as a software developer at Epic Systems. I started in August 2025 and was placed on a team that primarily works with MUMPS (old database language) and a very small amount of SQL. Unfortunately, my day-to-day work has little to no exposure to more modern stacks.\n\nSome teams/ apps at Epic do work with more modern technologies (C#, TypeScript, React, etc.), but:\n\n* You need at least 1 year of tenure before you can apply for a team change\n* You need to be in good standing with your TL\n* There’s no guarantee you’ll be able to transfer, or get the specific team/stack you want\n* Even when modern languages are used (C#, TypeScript, React), Epic tends to use them in fairly weird or non-traditional ways for frontend and middleware, which doesn’t translate cleanly to industry-standard experience either\n\nMy main concern is losing competitiveness in the broader SWE job market by spending too much time working with a dated tech stack.\n\nI’m trying to decide when it makes the most sense to apply for a SWE role at another company, and I’m stuck between two options (or any alternatives if those make more sense):\n\n**Option 1: Apply after \\~1 YOE (new grad / early career roles)**  \nPros:\n\n* New grad roles tend to have less strict requirements\n* Having \\~1 YOE might make me more competitive than fresh grads\n\nCons:\n\n* Job market is rough right now\n* Competing with a very large pool of new grads\n\n**Option 2: Apply after \\~2 YOE (junior roles)**  \nPros:\n\n* Presumably fewer applicants than new grad roles\n\nCons:\n\n* Likely won’t meet job requirements due to lack of real-world experience with modern languages/frameworks\n* Concerned I’ll have “wasted” 2 years learning skills that don’t transfer well outside of Epic\n\nI do have experience working with modern programming languages/ frameworks in college, and do plan on making some more personal projects to increase my competitiveness, but it's hard to find the time with a full-time job. Personal projects also can't compare to real production experience.\n\nFor those who’ve worked at Epic or similar companies with niche or legacy stacks, transitioned from older tech to modern stacks, or hired/interviewed junior engineers:  \nWhen would you start applying, and how risky is staying longer?  \nIs the Epic name plus general SWE experience enough to offset the tech stack issue?\n\nThanks in advance!",
