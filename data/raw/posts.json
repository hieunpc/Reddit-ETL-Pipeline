        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "When it comes to reporting, I’m a fan of Kimball/star schema. I believe that the process of creating dimensions and facts actually reveals potential issues inside of your data. Discussing and ironing out grain and relationships between various tables helps with all of this. Often the initial assumptions don’t hold up and the modeling process helps flesh these edge cases out. It also gives you a vocabulary that you don’t have to invent inside your organization (dimension, fact, bridge, SCD, junk dimension, degenerate dimension, etc).\n\nI personally do not see OBT as much of a data model. It always seemed like “we contorted the data and mashed it together so that we got a huge table with the data we want” without too much rhyme or reason. I would add that an exception I have made is to join a star together and materialize that as OBT so that data science or analysts can hack on it in Excel, but this was done as a delivery mechanism not a modeling methodology. Honestly, OBT has always seemed pretty amateur to me. I’m interested if anyone has a different take on OBT. Is there anyone out there advocating for a structured and disciplined approach to creating datamarts with an OBT philosophy? Did I miss it and there actually is a Kimball-ish person for OBT that approaches it with rigor and professionalism?\n\nFor some context, I recently modeled a datamart as a star schema and was asked by an incoming leader “why did you model it with star schema?”. To me, it was equivalent to asking “why did you use a database for the datamart?”. Honestly, for a datamart, I don’t think anything other than star schema makes much sense, so anything else was not really an option. I was so shocked at this question that I didn’t have a non-sarcastic answer so I tabled the question. Other options could be: keep it relational, Datavault, or OBT. None of these seem serious to me (ok datavault is a serious approach as I understand it, but such a niche methodology that I wouldn’t seriously entertain it). The person asking this question is younger and I expect he entered the data space post big data/spark, so likely an OBT fan.\n\nI’m interested in hearing from people who believe OBT is superior to star schema. Am I missing something big about OBT?",

        "content": "hey folks, curious how others are tackling a problem my team keeps running into.\n\n**TL;DR:** We have data spread across Hive, Iceberg tables, Kafka topics, and some PostgreSQL databases. Managing metadata in 4+ different places is becoming a nightmare. Looking at catalog federation solutions and wanted to share what I found.\n\n## Our Setup\n\nWe're running a pretty typical modern stack but it's gotten messy over time:\n- Legacy Hive metastore (can't kill it yet, too much depends on it)\n- Iceberg tables in S3 for newer lakehouse stuff\n- Kafka with its own schema registry for streaming\n- A few PostgreSQL catalogs that different teams own\n- Mix of AWS and GCP (long story, acquisition stuff)\n\nThe problem is our data engineers waste hours just figuring out where data lives, what the schema is, who owns it, etc. We've tried building internal tooling but it's a constant game of catch-up.\n\n## What I've Been Looking At\n\nI spent the last month evaluating options. Here's what I found:\n\n### Option 1: Consolidate Everything into Unity Catalog\nWe're already using Databricks so this seemed obvious. The governance features are genuinely great. But:\n- It really wants you to move everything into the Databricks ecosystem\n- Our Kafka stuff doesn't integrate well\n- External catalog support feels bolted on\n- Teams with data in GCP pushed back hard on the vendor lock-in\n\n### Option 2: Try to Federate with Apache Polaris\nSnowflake's open source catalog looked promising. Good Iceberg support. But:\n- No real catalog federation (it's still one catalog, not a catalog of catalogs)\n- Doesn't handle non-tabular data (Kafka, message queues, etc.)\n- Still pretty new, limited community\n\n### Option 3: Build Something with Apache Gravitino\nThis one was new to me. It's an Apache project (just graduated to Top-Level Project in May) that does metadata federation. The concept is basically \"catalog of catalogs\" instead of trying to force everything into one system.\n\nWhat caught my attention:\n- Actually federates across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, JDBC sources without moving data\n- Handles both tabular and non-tabular data (they have this concept called \"filesets\")\n- Truly vendor-neutral (backed by Uber, Apple, Intel, Pinterest in the community)\n- We could query across our Hive metastore and Iceberg tables seamlessly\n- Has both REST APIs and Iceberg REST API support\n\nThe catch:\n- You have to self-host (or use Datastrato's managed version)\n- Newer project so some features are still maturing\n- Less polished UI compared to commercial options\n- Community is smaller than Databricks ecosystem\n\n## Real Test I Ran\n\nI set up a quick POC connecting our Hive metastore, one Iceberg catalog, and a test Kafka cluster. Within like 2 hours I had them all federated and could query across them. The metadata layer actually worked - we could see all our tables, topics, and schemas in one place.\n\nThen tried the same query that usually requires us to manually copy data between systems. With Gravitino's federation it just worked. Felt like magic tbh.\n\n## My Take\n\nFor us, I think Gravitino makes sense because:\n- We genuinely can't consolidate everything (different teams, different clouds, regulations)\n- We need to support heterogeneous systems (not just tables)\n- We're comfortable with open source (we already run a lot of Apache stuff)\n- Avoiding vendor lock-in is a real priority after our last platform migration disaster\n\nBut if you're already 100% Databricks or you have simpler needs, Unity Catalog is probably the easier path.\n\n## Question for the Group\n\nIs anyone else using catalog federation approaches? How are you handling metadata sprawl across different systems?\n\nAlso curious if anyone has tried Gravitino in production. The project looks solid but would love to hear real-world experiences beyond my small POC.",

        "author": "Jazzlike_Middle2757",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**I am being asked to do the following:**\n\nReplicate a \\~3000 line view from our ERP into Snowflake. This view calls other views which calls other views. The total number of views within this view is at least 100 (not counting the nesting). And the amount of nesting is anywhere from 2-6 levels deep to get to the base table from the views I have documented. This main view also calls about 300 packages as well. This views are used mainly in the where clause of this query. \n\nThis view is related to sales, stakeholders are looking for at most a couple thousand dollars difference in total sales between the original view and the replica. My non-technical manager and the data analyst think that we could narrow down the difference by eliminating where clauses that are useless or provide little filtering. There are 100s of where clauses.\n\nI am a part-time employee, full-time student. My only support right now is a data analyst that does not code. I do all of the coding. \n\nMy non-technical skip wanted this completed in July. Back then we were still building out the pipelines to get our data into Snowflake. We didn't even have data analyst. \n\n**I have suggested the following to my manager and data analyst:**\n\n1. Make a replica of the view from the base tables without all of the where clauses as a fact table. Identify a composite surrogate key from the view and import those columns as a dim table. Do a join between on the dim table and fact table. \n\n2. Our second set of pipelines are doing transformations (joins, dropping columns, mappings) between the data lake (in parquet files) and our Datawarehouse in Snowflake. These transformations are done in Python using our orchestrator. My suggestion instead was to bring all of the base tables we needed into Snowflake without any transformations, copy-and-paste the query from Oracle and slowly work on replacing views with base tables. \n\nBoth suggestions got rejected. The first was due to them wanting to have transparency on the logic and rules being done. The second due to them thinking this would add more time for the project and effectively making the previous work redundant. \n\nEdit: I am a novice in data engineering so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

For someone still building their first PySpark projects, when is the realistic time to start Go without getting overwhelmed?\n\nI don’t want to distract myself too early, but I also don’t want to miss the train if Go is the next big thing for higher-paying / more interesting data platform roles.\n\nAny advice from people who started in Python/Spark and later added Go (or decided not to) would be super helpful.

I have quite a large pipeline that I want to optimize down to the last cent, and I have a clear vision on how to achieve this mathematically: \n\n- read dataframe A, repartition on join keys, cache on disk\n- read dataframe B, repartition on join keys, cache on disk\n- do all downstream (joins, aggregation, etc) on local nodes without ever doing another round of shuffle, because I have context that guarantees that shuffle won’t ever be needed anymore\n\nHowever, Spark keeps on inserting Exchange each time it reads from the cached data. The optimization results in even a slower job than the unoptimized one.\n\nHave you ever faced this problem? Is there any trick to fool Catalyzer to adhere to parameterized data distribution and not do extra shuffle on cached data? I’m using on-demand instances so there’s no risk of losing executors midway\n",

I didn’t even know the DE role existed. It really catched my attention, and I started studying every single day. I’ll admit I made some mistakes (jumping straight into Airflow/AWS, even made a post about Airflow here, LOL), but I kept going because I genuinely enjoy learning about the field.\n\nTwo months ago I actually received two job opportunities. Both meetings went well: they asked about my projects, my skills, my approach to learning, etc. Both processes just vanished. I assume it’s because I have 0 experience. Still, I’ve been studying 4–6 hours a day since I started, and I’m fully committed to become a professional DE.\n\n# My current skill set:\n\n**Python:** PySpark, Polars, DuckDB, OOP  \n**SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL  \n**Databricks:** Delta Lake, Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, Jobs, Roles, Unity Catalog, Secrets, External Locations, Connections, Clusters  \n**BI:** Power BI, Looker  \n**Cloud:** AWS (IAM, S3, Glue) / a bit of DynamoDB and RDS  \n**Workflow Orchestration:** Airflow 3 (Astronomer certified)  \n**Containers:** Docker basics (Images, Containers, Compose, Dockerfile)  \n**Version Control:** Git & GitHub  \n**Storage / Formats:** Parquet, Delta, Iceberg  \n**Other:** Handling fairly large datasets (+100GB files), understanding when to use specific tools, etc  \n**English:** C1/C2 (EF SET certified)\n\n# Projects I’ve built so far:\n\n– An end-to-end ETL built **entirely in SQL** using DuckDB, loading into PostgreSQL.  \n– Another ETL pulling from multiple sources (MySQL, S3, CSV, Parquet), converting everything to Parquet, transforming it, and loading into PostgreSQL. Total volume was \\~4M rows. I also handled IAM for boto3 access.  \n– A small Spark → S3 pipeline (too simple to mention it though).\n\nI know these are beginner/intermediate projects, i’m planning more advanced ones for next year.\n\nNext year, I want to do things properly: structured learning, better projects, certifications, and ideally my first job, even if it’s low pay or long hours. I’m confident I can scale quickly once I get my first actual job.\n\n# My questions:\n\n– If you were in my position, what would you focus on next?  \n– Do you think I’m in the right direction?  \n– What kind of projects actually stand out in a junior DE portfolio?  \n– Do certifications actually matter for someone with zero experience? (Databricks, dbt, Airflow, etc.)\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks.",

The goal is to setup cost reports on AWS and GCP (and add yours from Cloudflare, Azure, etc.) and combine each of them and get a combined overview from all costs and be able to see where most cost comes from.\n\nThere's a YouTube video for more details and detailed explanation of how to set up the cost exports (unfortunately, they weren't straight-forward AWS exports to S3 and GCP to BigQuery). Luckily we dlt that integrates them well. I also added Stripe to get some income data too, so have an overall cost dashboard with costs and income to calculate margins and other important data. I hope this is useful, and I'm sure there's much more that can be added.\n\nAlso, huge thanks to pre-existing dashboard [aws-cur-wizard](https://github.com/Twing-Data/aws-cur-wizard) with very detailed reports. Everything is build on open-source and I included a `make demo` that gets you started immediately without cloud reports setup to see how it works.\n\nPS: I'm also planing to add a GitHub actions to ingest into ClickHouse Cloud, to have a cloud version as an option too, in case you want to run it in an enterprise. Happy to get feedback too, again. The dlt part is manually created so it works, the reports are heavily re-used from aws-cur-wizard, and the rest I used some Claude Code. ",

If you don't want to use GitHub Codespces, you can run this locally via Docker Desktop.\n\nBonus for loacal: Since Cursor is based on VSCode, you can use the dev containers in there and then have AI help explain code or concepts (also super helpful for learning).\n\nOne thing I do want to highlight is that since this is meant for students and not production, security and user management controls are very lax (e.g. \"password\" for passwords db configs). I'm optimizing on student learning experience there, but it's probably a great starting point to learn how to implement those controls.\n\nAnything you would add? I've started a Kafka project, so I would love to build out streaming use cases as well. With the latest Kafka update, you no longer need Zookeeper, which keeps the docker compose file simpler!",

Today I started playing around, created a 'semantic view', a 'cortex analyst', and a 'cortex agent', and was able to get it all up and running in a day or so on small piece of our data. It seems reasonably good and I like the organization of the semantic view especially, but I'm skeptical that it ever gets to a point where the answers it provides are 100% trustworthy.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions or experience using snowflake for this stuff? Or experience doing production text to SQL type things for internal tools? Main concern right now is that AI  will inevitably be wrong a decent percent of the time and is just not going to mix well with people who don't know how to verify its answers or sense when it's making shit up.",

This helps with cases where you:\n\n* are data engineering in Rust within a highly connected, low latency ecosystem *(e.g., websocket feeds, Tokio etc.)*,\n* need typed arrays that remain Python/analytics ecosystem compatible\n* are working with real-time data use cases, and need minimal overhead Tabular data structures\n* are compiling lots, want < 2 second build times and basically value a solid data programming experience in Rust. \n\nTherefore, it is a great fit when you are DIY bare bones data engineering, and less so if you are relying on pre-existing tools *(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake).* For example, if you are data streaming in a more low-level manner.\n\n**Data Engineering examples:**\n\n* Stream data live off a Websocket and save it into \"**.arrow\"** or \"**.parquet**\" files.\n* Capture data in Minarrow, flip to Polars on the fly and calculate metrics in real-time, then push them in chunks to a Datastore as a live persistent service\n* Run parallelised statistical calculations on 1 billion rows without much compile-time overhead so Rust becomes workable\n\n**You also get:**\n\n* Strong IDE typing (in Rust)\n* One hit *\\`.to\\_arrow()*\\` and \\`.*to\\_polars()*\\` in Rust\n* Enums instead of dynamic dispatch *(a Rust flavour that's used in the official Arrow Rust crates)*\n* extensive SIMD-accelerated kernel functions available, including 60+ univariate distributions via the partner \\`SIMD-Kernels\\` crate (*fully reconciled to Scipy*). So, for many common cases you can stay in Rust for high performance compute.\n\nEssentially addressing a few areas that the main Arrow RS implementation makes different trade-offs. \n\n**Are you interested?**\n\nFor those who work in high performance data and software engineering and value this type of work, please feel free to ask any questions, even if you predominantly work in Python or another language*.* As, Arrow is one of those frameworks that backs a lot of that ecosystem but is not always well understood, due its back-end nature.\n\nI'm also happy to explain how you can move data across language boundaries *(e.g., Python <-> Rust)* using the Arrow format, or other tricks like this.\n\nHope you found this interesting.\n\nCheers,\n\nPete",

And the idea that it deploys everything, but it will be in invalid step untill you do some manual work really pushes me away. \n\nNext I added a video about git integration and python based deployments. That one is much more code oriented and even \"code-first\", which is great. Still, I was quite annoyed because of the parameter file. If only it could be split, or applied in stages...\n\nAnyway - those are 2 videos I mentioned:  \nFabric deployment pipelines - [https://youtu.be/1AdUcFtl830](https://youtu.be/1AdUcFtl830)  \nGit + Python - [https://youtu.be/dsEA4HG7TtI](https://youtu.be/dsEA4HG7TtI)\n\nHappy to answer any questions or even better get some suggestions for the next topics!  \nPurview?

For the past two months I've been working on a Python micro-ORM, which I just published and I wanted to share with you: [https://github.com/manoss96/onlymaps](https://github.com/manoss96/onlymaps)\n\nA micro-ORM is a term used for libraries that do not provide the full set of features a typical ORM does, such as an OOP-based API, lazy loading, database migrations, etc... Instead, it lets you interact with a database via raw SQL, while it handles mapping the SQL query results to in-memory objects.\n\nOnlymaps does just that by using Pydantic underneath. On top of that, it offers:\n\n\\- A minimal API for both sync and async query execution.\n\n\\- Support for all major relational databases.\n\n\\- Thread-safe connections and connection pools.\n\nThis project provides a simpler alternative to typical full-feature ORMs which seem to dominate the Python ORM landscape, such as SQLAlchemy and Django ORM.\n\nAny questions/suggestions are welcome!",

I often needed help from an AI model but did not feel comfortable sharing certain parts of the code because of sensitive names and internal details.\n\nBetween the feedback from this community and my own experience dealing with the same issue, I decided to build something to help.\n\nI created an open source local desktop app.  This tool lets you hide sensitive details in your code such as field names, identifiers and other internal references before sending anything to an AI model. After you get the response back, it can restore everything to the original names so the code still works properly.\n\nIt also works for regular text like emails or documentation that contain client specific information. Everything runs locally on your machine and nothing is sent anywhere. The goal is simply to make it easier to use LLMs without exposing internal structures or business logic.\n\nIf you want to take a look or share feedback, the project is at  \n[**codemasklab.com**](http://codemasklab.com)\n\nHappy to hear thoughts or suggestions from the community.",

We are considering the open lineage format because it is vendor agnostic and would allow us to use a range of different visualisation tools. Part of our design includes a processing layer which would validate, enrich and harmonize the incoming lineage data. We are considering using data bricks for this component, and following the medallion architecture and having bronze, silver and gold layers where we persist the data in case we need to re-process it. We are considering delta tables as an intermediate storage layer before storing the data in graph format in order to visualise it. \n\nSince I have never worked with open lineage json data in delta format, I wanted to know if this strategy makes sense. Has anyone done this before? Our processing layer would have to consolidate lineage data from different sources in order to create end to end lineage, and to de duplicate and clean the data. It seemed that data bricks and unity catalog would be a good choice for this, but I would love to hear some opinions.",

The request is as below\n\n“We are planning to automate and integrate AI into our test laboratory operations, and we would greatly appreciate your assistance with this initiative. Currently, we spend a significant amount of time copying data into Excel, processing it, and performing analysis. This manual process is inefficient and affects our productivity. Therefore, as the first step, we want to establish a centralized database where all our historical and future testing data—currently stored year-wise in Google Sheets—can be consolidated. Once the database is created, we also require a reporting feature that allows us to generate different types of reports based on selected criteria. We believe your expertise will be valuable in helping us design and implement this solution.”\n\nWhen i called for more information i was told, that what they do now is store all their data in tables on Google sheets and extract the data from there when doing calculations (im assuming using python/google colab?)\n\nOkay so the way I understood is:\n\n1. Have to make database\n2. Have to make ETL Pipeline?\n3. Have to be able to do calculations/analysis and generate reports/dashboards??\n\nSo I have come up with combos as below\n\n1. PostgresSQL database + Power BI\n2. PostgresSQL + Python Dash application\n3. PostgresSQL + Custom React/Vue application\n4. PostgresSQL + Microsoft Fabric?? (I'm so confused as to what this is in the first place, I just learnt about it)\n\nI do not know why they are being so secretive with the actual requirements of this project, I have no idea where even to start. I'm pretty sure the \"reports\" they want is some calculations. Right now, I am just supposed to give them options and they will choose according to their extremely secretive requirements, even then i feel like im pulling things out of my ass, im so lost here please help by choosing which option you would choose for the requirements. \n\nAlso please feel free to give me any advice on how to actual make this thing and if you have any other suggestions please please comment, thank you!

And now with current firm for 7 months. My real learning happened while being in the second firm , up-skill on a lot of things, dealt with clients and what not, basically was in a consulting role. \n\nWith the current switch, it’s a big MnC in healthcare with better employee policies than the previous firms I had worked with. The problem here is the type of work I am doing is of no use, not even upto the level of the previous employer. Just writing SQL transformations on DBT as ELT is already dealt by FiveTran, low code - no code tool. \n\nThis is making my learning curve go down and I am really worried about my career as we see AI being involved in every domain and a downward learning curve at this moment in time is not acceptable for me. Even I do learn a few more tools say Databricks, pretty similar to synapse , implementations come up as a problem. \n\nNeed your guidance from those sitting at senior roles or have passed through similar situations in the past.

        "content": "TLDR: Strategy/ops guy in the MCIT program aiming for SWE. Got a verbal offer for a Data Engineer II role doing Python/PySpark, Databricks, ADF pipelines, ingestion, and medallion architecture, but the role sits fully in the data/analytics org, not engineering, and pays $105–115K (I currently make ~$180K TC in NYC).\nTrying to figure out whether this DE role meaningfully helps me pivot into SWE/back-end engineering longterm, or if it’s better to stay in my current job, finish MCIT, build projects, and target SWE directly. Looking for input from DEs/SWEs on how transferable this work is, whether the comp is normal for NYC, and what questions I should ask before deciding.\n\n\nHey everyone, I’m looking for some candid input from folks in data engineering and software engineering.\n\nI’m currently in a strategy/operations role at a tech company while working through the MCIT program (Penn’s CS master’s for career switchers). My long term goal is to be a SWE. I recently interviewed for a Data Engineer II position at a healthcare tech company, and im trying to evaluate whether this role would be a good stepping stone to SWE or if I should just leverage my degree and build projects to make the switch. \n\nI’d appreciate any honest advice or experience people have.\n\nHere are the key details:\n\nBackground / motivation\n* I’ve worked strategy consulting and it has led to a good paying career but I don’t care about strategy in all honesty. I dislike the politics to get promoted, work is quite boring where im learning nothing new\n* I like consulting in the fact that I had to learn a new industry everyday, but TBH I couldn’t deal with 15-16hr workdays just to learn more\n* I love the technical side and building things which is why I considered SWE about a year and a half ago (I just expected the market to be better by then lolz)  \n\nComp\n* Base salary: $105–115K (Remote but I live in NYC)\n* Other factors are TBD as I haven’t gotten the formal letter yet, just verbal and what the job description outlines\n* I currently make 155k base and TC ~180k so it would be a pay cut for this role\n\nTeam / Org Structure\n* The role sits in the data - analytics org, not the software engineering org\n* DEs partner with analytics engineers, ML/data consumers, data scientists\n* I would not be in the analytics engineering track or an analyst, but they would be my stakeholders\n* No direct SWE involvement as far as I can tell\n\nTech + Responsibilities\n* Mostly Python + PySpark on Databricks\n* AWS and Azure\n* Both streaming and batch pipelines\n* Medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers)\n* ADF wiring + pipeline orchestration\n* File ingestion + transformations + schema enforcement\n* Some framework or pipeline component building, but unclear how deep the engineering side goes\n* Not much SQL involved, which surprised me, but they emphasized if they were asking for SQL it would be for more analysts vs engineers\n\n\nMy goals / questions:\nMy ultimate target is a technical heavy role that still pays well, like SWE or backend, but I’m also open to becoming a stronger DE if it meaningfully raises my chances of SWE transitioning.\n\nAny insights on the following would be helpful:\n1. Does this sound like a DE role with strong engineering exposure that can help facilitate a SWE transition? \n2. How transferable is this experience toward SWE or backend engineering later?\n3. For those who started in DE and moved into SWE, what allowed that transition?\n4. Is $105–115K base realistic for NYC in a mid-level DE role, or does that seem low?\n5. Would you take this role if your long-term goal leaned more toward SWE?\n6. Anything I should ask the hiring manager or my internal referrer to get more clarity?\nI’m not trying to bash the role or Data engineering, I’m genuinely trying to understand if this would meaningfully advance my pivot or if im better off staying in my current role and continuing to work on transitioning directly. Any honest input from experienced DEs or SWEs would really help. Thanks!",

        "author": "karakanb",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all, this is Burak, I am one of the makers of [Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin). We built an MCP server that allows you to connect your AI agents to your DWH/query engine and make them interact with your DWH.\n\nA bit of a back story: we started Bruin as an open-source CLI tool that allows data people to be productive with the end-to-end pipelines. Run SQL, Python, ingestion jobs, data quality, whatnot. The goal being a productive CLI experience for data people.\n\nAfter some time, agents popped up, and when we started using them heavily for our own development stuff, it became quite apparent that we might be able to offer similar capabilities for data engineering tasks. Agents can already use CLI tools, and they have the ability to run shell commands, and they could technically use Bruin CLI as well.\n\nOur initial attempts were around building a simple [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) file with a set of instructions on how to use Bruin. It worked fine to a certain extent; however it came with its own set of problems, primarily around maintenance. Every new feature/flag meant more docs to sync. It also meant the file needed to be distributed somehow to all the users, which would be a manual process.\n\nWe then started looking into MCP servers: while they are great to expose remote capabilities, for a CLI tool, it meant that we would have to expose pretty much every command and subcommand we had as new tools. This meant a lot of maintenance work, a lot of duplication, and a large number of tools which bloat the context.\n\nEventually, we landed on a middle-ground: expose only documentation navigation, not the commands themselves.\n\nWe ended up with just 3 tools:\n\n* `bruin_get_overview`\n* `bruin_get_docs_tree` \n* `bruin_get_doc_content` \n\nThe agent uses MCP to fetch docs, understand capabilities, and figure out the correct CLI invocation. Then it just runs the actual Bruin CLI in the shell. This means less manual work for us, and making the new features in the CLI automatically available to everyone else. \n\nYou can now use Bruin CLI to connect your AI agents, such as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other agent that supports MCP servers, into your DWH. Given that all of your DWH metadata is in Bruin, your agent will automatically know about all the business metadata necessary. \n\nHere are some common questions people ask to Bruin MCP:\n\n* analyze user behavior in our data warehouse\n* add this new column to the table X\n* there seems to be something off with our funnel metrics, analyze the user behavior there\n* add missing quality checks into our assets in this pipeline\n\n  \nHere's a quick video of me demoing the tool: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U)\n\nAll of this tech is fully open-source, and you can run it anywhere. \n\nBruin MCP works out of the box with:\n\n* BigQuery\n* Snowflake\n* Databricks\n* Athena\n* Clickhouse\n* Synapse\n* Redshift\n* Postgres\n* DuckDB\n* MySQL\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this!

        "content": "I wanted to share a small ingestion pipeline I built recently to solve the problem wich is that  I needed to analyze thousands of unstructured career discussions from Reddit, to visualize the gap between academic curriculum and industry requirements, so then later i can put in some value on the articles on Linkedin or just for myself.\n\nI didn't want to use PRAW (due to API overhead for read-only data) and I absolutely didn't want to use Selenium (cuz DUH).\n\nSo, I built ORION. It’s a local-first scraper that hits Reddit’s JSON endpoints directly to structure the data.\n\nThe Architecture:\n\nIngestion: Python requests with a rotating User-Agent header to mimic legitimate traffic and avoid 429/403 errors. It enforces a strict 2-second delay between hits to respect Reddit's infrastructure.\n\nTransformation: Parses the raw JSON tree, filters out stickied posts/memes, and extracts the selftext and top-level comments.\n\nAnalysis: Performs keyword frequency mapping (e.g., \"Excel\" vs. \"Calculus\") against a dictionary of 1,800+ terms.\n\nIt outputs and  generates a structured JSON dataset and uses reportlab to programmatically compile a PDF visualization of the \"Reality Gap.\"\n\nI built it like that cuz  I wanted a tool that could run on a potato  and didn't rely on external cloud storage or paid APIs. It processes \\~50k threads relatively quickly compared to browser automation.\n\nLink with showcase and Repo : [https://mrweeb0.github.io/ORION-tool-showcase/](https://mrweeb0.github.io/ORION-tool-showcase/)\n\nI’d love some feedback guys  on my error handling logic for the JSON recursion depth, as that was the hardest part to debug.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m looking for advice on how to structure partitions in Dagster for a new ingestion pipeline. We’re moving a previously manual process into Dagster. Our client sends us data every couple of weeks, and sometimes they include new datasets that belong to older categories. All data lands in S3 first, and Dagster processes it from there.\n\nThe data follows a 3-tier hierarichal pattern. (note: the field names have been changed)\n\n* Each `EQP_Number` contains multiple `AP_Number`\n* Each `AP_Number` has 0 or more `Part_Number` for it (optional)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20m26hc0ow2g1.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f3aa452890a6e899815899ee9acf0129126f176&height=222\n\nExample file list:\n\n    EQP-12_AP-301_Part-1_foo_bar.csv\n    EQP-12_AP-301_Part-2_foo_bar.csv\n    EQP-12_AP-302_Part-1_foo_bar.csv\n    EQP-12_AP-302_Part-2_foo_bar.csv\n    EQP-12_AP-302_Part-3_foo_bar.csv\n    \n    EQP-13_AP-200_foo.csv\n    EQP-13_AP-201_foo.csv\n\nMy current idea is to use a 2-dimensional partition scheme with dynamic partitions for `EQP_Number` and `AP_Number`. But I’m concerned about running into Dagster’s recommended 100k asset limit. Alternatively, I could use a single dynamic partition on EQP_Number, but then I’m worried Dagster will try to reprocess older data (when mew data arrives) which could trigger expensive downstream updates (also one of the assets produces different outputs each run so this would affect downstream data as well).\n\nI’d also like to avoid tagging processed data in S3, since the client plans to move toward a database storage/ingestion flow in the future and we don’t yet know what that will look like.\n\nWhat partitioning approach would you recommend for this? Any suggestions for this?",

On top of that, being new means I don't have the experience to be able to accurately tell whether something is hard or easy, which made things even more obviously dumb.\n\nAnd NOW I finally realize that, all I had to do was first cover the base case scenarios (like learning how to build a basic page that navigates around other pages) and then come up with something that I want to build, and start stumbling around 99% of the time trying to figure out how to build it. Obviously that would mean spending more time googling, reading articles, stackoverflow etc. than actually writing code. Duh! It's the first time I do most of the things required.\n\nSo you think at this point \"okay bro, now you know how people learn by building projects and connecting the dots to make functional software, congrats\".

I use them regularly, and I understand them in practice. But I really struggled to \\*explain\\* them clearly. I couldn’t put into words what I actually know how to do.

Nothing too big, not full-on projects, just exploring concepts. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck because I don’t have a lot of project ideas to apply what I’m learning. And honestly, I’m not sure if “learning by doing” is the right approach for me right now. It feels like there’s a huge emphasis in programming circles on just jumping in and building stuff, but in other fields like medicine or other branches of engineering, you spend a lot more time on theory before you start doing anything practical.\n\nSo I’m curious to hear from you all: Did you have a moment where you finally felt confident enough to start building things? What was your breakthrough? And how did you get over that feeling of “I need to know everything before I start”? I’d love to hear your stories and get some advice on taking that step into actually building something real or even contributing to open source. Thanks!\n\nEDIT : Wow thanks a lot for all the responses, it was really helpful to read about your experiences. I’ll definitely use your advice in my journey!\n",

It’s one thing to memorize that Quicksort is O(n log n), but it’s another thing to actually see how it partitions an array compared to how Bubble sort slowly crawls to the finish line.\n\nI was inspired by an old terminal-based visualizer I saw years ago, so I decided to build a modern web version to help people visualize these concepts. I ended up writing a comprehensive guide covering 25 different algorithms, including:\n\n- The Classics: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick.\n- The Modern Standards: Timsort (used in Python) and Introsort (used in C++).\n- The Weird Ones: Pancake Sort, Gnome Sort, and the chaotic Bogo Sort.",

It uses C#, Blazor (particularly SyncFusion), and HTML. I alone have built over 40 page templates (in the last 2 years) for this site at this point, and I don't work with anyone because only one other person codes, and it's my boss, who I am senior to with this kind of programming. Truthfully, I hate it. I hate web development, and I hate doing this day in and day out. I was just sort of forced into it, and now it's destroyed my passion for the field. I could go on about why I hate my current job, but I'll move on.\n\nIf the job market weren't demotivating enough, I'm so exhausted from work that I don't want to sit at my own computer at home, which makes learning so difficult. I remember during my first Python class, I was fascinated by a simple function that told you the total length of all sides of a shape based on the shape and length of one side. I tinkered with that and other code so much and never got tired of it. Now I'm sick of the thought of code, and that makes me sad because my dream is still to get into the gaming industry. The idea of not getting in makes me want to cry.\n\nI want to reignite that love I had for coding. I want to get back into it and find that love for tinkering and understanding how things work (I'm actually very good at learning through reverse engineering. It's how I learned everything I know about web development.) Is there a game or something that teaches code, particularly C++, in a way that is different and fun? I've been trying to work through an Udemy class that is actually taught very well, but I keep running into that block because it's just mostly watching someone code, taking notes, and then doing a couple of exercises throughout the chapter. It's just another class.\n\nAnd please, don't tell me about how difficult things are out there. I already know, and I need to be motivated, not have what little of a spark that's left put out.",

        "content": "Hey there,\n\nI recently graduated and got myself a web and mobile development degree. I'm not looking for a job now as my attention is fully dediacted to my trip to China to study in 2026. Here's the thing though:\n\nJust like many of you guys i was completely amazed by how fast AI can help me code. But i feel like i'm relying on it too much now... I just finished building my first app, developed the design myself and used symfony to build the app (i'm lacking in backend dev...) and most of the code was written by AI. I give directions, i know what feature to describe and how to technically build it using the rights terms, the right prompts and asking for the right things. But not typing the code myself makes me feel like i'm heading straight into a wall. I want to learn hard, started to learn vue js by myself and how to use components. But in the end i always reach for AI as to dev a feature faster. I'm afraid i won't make it far in the pro world if it keeps going. Do you guys have any recommendation for a guy who wants to dev for a living, mostly frontend without being own by Cursor or Claude ? What's the ideal roadmap to balance things....\n\n  \nThanks for reading through. ",

        "title": "Naming Things in really complex situations and as codebase size increases and glossry for common terms.",
        "author": "Dizzy-Complaint-8871",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Naming has become a real challenge for me. It’s easy when I’m following a YouTube tutorial and building mock projects, but in real production projects it gets difficult. In the beginning it’s manageable, but as the project grows, naming things becomes harder.\n\nFor example, I have various formatters. A formatter takes a database object—basically a Django model instance—and formats it. It’s similar to a serializer, though I have specific reasons to create my own instead of using the built-in Python or Django REST Framework serializers. The language or framework isn’t the main point here; I’m mentioning them only for clarity.\n\nSo I create one formatter that returns some structured data. Then I need another formatter that returns about 80% of the same data, but with slight additions or removals. There might be an order formatter, then another order formatter with user data, another one without the “order received” date, and so on. None of this reflects my actual project—it’s not e-commerce but an internal tool I can’t discuss in detail—but it does involve many formatters for different use cases. Depending on the role, I may need to send different versions of order data with certain fields blank. This is only the formatter situation.\n\nThen there are formatters that include user roles, order formatters that also include product details, and other combinations. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to separate order and product formatters, but in rare cases I need a product formatter with only an order number or something similar, so I end up creating another formatter because the original one didn’t include it.\n\nBeyond formatters, naming functions, classes, methods, getters, and setters also becomes difficult. I know that when naming becomes hard, it may indicate that the code isn’t following the Single Responsibility Principle. But I’m not always sure how to handle this.\n\nFor example, I might be building an interface that lets users update their data. An admin can update emails, phone numbers, and roles, but a regular user can only update their name. This leads to functions like `update_user_with_role`, `update_user_normal`, `update_user_with_email`, and so on.\n\nMost of my projects have role-based access control, and different roles can view or update different fields. Sometimes even the displayed values differ. For example, if an admin views an order, they might see quantity 100, but a vendor might see quantity 70 because the order is split between two vendors. That means writing multiple getters, different database queries, and various ways of manipulating the data. This leads to many functions and a lot of naming decisions.\n\nInside a single function, I often deal with dictionaries (like objects in JavaScript). I might fetch raw data from the database, give it a long descriptive name, remove some parts, process it again, and so on. I end up naming the same dictionary multiple times in different forms, and the names become long and messy. I’m unsure what the right approach is here.\n\nTutorials usually cover only obvious examples aimed at beginners. They say things like “If you calculate tax, call it `calculate_tax`,” which is obvious. But my real-world cases aren’t that simple. If discounts depend on user roles, sure, the logic should be inside the function, but I still need to express it clearly. I also don’t want to get stuck overthinking names because that delays the project.\n\nName collisions happen a lot. For example, I once wrote a function called `get_user` to fetch a user by ID. Later I needed to fetch users by email, username, and other fields. I ended up writing multiple versions, and the original vague name became a problem because it was created early in the project. I eventually renamed it, but it was painful. That’s why I want a better approach from the start so I don’t spend hours worrying about names.\n\nSometimes it feels easier to write the logic itself. I never use meaningless names like `a` or `x1`, but I do end up writing temporary or placeholder names like “this\\_has\\_to\\_be\\_renamed”. Then I move on to the next function and write “this\\_is\\_not\\_right\\_first\\_has\\_to\\_be\\_renamed”, and so on. These names aren’t helpful, but they let me continue writing code without getting stuck on naming.\n\nSo I’m looking for any guide, project, or glossary I can refer to—something with common naming patterns. For instance, I used words like “collection” or “group” earlier, but “batch” made more sense in my context. I’ve used AI suggestions often; sometimes they help, sometimes they produce vague names because they don’t have the full context.\n\nI’m not sure if there is any practical guide, but if there is, please share it.

        "content": "I recently wrote an image blurring algorithm that uses a basic approach that I learned in my computational physics course in college. Basically, pixels in an image are selected at random, and its RGB values are averaged with the RBG values of all pixels immediately round it. When this happens, the selected pixel (\"pixel\" is an object I created) is also set to \"processed\" meaning this pixel has already been worked on, don't perform the averaging operation on it again. This implies that the random selector method I'm using can choose any pixel it wants to while running, so multiple pixels get selected multiple times. This is inefficient. How could I also exclude them from the set of values the random method can select? I was thinking about putting all the pixel values in a linked list and then knocking them out that way with a checkinlist(pixel) method, but maybe a hash table would be better?",

I realized how behind I am compared to my peers since I have only completed school courses, which are very theoretical and more so like \"fill in the blanks\" type of projects (at least up until now). I can write pages of math proofs for sorting algorithms but I can't code for the sake of my life.\n\nBecause of this, I accepted a job offer as a data analyst for 8 months. It isn't what I want to pursue since I want to pivot more into the SWE side of tech, but I'm taking it just so I have some time off from school to self-learn programming and build some projects before I get back into school (and also to network since it's a very, very large company.) I feel like I can't contribute much to my course projects. Also, my college is very well known for CS/ AI and I feel like I'm not utilizing my opportunities enough due to how useless I am.\n\nWith that said, with my co-op coming up soon, I need some advice on where I can get started and the best way to go about this most efficiently. I know python and java in terms of syntax, I know all the structures like loops and stuff, but I haven't coded any projects before. I know R and SQL as well but that is useless.\n\nI think I can commit about 3-4 hours per day on average for the next 8 months (I will still be taking a calculus proof course + a data structure class on top of full time work, for the sake of 3rd year courses prequisites).\n\nAny advice will be helpful! I am a bit stupid but I am willing to put in the work to catch up to everyone. It definitely is overwhelming starting from zero haha, there's so many resources, so many terminologies, so many languages out there... I'm hoping I would find the most efficient way so I won't be wasting my time. Hopefully I'll be able to build some complex project by month 5. Thank you :)",

A few of them felt like they relied a bit too much on trial and error, so I turned that curiosity into a small side project. I built a browser extension that reads the puzzle when you open it, figures out the pattern, and then gives hints or can even solve it automatically. Right now it only works with the “Zip” puzzle, but I’m planning to expand it as I go.\n\nWhile building this, I ended up learning way more than I expected. I got a much better understanding of how Chrome extensions are structured, how to use content scripts to interact with a page, and how to scrape and interpret the DOM in a way that doesn’t break when the site loads things dynamically. I also had to figure out how to design simple pattern-recognition logic, handle communication between different parts of the extension, and work through a bunch of timing issues that I’d never really run into before. Publishing it taught me how the Chrome Web Store process works too. Overall, it was a fun reminder that small projects are often the best way to learn things you didn’t even know you needed.\n\nIf anyone wants to take a look or offer feedback, here’s the extension on the Chrome Web Store:\n\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkedin-puzzle-cracker/immohpcmpcbpfbepgkjacopkajnllpak",

I feel like I was exposed to some mathematical programming in Matlab and a lot of proofs.\n\nMy bachelors was in computer science, but for electives I took quantum/math(stuff like number theory), and I was mediocre at it--so I didn't have exposure to any SWE electives/ lack of time investing in programming.\n\nI spent a lot of time looking at hard things without having a foundation nor specialization, and I struggle to be practical in getting things done, how to break down projects, how to learn things.\n\nI am trying to be consistent with Python projects for data science roles, but I think I choose things too big in scope and I end up really lost on how to build out a project on my own. For example, I am trying to build a Python CLI that uses models I downloaded for inference. I have written out the processing logic for predictions on paper, but I get lost in managing multiple python files, how to organize my functions, how to choose the structure of my data, how to handle the logic for the inference pipeline. I have trouble not jumping around everywhere between my files, and I guess I read more Python than I write it myself. **I feel like I spend weeks just reading and never doing anything. I am good at concepts, but not writing the code.** \n\nI am trying to go for \"data science\" roles, but I only sometimes worked in Jupyter notebooks using sci-kit learn models or implemented the math for some algorithm in a singular python file. \n\nI am a little lost on whats the best way to get better programming for data science. What is the best thing I can do to maximize my chance of getting a job at this moment and learn to be more practical?",

        "content": "I often take advice too literally and get confused on how I should specifically structure my agenda when learning formal math, programming, and computer science.\n\n  \nI've made a lot of poor assumptions and ended up in a bottleneck where I'm not really improving in any of these three sectors  listed within computational mathematics/CS or software engineering.\n\n Because software engineering is usually an asynchronous isolated discipline it's hard to figure out what I am doing wrong and what other people are doing right, especially since people like to summarize and avoid being pedantic, but I don't always know what people mean by their advice.\n\n\n\n  \nSometimes I wish I could watch other people develop software or solve algorithmic in real time, read their notes and their learning journey in a biographical timeline. When I try to ask other students they might say \"I learnt from a young age from parents or other tutors\", or that \"they made projects that they liked and just coded a lot\",  I don't really get to observe the specifics of what they're doing the way you can study someone when they're playing a sport or some other visible activity. \n\n I was told mathematics was the main foundation behind computer science that is mainly unchanging compared to programming languages, libraries and toolkits which change constantly, I thought it would be best if I invested most of my time into studying math while taking 'intro to CS' and intro to 'x programming language tutorials', just trying to focus on passing my CS degree and computational mathematics first before exploring a specific software engineering discipline.\n\nI thought that once I understood the mathematics understanding how to translate concepts into code would be as straightforward as making functions for arithmetic operations or other ideas people intuitively understand.  But if you brought a mathematician with no programming experience in a structured course they would not understand how to program an addition function in python or C++ either.\n\nI should not have focused so much on math and expected the information to immediately convert to programming skill or at least make the implementation side obvious. In my intro to DSA class we didn’t even use discrete math or linear algebra, so there was no reason to take all 3 classes at the same time with no way to tie the classes together, but the curriculum made me do this. \n\n\n\nEventually in my classes I reached a point where I was told despite how much I tried to study the math and computer science concepts in pseudocode, I couldn't implement anything, i couldn't code. I was confused as I tried to engage as much as I could in my intro to x language-intermediate x language classes, asking questions, going to office hours(which in intermediate java for example was usually swamped because we were given 'real projects'/'toy projects' as assignments after going over a small topic in class, and the professor told us to figure it out)\n\nWhen I asked how I should have learnt to code I was told to mainly \"make more personal projects from scratch\" and just to \"code more\"\n\n  \nI wasn't sure where that meant for me to start.  While I knew I was hardly software engineer material, I thought I was at least making enough progress to code the computer science concepts in my classes but I wasn't, especially since we didn't focus on literal technical problems but toy projects/ \"real world scenarios\" using the algorithm in ways that we couldn't directly google because it was a unique scenario project, and we didn't actually code in class because we were told \"I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science.\" \n\nShould I do leetcode and seek computational problems to solve? I tried that and I was no more prepared for the mini software assignments given in class. \n\nShould I choose a specific field of software engineering and just start learning the tools through example projects before branching off into my own  project ideas? A lot of the programming  libraries/tools were too niche and abstract,  taking away time trying to study a specific library itself rather than the programming/ software engineering principles I was trying to gain from practicing programming with those tools to apply to my classes.\n\nI tried to read books on software design, but the books talked more about general project cycle principles such as readable  and  reusable code, good documentation, but computer architecture talked about low level concepts such as the ALU of which studying wasn't helping me program any better at the time nor did I fully understand.\n\n  \nI started trying to program projects from my imagination, especially since I was told \"don't use tutorials, code from scratch, employers don't care about clone/derivate projects\" which always ended up with me taking a bunch of notes on the documentation trying to study what enumeration is  or watching a bunch of mini tutorials on different classes in a toolkit I thought might be relevant to my project for weeks on end, with no actual progress on the project being made, just dismembered pieces of code in test files which I definitely can't put on my resume either. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We are learning C bitwise operations. \n\nThe question is this: Implement a program to complement all bits in x, except the least significant bit. x is an unsigned binary integer of indeterminate length. Use a bit mask. \n\nThe current code I have works for integers that end in 1, but not for integers that end in 0. Do I have to use if statements or can this be done entirely with bitwise operators?\n\nWhat I have so far is this:\n\n    temp = x & 1 // store LSB\n    x = ~x\n    x = temp | x",

What could possibly be the reason behind this? g++ version on Ubuntu and WSL is the same, so is the block size.\n\nI've handed in my code already so what's done is done on that front. It is a bit of an odd situation though so idk.\n\nEdit: It was somehow the matter of the mktime() function, for some reason on native Ubuntu it occasionally returned different time_t values for tm structs with identical values\n\nEdit: It was actually somehow the matter of my laptop.

For that, I need to design a collection system that reliably gathers publicly available thread metadata from Reddit (titles, timestamps, comment counts, etc.) without breaking any API rules or putting load on the infrastructure.\n\nI’ve tried two approaches so far. First, the official Reddit API, but my application wasn’t approved. Second, I tried using a scraping service, but that returned consistent HTTP 403 errors, which I assume are anti-bot protections.\n\nBefore I build the full system, I want to choose the right engineering approach. My constraints are long-term stability, strict rate limiting, predictable failure behavior, and minimal load on external services. Nothing related to bypassing anything; I just want a clean and reliable pipeline.\n\nThe options I'm evaluating are: building a pipeline around the .json endpoints with strict rate limiting and retry logic, using something like Apify to handle scheduling and backoff, or creating a hybrid setup that treats external data sources as unreliable and focuses on resilient architecture, caching, and backpressure.\n\nFrom an engineering point of view, which approach tends to produce the most maintainable and fault-tolerant system for long-term public-data collection?\n\nI’m not trying to gather private info or circumvent restrictions. This is strictly a systems-design question about building a predictable, well-behaved pipeline. Any advice from engineers who have built similar systems would help a lot.",

So I built a small adaptive learning system on top of an LLM that tries to sit in the middle.\n\nThe system does three things very strictly:\n\n* Error-driven feedback: When you ask for help with your code, the AI prints your code with line numbers and only points to “Line X – syntax error / structure error / logic error / input error”. No full solutions unless you explicitly ask after you’ve tried to fix it.\n* Maximum 2 new concepts per lesson: Each learning unit is allowed to introduce at most two new commands or ideas. If a lesson needs more than that, it’s automatically split into smaller sub-lessons. The idea is to manage cognitive load instead of throwing everything at you at once.\n* Reflection and tracking: After each session, there’s a short reflection (what was hard, what worked, what to focus on next), and the system tracks goals, progress, and repeated error types.\n\nRight now it’s wired for Python (loops, input, error handling, functions, lists, etc.), but the structure is generic: goals (G##), lessons (L## / W## / T##), a command tracker, error plan, progress tracking, learning log. You could in principle swap the content and use the same engine for other things (language learning, math, etc.).\n\nThe whole thing is:\n\n* A GitHub template repo\n* No personal data included\n* Documented so you can understand and change the rules\n\nRepo:  \n[https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-](https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-)\n\nI’d love feedback on:\n\n* Whether this kind of “error-only” feedback actually helps learning\n* How you would extend or simplify it for beginners\n* Any ideas for good Python goals/lessons that fit the “max 2 new concepts” rule",

They're either just not at their desk (taking like their 6th walk of the day, grabbing a snack, coffee, etc), or chatting with the people around them, or doing something else on their computer.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Background: Mid 2022 bootcamp grad. Got a job as a mostly frontend developer for 65k. Was there for \\~1.5 years, after our big project, they laid off about 1/4 of the company.\n\nJust had an 8 round interview process, I thought there wasn't a chance. Got the call, they said it was an easy decision for them and I signed the offer for 115k today. I'm over the moon.\n\n\n\nSo what worked / didn't work\n\nApplying:\n\nHad 3 referrals, none turned into interviews. I think the value of referrals have gone down dramatically in the last couple of years and that a lot of companies stopped giving referral bonuses\n\nI didn't get a single entry / jr level interview. I think the no cs degree hurt for those roles, so many say 1-2 YoE so I thought I was a shoo-in, nah\n\nMy success rate fell sharply after 6 months unemployment. Success rate improved dramatically (only for mobile positions) after publishing a personal project (this was about a year into unemployment, I had a single interview in months 6-12 and it didn't go past hiring manager)\n\nNo interviews from linkedIn job apps, despite targeting same day postings\n\ngot 2 interviews from hiringcafe and an ai auto fill extension (simplify)\n\nI went in-person and dropped off a resume to two local companies that I saw had openings. One gave me an interview (50% success rate, you were right Grandpa)\n\nThe mobile position I got, came from linkedIn. I stumbled across the tech lead of a local company posting about the opening, there was no linkedIn job posting. I messaged him about my app and he said he tried it out, liked it and wanted to interview me.\n\nI think the other 2 or 3 came from hackernews, again, where I was talking directly to somebody technical about my app.\n\nI tried linkedin premium and messaged a ton of hiring managers / recruiters, nothing came from those\n\nI had 6 or 7 interviews in the last year and a half, all above my last role. Was definitely unprepared for the first few, feel I went from jr. to mid level while unemployed.\n\nBut yeah, highest success rate was finding local companies and contacting somebody who was technical (and part of the hiring process) about what I was working on\n\n  \nTechnical Interviews:  \nI was grinding leetcode for a bit but found it not to be worth while (past getting comfortable with mapping and array, obj, string manipulation). I did have some coding challenges but they weren't leetcode mediums or hards, either can you fetch data, format / display / style it or a leetcode easy to see if you can code (though I didn't interview at major companies).\n\n I did have two system designs interviews earlier on that I wasn't prepared for. And one later on that I knew was coming and spent a week cramming for. Did really well in that and moved to final round but didn't get job. My recent interview didn't have a strictly system design round but a lot of topics I had studied did come up in conversation and I'm glad I was able to talk on them\n\nAnother thing that was a huge help was I was MUCH less stressed about the recent interview. I thought I wasn't going to get it, was working as a bartender so had money coming in, might as well see where it goes and try to learn something. Most of the interviews I had when I was deep into unemployment, I would get 2-4 hours of sleep the night before because I was so stressed. Somehow, the night before this company's technical, I had planned on doing leetcode all night but I was strangely tired, thought I wasn't going to get the job anyways and didn't want to waste my night off doing coding problems. I ended up conking out hard way earlier than I typically go to bed and had the best nights rest I've had in two years. I truly don't know how it aligned that way but being well rested was way more valuable than a couple more leetcode problems\n\nBehavioral interviews:\n\nThe 3 companies I interviewed with - post releasing my app - were much more interested in my app than my previous role. They were all for mobile positions.\n\nI also started keeping an interview prep journal that had 6 star stories (and what questions they could be used in) as well as all other questions I've been asked in interviews (and had a separate tab for system design notes)\n\nI would often get a \"how's your week going\" question at the start of interviews. Early into unemployment, I thought, 'I don't want to waste their time', and just say something like, 'It's been a good week, have been looking forward to this interview.' and let them jump into it from there. After it happened a few times I realize they want to see if they can have an actual, casual conversation with you. So in these last few interviews, I always made a point to spend literally a minute, 2 max, chatting. Just something like an event that weekend I was excited for. The recent interview the guy had mentioned having a kid, the next interview I asked what his kid was dressing as for Halloween\n\nThe other thing that was a big help was the CEO really liked me. I really didn't understand the company's industry, so I spent a couple of hours with ai learning about it, making sure I knew some basic terminology, read articles about the company, and had actual, non fluff questions, about the company and the industry for the CEO. In the middle he mentioned being surprised by the questions\n\n\n\n65k -> \\~27/hour -> 115k   \nAgain, absolutely over the moon. Very excited, will be working hard to make sure I continue to grow and never go through such a grueling unemployment period\n\nTl;dr  \nTry talking to technical people directly. Look local. Have some system design knowledge. Build something with users. Be well rested and sociable. Be able to talk about the company, past being a developer. Good luck to those searching and be easy on yourself, it's hard out there.",

Look for quota, OTE, or commission structures - that’s sales, not engineering. Check if the role reports to Sales/GTM instead of Engineering. If responsibilities focus on demos and deal closure rather than production deployments, or you hand things off after the contract signs, it’s not real FDE work.\n\nIn short, read the job description, dont just base everything off the job title.\n",

I'm making 200k, I have  health insurance, my boss is nice, and yet still I may have just completely fucked it up.\n\nBasically, here's the situation: I'm on a small team with just me and my boss. We use an in-house office software with a built-in chat and email, but 99% of the time we just use the chat or talk face-to-face.\n\nHowever, the office software sucks. If you don't use it for an hour, it disconnects without any notification. While you're disconnected, chat messages get sent to email, and don't display in chat when you log back on. The home page displays new email notifications, but only some of them, not all of them. I thought it only filtered automated messages, but I was VERY wrong.\n\nThis week my boss was on a business trip. He was still working in my timezone though so we could talk. I was waiting for some details in the chat, but either I was logged off or he just emailed it directly. Either way, no notification.\n\nThe day after he sent it, I had a day off I scheduled in advance. While I was out, he forgot I had off and sent me an email. Same thing, no notification.\n\nTwo days later, I got a message from him. While he'd remembered I had a day off, he was still extremely pissed that I hadn't seen his emails. He said it was the bare minimum act of communication\n\nAdmittedly, it feels like he'd be right at most other companies, but we'd always used other means of communication. Before he left, he even gave me his phone number saying it's how I should contact him if he wasn't online to recieve chat messages, completely overlooking the email.\n\nRegardless, my contract is supposed to be renewed soon, and now I'm worried it won't be. I'm not sure what to do to hopefully avoid being shitcanned.\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Just in case this would be useful to anyone as a datapoint...\n\n**About me:**\n- US Citizen\n- Graduated in 2022 from an average state school you may or may not have heard of \n- 3 YOE at the time of job hunting, all at one SaaS company in SF (+ 2 internships) \n- Full time experience was all backend development, and I did lead a larger project at my last company so I used that as a talking point in interviews \n- Located in San Francisco, looked to the entire Bay Area for my search. Wasn't open to relocation outside the Bay but that didn't seem to matter thanks to the AI boom... \n\n**Gearing up:**\nTotal time from interview prep to first offer: 3 months (beginning of May 2025 to end of July 2025)\nResources used: Paid for neetcode and the design gurus grokking system design course, and studied them meticulously. Already had LC premium and used that for specific companies. Didn't really do mock interviews because I was an interviewer myself at my last company and already had a ton of practice being on the other side of the table. \n\n**Applications & Interviews:**\nNOTE: All numbers are approximate and may be off by 5 or less, especially for interview counts. I didn't meticulously track everything. \n\nNumber of applications: ~250 sent by me. However, I also got reached out to a lot and pretty much all of my interviews came from recruiters coming to me first, so I can't create a reliable Sankey diagram! I only used 2 referrals from my network and got ghosted by those companies anyway. \n\nMostly targeted full stack roles at mid-late stage startups (Series C+), with the occasional big tech interview if they reached out to me first. \n\nHad 35 recruiter screens -> 32 first round interviews -> 14 second round+ interviews. Many of the first rounds were during my first few weeks studying, I used them to get my feet wet and didn't stress too hard over rejections. \n\n14 second+ turned into 2 offers, 5 rejections, and I canceled 5 final rounds & 2 first rounds myself after signing. \n\nI had ~100 individual interview blocks total, according to my calendar. (not 100 companies, 100 interviews). \n\n**The offer I took:**\n- Series D unicorn healthcare startup, fully remote in SF Bay Area (with the option to go into the office whenever I want, or not.) Big upgrade over my previous hybrid job!! \n- Mid level / level below senior \n- $195,000 base salary ($20k raise over previous job), and some ISOs that I don't consider real money. \n- Full pivot into full stack from my previous 100% backend role\n\n(The other offer was $200,000, upleveled from junior to midlevel and hybrid in SF, but it was SaaS and I was tired of SaaS, plus they told me some stuff about the future direction of the company that I didn't quite like.)\n\n**Insights & Tips**\n1. I got asked a lot less Leetcode and a lot more \"practical\" coding, like writing API endpoints, parsing JSONs, and even writing basic websites from end to end.\n2. Around 3-4 interviewers encouraged AI use during the coding interviews. \n3. LinkedIn pushes recently updated profiles to the top of recruiter searches, so every Sunday I would log in and make some minor change to my profile like adding a period, changing a word, etc. Then I would wake up on Monday with a full inbox. \n4. I went back and replied to all the recruiters and startup founders that had emailed me in the past 6 months. Some were still hiring, others weren't. One very kind startup CEO still chatted with me for 30 minutes and offered to pass my resume on to his founder friends, nothing came of it but he gave me good advice anyway. \n5. I interviewed on top of my day job by doing interviews 8-10 am, working 10-5, and then interviewing again 5-6. I didn't take a single \"sick day\" which I'm super proud of lol. Companies with an East coast presence were open to interviewing me as early as 7 am.\n6. As for how I pivoted to full stack with little to no frontend experience, YOLO I guess? The project I led had a small amount of frontend, and when I had fullstack interviews I did React crash courses and followed along. I got to the point where I knew what to look up for frontend, because most interviewers let you Google stuff on the spot if you look like you know what you're talking about, and just need to double check something etc. ",

        "content": "I’m in my 40s, currently working as an SDE2/Senior-level engineer at a big tech company. Compensation is solid and the work is technically interesting. The flip side is the usual big-tech stress: reorganizations, shifting priorities, constant pace, and the general feeling of volatility.\n\nI’m considering an offer for a “Principal”-level role in local government IT. The job is stable, unionized, slower paced, and has a predictable schedule. The work looks more enterprise/ERP-focused and nowhere near as chaotic as big tech.\n\nMy concerns are:\n\nWhether I’m actually ready for a Principal role: I’ve operated at a mid-to-senior IC level, but I haven’t formally held a Principal title before. I’m worried about stepping into Principal-level expectations in a new domain and whether I’ll be able to perform at the level the role requires.\n\nGetting pigeonholed: Government IT tends to have slower-moving tech and more specialized enterprise systems. I’m concerned that if I spend years there, my skills might narrow and limit future private-sector options.\n\nLong-term compensation ceiling: Government positions have fixed salary steps and a hard cap. Once you hit the top step, raises are basically cost-of-living adjustments. In private tech, there’s still room for higher comp and growth.\n\nI’m trying to balance a more stable and predictable lifestyle with the risks of taking on a bigger role, potentially narrowing my skillset, and reducing long-term earning potential.\n\nIf anyone has moved between private tech and government IT, especially mid-career or at a senior level, I’d really appreciate hearing how it affected your career, confidence, and quality of life.",

I got incredibly lucky with an internship that converted to full-time, so I've never interviewed anywhere lol (the internship didn't have a traditional interview process. I didn't even answer a single technical question.)\n\nRequired to be in another state by fall 2026, which means I need to start looking ASAP. Problem is...I'm in my late 20s and have literally zero job hunting experience.\n\n* **My first question:** How important are portfolio projects for senior-level roles? \n\nI've got a few (including a personal site) and I'm working on wrapping up a bigger Rust project, but I'm worried I'm just wasting my time if employers don't actually care about this stuff outside of entry-level.\n\nI'm also worried staying at one company for 7 years might've hurt me. I'm significantly underpaid for my experience and degree (MS in CS + certs) right now, and I'm paranoid that long tenure looks like I'm either stuck or coasting. I keep hearing conflicting takes: some say it's a red flag for stagnation, others say it doesn't matter.\n\n* **My second question:** Anyone know how this actually plays out in the job market? I'm pretty ignorant about this stuff. Can't change it now, but good to know for the future.\n\n\n\n**TDLR:** What should a senior dev actually focus on when entering the market for the first time?

I currently have \\~4 YOE and am a US citizen (I know this helps when evaluating risk)\n\n1. **Work** \\- Both companies have what I think are interesting work. I put embedded-specific details here for those are interested, but they both feel equally cool - [Embedded Software vs Board Support Package : r/embedded](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1p44co2/embedded_software_vs_board_support_package/). Meta would be more high-level / specific product work while Qualcomm is a more general role where the work will touch many of their products across their portfolio. This makes me wonder if working on a niche application like AR glasses would be better/worse for long-term career development\n2. **Location** \\- Meta would have to be in Sunnyvale while Qualcomm is in San Diego. I currently live in SoCal so I would have a preference to stay here, but I can't deny that there seem to be more opportunities in NorCal. Nonetheless taking Meta would require moving / establishing things in a new location\n3. **Culture** \\- I've been hearing bad things about Meta / Reality Labs, but I'm not sure how true they are since I've been relying on anecdotes from Blind (which is admittedly a negative community). I'm sure Qualcomm has its own pitfalls (e.g. offshoring), but I haven't heard of anything to the severity of Meta's current reputation with stacked ranking and PIPs\n4. **Compensation** \\- Both roles are pretty accurate to their grades on levels.fyi. Qualcomm would be a senior engineer role in San Diego while Meta would be E4 role in Sunnyvale\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I know having the brand name of Meta on a resume does wonders for a career, but I want to make sure I have as complete of a picture as I can.\n\nEdit: since there was some interest in the comments:\n\n* Meta (Sunnyvale) - 193k + 100k RSU/year + 35k sign on\n* Qualcomm (San Diego) - 147k + 43k RSU/year + 35k sign on",

For example, if I took a job with a 50% salary increase for a 5-day schedule, it would end up being only about a 20% increase in hourly pay after adjusting for the extra day and hours I would work. \n\nSo I’m stuck asking myself if a 20–25% hourly increase really worth giving up a 4-day WFH lifestyle?\n\nI’m a CS graduate, but I ended up in this role because the job posting was labeled as Software Engineer. It turns out the only real engineering work was rewriting a legacy system using the Power Platform. After that, it turned into pure dashboards and Power Automate flows on the business side because my manager believed upper management liked fancy, colorful reports that were tangible and made their lives easier.\n\nBefore this job, I was studying AWS, Terraform Linux, and getting into Kubernetes, but I haven’t touched any of that in a year, and I feel like I’m falling behind. If I stay in comfort, I risk stagnating, but at the same time I don’t really know where I can go from here, or what percentage increase in salary or hourly rate is worth leaving this job. \n\nAlso, my company is a large corporate, and one of my goals is to work abroad. I checked their internal positions offering relocation, and almost all of them are either pure engineering or management roles. I don’t think it’s realistic for me to apply to any of these in my current position unless I sharpen my engineering skills, as management is still a pipe dream given that I’m still junior with only about 2 years of total experience.\n\n\nSo essentially my questions boil down to:\n\n1. What kind of pay increase would make you give up a 4-day WFH job? Is 20% hourly increase enough? That’s already roughly a 50% increase in total salary.\n\n2. Should I pivot to a technical path like cloud infra/DevOps, which I plan to study over the next 6 months, or is there a well-paid path using my current skills? Would transitioning to data engineering instead be a better? Is it realistic in that timeframe?",

        "content": "Context: I am a software engineer working at a company that was recently acquired. Currently make 135k. My current company is being merged into a larger parent company and there were some recent layoffs. Management has signaled these will not be the last, and there will be more next year after a 'discovery' phase where they figure out what can be integrated into the parent company's existing software and what cant. Sometime after that (undisclosed time), there will be an RTO to a different city (I am currently WFH). We are currently mostly working on documentation + support work instead of new features. This has resulted in me going on a job hunt.\n\nI have three options:\n\nOffer 1: 165k base salary, 15 days of PTO (WFH). Working on a recently started project modernizing a legacy system (like, lots of logic in stored procedures style legacy) to python / AWS, immediate team and manager seem really nice. \\~20 engineers total in the tech department.\n\nOffer 1 Cons: Company has been owned by private equity for the past 7 years, has  2.7 stars on Glassdoor, mentioning lack of raises, leadership shifting priorities, and layoffs / reorgs, position was a backfill.\n\nOffer 2: 145k base salary, 30k equity in company, unlimited PTO (Mostly WFH, in office \\~2 times per month). Management seems fun (like, trips to Cancun type stuff), really interesting and exciting IoT style work with golang. Company was a Series A startup a few years ago, but is rapidly growing now with lots of customers and doesn't need funding anymore.\n\nOffer 2 Cons: It would just be me and 1 other engineer who is on a contract (my position would be full time) and may or may not convert to full time. The tech side of the company just started and is still a very 'early startup' environment, so I would have to juggle Project Manager + Software Engineer responsibilities. Could be fun, could also be super stressful, especially if the other engineer who seems like would be 'firewall' for the rest of the business leaves after his contract was up.\n\nOption 3. Take neither offer and stay at my current company and keep looking and hope i dont get laid off before i find something better. I have been getting a consistent amount of interviews each month. Seems like the laid off employees at my current company got 2 months severance at least...\n\nWhat are y'all's thoughts?",

This is my first time posting in a CS subreddit so please let me know if this is not the right place for this question.\n\nI've been thinking of switching into CS and finally decided to apply to schools with lots of Co-op opportunities. So far I've applied to bachelor's in UToronto (waiting), Waterloo (i may not meet eligibility requirements as a graduate), UBC (waiting; 20-month 2nd degree program) and UOttawa (got in).\n\n  \nI prefer getting another bachelors since the schools I've picked comes with a good (rigorous) curriculum and a very good selection of co-op options as well as decent hiring rates post-studies. I want a strong, guided foundation even though I've done a little bit of everything by myself out of curiosity and interest (C++ in university courses, Python in high school, JS, html, CSS, AI/ML, Data Science).\n\n  \nHowever my parents think it would be better to get a CS masters directly instead of \"wasting time\" doing another bachelors. The problem is well-reputed schools in Canada don't seem to offer masters without cs or related undergrad. The schools that do offer this option seems pointless to me because the market is already saturated and I feel like I would just be doing it for the sake of having just any CS related education. Plus they don't seem to offer any of the benefits that bachelors does (Co-op for eg).\n\n  \nClearly I'm biased towards doing a bachelors but I don't want to be close minded. I wanna know if I should consider masters as an actual option right away. My main focus is that my education shouldn't look like a drawback to potential employers, and there should be a better chance of employment. \n\n(Also I've read multiple times that strong portfolio and CS-based projects makes you a good candidate and that you don't need formal education but I honestly don't think I can be impressive enough pull that off. I'm willing to put in the work but I also need some structured learning before I can build my portfolio. Plus CS degree is a part of the mandatory requirements for a lot of job listings that I see so I don't want to be ineligible or automatically screened out for good opportunities)\n\nSo what should I do? CS Masters without Bachelors or CS bachelors.\n\n  \n**TLDR**; Are the chances of landing a job with a CS masters without CS bachelors the same as having a CS bachelors? I know landing a job in general would be hard but which offers me a better chance?",

I casually searched for around 5-6 months, really only applying to things that looked interesting, or any interesting recruiter reach out.\n\nMy Results:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png](https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png)\n\n\n\n*Note: these are a bit general numbers. This happened over a few months, so might be +/- one or two things I forgot about*\n\nIn general, I was pretty selective. I had a few dozen recruiter's message me, but only took 10 or so calls. Most were from in office startups that I had no interest in, or non tech companies which I wasn't really interested in.\n\nSome notes on my search\n\n\\- I make around 220k base at my current position, so any job needed to match that number (TC-wise anyway)  \n\\- I preferred remote, but for large public tech companies, was open to moving. But any startup needed to be remote (Unless something like OpenAI, etc, which of course didn't happen)  \n\\- Needed to be at least a tech forward company  \n\\- I only responded to first party recruiters  \n\\- I refuse to do take-home assessments  \n\\- I didn't do any interview prep for any of these, so my failure rate was a bit high\n\n\\--\n\nIn terms of general hiring vibes, I'd say the biggest difference was in the recruiter/HM screens, much more selective there, probably due to how easy it is to AI generate a reasonable looking resume now. I've pretty much never been rejected at that stage, but did end up getting rejected a couple times from HM's after the recruiter screens.\n\nLikewise, a few companies also wanted to do take home assessments before even going to the normal techs screens. I immediately dropped out from those (I hate take homes personally)\n\nOther than that, the general feeling was pretty similar from other times I've been on the market.",

        "content": "A little backstory about myself..\n\nPrior to my job now I was working HVAC for about 6 years, to say the least I was miserable.. Hated my boss, hated just feeling like I wasn't doing any fulfilling, hated that someone said I was going to be a lifer.. Fast forward too 2018, I took the leap, after doing some code academy and attempting to teach myself the basics of code, I applied and was accepted to do a 12 week immersive web dev program in Boston (General Assembly). Right before going to this program, my girlfriend at the time was a dental hygienist, she was making small talk with a client and he mentioned he was a software engineer. She mentioned how i was going to be going to an immersive program in Boston, he gave her his number for me to contact him, i did, we met up for coffee and talked goals and web dev in general. Fast forward to the 10th week of my program, I get a call from that guy and he asked if I wanted interview. I interviewed it was your typical interview but I feel like they were pretty relaxed about it because they knew how green I was. I mean shit, i'm pretty sure the tech challenge they let me use my own personal project I developed through the program.. Anyways they hired me probably believing they could mold me into what they wanted, although there wasnt much molding, there was a lot of extremely late nights of me trying to figure things out because I knew absolutely NOTHING. Long story short there were grueling years of teaching myself a lot but also kind of only teaching myself stuff that would get me through a specific task. I feel like I never really took a step back and really dove into soft skills or design concepts or why you would use a certain pattern for certain scenarios..\n\nNow, 8 years later I'm still at my current company and over the past 3 my company as a whole does not feel secure. I've survived big layoffs, clients leaving, entire company not getting raises, etc. I have a family now, I own a house, and I need security.. I've had one job interview over the past year and I completely botched it. The technical interview I froze, it was plain javascript and I couldn't solve it.. I was so embarrassed and couldn't believe it. Now I feel like if it was nextjs and my companies codebase? I wouldn't have had any issues what so ever because i've been working here for so long and I feel like my knowledge of nextjs is very good but thats not going to cut it if I want a new job, which obviously I do with more security.. Just getting an interview almost seems impossible though, then I'm dreading the whole interview process because quite frankly I feel like my soft skills, tech terminology, and overall understanding of frontend development is lacking and I'm so used to my companies codebase I feel like im going to be a deer in headlights during an interview process.\n\nI just need some advice on how I should go about getting a new job, do I zoom out and go back to strengthening my soft skills of javascript, do I use some platforms like TheGreatFrontend? What are some concepts companies are absolutely looking for that I should either learn or freshen up on? Any advice would be helpful. Please try your best not to tear me apart, I'm a anxiety filled mess at the moment with the thought of losing my job, I have 2 month old baby, a house, and an income needed for us to live.",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Earlier today I posted about feeling discouraged because it seems like, no matter how much I improve, AI will eventually do everything better and faster. The latest Anthropic model announcement pushed me further in that direction, especially after seeing developers say they barely write code now and reading some pretty dramatic predictions about software engineering not existing in a few years from actual Anthropic developers (yes I realize they stand to gain a ton by having people believing this, but I don't know if I have the luxury to hand wave it away).\n\nI am having a hard time seeing a long-term future in this field, which might be influenced by the fact that I am not currently working in it. Still, if I truly believe there is no future for me in this industry, then I need to plan for that possibility. Right now I am thinking that if I do not land a software job by summer 2026, I will go back to school for another engineering discipline, most likely power or mining.\n\nUntil that point (maybe just so I can say that I tried, or because I want to feel less horrible about the student debt I accrued getting this degree), I'm gonna be grinding a ton, trying to land something. If that doesn't work out, then I'm likely gone for good from the industry at this time next year.\n\nI would appreciate any advice from people who have dealt with this kind of uncertainty or who have thoughts on whether setting a timeline like this makes sense. Obviously I cant sit around and hope for the best forever, especially when the clouds on the horizon look darker and darker.",

However I love working at startups and they're generally a pretty flat hierarchy, so I went back and have been here for long enough for us to be profitable.\n\nI had a meeting with the PO that caught me off guard where he called me the \"Senior Data Engineer,\" because we don't use labels like that, and half my job is also Software rather than Data. I guess it's about that time, and a \"a new guy just joined that I've been trying to help get familiar with our product and everything, but I just didn't think about it.\n\nI've been mentoring someone I will call a \"Junior\" for context, someone who has experience in about 80% of the non-dev stuff I have to work on (automation workflows, infrastructure, etc), but 5% for actual code. He is doing fine for those tasks, but he wants to advance into development work. I am trying my best to understand his skill level by giving him different kinds of tasks. I now think I have a grasp on where he is.\n\nI want to ask some Juniors and Intermediates how they feel about:\n\n- Pair Programming\n- Tasks meant to teach them to find stuff in our codebase\n- Writing Unit/E2E Tests\n- Taking solo training courses\n- Encouraging them to spend a week setting up a brand new project in our chosen framework, and meeting to discuss questions, clarification, pair programming, etc. literally at any moment's notice, just to understand the How & Why\n\nI'm not worried about \"wasting time,\" and the PO left it up to me, so I want him to spend a month or so worth of time getting comfortable with the dev work, even if it leads nowhere in terms of output.",

For every task I’ve been given so far, there’s a point where I don’t know what to do after I try figuring out myself and have to ask for help. I have been asked to give ETAs fore and can my very loose estimations were always less than how long it actually took to finish tasks since I barely know what I’m doing. There had also been an instance where I messed up the deployment for some of my changes, and my teammates had to help me rollback. One of the tasks I had been working on were supposed to be finished before this past week, but I couldn’t since the changes were more involved than I initially realized because of differences in the service between non-prod and prod (whereas it worked in non-prod where I had been testing prior). Teammates also had to step in again for that. I’ll even try reading through docs our team has to try to get a better sense of things, just for things to still not click. I know I’m supposed to properly ramp myself up within 2 more months, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to. There was a new task I was working on today, and once again, I got stuck on it and don’t know what to do. I was really hoping to make some progress during the weekend so I can finish it ASAP, but…I guess that isn’t happening anymore.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I should probably cut my losses and focus more energy on getting a new position since people are saying that there’s another layoff in January, and I heard that my organization was going to be impacted. I don’t have any other ground of suspicion of getting laid off, but another intern I knew had gotten laid off during the first wave when he started a few months before me, and I’m one of the least experienced people on my team.

        "content": "I've been trying to get a job for months but it feels like it's getting worse and worse? No positive response in weeks and it's getting close to the point where my parents are going to force me into some random dead end job for the rest of my life. (I don't count the random calls out of nowhere as they're either scam job training or they hang up after realizing I don't have years of experience). I have no confidence I'll ever be able to get out of jobs like that (if I'm working full time in some random back breaking job I won't have time or energy to interview or do anything else, and upward mobility doesn't exist, and once recruiters see my resume with a dead end job on top they will reject immediately because a guy with actual skills wouldn't be forced into a job like that). I'm also not physically strong or sociable so jobs like that would probably kill me after years in them. And it would mentally destroy me too, what's the point of trying at all in school or in general if I can only get a useless dead end job?\n\nI feel so useless, I know I should be spending every day applying to 100+ places and doing useful projects but I'm not very motivated to? I've actively tried to force myself into it, deleting video games off my computer and archiving the folders for most of my useless projects but I kind of relapsed and did more work in those, but I should know those projects are going to absolutely nothing for me useful. I need someone to push me around so I can finally delete them and move onto something that will actually help me. They have no impressive metrics so there is nothing to put in resume bullet points. No recruiter is going to be impressed by an ugly indie rpg prototype or a garbage chess engine that's 100x slower than the stuff you can already get out there. And neither of those projects have a massive CI/CD pipeline or use expensive cloud servers or use Docker or whatever else is on the long list of technologies that are mandatory nowadays\n\nI just don't know what to do? I need to get a good job at some point but it's feeling more and more impossible? This time of the year might be really bad for hiring also, but I feel like I can't wait months to get a job or else it looks like I'm unhireable\n\nResume wise it is pretty unimpressive but I'm losing motivation to try to make \"impressive\" things, I haven't been able to come up with any \"useful\" project ideas that justify me paying money for an enterprise level server for something (found somewhere that said that real projects have to use enterprise level things, free servers are for useless toy projects). I can't \"make something I'm interested in\" because the things I'm interested in are all useless, I need to only work on useful things which means I can't pick something that I like to work on, I have to only work on something that will help me and not just play all day. I don't feel like I'm skilled enough to make a project useful and impressive for a specific company since they have their own experienced developers, who am I to think that I can surpass all of them combined? (Plus even if I spent months on a project like that what's to say their recruiter just rejects me before even seeing the project, or the company just rejects me anyway because they flat out aren't hiring low experience people?)",

Has the role name in the offer and everything, but was placed on the QA Automation team. At first, I did not know much, except that it's not liked, so I gave it a couple weeks, got some tasks, and I realized that I don't like this work at all, it isn't fufilling and I miss development work. I tell this information to my boss, about how the role is misleading and how I want to switch and be given tasks, and if it's possible to switch and they said it can happen, but it takes time and that someone did that after working in qa for a couple years. So, this isn't a good situation for me, I don't want to be stuck doing this work forever, then struggle later getting a dev job. Even hearing the word QA is becoming a trigger word for me, because there's that seperation between being qa and being a dev, and I am not considered a dev.  It sucks knowing that after 4 years of grinding CS work, and doing full-stack projects, that you spend your time running tests and trying to find bugs, but don't get to fix them. Since i only worked here 2-3 months now, should I include this in my resume when I am applying, or pretend it dosen't exist and just apply without it? Also has many people had this issue happen to them? I know it's not the end of the world, but it makes me anxious knowing each day longer I am here, the more I feel like I am settling and i can do better. So I decided to just bite the bullet and start back on applying, but I just want to know whats the best thing for me to do. Thanks for reading.",

However, I really enjoyed my time with B (can't understate this enough), and I know the hours would be considerably better (at least 1h30m less than A, daily).\n\nB is also a much bigger name, and has a couple particularly deep strengths which could enable me to seriously upskill and pivot back to finance if I wanted to. TC grows steadily year-on-year; I think £150-160k TC by year 4.\n\nOn the other hand, I suspect that As comp would grow similarly fast, and probably skews towards big bonuses in particularly good years.

Would they like the passion or shy away because of its focus in games?\n\nI have a couple projects I have worked on through school and outside of school that I have in my current portfolio that I hope would make me stand out as a new grad in the field.

        "content": "Hello, everyone.\n\nI need your help picking a book to expand my knowledge in fundamentals of computer science.\n\nI am a mechanical engineering major, and about 3 years ago I decided to switch careers and learn programming. Thing is, while doing this, I focused more on hands on knowledge that will help me find a job, not fundamentals. I started with Harward's CS50 course for some basics, then learned Java and Spring, basics of SQL and Git, and then a bit of data structures and algorithms. After about 8-9 months, I landed a job and started working.\n\nCurrently, I am feeling that I missed a lot of fundamental topics and I would like to cover the blank spots before I can further improve. I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.\n\nI feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.\n\nHence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.\n\nThanks for reading and your help.",

That made me lose motivation, so I stopped.\n\nLater, I got back into learning again and tried CS50. I watched the first two courses, but then I dropped it because I kept hearing people say the tech field is overcrowded and that learning to code isn’t worth it anymore.\n\nNow I’m a bit older, and I still like tech. I feel like if I put in the effort, I could actually get somewhere. But I’m also scared that after spending years learning and working on myself, it might not matter because so many people already know how to code and still struggle to find opportunities.\n\nSo I’m stuck between continuing with tech or looking for something else. Is there still hope in this field, or am I just wasting my time?\n",

        "content": "Hi guys, I am not sure how common this is but I have had a strange career path so far and I would love to get your advice as to how I should proceed from here on out. I studied Computer Science and graduated with a decent GPA in 2022.\n\nAfter finishing uni, I joined a company which was tech-adjacent. We sold educational robotics products like robots / drones / submarines etc. It was very cool work, but I did not actually program these products for the most part. In my second job, it was completely out of our field, I worked with hotels and sold food products.\n\nAlong the way I have gotten experience and picked up many skills with lots of diversity but little mastery. I have done pretty much every function of a business (except actual cs work) you could imagine to a junior-mid level including but not limited to Operations Management, Accounting, Sales, Marketing, etc.\n\nThis has one one hand I believe has made me quite a well rounded individual which is a jack of all trades, but naturally, I am a master of none and my identity as far as my career is concerned is very much all over the place with no one clear goal.\n\nI left my most recent job due to a change in management, and now I am on the hunt for a job again. My first reaction is to want to get into Data Analytics as I did this in University, enjoyed it and I feel that it is in demand. My second reaction is to do something like Business Analytics as this leverages my business knowledge and tech knowledge but the downside is that it is not very tech heavy. Failing both of these, I believe I could pivot into a project management role.\n\nWith the above context about me, what do you think my next steps should be? I am hoping to get up to speed and clean off the rust in the next month to try and get a job after the new year. If anyone could provide insight or even redirect me to something I might be missing that would be much appreciated. Thank you for the help!\n\nTLDR:\n\n- CS Graduate 2022\n- Worked unrelated jobs 3 years\n- Lots of experience in other business related roles but not CS\n- Looking for a job now back in Data Analysis / Business Analysis / Project Management",

My total compensation is around 115k at 24 years old, and I currently am 8 months on the job. I have 3 years of experience, working in a university position as a data engineer before this role for 2 years.\n\nSo within the stack I'm using, it's mainly PL/SQL and T-SQL - which I guess is fine because that's what I'm using to access big data and work with our internal customers. I do ETL work and requests given by customers using SQL, and of course manage loads every month with on-call/production support.\n\nThe pay is great and I also live at home with my parents, so I am indeed getting comfortable. I'm not in any relationship and I don't really wish to be at all any time soon. The only thing I'm wondering though is how badly I'm hindering my career by staying here skills wise. The data engineering space seems like it is changing a lot, and our tech in our current team doesn't use any of the new tech that's in the current climate.\n\nWhen I first entered this team, I was hoping to use a more modern tech stack, it looks like thought it's a bit limited to just Oracle. I'm fine with the work and I am learning everyday so I'm not complaining about what I have currently. But I do want to progress my career a bit more with more skills. There isn't any Python, Airflow, Spark, AWS, Kafka or any other modern orchestration tools, a bit of a gap in what others would be using.\n\nI'm aware that this is a good position, but I do want to progress as a data engineer and become higher impact in the future for maybe a different company or even a startup.\n\n**If I stay here for too long, would that make me a bit unmarketable for more current positions with more modern stacks?**\n\n**Do I stay 1–2 years and risk locking myself into legacy SQL work, or move now while I’m still early?**\n\n**Is it smarter to grind this job for money or take a risk and pivot sooner?**\n\nIn terms of urgency, I was considering moving out to a different company within 6 to 8 months but just want some advice.\n\nI really want to move to a city as well and move out as well, but with this current position I'm just conflicted on what the move should be. Some have suggested to switch internally within the company, which I could consider. Others have suggested to start applying for other roles in other areas. I want to know some thoughts.\n\ntldr; current position is only Oracle. Worried that it isn't up to date to current climate. What do I do.",
