These present clear violation of subreddit rules, Reddit’s self-promotion guidelines, and FTC disclosure requirements for employee endorsements. I urge you to take action to maintain trust in the channel and preserve community integrity. \n\n1. Verified OpenMetadata employees posting as “fans”\n\n[u/smga3000](https://www.reddit.com/user/smga3000/) \n\nIdentity confirmation – link to Facebook in the below post matches the LinkedIn profile of a DevRel employee at OpenMetadata: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RanchoSantaMargarita/comments/1ozou39/the\\_audio\\_of\\_duane\\_caves\\_resignation/?](https://www.reddit.com/r/RanchoSantaMargarita/comments/1ozou39/the_audio_of_duane_caves_resignation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) \n\nExamples:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1o0tkwd/comment/niftpi8/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1o0tkwd/comment/niftpi8/?context=3)[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nmyznp/comment/nfh3i03/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nmyznp/comment/nfh3i03/?context=3)[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m42t0u/comment/n4708nm/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1m42t0u/comment/n4708nm/?context=3)[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l4skwp/comment/mwfq60q/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l4skwp/comment/mwfq60q/?context=3)\n\n[u/NA0026 ](https://www.reddit.com/user/NA0026/) \n\nIdentity confirmation via user’s own comment history:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nwi7t3/comment/ni4zk7f/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1nwi7t3/comment/ni4zk7f/?context=3)\n\nExample:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kio2va/acryl\\_data\\_renamed\\_datahub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kio2va/acryl_data_renamed_datahub/)\n\n2. Anonymous account with exclusive OpenMetadata promotion materials, likely affiliated with OpenMetadata\n\n[u/Data\\_Geek\\_9702](https://www.reddit.com/user/Data_Geek_9702/)\n\nThis account has posted almost exclusively about OpenMetadata for \\~2 years, consistently in a promotional tone.\n\nExamples:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pcbwdz/comment/ns51s7l/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pcbwdz/comment/ns51s7l/?context=3)[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jxtvbu/comment/mmzceur/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jxtvbu/comment/mmzceur/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19f3xxg/comment/kp81j5c/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/19f3xxg/comment/kp81j5c/?context=3)\n\n**Why this matters:** Reddit is widely used as a trusted reference point when engineers evaluate data tools. LLMs increasingly summarize Reddit threads as community consensus. Undisclosed promotional posting from vendor-affiliated accounts undermines that trust and hinders the neutrality of our community. Per FTC guidelines, employees and incentivized individuals must disclose material relationships when endorsing products.\n\n**Request:**  Mods, please help review this behavior for undisclosed commercial promotion. Community members, please help flag these posts and comments as spam.",

        "content": "Just a Friday rant…I’ve worked on a bunch of data platforms over the years, and lately it’s getting harder to stay motivated and just do the job. When Fabric first showed up at my company, I was pumped. It looked cool and felt like it might clean up a lot of the junk I was dealing with. Now it just feels like it’s being shoved into everything, even when it shouldn’t fit, or can’t fit.\n\nAll the public articles and blogs I see talk about it like it’s already this solid, all-in-one thing, but using it feels nothing like that. I get random errors out of nowhere, and stuff breaks for reasons nobody can explain. It makes me waste hours to debug just to see if I ran into a new bug, an old bug, or “that’s just how it is.” It’s exhausting me, and leadership thinks my team is just incompetent because we can’t get it working reliably (Side note: if your team is hiring, I'm looking to jump).\n\nBut what’s been getting to me is how the conversation online has shifted. More Fabric folks and partner types jump into threads on Reddit acting like none of these problems are a big deal. Everything seems to be brushed off as “coming soon” or “it’s still new,” even though it’s been around for two years and half the features have GA labels slapped on them. It often feels like we get lectured for expecting basic things to work.\n\nI don’t mind a platform having some rough edges. Butt I *do* mind being pushed into something that still doesn’t feel ready, especially by sales teams talking like it’s already perfect, especially when we all know that the product keeps missing simple stuff you need to run something in production. I get that there’s a quota, but I promise I/my company would spend more if there was practical and realistic guidance and not just feel cornered into whatever product uplift they get on broken feature.\n\nAnd since Ignite, the whole AI angle just makes it messier. I keep asking how we’re supposed to do GenAI inside Fabric, there are lots of, “go look at Azure AI Foundry” or “go look at Azure AI Studio.” Or now this IQ stuff that’s like 3 different products, all called IQ. It feels like both everything and nothing at all are in Fabric? It just feels like a weird split between Data and AI at Microsoft, like they’re shipping whatever their org chart looks like instead of a real platform.\n\nHonestly, I get why people like Joe Reis lose it online about this stuff. At some point I just want a straight conversation about what actually works and what doesn’t, and how I can do my job well, instead of just getting into petty arguments",

I am extremely worried because we are essentially building a data product, which means that this person will be tasked with making architectural decisions with no knowledge about data engineering, but also I'm worried about my professional development as I'm MUCH more experienced about data stuff compared to my new manager / team lead so I'm not sure exactly what I can learn from him in that area.\n\nI won't go into details, but essentially we're building data pipelines with complex models that require an understanding of a complex domain, and the result of this processing is displayed on a UI that is sold to the customer.\n\nHas something like this happened at some of your companies?

        "content": "I ran a test on Spark with a small dataset (about 700MB) doing some map vs groupBy + flatMap chains. With just map there was no major memory usage but when shuffle happened memory usage spiked across all workers, sometimes several GB per executor, even though input was small. \n\nFrom what I saw in the Spark UI and monitoring: many nodes had large memory allocation, and after shuffle old shuffle buffers or data did not seem to free up fully before next operations.   \nThe job environment was Spark 1.6.2, standalone cluster with 8 workers having 16GB RAM each. Even with modest load, shuffle caused unexpected memory growth well beyond input size. \n\nI used default Spark settings except for basic serializer settings. I did not enable off-heap memory or special spill tuning.\n\nI think what might cause this is the way Spark handles shuffle files: each map task writes spill files per reducer, leading to many intermediate files and heavy memory/disk pressure. \n\nI want to ask the community\n\n* Does this kind of shuffle-triggered memory grab (shuffle spill mem and disk use) cause major performance or stability problems in real workloads\n* What config tweaks or Spark settings help minimize memory bloat during shuffle spill\n* Are there tools or libraries you use to monitor or figure out when shuffle is eating more memory than it should",

Users get dashboards, visualizations, rich semantic models across multiple environments, and can define invariants/alerts when certain conditions are met or violated.\n\nWe have paying customers and a working product, but the architecture has become more complex and ad-hoc than it needs to be (partly because we optimized for customer feedback over cohesion). And lately we have been feeling as we are dealing with a lot of incidental complexity than our domain itself.\n\nWith transactional apps, there are plenty of opinionated full-stack frameworks that give you auth, DB/ORM, scaffolding, API structure, frontend patterns, etc.\n\nMy question:\nIs there anything comparable for analytics apps — something that gives a unified framework for:\n- ingestion + pipelines\n- semantic modelling\n- supporting heterogeneous storage/query engines\n- dashboards + visualization\n- alerting\nso a small team doesn’t have to stitch everything together ourselves and can focus on domain logic?\n\nI know the pieces exist individually:\n- Pipelines: Airflow / Dagster\n- Semantics: dbt\n- Storage/query: warehouses, Delta Lake, etc.\n- Visualization: Superset\n- Alerting: Superset or custom\n\nBut is there an opinionated, end-to-end framework that ties these together?\n\nExtra constraint: We often deploy in customer cloud/on-prem, so the stack needs to be lean and maintainable across many isolated installations.\n\nTIA.",

        "author": "ShallowSeashore",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am a 36-year-old accountant working in the UAE passionate about data and automation. I have been with a financial services company for more than 10 years. Over the years, my work has evolved: I started in front-office operations, then moved into complex reconciliations, later handled end-to-end accounting (A to Z) for a sister company, and eventually returned to financial services.\n\nMy role has never been clearly defined. I am usually brought in to solve problems. I have access to an Oracle database now and I know basic SQL (not advanced). I also have strong Excel and VBA skills. I’ve regularly used these skills to solve operational problems, build logic, help write scripts, and set rules in vendor-provided tools to automate reconciliations. I also helped create Excel templates for reporting.\n\nI completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, along with SQL courses and basic Python, although I can’t recall everything well now. I’ve done some reconciliation work in BigQuery using SQL (often with ChatGPT support), but in my actual day-to-day job I mostly use standard queries like SELECT, GROUP BY, WHERE, and HAVING—nothing very advanced.\n\nMy dilemma is this: my company has huge backlogs, but the core problems are not about writing the right query or automating something. The real issues are poor initial setups, incorrect postings, bad historical decisions, and choosing the wrong cheap vendors to cut the cost. We’re trying to “clean the garage,” but the garage is fundamentally broken—missing data, open loops, and structural issues that can’t realistically be fixed.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that old staff are defensive. They won’t allow corrections that might expose their past mistakes because it affects their reputation. The expectation is: you’re here to fix things, but without the authority or data needed to actually fix them.\n\nBecause I commute around 5 hours a day, I arrive at work already exhausted. I struggle to learn new skills consistently. This has left me stressed, stagnant, and feeling useless—trying to clean deeply broken systems alone, with no real progress in either my career or my technical growth.\n\nSo I am stuck between these options:\n\n1) Stay with the company, learn very slowly, continue firefighting, take blame for issues I didn’t create, remain stressed, and feel that my career and skill set are not progressing.\n\n2) Go back to my home country, focus seriously on learning (properly and deeply), work on real projects, join something structured like Zoomcamp or another bootcamp, and try to move into freelance or remote work. I see people around me leveraging new tools, AI, automation, and platforms like n8n—while I feel stuck in a toxic environment with almost no time or energy to grow. My fear here is losing time and professional reputation.\n\n3)  Any other option I’m not seeing?",

If you finish Fundamentals, we have advanced modules (Orchestration, Custom Sources) you can take later, but this is the best starting point. Or you can jump straight to the best practice 4h course that’s a more high level take.\n\n**The Holiday \"Swag Race\"** (To add some holiday fomo)\n\n* We are adding a module on Data Quality on **Dec 22** to the fundamentals track (green)\n* The first 50 people to finish that new module (part of dlt Fundamentals) get a swag pack (25 for new students, 25 for returning ones that already took the course and just take the new lesson). \n\n# [Sign up to our courses here!](https://dlthub.learnworlds.com/courses?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=xmas_education_2025&utm_term=r_dataengineering)\n\n# Other stuff\n\nSince r/dataengineering self promo rules changed to 1/month, i won’t be sharing anymore blogs here - instead, here are some highlights:\n\nA few cool things that happened\n\n* Our pipeline [dashboard](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/dashboard) app got a lot better, now using Marimo under the hood.\n* We added [Marimo](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/dataset-access/marimo) notebook + attach mode to give you a SQL/python access and visualizer for your data.\n* Connectors: We are now at [8.800 LLM contexts](https://dlthub.com/workspace) that we are starting to convert into code - But we cannot easily validate the code due to lack of credentials at scale. So the big deal happens next year end of Q1 when we launch a sharing feature to enable using the above + dashboard for community to quickly validate and share.\n* We launched early access for dltHub, our commercial end to end composable data platform. If you’re a team of 1-5 and want to [try early access, let us know](https://info.dlthub.com/waiting-list). it’s designed to reduce the maintenance, technical and cognitive burden of 1-5 person teams by offering a uniform interface over a composable ecosystem.\n* You can now follow [release highlights here](https://dlthub.com/docs/release-highlights) where we pick the more interesting features and add some context for easier understanding. DBML visualisation and other cool stuff in there.\n* We still have a [blog](https://dlthub.com/blog) where we write about data topics and our roadmap.\n\nIf you want more updates (monthly?) kindly let me know your preferred format.\n\n  \nCheers and holiday spirit!  \n\\- Adrian",

        "author": "Captain_Strudels",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Went from senior analyst for a decently large tech company to intermediate engineer for an org a bit further along than \"startup\". I'm desperately trying to move my career to something closer to \"software engineer with data skills\" but I can't seem to land the right role. The org I've been with for the past year-ish has been focused on very grimy, hands-on data migrations for individual clients into our system - data entry with extra steps. I'm trying to take on projects that solve bigger problems, like getting involved with fleshing out our warehouse and providing reporting views for all of our customers rather than bespoke reports for individual customers.\n\nHowever the business seems REALLY keen on just keeping me in a little silo and handing off the important projects to our devs. I'm told migrations are the #1 priority, so proper pipeline building is sitting elsewhere as I keep the lights on. The migration work is absolutely soul destroying and mind numbing, but the volume of it keeps me from progressing more meaningful internal projects for my career.\n\nWhats more, the business has identified individual customer bespoke report building as an untapped revenue stream and is prepping to shift me much more onto it, so I seem to have even less room to negotiate doing anything else. And my attempts at working closer with the devs was dashed as we recently underwent something of a restructure that silo'd the data team further from them.\n\nI feel like my org just needs a cheap grunt to process customer data instead of an engineer, and that's totally cool, but I can't tell if my inability to climb internally or find a better role elsewhere is because I keep landing roles that fundamentally won't progress me or if I'm not learning the right skills in my own time. \n\n* I think my SQL skills are great - not like \"I can do the craziest shit in SQL\" amazing, but I've always been one of the better SQL writers in my orgs. I don't think I have much to say here.\n\n* I think my Python skills are mediocre but not a complete handicap. This year, since starting my new role, I've made some basic scripts to help me with processing data before pushing into our system, mainly with Polars/Pandas. But frankly this was largely prompted so I could deliver at speed. I'm fine with reading and debugging code on my own. But I've never been in much of a situation where I've needed to write code for the business, and when I review code written by our senior devs, I can tell I have no idea about proper project structuring. In prior analyst roles I mainly worked with R to solve complex data problems, so I'm not that unexposed to more traditional programming languages.\n\n* I haven't really had to work with LINQ but I've had exposure. It doesn't seem to come up in job listings so I assume it's more for SWEs who happen to be doing some data work in C#?\n\n* re: cloud tech, I'm not sure if I'm bringing anything to the table. Current org uses Azure, last org used GCP, haven't worked with AWS before. But ultimately none of this has affected me beyond using the company's choice of data interface, eg SQL Server, BigQuery, etc. In my current org I am lightly dabbling in Azure-specific key vaults and blob storage, but I don't know if I should suddenly be throwing this on the CV.\n\n* I think my GIT is fine? Like I'm not rebasing branches but I'm able to do the basics to contribute to a code base.\n\n* Soft skills I don't have the best measure on. I think they're good given my prior senior experience for a well-renowned org. My \"manager\" (part of senior leadership but the org is quite small so touches base once a week to confirm work is on track) suggested I consider trying to become the data team leader. I don't know if this is realistically happening in my time here.\n\nBut then I look at senior roles and I don't feel I qualify. There's not much which I think is a product of the global market being a bit shit, and particularly where I live has been hit pretty hard. But the few roles there are skills like advanced Python or specific cloud tech exposure. And I'm like \"I could probably lie and learn it on the role\" but I'm worried I'm giving myself too much credit.\n\nIs this a common situation to be in? Is there a way out? Do I just need to grind out Python on my own time for like 6-12 months before I'm allowed to be senior?",

I did this to mirror how our source system handles its types.\n\nNow since doing this, my data contract is busted. Whenever I run against the model it just fails pointing at the breaking change. To our end users, floats to fixed precision numeric shouldn't matter.

When I joined, most of our data workflows were built in n8n and AWS Lambdas, so my job became maintaining and automating these pipelines. n8n currently acts as our orchestrator, transformation layer, scheduler, and alerting system basically our entire data stack.\n\nWe don’t have heavy analytics yet; most pipelines just extract from one system, clean/standardize the data, and load into another. But the company is finally investing in data modeling, quality, and governance, and now the team has freedom to choose proper tools for the next stage.\n\nIn the near future, we want more reliable pipelines, a real data warehouse, better observability/testing, and eventually support for analytics and MLOps. I’ve been looking into Dagster, Prefect, and parts of the Apache ecosystem, but I’m unsure what makes the most sense for a team starting from a very simple stack.\n\nGiven our current situation (n8n + Lambdas) but our ambition to grow, what would you recommend? Ideally, I’d like something that also helps build a strong portfolio as I develop my career.\n\n\nObs: I'm open to also answering questions on using n8n as a data tool :)\n\nObs2: we use aws infrastructure and do have a cloud/devops team.

        "content": "Hey all, I had an idea for a data lake visualization tool but I don't know if this is a pain point that other engineers have as well. When I used to work on a team that built a data lake on top of AWS technologies (S3, DMS, Redshift, Glue, Athena, Lake Formation, etc) I found it a bit hard to visualize the data flow since everything was a bit scattered, though having the architecture diagram helped a little bit. Aside from visualization, the AWS monthly bill was eye watering and it had a bunch of operational issues. Observability was a bit of a pain too since we had to create alarms for each table and each database in Glue. This is just my experience from working on a data lake that was built from scratch.\n\nThis might be a stupid idea but I was thinking about possible ways to make it easier to build data lakes and manage everything in an all-in-one platform, from prototyping to testing to observability. Especially for smaller companies that don't have the luxury of spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars per month in infrastructure costs, they can use smaller machines to setup a data lake and expand it as they go. To start off, the idea is to build a visualization tool where you can use your choice of hosting / tools, for example S3 or your own blob storage, and execute scripts to perform transformations on that data and build a data lake from there. It would include ways to automate observability by automatically setting up alarms as you connect different pieces together.\n\nIs this a pain point that others face as well? Does something like this exist already? And would something like this be worth building?",

        "content": "I have created an open-source \\[protobuf schema-based fake data creation tool\\](https://github.com/lazarillo/protoc-gen-fake) that I thought I'd share with the community.\n\nIt's still in \\*very early\\* stages; it does fully work and there is some documentation, but I don't have nice CI/CD GitHub Actions set up for it yet, and I'm sure as folks who are not me start using it, they will either submit issues or code improvements, but I think it's good enough to share with an avant garde group willing to give me some constructive feedback.\n\nI have used protocol buffers as a binary format / hardened schema for many years of my data eng / machine learning career. I have also worked on lots of brand new platforms, where it's a challenge to create realistic, massive scale fake data that looks believable. There are nice tools out there for generating a fake address or a fake name, etc., and in fact I rely upon the nice Rust \\[fake\\](https://github.com/cksac/fake-rs) package. But nothing did the \"final step\", IMHO, of taking a schema that has already been defined and using that schema to generate realistic, complex fake data of exactly the structure you may need.\n\nAt its core, I have used protobuf's \\[options\\](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#options) as a mechanism to define what sort of fake data you want to generate. The package includes two examples to explain itself, here is the simpler one:\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n    syntax = \"proto3\";\n    package examples;\n    \n    import \"gen_fake/fake_field.proto\";\n    \n    message \n    User\n     {\n      option (gen_fake.fake_msg).include = true;\n      \n    string\n     id = 1 [(gen_fake.fake_data).data_type = \"SafeEmail\"];\n      \n    string\n     name = 2 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = {\n        data_type: \"FirstName\"\n        language: \"FR_FR\"\n      }];\n      \n    string\n     family_name = 3 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = {\n        data_type: \"LastName\"\n        language: \"PT_BR\"\n      }];\n      repeated \n    string\n     phone_numbers = 4 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = {\n        data_type: \"PhoneNumber\"\n        min_count: 1\n        max_count: 3\n      }];\n    }\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAs you can see, you add the \\`gen\\_fake.fake\\_data\\` option type, providing things like the data type, the count of repetitions, and you can supply a language. In the example above, you would get a \\`User\\` type of data object created with fake data filed in for the UUID, first name, family name, and phone numbers.\n\nI'm hoping this can be useful to others. It has been very helpful to me, especially when testing for corner cases like when optional or repeated values are missing, ensuring UTF-8 is being used everywhere and, most importantly, being able to generate the SQL code and whatnot needed for generating downstream derived data before the backend has all the tooling in place to be able to supply the data formats that I need.\n\nAs an aside, this also helps to encourage the \\[data contract\\](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/data-contracts) way of working within your organization, a lifesaver tool for robustness and uptime of analytics tools.\n\n  \n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Maybe a dumb question, maybe not.  In your data team, do you conduct solution design reviews?  Do you even have a deliberate solution design phase?\n\nI might be wrong in my usage of \"solution design\"; go ahead and correct me if so.  What I mean is more simply - how do you intend to achieve the required output, or meet the requirements?\n\nContrived example: What they want is the classic \"build a report\".  Or maybe just the data model to hand over to someone else to build a report with.  Raw data is not ingested.  So, let's say that simply, you have to ingest, model, and deliver.\n\n* But what does the development of that outcome look like?\n* How do you break down the work?\n* What objects are you going to create?\n* Where do you put this information and decision points?\n* Does a peer review this \"design\"?\n* Who \"sets\" this design?\n\nThis is where I might be venturing off topic, but it's why I'm asking - how do others in the industry do this stuff, and to what standard?  I'm not above thinking I might be looking for problems where there are none, or making drama and pointing fingers.  On the other hand, maybe my concerns are valid.\n\nI'm the senior in my team (of two ICs).  Not the manager, but the tech \"lead\".  I've talked quite a lot with my more junior colleague about the benefits of planning stuff out, coming up with a \"design\", and going over it together.  Two sets of eyes and all that.  IMO it's a fundamental development concept.  Applicable to data work as much as baking a wedding cake.\n\nI don't see a lot of planning, or pipeline and data model design being done.  Maybe it happens on a paper notebook?  That's fine to an extent, but it doesn't appear to be transferred to the ticket system, DevOps items, or even a Word doc in SharePoint.  We have regular time slots to discuss current work and otherwise chat generally about what we do.  It's meant to be pretty informal.  This is sometimes when we might do a \"design review\" but it tends to be based on verbal description of what is being done, and a remote view of developmental code.  I'll give feedback, but it's 50/50 if it drives any change.\n\nWe use branching and PRs with reviews.  The PR review has become an opportunity for reviewing the overall approach and design as much as code review.  But at that point, it's sort of too late to be challenging or making suggestions about the overall design.  There's been more than a few occasions where I know we have to deliver - value to the business! - but I'm seeing technical debt in the future.  Undocumented, sometimes inconsistent, has the feel of thrown-together.\n\nI want to bring it up with my manager, I just need to frame it well.  It could easily come across as complaining about someone who simply has a different work style to me.\n\nAny words of wisdom from the sub?",

The client has an agreement with different partners and access to their data.  \n\n  \n**The situation:** Currently our client has data from a platform, which does not show everything and often leads to extract data and do the calculation in Excel. The platform has an API, which gives access to raw data, and require some ETL - pipeline. \n\n**The problem:** We need to find a platform, where we can analyze data and visualise it. The problem is, we need to come up a with a platform that can be scalable. By scalable, I mean a platform, where the client can visualise their own data, but also for different partners.\n\nThis outlines a potentiel challenge, since each partner need access, and we are talking about 60+ partners. The partners come for different organisation, so if we setup a Power BI setup, I guess each partner need a license. \n\n**Recommendation**\n\n\\- Do you know a data tool, where partneres can access separately their data? \n\n\\- Also depending on the tool, what would you recommend to the data transformation in the platform/tool, or in another database or script? \n\n\\- Which tools would make sense to lower the costs? \n\n",

        "author": "CalendarNo8792",

        "content": "Hi, I am new to data engineering and software dev in general.\n\nI've been tasked with creating an AI Assistant for a management service company website using opensource models, like from Ollama. \n\nIn simple terms, the purpose of this assistant is so that both customer clients and operations staff can use this assistant to query anything about the current page they are on and/or about their data stored in the db. Then, the assistant will answer based on the available data of the page and from the database. Basically how perplexity works but this will be custom and for this particular website only.\n\nFor example, client asks 'which of my contracts are active and pending payment?' Then the assistant will be able to respond with details of relevant contracts and their payment details.\n\nFor db related queries, i do not want the existing db to be queried. So i though of creating a separate backend for this AI assistant and possibly create a duplicate db which is always synced with the actual db. This is when i looked into datalakes. I could possibly store some documents and files for RAG (such as company policy docs) and it will also store the synced duplicate db. Then the assistant will be using this datalake instead for answering queries and be completely independent of the website.\n\nIs this approach feasible? Can someone please suggest the pros and cons of this approach and if any other better approach is possible? I would love to learn more and understand if this could be used as a standard practice. ",

I've seen many companies use cron jobs, or custom job managers, b/c commercial solutions were too heavy, but all fell short in either missing DAG support, or missing cleanly managing jobs across deployments.\n\n\\- DataFrame storage library for pandas / polars. I've seen many companies use pandas/polars, and persist dataframes as csvs, only to later break the schema, or not maintain schemas correctly across processes or migrations. Maybe some wrapper around a db to maintain schemas and manage migrations would be useful.\n\nWould love any feedback on these ideas, or anything else that you are interested in seeing in an open source project.",

Since it's not that complicated of a task? \n\nI also wonder if spooldir wouldn't have to read all the file in memory to parse it ? Because my files size could vary from little as 1mb to hundreds of mb.\n\nAnd also, I would love to have your opinion about combining my custom script + spooldir , in a way where my script generates json header files in a file monitored by a spooldir connector?",

I then moved on to verify if a string was an isogram, and I can't even figure out the logic without the code being too redundant or straight up bad.\n\nI see literally everybody else around me get the logic in their codes just fine, but somehow I struggle too much and end up overthinking the solution too much, and it's not even good. So how can I be good at coding logic? How can I write good code without struggling?\n\nI know you may say that consistency and hard work are key, but no matter how hard I work and how consistent I am I always end up in the same spot. Any help?",

Mostly I am just feeling wrecked on a daily basis because of my lack of skills. The worst part is that there are people much younger than me here that are beasts at this. I am part of 2 projects, 1 is a Saas where I'm mostly doing front-end debugging and even adding elements as I am tasked using laravel.php, js and html in which I find im doing okay in and not using AI a lot. The other is a tool for the company that analyzes pdf pages and which will have a pipeline translation for the text, using python, and this one I am using mostly AI as I never coded in python before and it was handed to me promptly when I started. Now the stress of this 2nd project plus my lack of skill made me use chatgpt A LOT. Adding on top of that I live in a country where people will literally belittle you and throw irony at most things if you prove incompetent, which I am feeling a bit. Of course I try my best to see the logic in what is going on as I had no idea what the process was, now I can explain it at least when people ask and so on, plus seniors have been giving me hints and steps to take to make it better. Now the thing is, if I want to start from scratch a new project I am doomed. And this has just been going into my mind lately and even lost sleep over hiw useless I am. I don't know how you guys handle this stuff and I would love your advice and the whole thing. This job and career path is actually a decent thing to follow through as otherwise I would be forced to take up minimal wage jobs again, which is not ideal. If you have any advice for me I thank you.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice.\n\nI’m 29 and I’ve been working as a frontend developer for about five years. Lately, I’ve been feeling stuck: my current company no longer offers growth opportunities, either financially or professionally. Overall, it feels like a stagnant situation.\n\nThis has been weighing on me for a while and I feel like 2026 might be the right year to make a change, starting with improving my English, but also taking a serious step forward in my career.\n\nA bit of context about the situation here in Italy:\n\n* Being specialized only in frontend isn’t a highly in-demand skill.\n* On top of that, I keep receiving job offers with salaries that are honestly discouraging and make me feel undervalued.\n\nThat said, I want to invest both in my English and in my technical skills, but I’m not sure which direction to take. Here are some of the ideas I'm considering:\n\n* Buying several courses on Udemy and studying deeply to strengthen my knowledge, improve my CV and hopefully find better opportunities.\n* Looking into more structured, higher-quality courses (I’m willing to spend a few thousand euros if it’s truly worth it) that might offer stronger guarantees or even connections with companies. I know that in some fields these programs help people land jobs quickly, but I’m not sure if this model works in IT.\n* Broadening or diversifying my skill set: learning Three.js to specialize in a niche area, moving toward a full-stack role or even switching to game development, which has always interested me. I’m also open to exploring other promising or highly-requested fields.\n\nFor context, I don’t have a university degree. I’m also seriously considering relocating abroad, actually, that’s one of my main dreams right now, because I’d really like to gain international experience.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n29-year-old frontend dev in Italy feeling stuck with no growth. Considering improving English, taking courses (Udemy or premium programs), shifting to full-stack or gaming or something else and maybe moving abroad. Looking for advice on how to level up my career in 2026.",

My question is, do you guys have any fun project ideas I could do that would help me break into the field? Also, what languages/stacks would you recommend for these kinds of projects? I am currently learning C and would like to also learn C++. Python would also be great to know, as I have read that it is pretty heavily used in this line of work. Thanks!",

        "content": "Hi, I'm currently learning Java in my senior year of high school, and I got my Python certification a couple years ago. Please do let me know if this happens to be just a Java thing so I can instead ask on that sub.\n\nSomething I've noticed particularly recently is that, when trying to make something too far past the kind of things we learn about in class, I end up encountering a problem that challenges how I understand the way Java works.\nA good example of this is when I found some fairly basic code somewhere (the context & specifics of which I've forgotten) that created a \"new Main\" object. This threw me for a loop, as I've really just seen \"Main\" as a container for code that runs when starting a program, and never considered it as an object. I also then realized I have no clue what the \"(String[] args)\" bit means in the main method.\n\nSo, why are the \"basics\" of programming languages (or again, maybe just Java) things like printing \"hello world\" before you deeply understand what a class is and why the print command is in one?\n\nPost-script: A few other examples of being taught a specific use for something without knowing what it does exactly\n(Side note: \"for some reason\" here just means I didn't know the reason, not that it's unreasonable)\n\n- Printing text, which for some reason requires me to add \"System.out.\" beforehand\n- Creating a Scanner object to read user text input, which for some reason requires me to specify \"(System.in)\"\n- Catching all errors, which for some reason requires me to specify \"(Exception e)\"\n- Fixing a Scanner after inputting a number so it correctly takes text input, which for some reason is as simple as executing the command \".nextLine()\"\n\nEDIT: The (quite helpful!) responses to this were a lot longer than I expected lol, I believe my questions have been answered. Thank you!",

This is however, a question to those curious minds wanting to understand and learn OpenGL. Or even just want to know how computer graphics works in general. \n\nFirst, some context.\n\nA while ago I undertook the arduous task of learning OpenGL. From all the basics of drawing primitives and up to advanced concepts such as compute shaders and volumetric cloud rendering. The entire process was an immense learning curve and honestly felt like I was relearning how to program. The result is a procedurally generated universe where you can explore endless galaxies and solar systems. However, it is still unfinished and I will continue working on it.\n\nI found that while learning OpenGL you are bombarded with terminology, and it can be quite difficult to take these concepts and develop your own ideas. So, I was thinking of making a series that introduces you into the concepts needed, and develop an intuitive understanding of graphics programming. Then each concept we learn we can apply that to our custom program.\n\nSo my question is, would any of you be interested in this? Would you have any recommendations? Or should I scrap this idea? I already have a 'thumbnail' (not a very well thought out one) that I put together if anyone would like to see it. I will provide a link to a google docs if that is allowed. Once again, it is an unfinished project but I will continue to develop it and add new features as the series continues.\n\nOnce again, sorry if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to.\n\nThank you! :)",

Alsooo i wanna learn game dev not front end anymore so focusing on c#, python, java etccc.  Thank you so muchhh! ",

I have also had Application Support roles where I have spent most of my time in SQL, querying data and carrying out data fixes. \n\nAt another role, one of our devs destroyed the test DB as they forgot to include \"BEGIN TRANSACTION\" on a script they were testing.\n\nFinally managing Database clusters. Yeah this is a thing. \n\nSo where does an ORM fit into all of this, in a real world setting. Yeah its kind of nice in my simple app, defining a single table basically using OOP. \n\nBut I feel I am missing something vital.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "For context, I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.\n\nLatin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.\n\nFor example, lets take the word \"Servus\", which means (a male) slave. (Dont be scared, its a unfortunately very common word in the roman time period, in which most of the training texts are settled). \n\nIn the nominative case, its just \"Servus\", while the genitive case has \"servi\", the dative has \"servo\" and the accusative case has \"servum\" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations).\n\nBut then there are also the plural forms, which are \"Servi\", \"servorum\",\"servis\" and \"servos\" respectively.\n\nAnd nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.\n\nThis requires me to somehow construct something that can handle a lot of those cases, the question is just, how.\n\nMy first instinct was creating a Noun-Class (Java) and then create a constructor that takes the word stem and the grammatical gender and then write methods that return the fitting suffix based on the context that is called.  \nThis looks then like this:\n\n    public String getNominativeSingular() {\n        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\n        stringBuilder.append(stem);\n        String suffix = \"\";\n        switch (gender){\n            case \n    NEUTRUM \n    -> {\n                suffix = \"um\";\n                break;\n            }\n            case \n    MASCULINUM \n    -> {\n                suffix = \"us\";\n                break;\n            }\n            case \n    FEMININUM \n    -> {\n                suffix = \"a\";\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        stringBuilder.append(suffix);\n        return stringBuilder.toString();\n    }\n\nIn a vacuum this approach is fine, but it feels like this might cause more work than actually necessary in the long run. Imagine this as a big table with multiple dimensions. What i could imagine would be creating a big Array with multiple dimensions that have a size based on the amount of states that the given properties can have. Does this sound like it makes sense or are there some patterns i potentially could utilise?",

E.g. when referring to the structure of a complex class, can I call it  - say - the 'class's schema' ?\n* Does the phrase \"schema migration\" only ever refer to migrating between database versions ? Or can I use it in other contexts as well ? E.g. if I'm changing the structure, property fields and public API methods of some core classes, can I refer to it as a \"class schema migration\" ?\n* If the answer to any (or both) of the above is no, what would be the correct term(s)/phrase(s) to use for the examples I listed ?",

I had an idea on how to go about it, but while talking with one colleague his words discouraged me from this initial idea.\n\nSo, one of us thinks that I should pick up a project, design it in broad terms, do some research on what technologies make sense for it, then learn them as I work on the project.  \n  \nThe other thinks that I should make a list of topics (design patterns etc) and technologies I would like to learn, find some solid resources, follow them. As I follow the concepts I also do exercises or make up examples to apply the knowledge / tinker with the different info. As knowledge accumulates, I revisit these exercises and see if there are better ways to do those things and why.

When I thought about changing careers last time I still overlooked an MS in CS because I just thought I wasn’t someone capable of it.\n\nMy current career is very stable and comfortable, but I can shake the itch to learn coding and be an SWE in some capacity. I love to create, build, and problem solve, and I’ve become deeply fascinated with AI. I did some searching and saw it isn’t totally unfathomable to be a self-taught SWE.\n\nI’ve already built out a roadmap to learn some languages (starting with Python) and build some projects to try and transition careers to a backend role. I’ve been going at it for a few weeks and really love it, and spend most of my free time learning.\n\nThat said, the idea of teaching myself a skill and transitioning into a new industry still sounds a bit optimistic sometimes, especially in the current job market. Seeing as I am still in grad school, I won’t have the money to get another MS for a while which is why i’m opting for self-taught.\n\nI know there are success stories of people switching careers into SWE, and I have seen some great insight on this and similar subs, but I’d love to get any guidance and/or inspiration from anyone with a similar background to mine on how they navigated transitioning careers as a self-taught programmer. Thank you in advance! \n\nEdit: My current job / career path is very comfortable and stable which is a plus, meaning I have a lot of time to self-study and apply on my own terms at my own pace. I’m hoping to be application ready in 12-18 months",

Each piece of domino can rotate freely.

I have two main questions:\n\n1. How is the board generated? (Note: the holes can sometimes be in a loop (like today), or be jammed all together into a irregular piece, or a regular piece, so it can't be simply like a grid)\n\n  \n2. How do you verify that there is only one placement on the board? (i.e. how do you build a constraint solver such that you can verify there is only this solution?)\n\n2b. How to quantify the difficulty of a puzzle? (steps needed to solve? How many possible combinations?)\n\n\n\n\\--my thoughts--\n\nFor my first question, I thought of generating e.g. a 8x8 grid, then deleting all the empty spaces, but how do I ensure that sufficient amount of dominoes stick together and form a clump, instead of discrete dominoes floating inside the grid?\n\nFor my second question, of course I can write a program to test all the combinations, but factoring in the orientation of the dominoes, there are at least 12! \\* 4 (1.9 billion) placements, and it can be displaced (AB , CD) vs (XA, BC, DX), so its much more than that.",

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nHow do you abstract CRUD methods and still maintain flexibility?  \nIs DRY worth it when you don't even know what will be changed in the future?\n\nHere is an example from the current API (mainly \\`insert\\`, \\`update\\`, and \\`delete\\` methods):\n\n[https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/customer/customer.repository.ts](https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/customer/customer.repository.ts)\n\n[https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/customer/customer.repository.ts](https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/customer/customer.repository.ts)\n\n[https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/order/order.repository.ts](https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/order/order.repository.ts)\n\n[https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/product/product.repository.ts](https://github.com/azuziii/inventory-api/blob/main/src/modules/product/product.repository.ts)\n\nMy \"experience\" with DRY\n\nI've been remaking an API to learn design patterns. And one of the things I've been going out of my way to avoid is abstracting the repositories. The reason behind that is, the first few versions of this API (Files are lost) I did exactly that, everything worked really well until I had to do major changes in one of them. And since everything was super tied together any change I did would require me to change the others or add new methods that will handle the new changes. I did find some work around at the time but they were not great and I ended up remaking the whole thing with out abstracting the repositories again.\n\nOne of my main problems at the time with DRY was adding logic to the try/catch block that was abstracted. That's why I'm searching for a solution that's is flexible enough to allow this.\n\nThe API isn't done, there are like 100 things to be added, that's why I've been hesitant of abstracting them.\n\nI will be honest, the first few versions were bad, really really bad, horrible, the worst thing you will ever see (service logic mixed with repositories...) and I do believe that's part of it why I couldn't properly separate them. The current one isn't the best yet but it's a day and night difference from the older ones, I'm still learning on how to do things the right way, and that's why I'm posting this.\n\nIDK why I was embarrassed about posting this.",

        "content": "Senior software engineer with 9YOE.\n\nI got an offer for a fully remote role earlier this week. I negotiated with them with a higher base and told them that I'm in process with Meta (L5). With some back and forth, today they reached out and told me that they're willing to meet my asking base salary, which is higher than their cap for the role. I can tell that they want me and I also told them that I'm willing to stop my process with Meta if they can meet my requirements. They did, and now I'm wondering if I should cancel my final rounds with Meta next week. Regardless I will choose the fully remote role since even if I pass Meta, the 2-3 days hybrid in office requires me to uproot my family and relocate probably, and I do have a 18-month old toddler so work/life balance matters a lot to me now.\n\nSo for now, I'm thinking what's the point of doing the interviews if I'm not going to take the offer. Plus I've been preparing for this round for months, doing leetcode, system design everyday. I'm tired of all of this. If doing interviews, I think it's just for the sake of gaining experience. I don't want to waste everybody's time. The thing is I failed the final rounds with Meta in 2024, so if I fail this time it would be the 2nd fail attempt. But pulling before the final rounds might be better since I technically only failed once I guess. What do you think?",

Before that, I spent over two years working at a startup, and honestly those were the best years of my degree. I had close on-site friends, we built creative features, brainstormed ideas, and it genuinely felt fun going into the office every day.\n\nNow I’m ~6 months into MSFT and I seriously don’t know if this is normal. On paper everything is great, my winter review says I’m exceeding expectations, my manager and team are super happy with me, and objectively nothing is “wrong.”\n\nBut emotionally? It’s been rough. Most days I’m anxious, constantly scared I’m not performing enough. Half the week ends with me feeling overwhelmed, and at least once a week I break down crying at night. I look forward to weekends. No matter how much I sleep, exercise, meditate, or whatever, it keeps happening.\n\nThe work itself isn’t helping. It’s mostly infra, bugs,security standards - barely any coding and zero creativity. My team is nice but almost everyone is remote, and the office is full of people from unrelated teams. Plus people barely talk to each other. I haven’t formed any real friendships here; everything feels formal or “networking-like.” Nothing like the tight on-site friendships I had before.\n\nMy therapist says there’s probably something else causing this anxiety (also generally I’m someone with big self-imposed expectations of myself). But I can’t shake the feeling that I should be happy - isn’t working at such a company every CS student’s dream?\n\nI’m confused and honestly worried. Is this just normal for big tech grads in Europe? Do I need to toughen up or did I just enter the adult life?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone who’s been through something similar.",

But it's more like I forget things or I don't force myself to do my work hard enough. I feel like my brain is often more \"lazy\" because thinking hard (like solving a complex issue) is uncomfortable. I mean it's not that I'm lazy at work, but having the complex issue in ones mind and try to solve it efficiently is not that easy. On some days I have a overall good performance and I'm clearheaded but unfortunately on other days I'm not. \n\nChatgpt mentioned that I might have some mental issue where stimulants could help me to have a better performance. Actually I'm not sure if ADHD-I would be the right diagnosis because I don't have distraction issues like these people often have. It's not that my focus or thoughts are changing all the time and that's the core reason of all... No rather it's stuff like working memory, processing speed, mild \"brain fog\", etc. where I feel this impacts my performance at work. \n\nThe thing is that I'm not sure anymore. Even psychologists do have an overall different opinion... some say it could be ADHD-I, others say rather not. I don't know. \n\nCurrently I don't know what kind of work I can do instead if the only issue is that I'm not capable to work in this field.  I'm currently studying so I focus on that at the moment.

        "author": "Inner_Butterfly1991",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm a Tech Lead at a company you've heard of and I have 11 yoe. I'm typically anti-LC in interviews, my style is typically I pick the project they've listed on their resume that seems the most interesting both in terms of level of difficulty and just of interest to me, and drill super deep on it to really tease out if they did what they said they did. And 9/10 times that works. But until you've interviewed lots of people, you don't realize how good some people are at bullshitting. This is why LC exists, and it's why we implemented at least a super basic tech screen. We're a data team so we give them a sample dataset from data we actually work with, and ask them to do some super basic transformations and aggregations. We'll also work with them and are very forgiving, we're not looking for you to get the answer even, but we're looking for the signs that you actually understand the super basics and when given feedback can adjust your approach and at least have the right mindset.\n\nSo back to the title, it astounded me when there was a post in this sub where someone was super upset that reversing an array without using the reverse function would be a question, as that was too much of memorizing algorithms. If we were talking an LC hard then sure I agree. But to anyone who knows the basics about programming this should be super easy. But given all the pushback I reconsidered, and I tested myself to ensure I could do it. And within 5 minutes I had 3 different solutions. Again I don't do LCs regularly, I've done some in job prep but we're talking about \\~10 hours in my life and I'm on my 4th job. I don't think I've ever successfully done a hard, and although I can easily do most easy ones and am around 50/50 at mediums, there was one easy I failed on. I'm definitely not the LC, memorize algorithms type. But again this isn't an algorithm question it's one of the most basic things you can do. I used python but the fundamentals are the same in all languages:\n\n1.\n\n\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        array2[len(array) - 1 - i] = array[i]\n    array = array2\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(len(array)-1,-1,-1):\n      array2[j] = array[i]\n      j += 1\n    array = array2\n\nAnd probably the most algorithm answer:\n\n    i = 0\n    j = len(array) - 1\n    while j > i:\n        a = array[i]\n        array[i] = array[j]\n        array[j] = a\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n\nAnd I'd assume in an interview setting it's fine to be running code and refining it, I certainly did when doing especially the last one (I had the while condition j > 0 initially so it was actually re-reversing so ending with the original array). And I get it I have 11 yoe this was talking about a junior level interview. But if there's even an intern on the team, I'm expecting them to be able to figure things out much more complicated than reversing an array, and I don't think that's all that crazy to expect them to be able to do. My analogy I used was saying \"you'll never have to reverse an array at your job\" is similar to if a French to English translator was asked to count to 10 in French, couldn't, and angrily replied \"when am I ever going to be counting to 10 in my job?\" And the answer is you'll be asked to do things so much more difficult, and if you can't count to 10 in the language you're translating from obviously you're not going to be able to perform the job duties.\n\nAs I mentioned, I've never asked this question in an interview, but I'm asking much harder questions. I'm asking our junior level folks to calculate weighted averages excluding outliers and creating summary statistics by year. I'm then changing the requirements and seeing how they can update their code with the shifting requirements. And I don't think those are even all that hard, they're the bare minimum I'd expect interns to be able to do. We care a lot more about soft skills and perceived willingness to learn, but we need you to be able to do the bare minimum from a technical perspective. Do people really think asking a potential employee whether they can reverse an array is that crazy and means we expect them to memorize algorithms that have nothing to do with the job? This isn't an LC hard, I don't think any of my solutions above are all that crazy or tough to come up with if you understand the basics of arrays and loops. And given how business logic works, it's not even that crazy to be a real world example. What if there are certain values in the array that can't be moved due to government regulation or enterprise requirements so you can only reverse all the other elements while keeping certain values in their place? You can't use a reverse function for that. And that's a hell of a lot tougher of a problem than simple reversal.\n\nI don't know I guess it just astounds me that this sub is all about how tough this market is especially for juniors, yet at the same time it's crazy to expect a junior can do something that in my mind is super basic and contrary to the arguments against it does not actually require memorizing any algorithms, just using a little bit of critical thinking about what reversing an array actually is doing (first is last, second is second to last, etc).",

        "content": "**PSA: Rewritten with AI because im not a native speaker.**\n\n\n\nI Hit 5 years of frontend experience back in March. I was extremely stressed at my last job — hated every single day of it after getting placed on a new project that was basically a legacy nightmare.\n\nAfter about 3 years there, I started noticing the headcount slowly shrinking. I didn’t worry too much because I thought my role was “safe.” because I was replacing the ones that were fired before me. So I went ahead and got preapproved for a mortgage after saving for 7 years rent was draining me.\n\nThe *next day* after getting preapproved, i kid you not, I got fired with no notice (along with half my department).  \nHad to cancel the mortgage and lost a big chunk of money in the process. That one hurt.\n\nI was so burnt out that I just gave up for a bit. Moved back with my parents (super grateful for them) and did absolutely nothing for a month — just walked around, saw old friends, and tried to enjoy life again (best months of my recent life btw).\n\nDuring that time, I realized my parents’ business basically had no online presence. So I decided to build everything: marketing campaigns, data tracking, an ecommerce extension — the whole deal. Spent about 4 months grinding on that while also doing \\~10 interviews (all rejections) as you can see I was not super focused on interviewing, and I was very picky. The business slowly started gaining traction online.\n\nThen in month 5, I finally got a job through LinkedIn.\n\nFast forward almost a year:  \nThis new job pays 30% more than my old one… but I still hate it because it’s legacy stuff again, and I’m scared to leave because the market is rough. I get *zero* LinkedIn messages and feel like I’m getting rusty since no one uses this old tech anymore. I did an interview once during this period, and I was brutally destroyed since I forgot all the \"modern\" tech.\n\nBUT at the same time, the online business I built for my parents is on track this December to make *more* than my “new” job. And now people are hearing about it — I’m currently in talks with my first official non-family client to build a platform for them.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is: if things aren’t working out, and you know tech, just try stuff. Throw things at the wall until something sticks, then grab that opportunity and build it out. You’ll learn a ton, and you might get lucky. Honestly, at this point I feel like that’s more promising than job hunting. I only landed my current job because of a friend — without that, I’m not sure I’d have gotten hired again.\n\nTry everything, especially if you’re in your 20s. Something will eventually stick. I think that being a dev, knowing online Ads and marketing is a superpower, you can market anything.\n\nWorst part is: I still have zero stability. I can’t rent or get a mortgage right now, so I’m stuck living with my parents… but at least things are moving somewhere.And at the same time, this month december im on track to make more via this online business that my \"new\" job where im paid 30% more than my old job. And people have started to hear, and im on talks to onboard my first official non family client to build a platform for them.\n\nWith this I just want to say that if shit aint working for you, you know tech, try stuff, throw shit into the wall until something sticks and grab that shit by the horns and improve it, you will learn a lot, and might get lucky. At this point I think its better than lookign for a job, I got extremely lucky with the search specifically thanks to af riend, otherwise I think i would have never gotten a job again\n\nTry evertyhing, specially if you are young (20s) , something will stick, get some bartender job or whatever shit, and try to see what is a pain point they have and solve it with your coding skills. \n\nOn the worse said, I have 0 stability now, and I cant rent anything, nor get a mortgage because of it so im stuck at my parents. But still, I just wanted to give a bit of hope in this absolutely doomish /r/",

        "content": "I was a software eng at a somewhat big company for 9 years and 8 months until about 2 hours ago. For the last 2 years, I've honestly been kind of circling the drain and struggling to keep up with the other devs. I managed a senior promotion about 5 years into the job, but was promoted based on my fullstack work, which involved a lot of frontend; almost immediately after getting promoted, I was shunted into mostly backend, which I was able to maintain for about 2 years (although just barely, IMO) since we worked in Node.js.\n\n2 years ago, my team switched to Java, which I had very little experience in. I deeply struggled to keep up with the team, which at this point were experienced Java developers. The struggle overtook me, and I made dozens of mistakes, some small, some big. Admittedly, I didn't do anything outside of work; I tried to maintain WLB and stick to working during working-hours only, and didn't do any other prep or studying or projects outside of work hours. After many conversations about performance with my manager, they decided to let me go without a PIP or anything; just fired.\n\nDespite working in backend for 4 years now I feel like my backend skills are garbage. But since I had no opportunities during work to do any frontend work, my frontend skills have also decayed significantly to the point that I'm fairly sure I can't pass an interview based on it. On top of all that, the job I had was my first software job out of college, so I don't have experience with other companies to work with. I feel at least a little screwed (this is about as optimistic a take I can give), and extremely directionless; backend clearly isn't a good fit for me, and my frontend skills are junior-level at best. I have no idea how to present myself for interviews, or what to prepare for; I'm considering taking a frontend bootcamp to try and modernize my skills to _hopefully_ be able to get a frontend role, but I'm terrified that I can't maintain a senior skill level. It's frustrating because I know I have at least some experience to draw on; I couldn't have kept this job for so long without at least doing something right at some point. But it all feels so murky.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar position or has any advice, I would gladly take it. I don't mind if it's harsh; I'm not in a position to complain. I've been given 2 months severance and have some savings, but I have multiple bills to pay so I cannot just relax and take it slow. Any help or advice would be great.",

        "content": "I was coming from a tech leadership role for a handful of years before sort of burning out and deciding to jump at a startup. Same industry that I know, cool new hook and angle, a \"Head of Product\" title and good investors. This company demanded 10-12 hours daily and would rush projects out and I'm just completely allergic to this way of \"working\". Because they're in pacific time and I'm in central, I was working past dinner time and not eating or spending time with my family. So, after 4 months of being here, something I've never done, I decided to look for something better already.\n\nI've always been \"good\" at getting new offers if I wanted them, via by networking or other means. I was sort of slapped to reality and humbled when I saw how awful this market actually is. The pain at work, coupled with two early phone screen rejections made me realize I had to change how I was doing this. The tech job market from 2017-2022 was long gone.\n\nHere are the tips that ultimately worked for me:\n\n1. Reached out to my network and let them know my situation. I received 4 referrals and a handful of informational interviews with folks. I did this via group chats, messaging connections on LinkedIn, college alumni groups I'm a part of.\n2. I used LinkedIn Premium. Why use this overpriced service? As soon as I have it and I mark myself as actively looking (oh and hide the damn Premium icon from your profile or your employer will find it odd that you have it) - I start getting tons of recruiters hitting me up. 2 of these led to an initial screen.\n3. Adjusted my title appropriately. I de-leveled my title for certain Senior Product Manager roles. One question I kept getting was why go from leadership/management to a role like this. The real reason was because my current environment is toxic, my title is inflated there, and the money isn't great, and these \"lower title\" roles were paying on par or sometimes higher for significantly less responsibility. A buddy of mine who was a VP had to practice a similar thing in de-leveling his title when he was laid off. You can play around with your title a bit, but I DO NOT recommend leveling up your title when that isn't factual. It'll come out.\n4. Apply daily to the latest openings, I'll show you how to best do this below.\n5. Had a single thread with ChatGPT where it knew my resume, my work history, my specific projects, my answers to previous interview and job application questions. This made answering bespoke custom questions on ATSs very quick.\n6. A benefit/luxury/advantage - I do have a variety of experience as a software engineer, product manager, tech leadership etc. I'm aware that this greatly expedited this whole process and if I was more junior I likely would have struggled significantly more.\n\n**Best Places to Apply.**  \nI would open up my computer and had a browser with the following tabs open:\n\n1. LinkedIn job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)\n2. Indeed job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)\n3. [Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/) search (an AI aggregator that links you directly to company careers postings)\n4. [Wellfound.com](http://wellfound.com/) search (specifically for start-up hiring)\n5. Google search with the following:\n\nsite:jobs.smartrecruiters.com (\"Group Product Manager\" OR \"Principal Product Manager\" OR \"Senior Product Manager\" OR \"Director of Product\" OR \"VP of Product\" OR \"Head of Product\") AND \"remote\"\n\nThis will list ALL job postings that match the description of those job titles I was looking for (and remote!) directly against the ATS without having to rely on crappy job aggregators. Now open up a tab and do the same thing but replace site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com with the following ATSs I could find:  \n\\- site:jobs.lever.co  \n\\- site:boards.greenhouse.io  \n\\- site:ashbyhq.com\n\nThen on the google results, go to Tools and select last 24 hours.\n\nThis means I would have 10'ish tabs open each day and do the search at 9am and later around 2-3pm and then apply right away. This search almost always takes you to a new posting, rather than those annoying ghost openings or jobs that get reposted for months. This also takes you directly to the employer's site.\n\n**High-level stats:**  \n\\- Total Applications - 350+  \n\\- Referrals made on my behalf - 4 (only one led to a phone screen lol)  \n\\- Duration - \\~2 months  \n\\- Companies scheduling phone screen - 9 (2 ghosted, 2 wanted very niche experience)  \n\\- Companies moving to hiring manager round - 5  \n\\- Companies moving to second/third+ round - 5  \n\\- Offer - 1, I cancelled the remaining 4 live opportunities upon accepting offer\n\nThe offer came from the place I least expected (Wellfound). An application for a hybrid role in NYC (I'm not in NYC, or close to it) led to the CEO directly reaching out to me. I took his call not thinking much of the opportunity since the description didn't have much to go off of. We both had a ton of fun talking and getting a feel for each other. The rest of the interviewing process with that team felt like talking to friends, it was an easy offer to accept.\n\nI could go way more in detail about how I prep for interviews, not sure how helpful that would be for people. I just wanted to share my process of applying, hoping it's of any use to anyone!",

When you read interviews or biographies, you see traits often associated with autism or what used to be called Asperger’s, hyper-focus, intense special interests, difficulty with socializing, and a preference for systems over people. It makes me wonder how much neurodivergence plays into the tech world. These founders go from isolated kids to running giant companies, and even after becoming billionaires, they don’t “relax” like other wealthy people. A lot stay obsessively focused on huge, almost sci-fi goals (Mars missions, reinventing society, etc.), while others try to reinvent themselves as cool, stylish, yacht-owning public figures ( bezos, zuckerberg ). It sometimes feels like a real-life revenge of the nerds.",

Meanwhile Bloomberg promotions work differently as they don’t really follow levels so idk by how much my salary will change. I also get no equity cus it’s a private company.\n\nAlso Dropbox is a return offer and although I liked the people in my team (very chill WLB and nice people) I found the work not so exciting so I would have to try switching teams while at Bloomberg I prolly have many options. \n\nI’m indifferent between both cities but i’m sure that I want to pivot to entrepreneurship / startups or more fast paced environments than big tech in 3-4 years after working. I know SF is the place for that but New York could also be a solid option for fintech.\n\nDo you guys have any suggestions about where I should go? \n",

        "content": "Title is TLDR\n\nHey everyone, I just completed the final exam for my degree 50 minutes ago, but I’m honestly at a loss. For the past 3 years, I’ve been doing everything people say you’re “supposed” to do to break into tech (not just SWE positions, i'd be happy with anything) and nothing has worked.\n\nstuff I’ve tried: \n• Attended tons of networking events •\tJoined CS-related extracurriculars in my school\n • Reached out directly to recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn \n• Asked my network for referrals \n• Had my resume reviewed by recruiters + people working in the industry \n• Rebuilt my resume multiple times for different niches (IT, Cloud, SWE, Data, etc.) \n• Built different personal projects tailored to those fields \n• Applied to hundreds of roles consistently (from 2022-2025)\n\nDespite all that, I’m graduating with no internship experience, and I keep hearing that this will make my job search even harder than it already is.\n\nSo I’m wondering: \n• Has anyone else been in this situation and managed to turn things around? What worked for you?\n • Are there fields adjacent to CS where companies are willing to hire fresh grads without experience? \n• are certain tech markets better that i could pivot to? like tech sales, QA, IT support, cybersecurity, bizops, etc.? \n• Is it worth doing certifications (AWS, Security+, CCNA, etc.) at this stage? \n• Would contract work, freelancing, or even a non-tech job but in a tech company help me get a foot in the door? (this is probably my most likely path, i work for a city but my current role is part time and unrelated to tech. They have a job portal for internal hiring, hoping I can move into a tech role from there)\n\nAny advice, personal experiences, or suggestions would mean a lot. Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: wonky formatting",

It is unfortunately highly likely that I would not be able to speak to everyone (30 mins/person/month for 65 people is >30hours/month I don't have that much free time right now). I'm currently going through all responses seeing who I think I can help the most, I'll be in touch shortly!\n\n================\n\nEdit:  \nGoogle form is set up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRQuAjhNgKwXzdkaYjRQC8vk4_VKyzsvsKkgcZH_Q2o6EZjA/viewform?usp=dialog)!. I've replied to all the comments that were put up here so far with this form. In the (likely) event that there may be too many responses, I'll do my best to have at least one conversation with everyone, and find folks in my peer group who I respect a lot who may be willing to be mentors as well. This is all best effort, I appreciate your patience :)\n\n================\n\nHey all,\n\nNot sure if this violates the rules of the subreddit (don't think it does!).\n\nI've been fortunate enough to have done reasonably well in my tech career, and I wanted to see if I could offer mentorship support to anyone in this subreddit (or other kinds of support, depending on need).\n\nA bit about me: Based in the US, been in the tech industry for well over a decade, and have worn several hats from test to backend engineering to research. I won't share my personal details on this post, but here are the highlights:\n\n\\- Have a bachelor's and a Master's in Computer Science (consciously opted to not do a PhD)\n\n\\- Started out as a Software Engineer in Testing at a Big Tech firm\n\n\\- Made a lateral move to a \"traditional\" Software Engineer role\n\n\\- Made a lateral move to ML Research, all in premier research labs you've definitely heard about. A few promotions along the way\n\n\\- Founded a startup in the AI space, did fundraising, hiring, sales calls, etc.\n\n\\- Been an IC, TL, manager, founder, etc.\n\nWhat I think I can help with:\n\n\\- General mentorship: I currently (and have in the past) mentor early-career folks, topics range from \"how do I talk to my manager about this issue\" to \"How do I know what to work on?\"\n\n\\- Technical mentorship: General technical brainstorming/AI model review/code review, etc., in the past I did this with folks who didn't have a senior technical leader to learn from (e.g. they were the founding engineer in a small startup).\n\n\\- Mock interviews: Prepping for interviews at a tech company? I've done quite a few of those for engineering roles (and a few for product), I can do mock interviews and give you feedback.\n\n\\- Resume review\n\n\\- You just want to vent and need someone to listen :)\n\nWhat I can't help with:\n\n\\- Referrals for job openings: I get these requests semi-regularly on LinkedIn, and unfortunately, I'm unable to refer anyone I don't know personally or have worked with (literally one of the first questions in any referral is: \"how do you know this person?\").\n\nIf there's interest, I was planning on setting up a Google Form or something to coordinate -- please let me know if this is something that people here would want!",

        "author": "Organic-Helicopter54",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey yall, as end of year reviews come out and as my company hits raise and bonus time of year, I am curious if I am really underpaid, or if I am paid fairly and have unrealistic expectations.\n\n  \nI work for a non tech, semi small (around 100 employees) company, that has some pretty big clients. **I currently make 39k a year,** I am going on almost 2 years here and I have not received a raise yet. We work mostly in C# and .net, but have been making some pushes into some python development (more on this). personally I work on a wide range of applications, both client facing and internal. I am remote but company is located in Southern U.S. \n\n  \nSince we are a smaller dev team, I have alot of responsibilities that I feel like *most*  jr. devs don't have, but I could be wrong. Some of the things I do outside of programming are\n\n1. Meeting directly with Clients to scaffold out and discuss task, creating them in Jira, developing the solution, presenting and then directly receiving feedback on the solution (along with the PM and sr. dev) \n2. Having a heavy involvement in AWS migration, being the one creating proof of concepts for utilizing alot of different AWS micro services (e.g. currently working on lambda function that work with our applications) \n3. Creating internal and client facing documentation and sop's for applications, work flows, and pipelines\n\nI had a rocky start during my first 6 months, but improved alot and got an -A in my end of year review, as compared to a -B one my first.\n\nBut there are some caveats that I think are important\n\n1. I am \"Full-time\" w/ benefits but contracted at 32 hours a week. This because I am also a full time student at a university. They work around my class schedule, but I try my best to make my classes compliment the work day. I would be willing to move to 40 hours a week\n2. I am also part time Military, I know that they can't hold this against me, but during my first 6 months at this company, I spent probably about 4 of Military service, which could have slowed my progression either way. They also let me work reduced hours while I am fulfilling military commitments and pay me as usual (I can't really afford not to)\n3. I am sometimes a mediocre developer, however, past work experience makes my true strength my soft skills. I am applauded for how I carry myself in meetings and presentations with clients. \n\nSo, after all that, I am as underpaid as I think I am? I went into software development for financial stability for my family (I do have children), but I am kind of at a loss. I don't really want to start looking for other jobs, because I am unsure if they would work with my school schedule and be as flexible as this place. I also love the team and the work life balance is pretty good. \n\nIs thinking I should at least be around 70-80k unrealistic? I have brought up getting a raise before, but there really hasn't been an actual conversation about it. How do I engage in negotiation? What do yall think is acceptable pay? \n\nI think that's everything, thanks guys!\n\n  \n**TLDR;** Junior Software dev making production level code being paid 39k, often works directly with clients and new technologies, such as AWS during a huge migration. Am I super underpaid? If I am, what should I ask for and how should I broach that subject",

Compared to job sites in my country, LinkedIn and Indeed are awful: the filters don’t work, I can’t tell how much experience a job requires without scrolling, and half the time they force me to enter previous job titles even if I’ve never worked before. I get emails with vague subject lines, so I have to open each one to understand what they’re about. Indeed often doesn’t show the posting dates of jobs. LinkedIn is bloated with random buttons, Facebook posts I don’t care about, and spam bots constantly message me.\n\nWhen I look at supposedly \"entry-level\" or \"intern\" job descriptions, I often find stuff that’s obviously AI-generated:\n\nSeeking a Junior .NET Developer with 5+ years in development and production support, specializing in .NET Core 8/C# and Visual Studio. Mandatory skills include expert troubleshooting, deep proficiency with New Relic (NRQL) and CloudWatch Logs Insights for advanced observability. Experience with Postman is required, while familiarity with AWS services (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, etc.) and networking fundamentals is a strong asset.\n\nOften these descriptions contain grammar mistakes. Then, when I go to the company’s website I’m greeted with pure horror: basic HTML/CSS, looking like it was scraped in 2006. I go to the \"Careers\" tab on their website and it throws me 404. I open another website and I see the main page with some cringe quotes and random images.\n\nWhy are they so bad? Am I using fake scam websites instead of the real ones?",

It inevitably always leads to them talking about AI, how it's the future, and half of the time, their genius idea to build a chatbot/ AI wrapper for <insert use case here that could be done without AI>.\n\nMy response is always the same. AI in its current state is cool and useful, but has limitations. We shouldn't expect massive improvements (like AGI) in a short time period, and we shouldn't use AI for every use-case. In most cases, it's better to create a deterministic system instead.\n\nAlmost every time, I get a mixture of the following:\n\n1. But all of these people are saying that AI is the future! (Most of \"those people\" being tech CEOs with a vested interest in selling shovels in the gold rush, and the bandwagoners who follow them).\n\n2. But AI is improving so rapidly! (Ignoring the exponential costs of improvement and that improvement is not a foregone conclusion).\n\n3. But AI can create a website/ pitch deck/ <insert non-impressive task that there are endless publically-available tutorials for online>! (Missing the fact that these things were always easy, and the value is in creating/ executing the hard things that haven't been built yet).\n\n  \nTL;DR, I feel like the expert in the video, being ignored by the empty suits who think they're onto something but lack to knowledge to know what they don't know.",

        "content": "I was a mid level dev for the past 3-4 years at a big tech company. I was at a state I lost my drive to get to senior and while my skills did grow, I also didn't see a path to senior from it nor did I want to take the extra effort to go to senior. I made a post about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwef8o/anyone\\_lose\\_their\\_drive\\_after\\_reaching\\_mid\\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwef8o/anyone_lose_their_drive_after_reaching_mid_level/)\n\n  \nRecently I changed teams (literally a week after that post) since an interesting initiative came out and they wanted internal transfers since ramp up time would be faster. It's only been 2+ months or so since then but wow I am seeing a path to senior again and even possibly beyond. My skills have grown tremendously especially as I had to learn a lot of new things, there is immense pressure as the higher ups are taking a much closer look at our team's projects initiatives and I'm communicating with directors in some circumstances despite being just a mid level dev. There's a few cons like tighter deadlines and definitely feeling resource constrained headcount wise and doing much more of some things that I didn't like or were uncomfortable for me in my last role but it's been... fun again. I can see much greater impact (that affects multiple orgs and business units) compared to my last role too. Financial impact of my last role was maybe 50M max and direct impact was much less. Current role had that much in just a single project. The role's importance also makes me feel a lot more secure in it and I'm less scared of being laid off which has been great for my mental health especially as I see other companies laying off people.\n\nFor my resume, I had maybe 2-3 nice bullet points/stories I could get from my last role. I've gotten that in the last month and I'm pretty sure they sound better and are better stories to tell on interviews.\n\nThis make me think of how much growth I would have had if I had been in a similar team/role 1-2 years earlier and this isn't even considering how much more visibility I have now. I think I can get promoted in 6 months if I really go for it or a year if I take a bit more time to take things chiller just because of being \"forged\" in this fire that I'll develop senior skills without even really trying... That said I'm seeing much more of what principal/staff engineers do because of higher proximity to them and ngl, I'm not sure I want to be in their shoes lol ",

        "content": "So I worked three excessively shitty jobs in a row\n\nFirst was (Forest in Brazil). I found my manager nearly impossible to communicate with, we just did things so differently. My mentor was excessively aggressive, I legit thought he had some sort of personality disorder. I remember in my first week, I asked maybe 3 questions, common ones like where to find certain resources. Each time my mentor would simply send me a link, and on the third one, he made a remark about how I’m asking too many questions. So, I took the hint and didn’t ask questions unless it was absolutely necessary. Then they started complaining I wasn’t asking _enough_ questions. I was so lost. Then I was assigned a job with another new hire and she faced the same problem, told she asks too much questions then when she stopped. They said that she “just went off and did her own thing”. I kinda felt like I was missing something — isn’t the obvious reaction to “you’re asking too many questions” to… ask fewer questions? Obviously it was more than just this, but it’s an example of how communication was very hostile. I just kept a low profile as much as possible. I ended up quitting, but I definitely think something lingered here\n\nNext job was a weirdly incompetent AI company. Management expected ~30 tickets to be completed per week, and those tickets were usually big ones. For context, they expected something similar to ChatGPT to be built in 2 weeks by 2 engineers with 0 bugs. I was let go from here. I asked why, and they seemed to say I should be available 24/7 and I wasn’t (I explicitly said I can’t be contacted 6-8pm because I help at a Muay Thai gym and you can’t have a computer/phone on you while holding pads obviously)\n\nNext job started great. I was cautiously optimistic. Around 6 months in, I started to relax and take a deep breath. Then… they hired a new manager. I could not understand for the life of me what this manager was talking about. I thought I was losing my mind a little, honestly. She would constantly say these bromides like “act more like a senior engineer”. If I asked where I was falling short of being a “senior engineer” or what goals I should have, she said it’s not her job to tell me that, nor is it her job to give me work to do. I’d have to fight for hours to figure out what I should be working on. She was just an odd person. I remember she had an exercise where she _insisted_ that everyone eats peanut butter sandwiches. I don’t and never have. I thought this was some sort of weird test, because she was so insistent that everyone does this. I could tell I was being intentionally sabotaged by her, as she would block PRs with frankly obviously stupid and unproductive comments\n\nNow I’m starting a new job and I feel extremely intense anxiety about… everything. Although I’m a frontend engineer, this job has asked me to get up to date on ruby. I’ve never written ruby before. It’s not that I can’t learn it, but it causes me such deep anxiety to feel like I’m asking “stupid” questions. I asked one stupid question and I lost a whole night of sleep over the anxiety of thinking that I’m gonna get fired and start this cycle again\n\nIs there anything I can do? I’ve hired a therapist and everything but she mostly says “you should take it easy and be in the present” but that’s easier said than done. I have some fear that the “new manager” thing happening again. Yeah, the job is good _now_, but what if I get a new manager who just decides to fire me?",

I built an internal tool that helps devs on my team.\n\n2. I performed some bug fixes, some that were quite tricky and difficult, some that were pretty straightforward.\n\n3. I migrated one of our back-end services from the cloud to an on-prem instance.\n\nAnd that’s pretty much it. Fairly basic React work + Spring Boot work and some AWS as well.\n\nI guess I feel really bad because the vast majority of this work I accomplished in maybe a year at most and after that I stagnated hard because I was battling stage 3 cancer for some time and dealt with the aftermath of that (poor mental health) for quite some time. Like little to no code reviews, just maintaining what I’ve built, etc.\n\nOverall, I feel like I only have maybe 1 YoE even though I’ve been working for 4 years.\n\nThese past few months, I’ve been doing a lot better mentally and I’ve done a bunch of LeetCode, a Spring Boot course, and a ton of system design since those are areas where I’m quite weak.\n\nI’m confident I can improve my skills in the next 2-3 months, but the question always remains “am I cooked?” Like, am I screwed for doing next to nothing for quite some time? Is there any chance of salvaging what I have left of my career? This question really keeps me up at night. Will recruiters and hiring managers be completely turned off by my lacklustre work experience?\n\nI realize my career is in my hands and no one else’s, but I’m just so bummed out that I lost so much opportunity due to battling cancer + mental health, and I’m praying that there’s still a chance for me to do SWE now that I’m doing a lot better these months.\n\nAm I completely and utterly cooked? Is there a chance of redemption?\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "author": "pyromaniac_etal",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TLDR: Career changer hitting a knowledge ceiling, need tips for growth.\n\nI am a career changer with a BA in Classical Music Performance who completed a bootcamp back in 2020. Since then I have been continuously employed working first for a small company doing mostly front end, then for a large company doing full stack. In the small company (3 people) I had no guidance or mentoring and was entirely self taught. In the large company, everyone has 15-20 years of experience and we are working on maintaining an old code base rather than building new things. It's a very corporate model and pays far below market rate, but it had great benefits and stability. \n\nMy arm of the big company was just sold to a startup. The great benefits and stability are gone, the work is depressing and pointless, we have lost three direct managers in eight months, team morale is at an all time low, and there is no chance for advancement because anyone who could advocate for us gets fired. I just had a great written performance review, but the meeting was awful. During the review meeting, after all the positive comments, I was told by the higher up standing in for our manager that I was not eligible to be put up for senior because I am not showing the same code base knowledge as colleagues with 15-20 years experience (who were promoted to senior while at my level.) In my opinion and despite the positive comments, I think I am performing poorly. Even if my performance improves, I have no chance of promotion at this new company. In short, I need a new job. \n\nUnfortunately, I think my lack of education and experience building vs maintaining software is harming my ability to study for and perform in interviews. The terminology used by my colleagues seems totally foreign even when I should have heard it before, and I can't seem to remember or apply it to our work when trying to discuss it with others. In general, I feel stupidly inarticulate. I think my memory is terrible. I feel like my brain will sometimes short circuit during team meetings and I suddenly cannot find words or even concepts to describe what I was working on just the day before. I don't think it is anxiety related... I just don't remember. I also feel very slow at my work - in between childcare responsibilities, my own brain wandering, hating every second of the tasks, and getting distracted around the house, I probably put in two focused hours in an eight hour day. This makes me worry and beat myself up because obviously I could do so much better if I could focus. This inability to focus, along with some migraine stuff, bleeds into my ability to study. And studying algorithms doesn't seem to help me explain them better or talk about them in an intelligent way. With all of this, I'm not sure how I am going to get a new job at a senior level position.\n\nI need some tips to 1) learn how to learn what I ACTUALLY don't know 2) memory tips for vocabulary, tech trends, algorithms, etc. (flashcards? something else?) 3) learn how to talk about what I do know in a way that demonstrates my intelligence 4) a clear study plan that incorporates all of this so I don't have decision fatigue day after day. I have about one hour per day to spend on this 5) some encouragement. I am the sole provider for a neurodivergent kid and a spouse in school, I worked hard to make this career change as a previous professional musician and was good enough to be immediately hired as a TA and then get a job in the middle of the early covid recession. I cannot quit. I like solving problems. But I need help.",

They gave us a pip package that makes the most insane assumptions. It assumes that the package is being a run on a machine with a mount to the company wide NFS. This NFS is the most dogshit piece of bullshit to ever exist. It works. It works great. And what that means is that you have thousands of devs just throwing files and scripts in places, and assuming that other scripts exist. And the dependencies chain down, so every thing is tied to everything else. And their pip package needs to be run there. Even worse, one of their scripts that they call from inside their package starts with \" #!/usr/bin/python3.7\" (we are using python 3.13) and assumes that there are certain packages installed in that environment. \n\nNow we have been trying to unplug from all this bullshit, but the amount of crappy design and dev culture is just driving me insane. We tried to dockerize and run our stuff cleanly in a cluster, but the amount of leaky dependencies that we are finding is just soul crushing.\n\nThankfully at least my managers are very understanding and basically want to go to war with these nonces for providing such ass backwards tooling. \n\nRant over.

So, I got an offer from a startup, and I've been working here for the last 6 weeks. It's all what I wanted to work with but I'm starting to feel frustrated and I don't know if I'm the problem or if it's the place. \n\nThere is a new project, that's supposed I'm going to be in charge on the implementation. Deadline for BackEnd is end February and I've started to work on the project on my third week here, even before the product team defined the scope of v1. This was because it was too much and we couldn't wait until the product team finishes approving the scope of v1 to start to work.\n\nOnce the v1 was approved, I had to come back and change things, because I started to work based on assumptions of my manager and not on what's required. Now the problem  is that I feel that I keep working based on assumptions. \n\nI spend 3 days working on a module, to find in the next meeting that certain part of it, comes from a another service, or certain information hasn't have to be stored because another service already have it. My manager told me that is expected that I handle all the implementation by myself but I don't feel I have the enough context to do it.\n\nSo I'm starting to feel frustrated because there are things that I don't know how they expect that I should know being here only for 6 weeks without having the context of the whole backend and micro services we already have. Each time I start to work on something it's just to hear in the next meeting that I did it wrong because I didn't know it has to be done in a different way because X service.\n\nI just needed to vent, and know if you've had similar experiences and what should I do in this situation? \n\nI'm starting to get tired and I don't know if this is something I should expect for every work in software development I will have.\n\nThanks in advance ",

It flavored the rest of the screening as I seemed low energy and low confidence in the rest of the questions afterwards. \n\nI was also screened after a long workday and commute at 6pm... The recruiter also appears to have assumed I have been working with Spring Boot at my workplace when we just use Spring Framework. While I originally coded in college using SpringBoot, it's been awhile since I coded using that specifically. Some of the screening questions were also geared towards that.\n\nJust feeling super dumb and like an imposter as a mid level Java software engineer. At least 20-30% of the questions at some point I said \"I don't know\".\n\nIn the end the screener said I answered all the questions but appeared to lack confidence. I then gave some truth and said that I'm not always good at talking tech (some of the vocabulary I'm supposed to know goes right past me) but I am better when I can just sit down at the computer and write code. \n\nIn the end the recruiter said if they like my personality they will find a reason to hire me, which was nice to hear but also felt like it confirmed I didn't do very well in the screening? Or maybe I read too much into that.\n\nThe recruiter will now decide if they will send me stuff over to the hiring manager and ask for an interview. I'm debating on whether I should send him a message clarifying what I have said here about Hibernate / Spring Boot. What would you do? Maybe I just need to wait it out and see what he tells me today.\n\nI really need a remote job because I live 70 miles from any city and this company is 100% remote and hire a lot of devs, so I'd really like a chance there.\n\nI've had a few interviews so far since I started looking in August, about one per month, so maybe I should just be glad I am getting interviews at all.",

I believe that a Solutions/Sales Engineering (SE) role would be a much stronger fit for my personality. I can tolerate leetcode, system design, etc... but at the end of the day, coding for ~8 hr/day just feels isolating to me. I love presenting and talking to people on the other hand.\n\nIn terms of compensation/exit ops for SE, what is the outlook? How does it compare to SWE?\n\nA few data points: Databricks Solutions Architect - (4+ YoE- TC range is ~$210k-$700k)\n\nAll Salaries for Solutions Architect - TC up to $1.9m.\n\nAll Salaries for SWE - TC up to $4.9m.\n\nObviously these are the .01% of performers, but good to know the ceilings either way. Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nEdit: links broke idk why but the data points were linked to levels.fyi ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m looking for candid guidance on how to make a realistic pivot into modern AI and LLM roles. I’m a senior IC data scientist with over 10 years of experience at large, well-known tech companies. I have a PhD in NLP that predates AlexNet and word2vec, and a CS/SWE background, and I have always worked as a generalist with broad experience across the classical ML and data science stack: ETLs, data pipelines, experimentation, statistics, and lightweight models for product teams.\n\nAfter a year out of industry, I'm job hunting again, but my recruiter callback rate is under 5 percent. I seem overqualified for junior roles and underqualified for senior AI roles, and I honestly no longer know where I fit. I’ve seen plenty of DS-to-RE transition advice, but very little that speaks to someone senior like me. I’d be happy in research engineering, applied LLM work, AI-oriented data science, or agentic / safety / alignment roles, but I’m not sure which of these are actually realistic anymore.\n\nMost of my experience is in classical ML, not deep learning or modern LLM tooling. I understand Transformers conceptually and followed Karpathy’s GPT-from-scratch tutorial, but I don’t have professional experience with PyTorch, LLM finetuning, or production LLM systems. These gaps come out in interviews. For example, I was asked to use a tokenizer and realized I didn’t even know which ones are standard today. I could explain BPE, but I had to ask the interviewer to name one, and when they said TikToken I had to ask them to spell it because I had never heard of it. Not my best moment. My side projects also feel too toy-like to signal real capability.\n\nWhat I want to figure out is what skills and projects actually matter for breaking into modern AI and LLM roles and how someone with my background can reposition effectively. My concrete questions are:\n\n1. What is the most efficient way for someone with my background to build practical and credible skills for modern AI and LLM roles?\n2. How should I balance interview preparation with building real projects?\n3. Which roles are realistic targets for me given my experience and gaps?\n4. Am I fooling myself by thinking I could do the work if I could get past interviews, or is signaling the real barrier here?",

I have found this job monotonous, unchallenging, and too bureaucratic, so earlier this year I decided to start studying machine learning on my own hoping to pivot careers to that. During this time I delved deep into math and realized how much I miss it. So I decided to just apply to a math master’s and a statistics data science master’s and see what happens. I haven’t gotten into the math program yet but I’ve gotten into the data science one. I graduated with a BS in CS with a 3.76 gpa from a good university 2 years ago.  I can’t help but feel like the field is dying (although my job will never die, I do use AI some of my redundant tasks) and as a consequence, data science and ml is also a dead end degree for me. Math might open a few more doors for me. The data science degree is twice as much as the math master’s. Does anyone have advice on making a decision on what I should do? I can’t accept staying where I am at for the rest of my life even though I love the stability and might want to return after doing more with my life. ",

        "content": "**Context**\n\nI'm a US-based Product Designer with 5 years of experience (4 of which were in the Telehealth industry), with my last 3 years of employment leading multiple high-impact and well-documented projects. Between all the conversations around AI taking over roles, the government impacting the job market, frequent layoffs, and more—I was feeling burnt out. When the medium-sized company I worked for filed for bankruptcy, I used this as an opportunity to redeem my mental health. For the first 3 months I rested, and for the following 9 months I focused on art. I pursued any hobby I was interested in, joined clubs, and even felt my identity change. While I am proud of my decision, and I feel significantly better, I am now grappling with self-esteem issues when I consider my career journey ahead. Before this could snowball into an issue of its own, I immediately started going to therapy. \n\n  \n**Preparation**\n\nDuring this year-long break, I worked daily on my portfolio—writing case studies, networking, staying connected with previous colleagues, and developing my site from scratch. I completed and launched my portfolio with 4 in-depth case studies full of metrics and impact. All of my colleagues who were laid off were re-hired, and have offered me referrals. My resume is up-to-date, and I've developed my portfolio in a way that I can easily release personalized variations for each company I apply for. So not only will my resume be catered to each job application, but so will my website. \n\n**Action**\n\nI applied to one job that I felt I was 100% qualified for, and also recieved a referral from a close colleague. I catered my resume and also my portfolio, but it was a bit rushed—I launched my portfolio that same week and had to fix a lot of errors. I am still proud that I've applied, but I didn't expect the application to go through given that it was my first application. Today I've been informed that the role has been filled. I haven't applied to any other jobs yet because of holiday planning, but intend to apply to 5 - 10 jobs per week (depending on available jobs) after the New Year. Now that I've finished my portfolio, I am starting work on two career-related side projects to demonstrate my skills further. \n\nMy goal is to apply for remote full-time roles with a compensation range of $130k - $175k, prioritizing roles in the Telehealth industry. \n\n**Questions**\n\n* When asked about my career gap, what is the most elegant way I can talk about it?\n* Am I likely to face descrimination for my 1 year career gap? What can I do to navigate it?\n* How can I best get into contact with recruiters? Are they still open to communication through LinkedIn, or are they swamped with messages?\n* Does the job market feel better in FY2025 Q4 than it did in FY2024 or FY2023?\n* Is a 6-month timeline realistic for job hunting? \n* Are freelance and contract roles as competitive as full time? \n* What else can I do to be a more competitive design candidate?\n\n  \nAny advice is appreciated, though it would be helpful if you could share your industry/role to show relevance.

        "author": "ThomasHawl",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m 28 (almost 29) and I’m really stressed about a major career decision.\n\nI have a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics (not specifically applied to CS/ML). Right now I’m working (mostly out of necessity) as an embedded software engineer in the defense sector, in a European country where opportunities in “real” ML/DL research are extremely limited. Roles that are actually about experimenting with models, doing research, or contributing to novel ML ideas basically don’t exist here.\n\nMoving abroad seems like the only long-term way to pivot, but ML research roles are very competitive, and junior candidates with experience in unrelated fields are usually not considered. So at the moment I’m stuck in a stable career path (that I actively dislike) that could eventually take me to Northern Europe (Germany, Netherlands, etc.), or even US… but it’s absolutely not the work I want to do.\n\nMy dream since finishing my Master’s two years ago has been to work in ML/DL research, not MLOps, not ML engineering, but actually creating and experimenting with models in an industrial research setting. I’ve applied to positions like this several times but never got traction.\n\nTo be totally honest, the “dream dream” would be to work in a place like DeepMind, Meta FAIR, or similar labs. I know that’s extremely unrealistic, but they represent the type of work I want to do: pushing boundaries, experimenting, publishing internally, working on genuinely interesting problems.  \nEvery time I scroll LinkedIn and find a job that makes me think “wow, that’s exactly the kind of work I want to do”, it always requires a PhD (or a Master’s plus strong industry research experience). My current job can’t give me that experience at all.\n\nA PhD would also be an opportunity to build a stronger CV. I’ve basically only studied in my home country, never had any real abroad experience, and I didn’t do internships during my studies. Through the PhD I could finally have international experience and potentially do industry internships abroad, which is something my current career path will never allow.\n\nOf course I want to earn more money in the future, who doesn’t.  \nBut the main thing for me is that I really value what I do, at least at this stage of my life. And given how low salaries are in my home country, I don’t think doing a PhD would make me “poorer” long-term.\n\nMy real concern is whether there is a better path that aligns with both:\n\n\\--“I want to work on something genuinely cool and intellectually challenging”  \n\\--“I want to earn above-average in the long term.”\n\nRight now, a PhD seems like the best path for someone with my background and goals, but I’m very open to hearing other perspectives.\n\nNow a new opportunity appeared:  \na PhD abroad at a top-20 university (non-US), fully founded (the stipend is not amazing, but I will not starve, I will finish debt-free, and I am ok with making some sacrifices, the financial aspect is not the thing that will make me go/not go), strongly research-oriented, in mathematics/ML. The topic, the PI, and the school all seem very good, and I would try to push my work toward something more practical/ML-applied if possible, but I really enjoy the math.\n\nMy concern is not “I don’t know if I’ll like the PhD.”  \nI genuinely think I will.  \nMy concern is entirely about what happens after.\n\nHere are the fears that are keeping me up at night:\n\n1) I’m already 28. I’ll finish the PhD at 32/33. I do not want to do a postdoc (at least for now), and I am not interested in academia in the long run. My goal is to get into industry research (research scientist, ML researcher, quant researcher, etc.). But I’m scared companies will ignore someone who is older, with no prior industry ML experience.\n\n2) I’m afraid that the PhD will not actually help me get into ML research roles, and I’ll end up “overqualified and under-experienced”. Maybe the PhD will end up being too theoretical and not give me the applied experience, internships of portfolio needed for industry research roles.\n\n3) I currently work in a sector and tech stack completely unrelated to ML. I worry that this PhD is my only path out, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll be worse off than now, older, with no experience, and back at square 0.\n\n4) As an alternative to the PhD: would it make more sense to switch into something like data analyst / BI, get into a data-adjacent field, and then “climb up” from there toward ML? Is this realistic, or basically impossible? \n\nOn the other hand, staying where I am means staying in a field I do not like, with technologies extremely far from ML, and with no realistic opportunities to pivot, and with a career path that I do not like.\n\nIf anyone has seen similar transitions, or has experience hiring PhDs into ML/AI research roles, I would really appreciate your thoughts. I’m stuck between choosing stability in a field I don’t like, or taking a big risk that may not pay off, and I don’t want to make a life-altering mistake at 29.",

        "content": "I’m choosing between two roles and want some perspective from people who have actually worked in these fields.\n\nOne offer is an SRE position. The other is a Security Engineer role. Both companies seem strong, but the work and long term trajectories look very different.\n\nOn the SRE side, the work is focused on cloud engineering, observability, automation, CI CD, Kubernetes, and reliability. It feels very hands on and technical. A lot of people say SRE experience opens doors at big tech later because it shows you can handle scale and complex systems.\n\nOn the Security Engineering side, the work is more about hardening, IAM, vulnerability management, detection logic, cloud security, and defense. It feels more structured and predictable. It also seems like a path that can lead to architect level security roles or broader cloud security positions.\n\nFor people who have been in either role, I’d really appreciate your insight on a few things:\n\n• Which role grows your skills faster\n• Which path tends to pay more over time\n• Which one provides better job security\n• Which is more stressful day to day\n• Which one is easier to move from into big tech\n• If you switched between these fields, what made you change\n\nAny honest advice from people who have done SRE or security engineering would help a lot. I just want to make the right decision for my future.",

Help a brother out will you guys? No idea what to do here, if you’ve had a similar experience I’d appreciate it.",
