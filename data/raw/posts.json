Right now I’m:\n\n* Learning Python properly (doing daily problems)\n* Building small personal projects in PySpark using Databricks to get stronger\n\nI keep seeing postings and talks about modern data platforms where Go (and later Rust) is used a lot for pipelines, Kafka tools, fast ingestion services, etc. \n\nMy questions as a complete beginner in this area:\n\n1. Is Go actually becoming a “must-have” or a strong “nice-to-have” for data engineers in the next few years, or can I get really far (and get good jobs) by just mastering Python + PySpark + SQL + Airflow/dbt?\n2. If it is worth learning, I can find hundreds of tutorials for Go basics, but almost nothing that teaches how to work with data in Go – reading/writing CSVs, Parquet, Avro, Kafka producers/consumers, streaming, back-pressure, etc. How did you learn the real “data engineering in Go” part?\n3. For someone still building their first PySpark projects, when is the realistic time to start Go without getting overwhelmed?\n\nI don’t want to distract myself too early, but I also don’t want to miss the train if Go is the next big thing for higher-paying / more interesting data platform roles.\n\nAny advice from people who started in Python/Spark and later added Go (or decided not to) would be super helpful.

I didn’t even know the DE role existed. It really catched my attention, and I started studying every single day. I’ll admit I made some mistakes (jumping straight into Airflow/AWS, even made a post about Airflow here, LOL), but I kept going because I genuinely enjoy learning about the field.\n\nTwo months ago I actually received two job opportunities. Both meetings went well: they asked about my projects, my skills, my approach to learning, etc. Both processes just vanished. I assume it’s because I have 0 experience. Still, I’ve been studying 4–6 hours a day since I started, and I’m fully committed to become a professional DE.\n\n# My current skill set:\n\n**Python:** PySpark, Polars, DuckDB, OOP  \n**SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL  \n**Databricks:** Delta Lake, Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, Jobs, Roles, Unity Catalog, Secrets, External Locations, Connections, Clusters  \n**BI:** Power BI, Looker  \n**Cloud:** AWS (IAM, S3, Glue) / a bit of DynamoDB and RDS  \n**Workflow Orchestration:** Airflow 3 (Astronomer certified)  \n**Containers:** Docker basics (Images, Containers, Compose, Dockerfile)  \n**Version Control:** Git & GitHub  \n**Storage / Formats:** Parquet, Delta, Iceberg  \n**Other:** Handling fairly large datasets (+100GB files), understanding when to use specific tools, etc  \n**English:** C1/C2 (EF SET certified)\n\n# Projects I’ve built so far:\n\n– An end-to-end ETL built **entirely in SQL** using DuckDB, loading into PostgreSQL.  \n– Another ETL pulling from multiple sources (MySQL, S3, CSV, Parquet), converting everything to Parquet, transforming it, and loading into PostgreSQL. Total volume was \\~4M rows. I also handled IAM for boto3 access.  \n– A small Spark → S3 pipeline (too simple to mention it though).\n\nI know these are beginner/intermediate projects, i’m planning more advanced ones for next year.\n\nNext year, I want to do things properly: structured learning, better projects, certifications, and ideally my first job, even if it’s low pay or long hours. I’m confident I can scale quickly once I get my first actual job.\n\n# My questions:\n\n– If you were in my position, what would you focus on next?  \n– Do you think I’m in the right direction?  \n– What kind of projects actually stand out in a junior DE portfolio?  \n– Do certifications actually matter for someone with zero experience? (Databricks, dbt, Airflow, etc.)\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks.",

This helps with cases where you:\n\n* are data engineering in Rust within a highly connected, low latency ecosystem *(e.g., websocket feeds, Tokio etc.)*,\n* need typed arrays that remain Python/analytics ecosystem compatible\n* are working with real-time data use cases, and need minimal overhead Tabular data structures\n* are compiling lots, want < 2 second build times and basically value a solid data programming experience in Rust. \n\nTherefore, it is a great fit when you are DIY bare bones data engineering, and less so if you are relying on pre-existing tools *(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake).* For example, if you are data streaming in a more low-level manner.\n\n**Data Engineering examples:**\n\n* Stream data live off a Websocket and save it into \"**.arrow\"** or \"**.parquet**\" files.\n* Capture data in Minarrow, flip to Polars on the fly and calculate metrics in real-time, then push them in chunks to a Datastore as a live persistent service\n* Run parallelised statistical calculations on 1 billion rows without much compile-time overhead so Rust becomes workable\n\n**You also get:**\n\n* Strong IDE typing (in Rust)\n* One hit *\\`.to\\_arrow()*\\` and \\`.*to\\_polars()*\\` in Rust\n* Enums instead of dynamic dispatch *(a Rust flavour that's used in the official Arrow Rust crates)*\n* extensive SIMD-accelerated kernel functions available, including 60+ univariate distributions via the partner \\`SIMD-Kernels\\` crate (*fully reconciled to Scipy*). So, for many common cases you can stay in Rust for high performance compute.\n\nEssentially addressing a few areas that the main Arrow RS implementation makes different trade-offs. \n\n**Are you interested?**\n\nFor those who work in high performance data and software engineering and value this type of work, please feel free to ask any questions, even if you predominantly work in Python or another language*.* As, Arrow is one of those frameworks that backs a lot of that ecosystem but is not always well understood, due its back-end nature.\n\nI'm also happy to explain how you can move data across language boundaries *(e.g., Python <-> Rust)* using the Arrow format, or other tricks like this.\n\nHope you found this interesting.\n\nCheers,\n\nPete",

In fact when I brought it up he said that doesn’t exist for SSIS and then I had to say that it existed since 2012 with the project deployment model.  This surprised the dba’s boss and it’s fair to say that the dba probably does not like me right now. I will say that I have brought this up to him privately before and he ignored me so my boss decided for us to meet with his boss. I did not try to create drama but make a suggestion to make the prod deployment process smoother.\n\nAnyway that happened and now there are discussions for me to maybe just get my own database since the dba doesn’t want to improve systems.  I  am aware of data engineers sometimes managing databases also but wanted to know what that is like.  Does it make the job significantly harder or easier? now you understand more and have end to end control so that sounds like a benefit but it is more work.

Technically, it should also work on any K8s flavour. All the charts are custom made which can be tailored as per our needs. I found this deployment process to be extremely elegant for managing any K8s apps. :) \n\nAt a high level, a producer service calls the OpenSky REST API every ~30 seconds, publishes the raw JSON (converted to Avro) into Kafka, and a consumer writes that stream into Apache Iceberg tables which also has schema registry for evolution.\n\nI never used dagster before, so I tried to use it to make transformation tables. Also, it uses DuckDB for fast analytic queries. A better approach would be to use dbt on it - but that is something for later.\n\nI’ve then used a custom Dockerfile for Metabase to add DuckDB support as the official ones don’t have native DuckDB connection. Technically, you can query directly Iceberg realtime table - which I did to make realtime dashboard in Metabase.\n\nI hope this project might be helpful for people who want to learn or tinker with a realistic, end‑to‑end streaming + data lake setup on their own hardware, rather than just hello-world examples. \n\nLet me know your thoughts on this.

The read operation should identify: appended, changed and deleted rows.\n\nIn the iceberg documentation it says that the spark.read.format(\"iceberg\") is only able to identify appended rows. \n\nAny alternatives? \n\nMy idea was to use spark.readStream and to compare snapshots based on e.g. timestamps. But I am not sure whether this process could be very expensive as the table size could reache 100+ GB ",

Instead, it lets you interact with a database via raw SQL, while it handles mapping the SQL query results to in-memory objects.\n\nOnlymaps does just that by using Pydantic underneath. On top of that, it offers:\n\n\\- A minimal API for both sync and async query execution.\n\n\\- Support for all major relational databases.\n\n\\- Thread-safe connections and connection pools.\n\nThis project provides a simpler alternative to typical full-feature ORMs which seem to dominate the Python ORM landscape, such as SQLAlchemy and Django ORM.\n\nAny questions/suggestions are welcome!",

And now with current firm for 7 months. My real learning happened while being in the second firm , up-skill on a lot of things, dealt with clients and what not, basically was in a consulting role. \n\nWith the current switch, it’s a big MnC in healthcare with better employee policies than the previous firms I had worked with. The problem here is the type of work I am doing is of no use, not even upto the level of the previous employer. Just writing SQL transformations on DBT as ELT is already dealt by FiveTran, low code - no code tool. \n\nThis is making my learning curve go down and I am really worried about my career as we see AI being involved in every domain and a downward learning curve at this moment in time is not acceptable for me. Even I do learn a few more tools say Databricks, pretty similar to synapse , implementations come up as a problem. \n\nNeed your guidance from those sitting at senior roles or have passed through similar situations in the past.

I need to be able to get data on views, edits, deletes of reports, general user interactions, data pulled, tables/queries/views commonly used, etc. I do not need so much cpu consumption and stuff like that. In my stack I currently have dynatrace, but I saw it could be more for cpu consumption, and Azure Monitor, but couldnt find exactly what I need. Without Purview or smthn like that, is it possible to get this data? I've been checking PowerBI's APIs, but im not even sure they provide that. I saw that the Audit Logs within Fabric do have things like ViewReport, EditReport, etc. logs, but the documentation made it seem like a Purview subscription was needed, not sure tho.\n\nI know its possible to get that info, cause in another org I worked at I remember helping build a PowerBI report exactly about this data, but back then I just helped create some views to some already created tables in Snowflake and building the actual dashboard, so dont know how we got that info back then. I would REALLY appreciate if anyone could help me with having at least some clarity on this. If possible, I wish to take that data into our Snowflake like my old org did.",

        "author": "Crazy-Sir5935",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\n  \nN00b alert! \n\nWe are planning to do a proof of concept and one of the things we want to improve is that currently, we just ingest data directly from our source systems into our staging tables (without decoupling). For reference, we load data on a daily basis, operate in a heavily regulated sector and some of our source systems endpoint only provide batch/full loads (as they do tend to offer CDC on their end points but it only tracks 50% of the attributes making it kind of useless).\n\nIn our new setup we are considering the following:\n\n1. Every extraction gets saved in the source/extraction format (thus JSON or .parquet).\n2. The extracted files get stored for atleast 3 months before being moved to cold storage (JSON is not that efficient so i guess that will save us some money).\n3. Everything gets transformed to .parquet\n4. .parquet files will be stored forever (this is relative but you know what i mean).\n5. We will make a folder structure for each staging table based on year, month, day etc.\n\n  \nSo now you understand that we will work with .parquet files. \n\nWe were considering the new method of append only/snapshot tables (maybe combine it with  SC2) as then we could easily load the whole thing again if we mess up and fill in the valid from/valid to dates on basis of a loop. \n\nYet, a couple of our endpoints cause us to have some limitations. Let's consider the following example:\n\n1. The source system table logs hours a person logs on a project.\n2. The data goes back to 2015 and has approximately \\~12 mln. records.\n3. A person can adjust hours going a year back from now (or other columns in the table in the source system).\n4. The system has audit fields so we could only take changed rows but this only works for 5 out of 20 columns thereby forcing us to do batch loads on a daily basis for a full year back (as we need to be sure to be 100% correct).\n5. The result is that, after the initial extraction, each day we have a file with logging hours for the last 365 days.\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. We looked at the snapshot method, but even not looking at the files, this would result in 12 mln records per day added? I'm surely no expert but even with partitioning, this doesn't sound very durable after a year?\n2. Considering SCD2 for a staging table in this case. How can we approach a scenario in which we would need to rebuild the entire table? As most daily loads consider the last 365 days and approximately 1 million rows, this would be hell of a loop (and i don't want to know how long it's going to take). Would it in this case make sense to make delta parquet's specifically for this scenario so you end up with like 1000 rows a file and making such a scenario easier?\n\nWe need to be able to pull out 1 PK and see the changes in time for that specific PK without seeing thousands of duplicate rows, that's why we need SCD2 (as f.e. iceberg only shows the  whole table in a point of time).  \n\nThanks in advance for reading this mess. Sorry for being a n00b.",

Looking for input from DEs/SWEs on how transferable this work is, whether the comp is normal for NYC, and what questions I should ask before deciding.\n\n\nHey everyone, I’m looking for some candid input from folks in data engineering and software engineering.\n\nI’m currently in a strategy/operations role at a tech company while working through the MCIT program (Penn’s CS master’s for career switchers). My long term goal is to be a SWE. I recently interviewed for a Data Engineer II position at a healthcare tech company, and im trying to evaluate whether this role would be a good stepping stone to SWE or if I should just leverage my degree and build projects to make the switch. \n\nI’d appreciate any honest advice or experience people have.\n\nHere are the key details:\n\nBackground / motivation\n* I’ve worked strategy consulting and it has led to a good paying career but I don’t care about strategy in all honesty. I dislike the politics to get promoted, work is quite boring where im learning nothing new\n* I like consulting in the fact that I had to learn a new industry everyday, but TBH I couldn’t deal with 15-16hr workdays just to learn more\n* I love the technical side and building things which is why I considered SWE about a year and a half ago (I just expected the market to be better by then lolz)  \n\nComp\n* Base salary: $105–115K (Remote but I live in NYC)\n* Other factors are TBD as I haven’t gotten the formal letter yet, just verbal and what the job description outlines\n* I currently make 155k base and TC ~180k so it would be a pay cut for this role\n\nTeam / Org Structure\n* The role sits in the data - analytics org, not the software engineering org\n* DEs partner with analytics engineers, ML/data consumers, data scientists\n* I would not be in the analytics engineering track or an analyst, but they would be my stakeholders\n* No direct SWE involvement as far as I can tell\n\nTech + Responsibilities\n* Mostly Python + PySpark on Databricks\n* AWS and Azure\n* Both streaming and batch pipelines\n* Medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers)\n* ADF wiring + pipeline orchestration\n* File ingestion + transformations + schema enforcement\n* Some framework or pipeline component building, but unclear how deep the engineering side goes\n* Not much SQL involved, which surprised me, but they emphasized if they were asking for SQL it would be for more analysts vs engineers\n\n\nMy goals / questions:\nMy ultimate target is a technical heavy role that still pays well, like SWE or backend, but I’m also open to becoming a stronger DE if it meaningfully raises my chances of SWE transitioning.\n\nAny insights on the following would be helpful:\n1. Does this sound like a DE role with strong engineering exposure that can help facilitate a SWE transition? \n2. How transferable is this experience toward SWE or backend engineering later?\n3. For those who started in DE and moved into SWE, what allowed that transition?\n4. Is $105–115K base realistic for NYC in a mid-level DE role, or does that seem low?\n5. Would you take this role if your long-term goal leaned more toward SWE?\n6. Anything I should ask the hiring manager or my internal referrer to get more clarity?\nI’m not trying to bash the role or Data engineering, I’m genuinely trying to understand if this would meaningfully advance my pivot or if im better off staying in my current role and continuing to work on transitioning directly. Any honest input from experienced DEs or SWEs would really help. Thanks!",

For each document, we want to produce a Markdown version in a new dataset, then ask an LLM to summarize it. \n\nThese tools all suggest an imperative approach: Maybe a function `get_input_documents()` that returns HTML documents, then a loop over this to run a conversion function `convert_to_markdown()`, and then a `summarize()` and a `save_output_document()`. With Ray you could define these as _tasks_ and have the scheduler execute them concurrently and distributed over a cluster. You could batch or paginate some things as needed, all easy stuff.\n\nIn such an imperative world, we might also keep the job simple and simply iterate over the input every time if the processing is cheap enough — dumb is often easier. We could use hashes (for example) to avoid doing work on inputs that haven't changed since the last run, and we could cache LLM prompts. We might do a \"find all since last run\" to skip work. Or plug the input into a queue of changes.\n\nAll that's fine, but once the processing grows to a certain scale, that's a lot of \"find inputs, loop over, produce output\" stitched together — it's the same pattern over and over again: Mapping and reducing. It's map/reduce but done imperatively.\n\nFor my purposes, it would be a lot more elegant to describe a full graph of operators and queries.\n\nFor example, if I declared `bucket(\"input/*.html\")` as a source, I could string this into a graph `bucket(\"input/*.html\") -> convert_document()`. And then `-> write_output_document()`. An important principle here is that the pipeline only expresses flow, and the scheduler handles the rest: It can parallelize operators, it can memoize steps based on inputs, it can fuse together map steps, it can handle retrying, it can track lineage by encoding what operators a piece of data went through, it can run operators on different nodes, it can place queues between nodes for backpressure, concurrency control, and rate limiting — and so on.\n\nAnother important principle here is that the pipeline, if properly memoized, can be fully differential, meaning it can know at any given time which pieces of data have changed between operator nodes, and use that property to avoid unnecessary work, skipping entire paths if the output would be identical.\n\nI'm fully aware of, and have used, streaming systems like Flink and Spark. My sense is that these are very much made for large-scale Big Data applications that benefit from vectorization and partitioning of columnar data. Maybe they could be used for this purpose, but it doesn't appear like a good fit? My data is complex, often unstructured or graph-like, and is I/O-bound (calling out to LLMs, vector databases, and so on). I haven't really seen this for \"small data\".\n\nIn many ways, I'm seeking a \"distributed Make\", at least in the abstract. And there is indeed a very neat tool called [SnakeMake](https://snakemake.github.io/) that's a lot like this, which I'm looking into. I'm a bit put off by how it has its own language — I would prefer Python to declare my graph, too — but it looks interesting and worth trying out. \n\nIf anyone has any tips, I would love to hear them.",

Any resources that you're aware of in this space would also be of benefit for me to reference.  Thanks!\n\n1) Data quality (DQ): technical controls vs business rules.  In my last role there was a “handshake” agreement on what DQ rules are for Technology to own vs what Data Governance owns.  Typically rules like reconciliations, timeliness rules, and record counts (e.g. file-level rules vs field- or content-level rules) were left for Technology to manage.\n\n2) Bronze/silver/platinum/gold layers.  DQ rules apply to the silver or platinum layers, not the gold layer.  The gold layer (i.e. the \"golden source\") should be for consumption.\n\n3) Any critical data elements should have full lineage tracking of all layers in #2.  Tech isn't necessarily directly involved in this process, but should support DG when documenting lineage.\n\n4) Any schema changes DG should be actively aware of, even before the changes are made.  Whether the change request originates from Technology or the Business, any change can have downstream impact for data consumers for example to Data Products.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all, this is Burak, I am one of the makers of [Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin). We built an MCP server that allows you to connect your AI agents to your DWH/query engine and make them interact with your DWH.\n\nA bit of a back story: we started Bruin as an open-source CLI tool that allows data people to be productive with the end-to-end pipelines. Run SQL, Python, ingestion jobs, data quality, whatnot. The goal being a productive CLI experience for data people.\n\nAfter some time, agents popped up, and when we started using them heavily for our own development stuff, it became quite apparent that we might be able to offer similar capabilities for data engineering tasks. Agents can already use CLI tools, and they have the ability to run shell commands, and they could technically use Bruin CLI as well.\n\nOur initial attempts were around building a simple [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) file with a set of instructions on how to use Bruin. It worked fine to a certain extent; however it came with its own set of problems, primarily around maintenance. Every new feature/flag meant more docs to sync. It also meant the file needed to be distributed somehow to all the users, which would be a manual process.\n\nWe then started looking into MCP servers: while they are great to expose remote capabilities, for a CLI tool, it meant that we would have to expose pretty much every command and subcommand we had as new tools. This meant a lot of maintenance work, a lot of duplication, and a large number of tools which bloat the context.\n\nEventually, we landed on a middle-ground: expose only documentation navigation, not the commands themselves.\n\nWe ended up with just 3 tools:\n\n* `bruin_get_overview`\n* `bruin_get_docs_tree` \n* `bruin_get_doc_content` \n\nThe agent uses MCP to fetch docs, understand capabilities, and figure out the correct CLI invocation. Then it just runs the actual Bruin CLI in the shell. This means less manual work for us, and making the new features in the CLI automatically available to everyone else. \n\nYou can now use Bruin CLI to connect your AI agents, such as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other agent that supports MCP servers, into your DWH. Given that all of your DWH metadata is in Bruin, your agent will automatically know about all the business metadata necessary. \n\nHere are some common questions people ask to Bruin MCP:\n\n* analyze user behavior in our data warehouse\n* add this new column to the table X\n* there seems to be something off with our funnel metrics, analyze the user behavior there\n* add missing quality checks into our assets in this pipeline\n\n  \nHere's a quick video of me demoing the tool: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U)\n\nAll of this tech is fully open-source, and you can run it anywhere. \n\nBruin MCP works out of the box with:\n\n* BigQuery\n* Snowflake\n* Databricks\n* Athena\n* Clickhouse\n* Synapse\n* Redshift\n* Postgres\n* DuckDB\n* MySQL\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this!

Our goal is to make the experience more intuitive and efficient, and your input will play a key role in shaping the design.\n\nWhen you first open a fresh TDMS file, what does your real-world workflow look like? Specifically, when importing data (whether in MATLAB, Python, LabVIEW, DIAdem, or Excel), do you typically load everything at once, or do you review metadata first?\n\nHere are a few questions to guide your thoughts:\n\n\t•\tThe “Blind” Load: Do you ever import the entire file without checking, or is the file size usually too large for that?\n\n\t•\tThe “Sanity” Check: Before loading raw data, what’s the one thing you check to ensure the file isn’t corrupted? (e.g., Channel Name, Units, Sample Rate, or simply “file size > 0 KB”)\n\t\n•\tThe Workflow Loop: Do you often open a file for one channel, close it, and then realize later you need another channel from the same file?\n\nYour feedback will help us understand common pain points and improve the overall experience. Please share your thoughts in the comments or vote on the questions above.\n\nThank you for helping us make TDMS data handling better!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1p715sk)",

It enforces a strict 2-second delay between hits to respect Reddit's infrastructure.\n\nTransformation: Parses the raw JSON tree, filters out stickied posts/memes, and extracts the selftext and top-level comments.\n\nAnalysis: Performs keyword frequency mapping (e.g., \"Excel\" vs. \"Calculus\") against a dictionary of 1,800+ terms.\n\nIt outputs and  generates a structured JSON dataset and uses reportlab to programmatically compile a PDF visualization of the \"Reality Gap.\"\n\nI built it like that cuz  I wanted a tool that could run on a potato  and didn't rely on external cloud storage or paid APIs.

But I’m concerned about running into Dagster’s recommended 100k asset limit. Alternatively, I could use a single dynamic partition on EQP_Number, but then I’m worried Dagster will try to reprocess older data (when mew data arrives) which could trigger expensive downstream updates (also one of the assets produces different outputs each run so this would affect downstream data as well).\n\nI’d also like to avoid tagging processed data in S3, since the client plans to move toward a database storage/ingestion flow in the future and we don’t yet know what that will look like.\n\nWhat partitioning approach would you recommend for this?

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm looking for principles of structuring data analyses in bioinformatics. Almost all bioinf projects start with some kind of data (eg. microscopy pictures, files containing positions of atoms in a protein, genome sequencing reads, sparse matrices of gene expression levels), which are then passed through CLI tools, analysed in R or python, fed into ML, etc.\n\nThere's very little care put into enforcing standardization, so while we use the same file formats, scaffolding your analysis directory, naming conventions, storing scripts, etc. are all up to you, and usually people do them ad hoc with their own \"standards\" they made up couple weeks ago. I've seen published projects where scientists used file suffixes as metadata, generating files with 10+ suffixes.\n\nThere are bioinf specific workflow managers (snakemake, nextflow) that essentially make you write a DAG of the analysis, but in my case those don't solve the problems with reproducibility.\n\nGeneral questions:\n\n1. Is there a principle for naming files? I usually keep raw filenames and create a symlink with a short simple name, but what about intermediate files?\n2. What about metadata? \\*.meta.json? Which metadata is 100% must-store, and which is irrelevant? 1 meta file for each datafile or 1 per directory, or 1 per project?\n3. How to keep track of file modifications and data integrity? sha256sum in metadata? Separate csv with hash, name, date of creation and last modification? DVC + git?\n4. Are there paradigms of data storage? By that I mean, design principles that guide your decisions without having think too much?\n\nI'm not asking this on a bioinf sub because they have very little idea themselves.",

        "author": "xandral95",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m experimenting with a storage-engine design and I’d love feedback from people with database internals experience.\nThis is a thought experiment with a small Python PoC, I'm not an expert SW engineer, for me would be really difficult to develop alone a complex system in Rust or C++ to get serious benchmarks, but I would like to share the idea to understand if it's interesting.\n\n# Core Idea\n\nTo think SQL like tables as geospatial raster data.\n\n1. Latitude ---> row_index (primary key)\n2. Longitude ---> column_index \n3. Time ---> MVCC version or transaction_id\n\n\nAnd from these 3 core dimensions (rows, columns, time), the model naturally generalize to N dimensions:\n\n* Add hash-based dimensions for high‑cardinality OLAP attributes (e.g., `user_id`, `device_id`, `merchant_id`). These become something like:\n\n  * `hash(user_id) % N` → distributes data evenly.\n\n* Add range-based dimensions for monotonic or semi‑monotonic values (e.g., timestamps, sequence numbers, IDs):\n\n  * `timestamp // col_chunk_size` → perfect for pruning, like time-series chunks.\n\n\nThis lets a traditional RDBMS table behave like an N-D array, hopefully tuned for both OLTP and OLAP scanning, depending on which dimensions are meaningful to the workload by chunking rows and columns like lat/lon tiles, and layering versions like a time-axis, you get deterministic coordinates and very fast addressing.\n\n### Example\nHere’s a simple example of what a chunk file path might look like when all dimensions are combined.\n\nImagine a table chunked along:\n\n* **row dimension** → `row_id // chunk_rows_size = 12`\n* **column dimension** → `col_id // chunk_cols_size = 0`\n* **time/version dimension** → `txn_id = 42`\n* **hash dimension** (e.g., `user_id`) → `hash(user_id) % 32 = 5`\n* **range dimension** (e.g., timestamp bucket) → `timestamp // 3600 = 472222`\n\nA possible resulting chunk file could look like:\n\n```\nchunk_r12_c0_hash5_range472222_v42.parquet\n```\n\n\nInspired by array stores like **Zarr**, but intended for **HTAP** workloads.\n\n\n### Update strategies\n\nNaively using CoW on chunks but this gives huge write amplification. So I’m exploring a **Patch + Compaction** model: append a tiny *patch file* with only the changed cells + txn_id. A vacuum merges base chunk + patches into a new chunk and removes the old ones.\n\nIs this something new or reinvented? I don't know about similar products with all these combinations, the most common are (ClickHouse, DuckDB, Iceberg,...). Do you see any serious architectural problem on that?\n\n\nAny feedback is appreciated!\n\nTL;DR: Exploring an HTAP storage engine that treats relational tables like N-dimensional sparse arrays, combining row/col/time chunking with hash and range dimensions for OLAP/OLTP. Seeking feedback on viability and bottlenecks.\n",

On top of that, being new means I don't have the experience to be able to accurately tell whether something is hard or easy, which made things even more obviously dumb.\n\nAnd NOW I finally realize that, all I had to do was first cover the base case scenarios (like learning how to build a basic page that navigates around other pages) and then come up with something that I want to build, and start stumbling around 99% of the time trying to figure out how to build it. Obviously that would mean spending more time googling, reading articles, stackoverflow etc. than actually writing code. Duh!

I'd appreciate it quite the lot.\nWhere is best to look for? Should I take courses, will I embarrass myself for being clumsy? Quite the personal question, but I'm rather anxious when it comes about being an inconvenience to others.\nAre tutorials reliable enough to give me a nudge forward?\n\nAnything helps, really.\nThank you for your time reading this.

I used InterviewCoder for some of those sessions because it gives structure instead of chaos. It forced me to slow down, think out loud, and understand my approach instead of just clicking through problems. Weirdly enough, I improved faster with less stress. I feel like half of interview prep is just learning to be calm and organized, not solving a million questions. Wish I realized that sooner",

I alone have built over 40 page templates (in the last 2 years) for this site at this point, and I don't work with anyone because only one other person codes, and it's my boss, who I am senior to with this kind of programming. Truthfully, I hate it. I hate web development, and I hate doing this day in and day out. I was just sort of forced into it, and now it's destroyed my passion for the field. I could go on about why I hate my current job, but I'll move on.\n\nIf the job market weren't demotivating enough, I'm so exhausted from work that I don't want to sit at my own computer at home, which makes learning so difficult. I remember during my first Python class, I was fascinated by a simple function that told you the total length of all sides of a shape based on the shape and length of one side. I tinkered with that and other code so much and never got tired of it. Now I'm sick of the thought of code, and that makes me sad because my dream is still to get into the gaming industry. The idea of not getting in makes me want to cry.\n\nI want to reignite that love I had for coding. I want to get back into it and find that love for tinkering and understanding how things work (I'm actually very good at learning through reverse engineering. It's how I learned everything I know about web development.) Is there a game or something that teaches code, particularly C++, in a way that is different and fun? I've been trying to work through an Udemy class that is actually taught very well, but I keep running into that block because it's just mostly watching someone code, taking notes, and then doing a couple of exercises throughout the chapter. It's just another class.\n\nAnd please, don't tell me about how difficult things are out there. I already know, and I need to be motivated, not have what little of a spark that's left put out.",

I'm not looking for a job now as my attention is fully dediacted to my trip to China to study in 2026. Here's the thing though:\n\nJust like many of you guys i was completely amazed by how fast AI can help me code. But i feel like i'm relying on it too much now... I just finished building my first app, developed the design myself and used symfony to build the app (i'm lacking in backend dev...) and most of the code was written by AI. I give directions, i know what feature to describe and how to technically build it using the rights terms, the right prompts and asking for the right things. But not typing the code myself makes me feel like i'm heading straight into a wall. I want to learn hard, started to learn vue js by myself and how to use components. But in the end i always reach for AI as to dev a feature faster. I'm afraid i won't make it far in the pro world if it keeps going. Do you guys have any recommendation for a guy who wants to dev for a living, mostly frontend without being own by Cursor or Claude ? What's the ideal roadmap to balance things....\n\n  \nThanks for reading through. ",

Or is it way too early (I am 20yo)?\n\n  \nAnother question I have is how the hell does one pick how to actually learn to code, or the fundamentals of programming etc? I am familiar with HTML5, CSS, JS as well as C and JAVA, that i've learned through uni courses, youtube videos and online courses. But how does one actually choose whats better for understanding the basics of programming, a language etc? Is it youtube vids? online courses? books? I am aware that the courses and the vids are only a small \"push\" to actually learn to code and that you have to build on your own, but how do I choose this push? Also, does any of these ways of learning put you in a coordination for your future career, by helping you put your interests in an order? I'd love to hear yall's opinions!",

I'm interested in knowing which path is best for me to use enough mathematics and not feel like I'm learning tools like Git or Python libraries in vain, which were my next steps.\n\nI'm in a hurry to get a job or some income (I want to rent alone again; I had to move back in with my parents), but I think I can take some time to educate myself and gain some solidity. Any form of encouragement, project ideas, suggestions on where to look, what communities to interact with, or a learning path is welcome, even if it's a harsh but sincere comment.\n\nThank you.",

        "author": "Dizzy-Complaint-8871",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Naming has become a real challenge for me. It’s easy when I’m following a YouTube tutorial and building mock projects, but in real production projects it gets difficult. In the beginning it’s manageable, but as the project grows, naming things becomes harder.\n\nFor example, I have various formatters. A formatter takes a database object—basically a Django model instance—and formats it. It’s similar to a serializer, though I have specific reasons to create my own instead of using the built-in Python or Django REST Framework serializers. The language or framework isn’t the main point here; I’m mentioning them only for clarity.\n\nSo I create one formatter that returns some structured data. Then I need another formatter that returns about 80% of the same data, but with slight additions or removals. There might be an order formatter, then another order formatter with user data, another one without the “order received” date, and so on. None of this reflects my actual project—it’s not e-commerce but an internal tool I can’t discuss in detail—but it does involve many formatters for different use cases. Depending on the role, I may need to send different versions of order data with certain fields blank. This is only the formatter situation.\n\nThen there are formatters that include user roles, order formatters that also include product details, and other combinations. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to separate order and product formatters, but in rare cases I need a product formatter with only an order number or something similar, so I end up creating another formatter because the original one didn’t include it.\n\nBeyond formatters, naming functions, classes, methods, getters, and setters also becomes difficult. I know that when naming becomes hard, it may indicate that the code isn’t following the Single Responsibility Principle. But I’m not always sure how to handle this.\n\nFor example, I might be building an interface that lets users update their data. An admin can update emails, phone numbers, and roles, but a regular user can only update their name. This leads to functions like `update_user_with_role`, `update_user_normal`, `update_user_with_email`, and so on.\n\nMost of my projects have role-based access control, and different roles can view or update different fields. Sometimes even the displayed values differ. For example, if an admin views an order, they might see quantity 100, but a vendor might see quantity 70 because the order is split between two vendors. That means writing multiple getters, different database queries, and various ways of manipulating the data. This leads to many functions and a lot of naming decisions.\n\nInside a single function, I often deal with dictionaries (like objects in JavaScript). I might fetch raw data from the database, give it a long descriptive name, remove some parts, process it again, and so on. I end up naming the same dictionary multiple times in different forms, and the names become long and messy. I’m unsure what the right approach is here.\n\nTutorials usually cover only obvious examples aimed at beginners. They say things like “If you calculate tax, call it `calculate_tax`,” which is obvious. But my real-world cases aren’t that simple. If discounts depend on user roles, sure, the logic should be inside the function, but I still need to express it clearly. I also don’t want to get stuck overthinking names because that delays the project.\n\nName collisions happen a lot. For example, I once wrote a function called `get_user` to fetch a user by ID. Later I needed to fetch users by email, username, and other fields. I ended up writing multiple versions, and the original vague name became a problem because it was created early in the project. I eventually renamed it, but it was painful. That’s why I want a better approach from the start so I don’t spend hours worrying about names.\n\nSometimes it feels easier to write the logic itself. I never use meaningless names like `a` or `x1`, but I do end up writing temporary or placeholder names like “this\\_has\\_to\\_be\\_renamed”. Then I move on to the next function and write “this\\_is\\_not\\_right\\_first\\_has\\_to\\_be\\_renamed”, and so on. These names aren’t helpful, but they let me continue writing code without getting stuck on naming.\n\nSo I’m looking for any guide, project, or glossary I can refer to—something with common naming patterns. For instance, I used words like “collection” or “group” earlier, but “batch” made more sense in my context. I’ve used AI suggestions often; sometimes they help, sometimes they produce vague names because they don’t have the full context.\n\nI’m not sure if there is any practical guide, but if there is, please share it. Or share any tips that can help me improve. Naming shouldn’t be something that holds me back; I’d rather focus on the logic instead. Thank you.",

        "content": "I recently wrote an image blurring algorithm that uses a basic approach that I learned in my computational physics course in college. Basically, pixels in an image are selected at random, and its RGB values are averaged with the RBG values of all pixels immediately round it. When this happens, the selected pixel (\"pixel\" is an object I created) is also set to \"processed\" meaning this pixel has already been worked on, don't perform the averaging operation on it again. This implies that the random selector method I'm using can choose any pixel it wants to while running, so multiple pixels get selected multiple times. This is inefficient. How could I also exclude them from the set of values the random method can select? I was thinking about putting all the pixel values in a linked list and then knocking them out that way with a checkinlist(pixel) method, but maybe a hash table would be better?",

A few of them felt like they relied a bit too much on trial and error, so I turned that curiosity into a small side project. I built a browser extension that reads the puzzle when you open it, figures out the pattern, and then gives hints or can even solve it automatically. Right now it only works with the “Zip” puzzle, but I’m planning to expand it as I go.\n\nWhile building this, I ended up learning way more than I expected. I got a much better understanding of how Chrome extensions are structured, how to use content scripts to interact with a page, and how to scrape and interpret the DOM in a way that doesn’t break when the site loads things dynamically. I also had to figure out how to design simple pattern-recognition logic, handle communication between different parts of the extension, and work through a bunch of timing issues that I’d never really run into before. Publishing it taught me how the Chrome Web Store process works too. Overall, it was a fun reminder that small projects are often the best way to learn things you didn’t even know you needed.\n\nIf anyone wants to take a look or offer feedback, here’s the extension on the Chrome Web Store:\n\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkedin-puzzle-cracker/immohpcmpcbpfbepgkjacopkajnllpak",

When I try to ask other students they might say \"I learnt from a young age from parents or other tutors\", or that \"they made projects that they liked and just coded a lot\",  I don't really get to observe the specifics of what they're doing the way you can study someone when they're playing a sport or some other visible activity. \n\n I was told mathematics was the main foundation behind computer science that is mainly unchanging compared to programming languages, libraries and toolkits which change constantly, I thought it would be best if I invested most of my time into studying math while taking 'intro to CS' and intro to 'x programming language tutorials', just trying to focus on passing my CS degree and computational mathematics first before exploring a specific software engineering discipline.\n\nI thought that once I understood the mathematics understanding how to translate concepts into code would be as straightforward as making functions for arithmetic operations or other ideas people intuitively understand.  But if you brought a mathematician with no programming experience in a structured course they would not understand how to program an addition function in python or C++ either.\n\nI should not have focused so much on math and expected the information to immediately convert to programming skill or at least make the implementation side obvious. In my intro to DSA class we didn’t even use discrete math or linear algebra, so there was no reason to take all 3 classes at the same time with no way to tie the classes together, but the curriculum made me do this. \n\n\n\nEventually in my classes I reached a point where I was told despite how much I tried to study the math and computer science concepts in pseudocode, I couldn't implement anything, i couldn't code. I was confused as I tried to engage as much as I could in my intro to x language-intermediate x language classes, asking questions, going to office hours(which in intermediate java for example was usually swamped because we were given 'real projects'/'toy projects' as assignments after going over a small topic in class, and the professor told us to figure it out)\n\nWhen I asked how I should have learnt to code I was told to mainly \"make more personal projects from scratch\" and just to \"code more\"\n\n  \nI wasn't sure where that meant for me to start.  While I knew I was hardly software engineer material, I thought I was at least making enough progress to code the computer science concepts in my classes but I wasn't, especially since we didn't focus on literal technical problems but toy projects/ \"real world scenarios\" using the algorithm in ways that we couldn't directly google because it was a unique scenario project, and we didn't actually code in class because we were told \"I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science.\" \n\nShould I do leetcode and seek computational problems to solve? I tried that and I was no more prepared for the mini software assignments given in class. \n\nShould I choose a specific field of software engineering and just start learning the tools through example projects before branching off into my own  project ideas? A lot of the programming  libraries/tools were too niche and abstract,  taking away time trying to study a specific library itself rather than the programming/ software engineering principles I was trying to gain from practicing programming with those tools to apply to my classes.\n\nI tried to read books on software design, but the books talked more about general project cycle principles such as readable  and  reusable code, good documentation, but computer architecture talked about low level concepts such as the ALU of which studying wasn't helping me program any better at the time nor did I fully understand.\n\n  \nI started trying to program projects from my imagination, especially since I was told \"don't use tutorials, code from scratch, employers don't care about clone/derivate projects\" which always ended up with me taking a bunch of notes on the documentation trying to study what enumeration is  or watching a bunch of mini tutorials on different classes in a toolkit I thought might be relevant to my project for weeks on end, with no actual progress on the project being made, just dismembered pieces of code in test files which I definitely can't put on my resume either. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So I built a small adaptive learning system on top of an LLM that tries to sit in the middle.\n\nThe system does three things very strictly:\n\n* Error-driven feedback: When you ask for help with your code, the AI prints your code with line numbers and only points to “Line X – syntax error / structure error / logic error / input error”. No full solutions unless you explicitly ask after you’ve tried to fix it.\n* Maximum 2 new concepts per lesson: Each learning unit is allowed to introduce at most two new commands or ideas. If a lesson needs more than that, it’s automatically split into smaller sub-lessons. The idea is to manage cognitive load instead of throwing everything at you at once.\n* Reflection and tracking: After each session, there’s a short reflection (what was hard, what worked, what to focus on next), and the system tracks goals, progress, and repeated error types.\n\nRight now it’s wired for Python (loops, input, error handling, functions, lists, etc.), but the structure is generic: goals (G##), lessons (L## / W## / T##), a command tracker, error plan, progress tracking, learning log. You could in principle swap the content and use the same engine for other things (language learning, math, etc.).\n\nThe whole thing is:\n\n* A GitHub template repo\n* No personal data included\n* Documented so you can understand and change the rules\n\nRepo:  \n[https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-](https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-)\n\nI’d love feedback on:\n\n* Whether this kind of “error-only” feedback actually helps learning\n* How you would extend or simplify it for beginners\n* Any ideas for good Python goals/lessons that fit the “max 2 new concepts” rule",

I'm an engineer-turned-marketer, so I have a fair understanding of programming concepts as well. I just want to be better - and I'm having a hard time figuring out where to start.\n\nI like threeJS and GSAP, although the learning curve feels a little intimidating. I feel like Scrimba and Boot.Dev(maybe more backend?) might be a good place to start. I'm prone to picking things up then dropping them quickly - so I'd ideally not want to put in a lot of money as a subscription (the currency exchange rate makes the $ a little painful). \n\nWhere do I begin?",

        "content": "Hello, everyone.\n\nI need your help picking a book to expand my knowledge in fundamentals of computer science.\n\nI am a mechanical engineering major, and about 3 years ago I decided to switch careers and learn programming. Thing is, while doing this, I focused more on hands on knowledge that will help me find a job, not fundamentals. I started with Harward's CS50 course for some basics, then learned Java and Spring, basics of SQL and Git, and then a bit of data structures and algorithms. After about 8-9 months, I landed a job and started working.\n\nCurrently, I am feeling that I missed a lot of fundamental topics and I would like to cover the blank spots before I can further improve. I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.\n\nI feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.\n\nHence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.\n\nThanks for reading and your help.",

        "author": "Effective_Clue_1099",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Background: Mid 2022 bootcamp grad. Got a job as a mostly frontend developer for 65k. Was there for \\~1.5 years, after our big project, they laid off about 1/4 of the company.\n\nJust had an 8 round interview process, I thought there wasn't a chance. Got the call, they said it was an easy decision for them and I signed the offer for 115k today. I'm over the moon.\n\n\n\nSo what worked / didn't work\n\nApplying:\n\nHad 3 referrals, none turned into interviews. I think the value of referrals have gone down dramatically in the last couple of years and that a lot of companies stopped giving referral bonuses\n\nI didn't get a single entry / jr level interview. I think the no cs degree hurt for those roles, so many say 1-2 YoE so I thought I was a shoo-in, nah\n\nMy success rate fell sharply after 6 months unemployment. Success rate improved dramatically (only for mobile positions) after publishing a personal project (this was about a year into unemployment, I had a single interview in months 6-12 and it didn't go past hiring manager)\n\nNo interviews from linkedIn job apps, despite targeting same day postings\n\ngot 2 interviews from hiringcafe and an ai auto fill extension (simplify)\n\nI went in-person and dropped off a resume to two local companies that I saw had openings. One gave me an interview (50% success rate, you were right Grandpa)\n\nThe mobile position I got, came from linkedIn. I stumbled across the tech lead of a local company posting about the opening, there was no linkedIn job posting. I messaged him about my app and he said he tried it out, liked it and wanted to interview me.\n\nI think the other 2 or 3 came from hackernews, again, where I was talking directly to somebody technical about my app.\n\nI tried linkedin premium and messaged a ton of hiring managers / recruiters, nothing came from those\n\nI had 6 or 7 interviews in the last year and a half, all above my last role. Was definitely unprepared for the first few, feel I went from jr. to mid level while unemployed.\n\nBut yeah, highest success rate was finding local companies and contacting somebody who was technical (and part of the hiring process) about what I was working on\n\n  \nTechnical Interviews:  \nI was grinding leetcode for a bit but found it not to be worth while (past getting comfortable with mapping and array, obj, string manipulation). I did have some coding challenges but they weren't leetcode mediums or hards, either can you fetch data, format / display / style it or a leetcode easy to see if you can code (though I didn't interview at major companies).\n\n I did have two system designs interviews earlier on that I wasn't prepared for. And one later on that I knew was coming and spent a week cramming for. Did really well in that and moved to final round but didn't get job. My recent interview didn't have a strictly system design round but a lot of topics I had studied did come up in conversation and I'm glad I was able to talk on them\n\nAnother thing that was a huge help was I was MUCH less stressed about the recent interview. I thought I wasn't going to get it, was working as a bartender so had money coming in, might as well see where it goes and try to learn something. Most of the interviews I had when I was deep into unemployment, I would get 2-4 hours of sleep the night before because I was so stressed. Somehow, the night before this company's technical, I had planned on doing leetcode all night but I was strangely tired, thought I wasn't going to get the job anyways and didn't want to waste my night off doing coding problems. I ended up conking out hard way earlier than I typically go to bed and had the best nights rest I've had in two years. I truly don't know how it aligned that way but being well rested was way more valuable than a couple more leetcode problems\n\nBehavioral interviews:\n\nThe 3 companies I interviewed with - post releasing my app - were much more interested in my app than my previous role. They were all for mobile positions.\n\nI also started keeping an interview prep journal that had 6 star stories (and what questions they could be used in) as well as all other questions I've been asked in interviews (and had a separate tab for system design notes)\n\nI would often get a \"how's your week going\" question at the start of interviews. Early into unemployment, I thought, 'I don't want to waste their time', and just say something like, 'It's been a good week, have been looking forward to this interview.' and let them jump into it from there. After it happened a few times I realize they want to see if they can have an actual, casual conversation with you. So in these last few interviews, I always made a point to spend literally a minute, 2 max, chatting. Just something like an event that weekend I was excited for. The recent interview the guy had mentioned having a kid, the next interview I asked what his kid was dressing as for Halloween\n\nThe other thing that was a big help was the CEO really liked me. I really didn't understand the company's industry, so I spent a couple of hours with ai learning about it, making sure I knew some basic terminology, read articles about the company, and had actual, non fluff questions, about the company and the industry for the CEO. In the middle he mentioned being surprised by the questions\n\n\n\n65k -> \\~27/hour -> 115k   \nAgain, absolutely over the moon. Very excited, will be working hard to make sure I continue to grow and never go through such a grueling unemployment period\n\nTl;dr  \nTry talking to technical people directly. Look local. Have some system design knowledge. Build something with users. Be well rested and sociable. Be able to talk about the company, past being a developer. Good luck to those searching and be easy on yourself, it's hard out there.",

We use an in-house office software with a built-in chat and email, but 99% of the time we just use the chat or talk face-to-face.\n\nHowever, the office software sucks. If you don't use it for an hour, it disconnects without any notification. While you're disconnected, chat messages get sent to email, and don't display in chat when you log back on. The home page displays new email notifications, but only some of them, not all of them. I thought it only filtered automated messages, but I was VERY wrong.\n\nThis week my boss was on a business trip. He was still working in my timezone though so we could talk. I was waiting for some details in the chat, but either I was logged off or he just emailed it directly. Either way, no notification.\n\nThe day after he sent it, I had a day off I scheduled in advance. While I was out, he forgot I had off and sent me an email. Same thing, no notification.\n\nTwo days later, I got a message from him. While he'd remembered I had a day off, he was still extremely pissed that I hadn't seen his emails. He said it was the bare minimum act of communication\n\nAdmittedly, it feels like he'd be right at most other companies, but we'd always used other means of communication. Before he left, he even gave me his phone number saying it's how I should contact him if he wasn't online to recieve chat messages, completely overlooking the email.\n\nRegardless, my contract is supposed to be renewed soon, and now I'm worried it won't be.

Apple trimmed sales positions managing business, education, and government accounts, and Amazon cut approximately 14,000 corporate workers in October, including more than 1,800 engineers.\n\nThis doesn't mean AI will take over jobs, I just means AI will more jobs that require physical human interaction in fields like agriculture, plumbing, welding, waste collection etc which will be a goldmine. \n",

        "content": "I’m in my 40s, currently working as an SDE2/Senior-level engineer at a big tech company. Compensation is solid and the work is technically interesting. The flip side is the usual big-tech stress: reorganizations, shifting priorities, constant pace, and the general feeling of volatility.\n\nI’m considering an offer for a “Principal”-level role in local government IT. The job is stable, unionized, slower paced, and has a predictable schedule. The work looks more enterprise/ERP-focused and nowhere near as chaotic as big tech.\n\nMy concerns are:\n\nWhether I’m actually ready for a Principal role: I’ve operated at a mid-to-senior IC level, but I haven’t formally held a Principal title before. I’m worried about stepping into Principal-level expectations in a new domain and whether I’ll be able to perform at the level the role requires.\n\nGetting pigeonholed: Government IT tends to have slower-moving tech and more specialized enterprise systems. I’m concerned that if I spend years there, my skills might narrow and limit future private-sector options.\n\nLong-term compensation ceiling: Government positions have fixed salary steps and a hard cap. Once you hit the top step, raises are basically cost-of-living adjustments. In private tech, there’s still room for higher comp and growth.\n\nI’m trying to balance a more stable and predictable lifestyle with the risks of taking on a bigger role, potentially narrowing my skillset, and reducing long-term earning potential.\n\nIf anyone has moved between private tech and government IT, especially mid-career or at a senior level, I’d really appreciate hearing how it affected your career, confidence, and quality of life.",

We scrambled to switch vendors and migrate services overnight.\n* In another case, the country  IT head got fired after auditors discovered his wife was a key partner in the firm building our new data centre.\n\n**How It Plays Out at Every Level**\n\n* **Top Brass**: Execs skim a “small percentage” from huge outsourcing deals with ISVs and preferred partners. Kickbacks may hit spouse accounts as “consulting fees,” or come as all-expenses-paid Vegas/Hawaii retreats, plus holiday hampers and gift cards. \n* **Middle Management (VPs/Directors)**: They steer SOWs and contracts to “preferred vendors” – think brother-in-law’s startup – for their cut. \n* **Lower Levels (Managers/Devs)**: Free conference passes with airfare, SWAG-stuffed goodie bags, vendor open bars, and hackathon gift cards are routine “*appreciation*.”\n\nThis stuff feels like par for the course in IT, even as companies preach zero tolerance. \n\nWhat’s the wildest (or most common) corruption you’ve spotted?",

I got incredibly lucky with an internship that converted to full-time, so I've never interviewed anywhere lol (the internship didn't have a traditional interview process. I didn't even answer a single technical question.)\n\nRequired to be in another state by fall 2026, which means I need to start looking ASAP. Problem is...I'm in my late 20s and have literally zero job hunting experience.\n\n* **My first question:** How important are portfolio projects for senior-level roles? \n\nI've got a few (including a personal site) and I'm working on wrapping up a bigger Rust project, but I'm worried I'm just wasting my time if employers don't actually care about this stuff outside of entry-level.\n\nI'm also worried staying at one company for 7 years might've hurt me. I'm significantly underpaid for my experience and degree (MS in CS + certs) right now, and I'm paranoid that long tenure looks like I'm either stuck or coasting. I keep hearing conflicting takes: some say it's a red flag for stagnation, others say it doesn't matter.\n\n* **My second question:** Anyone know how this actually plays out in the job market? I'm pretty ignorant about this stuff. Can't change it now, but good to know for the future.\n\n\n\n**TDLR:** What should a senior dev actually focus on when entering the market for the first time?

        "content": "*^(Note: I didn't run any of this thru AI.)*\n\n**Here's my job and interview experience in 2025. 14yoe.** To not bloat the main thread, some topics will be in comments below.\n\nI was working at a fintech company and they did huge layoffs after acquiring 2 companies, nearly every engineer from our division was cut. it frikin sucks but it is what it is.\n\n350 applications ->  18 recruiter calls -> 12 tech screens -> 3 final rounds -> 1 offer;\n\ni applied to practically every single front end position in existence.\n\nSankey diagram here [https://i.imgur.com/pwHagNt.png](https://i.imgur.com/pwHagNt.png)\n\nTime elapsed: 3 months.\n\nI landed an incredible offer with Marvell Semiconductor as Staff UI Architect!\n\nThis position is unique- hybrid of Front End Engineering + UI/UX Design. I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n\\-TC: Years 1-4: 248k -> 276k -> 303k -> 330k (Includes estimate of guaranteed refreshers)\n\n\\-High level role with mostly design + telling other devs what to create, less coding\n\n\\-4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins. On call for overseas folks 8-10PM. + Occasional travel overseas to india.\n\n\\-highly rated on glassdoor, low layoffs compared to peers\n\n\\-incredibly smart EE folks with buncha guys PhD from MIT in Physics\n\n\\-I studied EE in college but pivoted to FE dev and now this is almost going back to my roots.\n\nInterview:\n\n\\-I didn't even expect a call back, the position seemed out of my league, but behold, i did. Told recruiter my background in FE dev, not a pro UIUX designer but i know the concepts and i work with them. Said he'll get back to me and the next week they want me for a GIGA HARDCORE FINAL ROUND with 6 directors/vps/staff engineers. \n\n6 1:1's PLUS a presentation to all 6.\n\nOh my god I’ve never got grilled on UX design this hard in my life. \n\nOne of the directors (PhD from MIT) asked me: Say aliens are invading earth. You need to design a control panel for a missile defense system that is user friendly to the operators. Button? Console; command line etc? What’s the design like, how about communication? How do u communicate to others, alarm system? Should there be a mute button? If the operator is in a hurry and needs split second decision how do u ensure the cleanest UI design? Security?\n\nAnother director (ex-AWS) asked: Say u have a data center with servers and switches that transmit data, but data can be failed / low quality / bad transmission, design a gui for this.\n\nVP asked me: Say there’s a bar graph. X axis is quality and Y is number of items. Title of graph is “amount of items of various qualities over the past 24 hours”. Now, we don’t like this presentation and instead want the X axis to be time. But we still want to show the data for quality/# , so we’re adding another data point. How do we display the graph now?\n\nStaff FE dev grilled me on js fundamentals such as closures and promises. I fumbled on a few questions but managed to get most, explaining thought process.\n\nCrazy interviews, hiring manager told me as a closing thought \"This position is challenging to fill\" and i had that thought RACING in my head 24/7. what could it mean? Did he like me and i'm a contender? Or did it mean \"this is a tough role to pass\"; i asked chatGPT and it said \"THIS IS A HUGE GREEN SIGNAL\" i was like lolwut really? ok then!\n\nWeek later recruiter emails me \"I wanted to connect with you regarding feedback and next steps\" im like NEXT STEPS?? GG? lets fkin goooooooooo. and boom offer.\n\nCraziest part is i couldn't prepare for these UI questions, came leftfield, i just winged it and somehow i had enough intuition to pass them. Recruiter told me many candidates were able to pass coding, but struggled/froze on the Design Mission Control System design question. I guess i have some semblance of talent in UI design?\n\n\\----\n\nSome FE coding questions I had this year:\n\n**Discord -** tech screen - failed\n\nCreate a UI for a formula parser that has fields a, b, c. You can type numbers in the field and the output of the fields would be those numbers, but you can also type letters in the fields and they would add up the numbers stored. For example in field A if you type 3 the output of field A is 3. \n\nThen if you type A in field B the output of B is 3. In field C if you type in AB you get 6 (3+3) the reqs were so ambiguous so it took me awhile to understand the problem. NO AI, write on own IDE with screenshare.\n\n**Crunchyroll** \\- tech screen - passed\n\nCreate a react app that renders a collection of anime titles and its image, from json data;\n\nfor(var i=0; i<5; i++) setTimeOut console.log(i) \"trick\" question whats the output and why?\n\n**Crunchyroll -** final coding round - failed\n\nPolyfill the \"getElementsByClassName\" function. Aced system design though, the interviewer was impressed.\n\n**Walmart -** tech screen - ghosted\n\nWrite a \"deepclone\" function that copies an object with variable depth and contains anything, including other objects, arrays etc.\n\n**Oracle -** tech screen - failed (passed question but they chose another candidate with more backend exp)\n\nCreate a react app that displays a credit card, with buttons to switch which cc to view, cc data comes from json. Clicking on cc will replace the text with X's- X's correspond to how many words there are, so FIRST LASTNAME will be XXXX XXXX.\n\n**Anduril -** tech screen - failed \n\nYou know in your IDE the directory structure, with folders and files? Given a pic/mock of that, Build it.\n\n**Amazon -** https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1iudddy/rainforest_loop_experience_frontend_l5_12_yoe/\n\n\\---\n\nClosing thought: It's rough out there for Front End devs. There are fewer positions than before, but way more AI/ML positions. However, FE dev compensation is still competitive, u just needa know so much.\n\nI'm not incredibly smart or talented, most other engineers are more brilliant than I. The biggest source of my success is the resilience to failure. The amount of rejections and failures is so high  but every time, i write down what went wrong, study it, and gain knowledge, so over time every failure builds up to more and more knowledge.",

        "content": "I am currently working within the embedded space and was fortunate to receive what I think are 2 great opportunities:\n\n* Qualcomm - working on low-level firmware for their SoC\n* Reality Labs (Meta) - working on firmware for their ray-bans\n\nI'm a bit torn between the based on several factors, and I was hoping to gain insight from people here. I currently have \\~4 YOE and am a US citizen (I know this helps when evaluating risk)\n\n1. **Work** \\- Both companies have what I think are interesting work. I put embedded-specific details here for those are interested, but they both feel equally cool - [Embedded Software vs Board Support Package : r/embedded](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1p44co2/embedded_software_vs_board_support_package/). Meta would be more high-level / specific product work while Qualcomm is a more general role where the work will touch many of their products across their portfolio. This makes me wonder if working on a niche application like AR glasses would be better/worse for long-term career development\n2. **Location** \\- Meta would have to be in Sunnyvale while Qualcomm is in San Diego. I currently live in SoCal so I would have a preference to stay here, but I can't deny that there seem to be more opportunities in NorCal. Nonetheless taking Meta would require moving / establishing things in a new location\n3. **Culture** \\- I've been hearing bad things about Meta / Reality Labs, but I'm not sure how true they are since I've been relying on anecdotes from Blind (which is admittedly a negative community). I'm sure Qualcomm has its own pitfalls (e.g. offshoring), but I haven't heard of anything to the severity of Meta's current reputation with stacked ranking and PIPs\n4. **Compensation** \\- Both roles are pretty accurate to their grades on levels.fyi. Qualcomm would be a senior engineer role in San Diego while Meta would be E4 role in Sunnyvale\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I know having the brand name of Meta on a resume does wonders for a career, but I want to make sure I have as complete of a picture as I can.\n\nEdit: since there was some interest in the comments:\n\n* Meta (Sunnyvale) - 193k + 100k RSU/year + 35k sign on\n* Qualcomm (San Diego) - 147k + 43k RSU/year + 35k sign on",

        "content": "So I’m trying to figure out when a salary increase actually justifies giving up a very comfortable setup. I officially have a 5-day/week job, but because my manager and I work remotely and are in different countries with different weekends, I’ve effectively been working 4 days a week for the last 1.5 years with a 3-day weekend. The work is simple, mostly Power BI dashboards and Power Automate flows for upper management, with nothing deeply technical or challenging. The problem is that the job is *too* comfortable. I’m not learning much, and I worry that future cost-cutting (I work in corporate) or AI could replace me since the work is so basic.\n\nBecause I essentially work 4 days (32 hrs/week), my hourly rate is higher than it would be in a typical 5-day (40 hrs/week) job. For example, if I took a job with a 50% salary increase for a 5-day schedule, it would end up being only about a 20% increase in hourly pay after adjusting for the extra day and hours I would work. \n\nSo I’m stuck asking myself if a 20–25% hourly increase really worth giving up a 4-day WFH lifestyle?\n\nI’m a CS graduate, but I ended up in this role because the job posting was labeled as Software Engineer. It turns out the only real engineering work was rewriting a legacy system using the Power Platform. After that, it turned into pure dashboards and Power Automate flows on the business side because my manager believed upper management liked fancy, colorful reports that were tangible and made their lives easier.\n\nBefore this job, I was studying AWS, Terraform Linux, and getting into Kubernetes, but I haven’t touched any of that in a year, and I feel like I’m falling behind. If I stay in comfort, I risk stagnating, but at the same time I don’t really know where I can go from here, or what percentage increase in salary or hourly rate is worth leaving this job. \n\nAlso, my company is a large corporate, and one of my goals is to work abroad. I checked their internal positions offering relocation, and almost all of them are either pure engineering or management roles. I don’t think it’s realistic for me to apply to any of these in my current position unless I sharpen my engineering skills, as management is still a pipe dream given that I’m still junior with only about 2 years of total experience.\n\n\nSo essentially my questions boil down to:\n\n1. What kind of pay increase would make you give up a 4-day WFH job? Is 20% hourly increase enough? That’s already roughly a 50% increase in total salary.\n\n2. Should I pivot to a technical path like cloud infra/DevOps, which I plan to study over the next 6 months, or is there a well-paid path using my current skills? Would transitioning to data engineering instead be a better? Is it realistic in that timeframe?",

This is my first time posting in a CS subreddit so please let me know if this is not the right place for this question.\n\nI've been thinking of switching into CS and finally decided to apply to schools with lots of Co-op opportunities. So far I've applied to bachelor's in UToronto (waiting), Waterloo (i may not meet eligibility requirements as a graduate), UBC (waiting; 20-month 2nd degree program) and UOttawa (got in).\n\n  \nI prefer getting another bachelors since the schools I've picked comes with a good (rigorous) curriculum and a very good selection of co-op options as well as decent hiring rates post-studies. I want a strong, guided foundation even though I've done a little bit of everything by myself out of curiosity and interest (C++ in university courses, Python in high school, JS, html, CSS, AI/ML, Data Science).\n\n  \nHowever my parents think it would be better to get a CS masters directly instead of \"wasting time\" doing another bachelors. The problem is well-reputed schools in Canada don't seem to offer masters without cs or related undergrad. The schools that do offer this option seems pointless to me because the market is already saturated and I feel like I would just be doing it for the sake of having just any CS related education. Plus they don't seem to offer any of the benefits that bachelors does (Co-op for eg).\n\n  \nClearly I'm biased towards doing a bachelors but I don't want to be close minded. I wanna know if I should consider masters as an actual option right away. My main focus is that my education shouldn't look like a drawback to potential employers, and there should be a better chance of employment. \n\n(Also I've read multiple times that strong portfolio and CS-based projects makes you a good candidate and that you don't need formal education but I honestly don't think I can be impressive enough pull that off. I'm willing to put in the work but I also need some structured learning before I can build my portfolio. Plus CS degree is a part of the mandatory requirements for a lot of job listings that I see so I don't want to be ineligible or automatically screened out for good opportunities)\n\nSo what should I do? CS Masters without Bachelors or CS bachelors.\n\n  \n**TLDR**; Are the chances of landing a job with a CS masters without CS bachelors the same as having a CS bachelors? I know landing a job in general would be hard but which offers me a better chance?",

I casually searched for around 5-6 months, really only applying to things that looked interesting, or any interesting recruiter reach out.\n\nMy Results:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png](https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png)\n\n\n\n*Note: these are a bit general numbers. This happened over a few months, so might be +/- one or two things I forgot about*\n\nIn general, I was pretty selective. I had a few dozen recruiter's message me, but only took 10 or so calls. Most were from in office startups that I had no interest in, or non tech companies which I wasn't really interested in.\n\nSome notes on my search\n\n\\- I make around 220k base at my current position, so any job needed to match that number (TC-wise anyway)  \n\\- I preferred remote, but for large public tech companies, was open to moving. But any startup needed to be remote (Unless something like OpenAI, etc, which of course didn't happen)  \n\\- Needed to be at least a tech forward company  \n\\- I only responded to first party recruiters  \n\\- I refuse to do take-home assessments  \n\\- I didn't do any interview prep for any of these, so my failure rate was a bit high\n\n\\--\n\nIn terms of general hiring vibes, I'd say the biggest difference was in the recruiter/HM screens, much more selective there, probably due to how easy it is to AI generate a reasonable looking resume now. I've pretty much never been rejected at that stage, but did end up getting rejected a couple times from HM's after the recruiter screens.\n\nLikewise, a few companies also wanted to do take home assessments before even going to the normal techs screens. I immediately dropped out from those (I hate take homes personally)\n\nOther than that, the general feeling was pretty similar from other times I've been on the market.",

        "content": "I've been pretty active on both sides of the hiring/interviewing gauntlet for the last few months, and just wanted to share the following thoughts on what I believe are some huge misconceptions around compensation (that candidates, recruiters, companies, and other have).\n\n1. Engineers are not commodities.  We are non-fungible and there are HUGE differences in the amount of value we can bring, even when you try to classify us into strata like junior, middle, senior, staff, etc.  Engineers are more like real estate.  There can be huge differences in pricing for a 1500 sqft abode, depending on factors like location, build, amenities, etc.\n2. Not every company can make the same use of a talented engineer.  Just because you are worth $500k at Citadel does not mean Walgreens can realistically get as much value out of you.\n\nThese 2 realities result in interesting dynamics, where one company may pay their junior engineers more than another company on the same street pays their principal engineers.  Both may be acting rationally.  It also results in some interesting dynamics where a junior engineer may thumb their nose at opportunities that may be a huge step up in title and responsibilities, and they are acting rationally too.\n\n3. The above should make you question the concept of \"market pay\".  It is not a meaningful measure.  However, if you want to use it, do not use job posting data to figure out \"market pay\".  A job posting is an \\*unfilled\\* role.  There are 2 good sources of \"market pay\".  1. Current pay of employed engineers in a similar role and setting. and 2. Recent offers that are accepted by engineers for a similar role and setting.  The latter is a better/more effective measure for evaluating a new role as a candidate / determining how to budget for a role you are trying to hire for.",

Hated my boss, hated just feeling like I wasn't doing any fulfilling, hated that someone said I was going to be a lifer.. Fast forward too 2018, I took the leap, after doing some code academy and attempting to teach myself the basics of code, I applied and was accepted to do a 12 week immersive web dev program in Boston (General Assembly). Right before going to this program, my girlfriend at the time was a dental hygienist, she was making small talk with a client and he mentioned he was a software engineer. She mentioned how i was going to be going to an immersive program in Boston, he gave her his number for me to contact him, i did, we met up for coffee and talked goals and web dev in general. Fast forward to the 10th week of my program, I get a call from that guy and he asked if I wanted interview. I interviewed it was your typical interview but I feel like they were pretty relaxed about it because they knew how green I was. I mean shit, i'm pretty sure the tech challenge they let me use my own personal project I developed through the program.. Anyways they hired me probably believing they could mold me into what they wanted, although there wasnt much molding, there was a lot of extremely late nights of me trying to figure things out because I knew absolutely NOTHING. Long story short there were grueling years of teaching myself a lot but also kind of only teaching myself stuff that would get me through a specific task. I feel like I never really took a step back and really dove into soft skills or design concepts or why you would use a certain pattern for certain scenarios..\n\nNow, 8 years later I'm still at my current company and over the past 3 my company as a whole does not feel secure. I've survived big layoffs, clients leaving, entire company not getting raises, etc. I have a family now, I own a house, and I need security.. I've had one job interview over the past year and I completely botched it. The technical interview I froze, it was plain javascript and I couldn't solve it.. I was so embarrassed and couldn't believe it. Now I feel like if it was nextjs and my companies codebase? I wouldn't have had any issues what so ever because i've been working here for so long and I feel like my knowledge of nextjs is very good but thats not going to cut it if I want a new job, which obviously I do with more security.. Just getting an interview almost seems impossible though, then I'm dreading the whole interview process because quite frankly I feel like my soft skills, tech terminology, and overall understanding of frontend development is lacking and I'm so used to my companies codebase I feel like im going to be a deer in headlights during an interview process.\n\nI just need some advice on how I should go about getting a new job, do I zoom out and go back to strengthening my soft skills of javascript, do I use some platforms like TheGreatFrontend? What are some concepts companies are absolutely looking for that I should either learn or freshen up on? Any advice would be helpful. Please try your best not to tear me apart, I'm a anxiety filled mess at the moment with the thought of losing my job, I have 2 month old baby, a house, and an income needed for us to live.",

I’ve been having a lot of trouble with different teams and the codebase, and I’m looking for an outside perspective on whether this is common or if I’m contributing to problem.\n\nSome background:\n\n-\tI have 3 YoE, mid level SWE, this is my first tech company. \n-\tThe company has this product with multiple teams working on different parts of it.\n-\tMy role requires me to work on the product in other team’s domain and set up integrations. \n-\tThe company has about 500 employees and is doing quite well. \n\nFrom the start, I was having a difficult time working with the team that maintains the core code of the product since the manager on that team can be pretty aggressive and difficult to work with (not just my experience, have heard from multiple people about this). The code isn’t that great either, hard to reason about, plenty of side effects, hard to test, and PR reviews tend to focus on superficial code styling vs catching issues and forward thinking (another opinion shared by others). From what I see, there isn’t a big initiative to fix or improve things but rather keep patching on top of it, and a lot of people dislike that team’s work as they have to use it and deal with the problems.\n\nThis has made it so that the features I have worked on have been quite messy and buggy, where I’m constantly at odds trying to do my work in the best way but constantly have to implement workarounds or just do more work outside of scope so it doesn’t completely break. I’m always waking up to messages to fix things or staying up late to debug (not just my work), there are features that have had the same bug for months that I haven’t been allowed to fix. I have started to slow down, constantly review my work, afraid that I’ll cause another issue and have to deal with 20 slack messages the next day. All of this has taken a toll on me where I’m regularly stressed and frustrated by what’s going on and what I’m doing.\n\nI used to be very excited but nowadays I’m quite drained by the experience, I don’t work on side projects anymore and have started to stop caring about what I work on. I understand that start ups have problems but I don’t mind usual start up problems, I’m used to working a lot and moving quickly. My manager is great and we talk often, he agrees that things are messed up and says I’m doing fine, but I certainly don’t feel that way. I’ve noticed that I have reverted back to a junior mindset of slowing down my pace, staying silent in meetings, and constantly checking in with my manager because I can’t trust the work I do to not fail, yet it still does.\n\nIs this a normal thing? I am very open to feedback and everyone I talk to says that I’m doing well and things are messy, but I seriously feel like I haven’t progressed in any way since I’ve started working here and have gotten worse.\n\nTL;DR: Mid-level SWE (3 YoE, first tech company) at a ~500-person startup, 8 months in. My work depends on a messy, hard-to-test codebase owned by a difficult manager, so my work ends up buggy, I’m constantly firefighting, and I’m losing confidence and motivation even though my own manager says I’m doing fine. Is this just normal chaos or am I the issue?",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Earlier today I posted about feeling discouraged because it seems like, no matter how much I improve, AI will eventually do everything better and faster. The latest Anthropic model announcement pushed me further in that direction, especially after seeing developers say they barely write code now and reading some pretty dramatic predictions about software engineering not existing in a few years from actual Anthropic developers (yes I realize they stand to gain a ton by having people believing this, but I don't know if I have the luxury to hand wave it away).\n\nI am having a hard time seeing a long-term future in this field, which might be influenced by the fact that I am not currently working in it. Still, if I truly believe there is no future for me in this industry, then I need to plan for that possibility. Right now I am thinking that if I do not land a software job by summer 2026, I will go back to school for another engineering discipline, most likely power or mining.\n\nUntil that point (maybe just so I can say that I tried, or because I want to feel less horrible about the student debt I accrued getting this degree), I'm gonna be grinding a ton, trying to land something. If that doesn't work out, then I'm likely gone for good from the industry at this time next year.\n\nI would appreciate any advice from people who have dealt with this kind of uncertainty or who have thoughts on whether setting a timeline like this makes sense. Obviously I cant sit around and hope for the best forever, especially when the clouds on the horizon look darker and darker.",

My total compensation is around 115k at 24 years old, and I currently am 8 months on the job. I have 3 years of experience, working in a university position as a data engineer before this role for 2 years.\n\nSo within the stack I'm using, it's mainly PL/SQL and T-SQL - which I guess is fine because that's what I'm using to access big data and work with our internal customers. I do ETL work and requests given by customers using SQL, and of course manage loads every month with on-call/production support.\n\nThe pay is great and I also live at home with my parents, so I am indeed getting comfortable. I'm not in any relationship and I don't really wish to be at all any time soon. The only thing I'm wondering though is how badly I'm hindering my career by staying here skills wise. The data engineering space seems like it is changing a lot, and our tech in our current team doesn't use any of the new tech that's in the current climate.\n\nWhen I first entered this team, I was hoping to use a more modern tech stack, it looks like thought it's a bit limited to just Oracle. I'm fine with the work and I am learning everyday so I'm not complaining about what I have currently. But I do want to progress my career a bit more with more skills. There isn't any Python, Airflow, Spark, AWS, Kafka or any other modern orchestration tools, a bit of a gap in what others would be using.\n\nI'm aware that this is a good position, but I do want to progress as a data engineer and become higher impact in the future for maybe a different company or even a startup.\n\n**If I stay here for too long, would that make me a bit unmarketable for more current positions with more modern stacks?**\n\n**Do I stay 1–2 years and risk locking myself into legacy SQL work, or move now while I’m still early?**\n\n**Is it smarter to grind this job for money or take a risk and pivot sooner?**\n\nIn terms of urgency, I was considering moving out to a different company within 6 to 8 months but just want some advice.\n\nI really want to move to a city as well and move out as well, but with this current position I'm just conflicted on what the move should be. Some have suggested to switch internally within the company, which I could consider. Others have suggested to start applying for other roles in other areas. I want to know some thoughts.\n\ntldr; current position is only Oracle. Worried that it isn't up to date to current climate. What do I do.",

My manager never addressed any particular issues with my performance when we met 1:1 a few months ago (we never had a 1:1 since), but I was still worried. For every task I’ve been given so far, there’s a point where I don’t know what to do after I try figuring out myself and have to ask for help. I have been asked to give ETAs fore and can my very loose estimations were always less than how long it actually took to finish tasks since I barely know what I’m doing. There had also been an instance where I messed up the deployment for some of my changes, and my teammates had to help me rollback. One of the tasks I had been working on were supposed to be finished before this past week, but I couldn’t since the changes were more involved than I initially realized because of differences in the service between non-prod and prod (whereas it worked in non-prod where I had been testing prior). Teammates also had to step in again for that. I’ll even try reading through docs our team has to try to get a better sense of things, just for things to still not click. I know I’m supposed to properly ramp myself up within 2 more months, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to. There was a new task I was working on today, and once again, I got stuck on it and don’t know what to do. I was really hoping to make some progress during the weekend so I can finish it ASAP, but…I guess that isn’t happening anymore.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I should probably cut my losses and focus more energy on getting a new position since people are saying that there’s another layoff in January, and I heard that my organization was going to be impacted. I don’t have any other ground of suspicion of getting laid off, but another intern I knew had gotten laid off during the first wave when he started a few months before me, and I’m one of the least experienced people on my team. Either that, or I’m guessing getting PIP’d. I was wondering if anyone happened to have any advice for what to do.",

Has the role name in the offer and everything, but was placed on the QA Automation team. At first, I did not know much, except that it's not liked, so I gave it a couple weeks, got some tasks, and I realized that I don't like this work at all, it isn't fufilling and I miss development work. I tell this information to my boss, about how the role is misleading and how I want to switch and be given tasks, and if it's possible to switch and they said it can happen, but it takes time and that someone did that after working in qa for a couple years. So, this isn't a good situation for me, I don't want to be stuck doing this work forever, then struggle later getting a dev job. Even hearing the word QA is becoming a trigger word for me, because there's that seperation between being qa and being a dev, and I am not considered a dev.  It sucks knowing that after 4 years of grinding CS work, and doing full-stack projects, that you spend your time running tests and trying to find bugs, but don't get to fix them. Since i only worked here 2-3 months now, should I include this in my resume when I am applying, or pretend it dosen't exist and just apply without it? Also has many people had this issue happen to them? I know it's not the end of the world, but it makes me anxious knowing each day longer I am here, the more I feel like I am settling and i can do better. So I decided to just bite the bullet and start back on applying, but I just want to know whats the best thing for me to do. Thanks for reading.",

I have a Associates degree in game programming from one college and will have a standard CS Bachelors with a certificate in game from another college. \n\nSo my questions for here is what is the interview processes like for these places?\n\nDo they do the standard leet code/coding assignments/oral tests or is it more portfolio based?\n\nShould I look for standard CS work while also looking for game work or just focus on one?\n\nHow would my portfolio look to standard CS jobs? Would they like the passion or shy away because of its focus in games?\n\nI have a couple projects I have worked on through school and outside of school that I have in my current portfolio that I hope would make me stand out as a new grad in the field.

Thing is, while doing this, I focused more on hands on knowledge that will help me find a job, not fundamentals. I started with Harward's CS50 course for some basics, then learned Java and Spring, basics of SQL and Git, and then a bit of data structures and algorithms. After about 8-9 months, I landed a job and started working.\n\nCurrently, I am feeling that I missed a lot of fundamental topics and I would like to cover the blank spots before I can further improve. I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.\n\nI feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.\n\nHence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.\n\nThanks for reading and your help.",

We have one product manager, few Ops, one qa. That's it. It's a very, very small team size. \n\nThere aren't many (some were) complicated technical challenges in my job. No deadlines. No junior engineers to mentor. Heck I don't even have a technical lead or an engineering director or anybody. \n\nI recently started looking for a staff/senior roles and found out that Im having difficulty answering behavioral questions like \"What was the most difficult issue you faced and how you tackled it\" or \"Was there a time when you disagreed with your manager and if yes, how did you resolve it?\", etc. I cant answer those questions because I haven't encountered them. I don't have much difficulties with Leetcode like questions or design  systems rounds. \n\nBut given small team size with no leadership to lookup to, how should I answer behavioral round questions?",

I watched the first two courses, but then I dropped it because I kept hearing people say the tech field is overcrowded and that learning to code isn’t worth it anymore.\n\nNow I’m a bit older, and I still like tech. I feel like if I put in the effort, I could actually get somewhere. But I’m also scared that after spending years learning and working on myself, it might not matter because so many people already know how to code and still struggle to find opportunities.\n\nSo I’m stuck between continuing with tech or looking for something else.

I accepted it and I was excited, but this semester has been rough. I have an 11 month old (fyi they know this) and I also had to cram alot of hours in this semester because some weren’t available in the previous summer. I’m pretty much going to fail my Statistics class. I was so focused on my other CS classes and Statistics has always been hard for me to wrap my head around, so it was unintentionally put last with my attention. I always thought I could improve it, but even with a final exam coming up, I don’t think it’ll drastically improve my grade. \n\nI’m afraid my offer will be rescinded because of this and I’ve already set a start date weeks ago, as well as searched for an apartment and notifying my current apartment to break lease. What should I do? Do you think I could lose my internship as well? And how should I tell them this information as well as my family?",
