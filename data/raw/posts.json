        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I work with datasets that are not huge (GBs to low TBs), but the pipeline still needs to be reliable. I used to overbuild: Kafka, Spark, 12 moving parts, and then spend my life debugging glue. Now I follow a boring checklist to decide what to use and what to skip.\n\nIf you’re building a pipeline and you’re not sure if you need all the distributed toys, here’s the decision framework I wish I had earlier.\n\n1. Start with the SLA, not the tech\n\nAsk:\n\n* How fresh does the data need to be (minutes, hours, daily)?\n\n* What’s the cost of being late/wrong?\n\n* Who is the consumer (dashboards, ML training, finance reporting)?\n\n\nIf it’s daily reporting, you probably don’t need streaming anything.\n\n2. Prefer one “source of truth” storage layer\n\nPick one place where curated data lives and is readable by everything:\n\n* warehouse/lakehouse/object storage, whatever you have Then make everything downstream read from that, not from each other.\n\n\n3. Batch first, streaming only when it pays rent\n\nStreaming has a permanent complexity tax:\n\n* ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills. If your business doesn’t care about real-time, don’t buy that tax.\n\n4. Idempotency is the difference between reliable and haunted\n\nEvery job should be safe to rerun.\n\n* partitioned outputs\n\n* overwrite-by-partition or merge strategy\n\n* deterministic keys If you can’t rerun without fear, you don’t have a pipeline, you have a ritual.\n\n5. Backfills are the real workload\n\nDesign the pipeline so backfilling a week/month is normal:\n\n* parameterized date ranges\n\n* clear versioning of transforms\n\n* separate “raw” vs “modeled” layers\n\n6. Observability: do the minimum that prevents silent failure\n\nAt least:\n\n* row counts or volume checks\n\n* freshness checks\n\n* schema drift alerts\n\n* job duration tracking You don’t need perfect observability, you need “it broke and I noticed.”\n\n7. Don’t treat orchestration as optional\nEven for small pipelines, a scheduler/orchestrator avoids “cron spaghetti.” Airflow/Dagster/Prefect/etc. is fine, but the point is:\n\n* retries\n\n* dependencies\n\n* visibility\n\n* parameterized runs\n\n8. Optimize last\n\nMost pipelines are slow because of bad joins, bad file layout, or moving too much data, not because you didn’t use Spark. Fix the basics first:\n\n* partitioning\n\n* columnar formats\n\n* pushing filters down\n\n* avoiding accidental cartesian joins\n\nMy rule of thumb\n\nIf you can meet your SLA with:\n\n* a scheduler\n\n* Python/SQL transforms\n\n* object storage/warehouse and a couple checks\nthen adding a distributed stack is usually just extra failure modes.\n\nCurious what other people use as their “don’t overbuild” guardrails. What’s your personal line where you say “ok, now we actually need streaming/Spark/Kafka”?",

        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\n  \nFeeling a bit demoralized today and wondering if anyone else has come to a similar realization and how they dealt with it. Approximately 6 months ago I left a Sr. DE job on a team of 5 to join a startup as their sole data engineer. \n\n  \nThe last job I was at for 4.5 years and helped them create reliable pipelines for \\~15 sources and build out a full QC process that all DEs followed, created code standards + CI/CD that linted our code and also handled most of the infrastructure for our pipelines. During this time I was promoted multiple times and always had positive feedback.\n\n  \nCut to my current job where I have been told that I am not providing enough detail in my updates and that I am not specific enough about what went wrong when fixing bugs or encountering technical challenges. And - the real crux of the issue - I failed to deliver on a project after 6 months and they have of course wanted to discuss why the project failed. For context the project was to create a real time analytics pipeline that would update client reporting tables. I spent a lot of time on the infrastructure to capture the changes and started running into major challenges when trying to reliably consume the data and backfill data.\n\nWe talked through all of the challenges that I encountered and they said that the main theme of the project they picked up on was that I wasn't really \"engineering\" in that they felt I was just picking an approach and then discovering the challenges later.\n\n  \nCircling back to why I feel like maybe I'm just a mid-level engineer, in every other role I've been in I've always had someone more senior than me that understood the role. I'm wondering if I'm not actually senior material and can't actually do this role solo. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my ramble and let me know if you've found yourself in a similar position.  ",

We are experimenting with a builder instead of rolling everything from scratch, partly to avoid becoming a full-time CRUD developer.\n\nUI Bakery is one of the tools we are trying at the moment because it can sit on-prem, talk to our DB and some OpenAPI-described services, and still give non-technical users a UI with roles/permissions. Too early to call it perfect, but it feels less scary than handing out SQL editors.\n\nCurious what the rest of you are doing:\n\n* Do you let business users touch warehouse data at all, or is everything ticket-driven?\n* If you built a portal / upload tool / internal UI, did you go custom code or something like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery / similar?\n* Any “we thought this would be fine, then someone updated 50k rows by mistake” stories you are willing to share?\n\nTrying to find a balance between safety, governance and not spending my whole week building yet another admin panel.",

Did relevant projects, learned a lot, but no luck. I was comfortable working with python, docker, a few frameworks like Airflow, Spark, Dagster, DBT etc. and of course git and Java + a few tools that nobody uses in DE from the job that I was doing.\n\nDid about 100 applications, spending a fair bit of time tweaking applications to match every job that I applied to. Did not apply for stuff that I wasn't interested in. Got pretty much nothing.\n\nI did however also applied to a few software dev roles too. Ended up landing one and got incredibly lowballed but I was so tired of my previous job, I had to take it like an idiot.\n\nWell, started the new job and the work was pretty fun. But colour me surprised, the thing that pushed me out from the previous job wasn't the culture or the work just being boring, it was the cycle. I'm only 26 and honestly, I can't imagine working 9-5 until I turn 50 or 60. \n\nI'm drafting up some ideas, learning and researching what's required to create products on my own. Once I'm confident enough in an idea and the progress, I'll probably quit. Or get fired because I'm distracted. Staying for a few for months because of financial constraints.\n\nAnybody else have similar experiences? I find it so weird that I was so interested in DE just a year ago, still confident that I can perform well in it, but completely lost interest to put in the effort because in the end I know I'll just get paid peanuts for the actual amount of work I'll do (pay in my country is garbage). \n\nThe only thing that might change this would be life changing compensation, but obviously that requires much more prep that I don't know if I have the time for (or the ability for that matter). Even that wouldn't be a sustainable way out of this dumb rotten week cycle we humans invented for ourselves. Work like a mchine for 5 days and be tired for the rest of the day after work? Recover from that shit for 2 days and then get back to it again? Fuck. That.\n\nThanks for listening to my rant, please share your own thoughts, because obviously there's lots of people who enjoy what they do and have much more \"work endurance\" than me. Also curious to see if there's more people who feel the same way as me too.",

Engineers are arguing that they are already on AWS and Redshift natively integrates with VPC, IAM roles, etc. And with reserved instances, cost of ownership looks cheaper than showflake.\n\nAnalysts are not cool with it however. They complain about distribution keys and the trouble with parsing of json logs. They are struggling with Redshift's SUPER data type. They claim it’s \"weak for aggregations\" and requires awkward casting hacks. They want snowflake because it works no frills (especially VARIANT and dot notation) and they can query semi structured data.\n\nThe big argument is that savings on Redshift RIs will be eaten up by the salary cost of engineers having to constantly tune WLM queues and fix skew.\n\nWhat needs to be picked here? What will make both teams happy?",

The proposal is to migrate our dbt models from PostgreSQL to BigQuery in order to take advantage of BigQuery’s OLAP capabilities for analytical workloads. However, since I am quite fond of PostgreSQL, and value having a stable, open-source database as our data warehouse, I am wondering whether there are extensions or architectural approaches that could extend PostgreSQL’s behavior from a primarily OLTP system to one better suited for OLAP workloads.\n\nSo far, I have the impression that this might be achievable using DuckDB. One option would be to add the DuckDB extension to PostgreSQL; another would be to use DuckDB as an analytical engine interfacing with PostgreSQL, keeping PostgreSQL as the primary database while layering DuckDB on top for OLAP queries. However, I am unsure whether this solution is mature and stable enough for production use, and whether such an approach is truly recommended or widely adopted in practice.",

        "author": "Defiant_Month_497",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Just wanted to share my experience with Snowflake Openflow.\n\n  \nThe client i work for relies heavily on CDC replication for their data ingestion to snowflake. We mainly bring in data from SQL server and oracle database to our snowflake data lake.\n\nOur client is using many different ETL tools mainly Firvetran's HVR, IICS and AWS DMS and in some cases snowpipe when they want to ingest data from s3 to snowflake.\n\n  \nWhen snowflake announced openflow which supports CDC replication we were excited. Out of the box it was supporting SQL Server CDC replication and Oracle connector was soon to be released. We were very excited as our client wanted to move away from IICS and HVR due to licensing costs.\n\n  \nWe immediately started working on a POC when the openflow was available in private preview.\n\nPOC Area: - CDC based replication from SQL Server to snowflake.\n\n  \nIts fairly very easy to setup the connectors and start using it. We were able to configure the connectors and start ingesting the data within couple of hours and mind you none of us had used apache nifi before.\n\n  \nPros: - \n\n1. easy to setup and use.\n\n2. Replication latency is pretty low. Plus it can be configured as well to fit your use case.\n\n  \nCons: - \n\n1. Cannot configure target snowflake schema : - biggest downside we have found out yet. We were using the default workflow for SQL server CDC and there is no option to ingest the data into desired snowflake schema. By default Openflow is creating a schema in snowflake database with the source SQL Server schema name. We were pulling the data from SQL server schema \"DBO\" and Openflow was creating the same schema inside our snowflake database.\n\nWe updated almost all the processors inside the workflow to use the custom schema name, for most part it worked. we were able to create tables and journal tables etc inside our custom schema in snowflake. But there is one processor which merges journal tables to permanent table which was not supporting to use custom schema name. Somehow it was still using \"<DB\\_NAME>.DBO\". DB name is configurable in this processor but not the schema name.\n\n  \nWe connected with the snowflake internal team regarding the same and the guy said they working on it after receiving complaints from lots of other clients. \n\nLater he suggested us to not configure/updated the workflow which comes with database connectors. If we do update it, it's gonna be considered as a custom workflow and it will be locked out of future updates.\n\nSo, customizing the pipeline is out of the picture.\n\n2. Environment variables and JVM variables: - there is no one stop UI to manage all these variables inside the workflow. You need to navigate to each processor to manage these variables. \n\n  \n3. Error logs: - not a fan of how openflow manages error logs, its very janky to navigate  and use.\n\n  \nthese were the stuff we found out in the last couple of weeks. We have stopped our POC midway due to con 1. And we and the client are totally dissappointed with how openflow is working as of now.\n\n",

        "content": "I’ve written about my job on this sub before but I really am at a loss at times and come here to vent frequently. I am fine with hearing it’s a me problem, I really am. But I don’t know how to work faster when everything feels so chaotic upstream of me. I am not eating well, working 8+ hours and finding myself really sleepy (taking 2 naps a day these days) that are signs of burnout I’ve been experiencing especially over the last few months. \n\nI’ve been given feedback about not being as fast as the team anticipates on projects. Currently, I’ve been focusing on migrating old projects to a new architecture we plan to use by early next year. I really started being 100% dedicated to this work as of October/November of this year, which gives me 2-3 months to migrate my old projects to this new architecture. \n\nIn theory it sounds easy to my higher up: all I have to do is copy + paste and tweak my old code to new architecture and that’s it. Except it’s not that easy:\n\n1. In current architecture, I built several views that depend on each other. When deploying on this architecture, nobody made me aware (bc nobody seems to know) that changing things in upstream views causes deployment failures until I started working on this and my only workaround is to delete downstream views -> push -> confirm deployment successful -> make changes to upstream views-> push -> confirm deployment -> bring back deleted views -> push -> confirm deployment. This has caused a lot of delays and plenty failures that made me have to go to SWE team to fix that sometimes took the whole day to resolve \n\n2. Naming conventions and the way the data is stored have changed in new architecture with no documentation about this, leaving me to figure out using “eyeball” technique to see where new data is stored and changing my code accordingly \n\n3. Data in old architecture is not always coming through new architecture and I have to just figure this out by checking discrepancies and opening tickets for missing data that doesn’t get resolved no matter how much I ping people to look into it or fix it (I also don’t blame them because I feel other people are inundated too)\n\n4. Validation is a nightmare, I’ll have 30+ discrepancies and after checking code and data is there, I have to go through these records one by one to see why it’s not there by comparing tables. It turns out that some records are not meant to be in the new architecture, which I was not told until later when I did validation and had to compare what info from our schema tables was missing between the two. I have to look for specific clues between the old and new dataset for indication whether something is valid or not so I can document there is a reason for discrepancy  \n\n5. Documenting all of this and more is a task of its own \n\n6. Ongoing enhancements are expected to be added to some projects \n\nI have one project that is comprised of 10 SQL views. The expectation was this would take 2 weeks but it took me a month: 1. creating the views and aligning them to new data model 2. dealing with random/unanticipated failures because of how these views are connected that I can only ask the SWE team to because they can tell me what things in my code that used to be compatible with this new architecture aren’t anymore 3. Validating data and having discrepancies no matter how many times I’ve fixed any errors because some things are “discrepancy by nature” of this new model which I either document and write an explanation of why it’s valid or a something I have to open a ticket for 4. The new way we’re modelling data sometimes doesn’t work for existing projects and I have to add more lines of code to work around that \n\nThis is not new of the culture of my team. They give me several projects at a time thinking it will take 2 weeks. It takes longer for me and I have been told I have a consistent issue with slowness that makes me feel it’s a me issue. I explain to management my process, I started documenting all issues way more, but nobody gives me constructive advice on what I can do differently to work “faster” and it makes me feel like a failure. \n\nOne of the advices I was given was “ask for help” but whenever I do, nobody is able to help. When there were holidays, I asked overseas employees to help me investigate a discrepancy an came back to see nobody was able to do it no matter how many people I pinged and explained the issue in detail. \n\nAs a side note, some of the code I’m migrating now was a nightmare to develop in the first place - it was projects I inherited with no documentation, no idea what the project outcome should look like or what “acceptance criteria” deems the project complete or not. The code was 1000 lines and took several minutes to run with poor performance issues. Like a million full joins, sub queries within subqueries. I was once asked to add something to a where clause in this query and unknowingly broke something that I didn’t realize was a break bc I have no idea what the end result is supposed to look like. I was told to reverse it immediately and asked the SWE team who told me we can’t simply reverse our daily pipeline. The colleague who asked me to made the change became furious and this is where negative feedback about me started. I later worked hard to re-develop this whole project, breaking down the code into separate parts in order to join these separate views together at the end to make cleaner, optimized code. The team did like that work, but even then, issues would arise - upstream pipeline would fail, I have to interrupt my 10 projects to manually get a dataset, upload it through our transformation tool, export and manually put back into S3 that takes 30+ minutes. Later, it turns out that simple joins to create the end table aren’t enough per requirements because of unanticipated quirks with the data that requires a full join and 2 additional CTEs to get right. \n\nBasically, I’m just really tired. The business requirements are really ambiguous and a work in progress, our data is in different constantly changing formats and we have failures or changes of me upstream of I have to keep track of while working through other projects and stop everything to fix it. Of note, most of my team members are not strong technically but do have domain knowledge, yet I feel domain knowledge is not enough because the way we do things technically feels very poor as well. Sorry to make everybody read all this, I don’t have any other friends who work in data who I can vent to about this. ",

We handle healthcare data so first of all, we want to keep everything on prem, so it limits some of our options right off the bat.\n\nCurrently, we are using a Makefile to call a massive list of SQL files and run them with psql. Dependencies are maintained by hand.\n\nI've just started seeing what it might take to move to DBT to handle the build, and while it looks very promising, the initial tests are still creating some hassles. We have a LOT large datasets. So DBT has been struggling to run some of the seeds because it seems to get memory intensive and it looks like maybe psql was the better option for atleast those portions. I am also still struggling a bit with the naming conventions for selectors vs schema/table names vs folder/file names. We have a number of schemas that handle data identically across different applications, so table names that match seem to be an issue, even if they're in different schemas. I am also having a hard time with the premise that seeds are 1 to 1 for the csv to table. We have for example a LOT of historical data that has changed systems over time, but we don't want to lose that historic data, so we've used psql copy in the past to solve this issue very easily. This looks against the dbt rules.\n\nSo this has me wanting to ask, are there better tools out there that I should be looking at? My goal is to consolidate services so that managing our containers doesn't become a full time gig in and of itself.\n\n  \nPart of the goal of modernization is to attach a semantic layer, which psql alone doesn't facilitate. Unit testing across the data in an easier to run and monitor environment, field level lineage, and even eventually pointing things like langchain are some of our goals. The fact is, our process is extremely old and dated, and modernizing will simply give us better options. What is your advice? I fully recognize I may not know DBT enough yet and all my problems are very solveable.

My role doesn't have much opportunity for me to get experience on the job without switching teams, but that would require uprooting my family's life and moving to another city due to RTO.\n\nI'm planning to spend time over the next few months outside of work building projects with AWS, Snowflake, Airflow and other modern tools, so I can speak more to it during interviews.

Our data mainly lives in product DBs (Postgres), BigQuery, and our CRM (SFDC). We want agents for lightweight automation and reporting. \n\nCurrent approach:  \nInstead of giving agents any kind of direct warehouse access, we’re planning to run them against an isolated sandboxed environment with pre-joined, pre-sanitized views pulled from our DW and other sources. Agents never see the warehouse directly.\n\nOn top of those sandboxed views (not direct DW tables), we’d build and expose custom MCP tools. Each of these MCP tools will have a broader sql query- with required parameters and a real-time policy layer between views and these tools- enforcing row/column limits, query rules, and guardrails (rate limits, max scan size, etc.).\n\nThe goal is to minimize blast radius if/when an LLM does something dumb: no lateral access, no schema exploration, no accidental PII leakage, and predictable cost.\n\nDoes this approach feel sane? Are there obvious attack vectors or failure modes we’re underestimating with LLMs querying structured data? Curious how others are thinking about isolation vs. flexibility when agents touch real customer data.\n\nWould love feedback - especially from teams already running agents against internal databases.",

Our downstream SQL streaming table (CREATE STREAMING TABLE ...) immediately failed because we can't pass skipChangeCommits.\n\nQuestion: Is there any hidden SQL syntax to ignore deletes, or is switching to Python the only way to avoid a full refresh here?\n\nAuto Loader Partition Inference: After a partial pipeline refresh (clearing one table's state), Auto Loader failed to resolve Hive-style partitions (/dt=.../) that it previously inferred fine. It only worked after we explicitly added partitionColumns.\n\nQuestion: Is implicit partition inference generally considered unsafe for Prod DLT pipelines? It feels like the checkpoint reset caused it to lose context of the directory structure",

        "author": "Data-Panda",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Working on one of my first bigger data projects as a junior and I’m a bit stuck.\n\nThe source system stores timestamps in CST (no DST); the target tables must be UTC.\n\nI extract data using a rolling 7–14 day window, filtered by a business date (midnight-to-midnight in CST) as these are essentially log tables. This is necessary because there’s no last-modified field in the source tables and yet records can be updated up to 7–14 days after creation.\n\nThe target tables are partitioned by the business date, and I overwrite partitions on each run. This works in theory when extracting full days, but timezone conversion complicates things. When converting CST to UTC, some records shift into the next day, meaning a “full day” CST extract can become partial days in UTC, potentially overwriting partitions with incomplete data.\n\nI’m avoiding MERGE because there’s no reliable primary key and analysts want to keep duplicates (some are valid), so partition overwrites seem like the best option. Essentially I just want to clone the source tables into BigQuery.\n\nOne idea is to extract data as UTC midnight-to-midnight, but the only apparent option in the source is extracting as GMT Monrovia (which I think maps to UTC). This is what I’m edging towards, but not sure if extracting data in a different timezone to what it’s natively stored as is a recommended approach?\n\nCan someone please sanity check my approach and let me know if it’s a bad idea, or if I’m missing anything?",

Whereas with S3 tables, you use a native AWS catalog, and maintenance is automatically handled. When would someone choose one over the other? \n\nIs there anything fundamentally wrong with the self-managed route? My plan was to ingest data using SQS+ Glue Catalog + PyIceberg + PyArrow in ECS tasks, and handle maintenance through scheduled Athena-based compaction jobs.\n\n\n",

It's basically a local app delivered via the web.

My package is basically a wrapper around PyIceberg, but with a much handier API  it auto-converts that messy JSON you often get from APIs (like dicts/lists) into proper Iceberg structures. Plus, it handles big datasets without hogging memory.\n\nIt's still in beta, I'm testing it out, but overall it's running reliably. Yeah, I built it with LLM help would've taken me half a year otherwise. But linters, tests, and checks are all there.\n\nIt also plays nice natively with PyArrow data. Right now, I'm prepping a test repo with examples using Dagster + ConnectorX + iceberg-loader. Should end up as a fast open-source data loader since everything runs on Arrow.\n\nWould love if any devs take a look with their experienced eye and suggest improvements or feedback.\n\nhttps://github.com/vndvtech/iceberg-loader",

As a Data Engineer, I'm tasked with revamping this setup to create a more efficient and scalable architecture, following best practices.\n\nI'm considering moving to Snowflake for analysis and BI reporting. But I’m unsure about the OLTP (transactional) side of things. Should I stick with RDS MySQL for handling transactional workloads, like upserting data from APIs, while using Snowflake for BI and analysis? Currently, we're being billed around $550/month for RDS MySQL, and I want to know if switching to Snowflake will help reduce costs and overcome bottlenecks like slow queries and concurrency issues.\n\nAlternatively, I’ve been thinking about using Lambda functions to move data to S3 and then pull it into Snowflake for analysis and Power BI reports. But I’m open to hearing if there’s a better approach to handle this.\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be really appreciated!",

        "content": "Context:\n\nWe have an old MSSQL Server on prem + Alteryx for orchestration/transformations + Tableau server for visualizations. Our data \"team\" is basically just me, plus my manager and coworker - both of whom are mostly comfortable just with data visualization in Tableau. Our data comes in from various vendors (20+) in the form of flat files in SFTPs or API endpoints. Nothing overly crazy, no streaming, no more than 1-2 GB over the course of a day.\n\nWhile Alteryx has been \"good enough\" the last 10 years, their rapidly rising costs has led us to research various options at how we can modernize our data stack and keep costs low. My manager has given me free reign to research various options and come up with a plan that we can execute over 2026, just with the understanding that our company has a footprint in Azure, so I shouldn't branch out to AWS or GCP for example.\n\nProposal:\n\n+ Azure Blob Storage to ingest and store all our vendors' files and data on a daily/hourly basis\n+ Dagster+ (hybrid) for orchestration\n+ Deltalake tables created/updated in blob storage for staging, warehouse, and marts layers using delta-rs and polars for transformations\n+ For serving to BI tools, use external tables in a Databricks SQL warehouse pointed to delta tables\n+ Keep Tableau as is, reduce our need for Alteryx over time to just last mile transformations/adhoc analysis for my other team members\n\nOther considerations:\n\n+ DBT: I did some of their courses and tried to recreate an existing pipeline using dbt-core orchestrated by Dagster and it seemed overkill for my purposes. Everything I liked in it was already covered by Dagster, such as data lineage, testing, and the features that might be nice require cloud. I'm also more comfortable writing transformations in Python rather than SQL.\n\n+ Table maintenance: I'm aware that external tables are not managed by DBX and it's on me to manage the tables manually (optimize/vacuum). I figure I can set up a script that runs once a month or something to automatically do it.\n+ Why delta-rs? Again, we don't have overly complex data needs or sizes that require Spark computing costs. Our machines are perfectly capable of handling the compute requirements that we need. If we get to ML models down the road, then I'd probably run those in DBX notebooks and rely on their computing power.\n\nHas anyone else ran a similar design before? Any pitfalls or limitations to be aware of?",

At the moment, I have a headless API server and the code to handle PostgreSQL and S3 or MinIO data lakes with plans to support the other major databases and data lakes, but before I continue, I wanted community feedback on whether you’d find this useful.\n\nThe project goal was to make a version of Git that could be used for data so that we data engineers wouldn’t have to learn a completely new terminology. It uses the same CLI for the most part, with init, add, commit, push, etc. The versioning control is operations-based instead of record- or table-based, so it simplifies a lot of the branch operations. I’ve included a dedicated ingestion branch so it can work with a live database where data is constantly ingested via some external process. \n\nI realize there are some products available that do something moderately similar, but they all either require learning a completely new syntax or are extremely limited in capability and speed. This allows you to directly branch on server from an existing database with approximately 10% overhead. The local client is written in Rust with PyO3 bindings to interact with the headless FastAPI server backend when deployed for an organization. \n\nEventually, I want to distribute this to engineers and orgs, but this post is primarily to gauge interest and feasibility from my fellow engineers. Ask whatever questions come to mind, bash it as much as you want, tell me whatever comes to mind. I have benefited a ton from my fellow data and software engineers throughout my career, so this is one of the ways I want to give back. ",

        "content": "Program a drone using a simple python-like language to fully automate various farming tasks that would otherwise be very grindy. Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing \"execute\" and watching your drone do all the hard work.\n\nUnlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.\n\nFarming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.\n\nProgramming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.\n\nWhile it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.\n\nIf you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.\n\nAlthough the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the \"File Watcher\" setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.\n\nHope you like the coding game concept! :)\n\nYou can find it here:   \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The\\_Farmer\\_Was\\_Replaced/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160?utm_source=RD)",

Code isn't the hard part. On this topic, here is my\n\n<rant>\n\nI reply that we programmers use languages as tools. We use those tools to create programs. We test those programs. We package those programs. We sell those packages, or publish them as open source, or deliver them to an employer, or whatever. We get bug reports from users. We fix (some of) those bugs. We repackage and republish.   \n\nCode is only part of the trade of programming. \n\nProfessional programmers understand what our users need. We have clear vision for what a finished software package is and does and looks like. We get our work tested, packaged, and across the finish line. \n\nAlong the way we write some code.  The thing is, if we can do the other things well, the code is (usually) pretty easy, comparatively. \n\nAt the same time, pure code isn't finished and doesn't have any users. That gets very boring very fast.\n\nWanna see some examples of software packages of a scale that one person -- you -- can make and publish and try to attract live people as users?\n\n* These are Javascript utility packages. https://www.npmleaderboard.org/\n* These are plugins for WordPress:  https://wordpress.org/plugins/\n* ...for Python.  https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Artistic+Software \n* Indie games. https://itch.io/\n\nThere are other lists and repositories of packages out there for the searching. \n\nLaying down lines of code is just a part of our trade. The programmers of many of those packages did the whole job: explanation, instructions, code, testing, packaging, publishing, and then bug fixing.  Read through some of the package descriptions; they'll give you a feel for what a piece of finished software looks like.\n\nDon't be too intimidated by the packages that turn up on the first page of these lists. The best of them have been around for many years, and have been through a lot of changes to perfect them. \n\nBut those packages started somewhere. Yours can too.\n\n</rant>\n\nMake good software and stay in touch.\n",

People who don't program won't know the difference, and experienced programmers genuinely won't give a shit (and might in fact think your code is inferior, since it's less readable now).\n\nBut most importantly, memorizing lots of tricks won't make you a good programmer. You know what makes you a good programmer? Understanding fundamentals and learning creative problem solving, that's what you really need.\n\nPlease, for the love of God, stop following pop-coding \"coaches\".

I think it could be fun to take someone who knows almost no JavaScript and try to teach them the language. \n\nI'd be interested in helping people debug problems they're stuck on.\n\nI'm interested in this again because I'm worried that AI may be causing that programming muscle in my brain to atrophy a bit and I want to make sure I can still remember the basics that I've taken for granted for so long. \n\nI'm not a good teacher, as in I don't have lesson plans, and teaching isn't a strong suit of mine, but I am passionate and I have a lot of experience. \n\nI'm just trying to feel out the appetite for putting together an informal workshop that can be live streamed and establishing some new relationships in the process. I'd be open to project ideas. Maybe we can bootstrap a full-stack app and deploy it to Vercel together, I don't know exactly, I'm open to suggestions.\n\nI do have a discord group that I started a few years back when I last made a reddit post similar to this and the group grew extremely fast. There are only about 5 people still active in it but they're all great people and love helping new developers too. I don't know if it is a violation to share the discord group in a post but if you're interested you can DM me and I can share it. \n\nTO BE CLEAR- nothing here is monetized and there is no plan to ever monetize any of this. Not YouTube, not discord, not mentorship, I make a solid living doing work that I love. This is to keep me sharp and to try to chase the good feeling of knowing I've helped people to develop the superpower of programming. \n\nI also have a few (soon to be) open source projects I've been casually working on. If anyone is interested in learning to contribute to open source, maybe we could find a way to do that with one of those projects. I'm just spitballing here. I'm open to any ideas but I want to kick of 2026 putting some positive energy out into the community",

I’m currently working as a working student at a software company, and most of my day-to-day work is focused on implementing features and writing code. While this is valuable experience, I don’t really get the opportunity to deeply learn or reflect on the underlying concepts and mechanics of the web. The problem I see here is that there are things I dont even know about and I would I need a good overview about the things that they even exist, like a book for example. Of course, I could just google individual topics, but the problem is that I don’t always know *what* I should even be googling. That’s why a well-structured roadmap, book, or resource where the relevant information is collected and explained in a coherent way would be extremely helpful.\n\nBecause of that, I want to be very clear: I’m **not** looking for tutorials on JavaScript, CSS, HTML syntax, or how to use frameworks like React, Vue, etc. I already work with those technologies on a daily basis.\n\nWhat I’m interested in are topics like:\n\n* Authentication & authorization (sessions, tokens, OAuth, etc.)\n* Cookies, storage, and state management\n* Caching strategies (browser, CDN, server-side)\n* HTTP fundamentals and request/response lifecycle\n* Security concepts (CORS, CSP, CSRF, XSS, same-origin policy)\n* How browsers and servers actually interact\n* General web architecture and system design concepts\n\nI want to better understand *why* things work the way they do, not just *how* to implement them in a specific stack.\n\nIf you know any resources that explain these concepts well (beginner-friendly but not superficial is ideal), I’d really appreciate your recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I've been using freeCodeCamp since 2023 and I loved its structure: learn a concept -> guided project -> unguided project. That format works great for me and I learned a lot of stuff that I still remember.\n\nThe big problem is: FCC removed its video content. Staying focused on long lectures is a huge problem for me, because of that I can't learn on freeCodeCamp anymore.\n\nSo now I’m looking at alternatives:\n\n* Scrimba: seems interactive and video-based, which I need, but from what I've understood there are no projects where you actually get to write *everything* on your own and it's really shallow in terms of libraries and general depth\n* The Odin Project: To me personally it seems impossible to learn here, because there's lots and lots of text which is just a big no-no for my small clip thinking brain (thank you, tiktok).\n* freeCodeCamp: still amazing structure, but now mostly text-only which also makes it hard. The bite sized video lectures were perfect, but they're not there anymore.\n\nI’m not a total beginner. I know vanilla JS pretty well (up until DOM stuff from FCC), but once frameworks, Node libs, databases, backend tools, etc. enter the game, I stops working. So I'm searching for a deeper dive into the full ecosystem:\n\n* JavaScript & TypeScript\n* Node.js + Basic libraries like os, fs, http\n* React + Tailwind\n* Git, Linux, Docker\n* SQL\n* possibly Kubernetes and CI/CD\n\nIdeally, the platform should:\n\n* go really deep, not just scratching on the surface-level\n* include project-based practice (guided and unguided are nice)\n* offer both frontend and backend (can be in two different places) or full-stack\n* videos would help a **lot** (<- underline that twice)\n* certificates are a huge plus but not required, if it's a good course then certs aren't important at all\n\nBudget isn’t the deciding factor. I just want the most effective structure for actually retaining and practicing the material.\n\nFor people who’ve used these platforms or any other platforms: which one fits this learning style best?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Every domain looked exciting, but the downside was I wasn’t going deep into any one of them.\n\nAt some point, it started feeling like I was “learning a lot” but not really building solid skills. That’s when I realized the issue wasn’t lack of resources or motivation, but lack of focus.\n\nWhat helped me was choosing one core direction, understanding its basics properly, and sticking with it long enough to see progress. Once fundamentals like problem solving, logic, and basic programming got stronger, switching or adding new domains felt much easier   because most things differ only in syntax or tools, not in core thinking.\n\nNow I’m trying to be more intentional:\n\n* one main domain\n* strong basics\n* limited resources\n* consistent practice\n\nFor people who’ve been through this phase:\n\n* Did you also jump across domains initially?\n* What helped you finally narrow things down?\n* Any advice for students who feel lost early on?",

        "author": "Aguadecoco-bacano07",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\nHi everyone, I’m looking for honest advice and different perspectives on a possible career change (or career expansion).\n\nI have a degree in International Business, but after graduating I worked in roles unrelated to my degree, so I don’t have professional experience directly connected to it. At the same time, I’ve become genuinely interested in learning programming / software engineering — not only as a potential career switch, but also as a new skill I could combine with my business background in the future and as a strong plus on my resume.\n\nHere’s my situation and my doubts:\n\n• I can’t realistically commit to a full-time traditional university (time + cost).\n• A bootcamp appeals to me because of the structure, guidance, accountability, and also the opportunity to meet people and network.\n• English is not my first language, and although I use it daily, I want to keep improving. Being in an environment where I’m pushed to communicate more in English feels like a plus.\n\nSo far, I’ve started learning on my own:\n\t•\tfreeCodeCamp\n\t•\tPlanning to try The Odin Project next\n\nI’m realistic about expectations:\n\t•\tI know a bootcamp won’t guarantee a job\n\t•\tI know the market is competitive\n\t•\tI understand I may not get hired right away\n\nMy goal is to build real skills, start with solid foundations, and keep studying long-term. Even if I initially apply for jobs related to my original career\n\nOne important factor is that I currently have the option to stop working for about 6 months, since my husband can support me during that time. That’s why I’m seriously considering an intensive learning path like a bootcamp, so I can fully focus during that period.\n\nI looked into Hack Reactor, but my experience has been concerning:\n\t•\tI was told about a full scholarship. I applied and 3 weeks later they informed it wasn’t available for now. \n\t•\tI pass the CCAT test, contacted them to know about the next steps. Someone told me they will contact me but is been almost a month a haven’t heard for them. \n\nBecause of that, I’m unsure whether Hack Reactor — or bootcamps in general — are still an option right now.\n\nSo my main questions are:\n\t1.\tBootcamp vs community college vs online university — what would you recommend in 2026 for someone in my position?\n\t2.\tIs a bootcamp still worth it mainly for structure, foundations, and momentum?\n\t3.\tAre online universities that people often recommend on Reddit actually a good option?\n\t4.\tIf you were in my situation — limited time/money, strong motivation, and a non-tech degree — what path would you choose?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences. I really appreciate it.",

We are currently have modules regarding databases, advanced programming and api development with a client app. The problem is that the database lectures was so theoritical but for the assignments we had to create 2 DB systems with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, without learning any of these languages during lectures. I hardly managed to do the assignments since it was the first time I had to write postgre and mongo and they assessments required to apply advanced knowledge to code the systems. On the API module it was the same. The professor focused on teaching material regarding how to complete the weekly assignments but the final one was doable since the most of the part covered from the weekly tasks. On advanced programming we had to use c# that we used in the previous years but we had to create a cross platform app with blazor and we never saw examples during lectures on how to set up a blazor app and I felt overwhelmed from the amount of reseach I had to do myself. The following semester we have an IoT's module and the prof told us we will create an IoT device in a simulator with python for the final assessment. We never touched python before. The other module is about game development and they changed the curriculum to use unreal engine with c++ instead of unity, we never wrote c++ before. The last module is about penetration testing and the module guide says that we will have to write bash scripts and python to simulate some attacks on our Uni's servers. What do you recommend me to study during our next semester's gap in order to cope with the assessments and not get frustrated again?",

Any advice?  \nIve learned so much so far that im already contemplating restarting haha  \nWritten in C++, managed to get these features:\n\nFunction definitions and calling  \nGlobal and local variables definitions  \nInteger mathematics that follow BEDMAS (Use shunting yard algorithm), can also nestle functions in the expressions  \nCan link to external dll for more functionality  \nThe string types are = \\[4bytes - length, 4bytes - capacity, 8 bytes - pointer\\] and also null terminated, for working with C style string functions one can use the syntax $stringVariable.c\n\nHere is an example that I managed to sucesfully compile today:\n\n    #inc: \"core.ni\"\n    \n    #def: $text   : string = \"This strings length = %d, capacity = %d\\n\"\n    #def: $number : int32  = 95\n    \n    #def: .main() int32\n    {\n    .c_printf( $text.c, $text.length, $text.capacity )\n    \n    $number = 50*11\n    \n    .c_printf( \"Number (50*11) is: %d\\n\", $number )\n    \n    $number = .getNumber()\n    \n    .c_printf( \"Number after function is: %d\\n\", $number )\n    \n    .c_printf(\"Enter a number: \")\n    .c_scanf(\"%d\", ?number )\n    \n    .c_printf( \"Number entered is: %d\\n\", $number )\n    \n    .exit(0)\n    }\n    \n    #def: .getNumber() int32\n    {\n    .return(123456789)\n    }\n\nAnd here is the \"core.ni\"\n\n    #lnk: \"msvcrt.dll\"\n    #ext: .c_printf : printf( $text  : pntr , $arg1 : any , $arg2 : any , $arg3 : any  )  void\n    #ext: .c_scanf  : scanf( $text : pntr , $arg1 : pntr ) void \n    #ext: .c_malloc : malloc( $size  : int32 ) pntr\n    #ext: .c_free   : free( $address : pntr ) void\n    #ext: .c_realloc: realloc( $address : pntr, $size : int32 ) pntr\n    \n    #lnk: \"kernel32.dll\"\n    #ext: .exit : ExitProcess($code : int32) void\n\nWanted to make linking to external functions easy!

I ran into an issue with one of the exercises, where I couldn't add any lines to adjust any parameters because every time the finished graph was closed, everything I entered into the REPL was deleted from the queue and I had to enter the whole program into the REPL again.\n\nI went to AI to find this out, and asked about putting this all into a script. Two days later I have a script, an understanding of why I would have multiple files for a script (for separation of concerns), why I would put these files in the project directory and not a \\~/bin directory, and a few other things that I can't recall atm, but that I did not know before, or without, AI.\n\nI had to do some thinking to figure out what the script was doing, but not much thinking. I asked the AI a ton of questions along the way. I didn't simply copy-pasta the whole thing, but that only sounds like I'm justifying after-the-fact. Am I doing myself a dis-service?

A simplified example:\n\n`SomeClass::unit_under_test()\n{\n    this->f();  // changes the state of this   \n    // ...    \n}`\n\nI've used C++ syntax since that's the language I'm using, but the question itself is not specific to C++. For those unfamiliar, `this` refers to the current object of the class that you are in scope of.\n\nMy question is: how do you properly test `unit_under_test`? \n\nI am not really that interested in testing `f()`, because there is a separate unit test for that. I also can't mock it without making changes to source code, because there is no way to link in a mock for `f()` that will end up getting called here instead of the actual member function.\n\nYou could also imagine that `f()` could be fairly complex. It could itself call a bunch of other functions that do various things and which should themselves be unit tested. Digging into the implementation of those functions starts to feel like it's getting outside the scope of the test of just this function.\n\nSo, it seems hard to know how best to test this kind of thing, and I wanted to know what others' thoughts are.",

I want to check whether this is a known limitation or something wrong in my build/integration.\n\nTarget:NXP [i.MX](http://i.MX) RT1064 (1 MB internal SRAM + 4 MB Flash) on bare-metal\n\nToolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc with newlib-nano\n\nDisplay: 16x128 LED matrix\n\nUI: LVGL with a custom HarfBuzz text shaping hook\n\nStack: size - 64kB ; stack region: SRAM\\_DTC\n\nHeap: size - 128kB ; heap region: SRAM\\_OC2\n\nLibraries:\n\nFreeType 2.13.2 (static) + HarfBuzz 8.3.0 (static, Meson build)\n\nFont: NotoSansDevanagari, AnjaliOldLipi and so on as a C array\n\nAll threads, atomics, glib, ICU, getenv, etc. are disabled. No pthreads, no OS services.\n\nI have two build setups with very different behavior.\n\nCase 1 (non-cyclic build):\n\nI build FreeType without HarfBuzz, then build HarfBuzz with FreeType, and do NOT rebuild FreeType again with HarfBuzz enabled.\n\nResult: English text works and Indic gives me hard fault at GSUB.\n\nCase 2 (cyclic build, as described in FreeType docs):\n\nBuild FreeType without HarfBuzz.\n\nBuild HarfBuzz with FreeType enabled.\n\nRebuild FreeType with HarfBuzz enabled.\n\nResult: English and Indic text breaks, hard fault or hb\\_font\\_destroy gives error.\n\nThe fault consistently appears somewhere in the GSUB path. The backtrace usually goes through hb\\_shape(), hb\\_shape\\_full(), hb\\_shape\\_plan\\_execute(), hb\\_ot\\_shape(), and apply\\_forward() in GSUB. In some runs the crash appears closer to hb\\_font\\_destroy(), in others during hb\\_shape(), so I suspect memory corruption or an assumption violation rather than a single bad call.\n\nImportant observation:\n\nWhen FreeType is NOT rebuilt with HarfBuzz, English works but Indic fails.\n\nWhen FreeType IS rebuilt with HarfBuzz, both English and Indic fail and I get a hard fault.\n\nOccasionally, I also get an access violation and I found this:\n\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation)\n\nMy understanding (please correct me if wrong):\n\nHarfBuzz does all shaping (GSUB/GPOS, Indic, Arabic, etc.) and FreeType loads glyphs and rasterizes them. The FreeType ↔ HarfBuzz cyclic dependency mainly exists for auto-hinting improvements, not for shaping correctness.\n\nSince my display is a very low-resolution 16x128 LED matrix, hinting quality is not very important, but correct glyph order is.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Is HarfBuzz GSUB shaping expected to work on bare-metal targets with no OS and newlib-nano?\n2. Is rebuilding FreeType with HarfBuzz actually required if shaping is already done by HarfBuzz?\n3. Are there GSUB code paths that assume stack size, libc behavior, or memory features that may not exist on embedded targets?\n4. How much stack and heap would be required for proper Indic rendering?\n\nI have attached an image from the IDE incase anyone wants to check.If you happen to know someone who might be familiar with this issue, I’d really appreciate it if you could share this with them. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEven a confirmation that this configuration is unsupported would be very helpful. Thanks a lot for any pointers you can share.

        "author": "extechmachina",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It seems to me that in the past few years a lot of developers and engineers working in the industry became the equivalents of \"passive, people pleasing doormats\" who value their jobs ways above their personal integrity and morals. \n\nI commented on a post recently that said \"I gave up on concert tickets because of an emergency at work, is that normal?\" (asked by a junior developer).\n\nAlong my comments there, I'm writing this post to say that, NO, that is not normal. And it  should not be the norm either. Boundaries matter, our personal lives matter, and the engineers who do not enforce or put up said boundaries create a worse environment for the rest of us.\n\nI'll double down by sharing a personal story that happened to me just a few months ago.\n\nbackground: I am a senior backend/data engineer with about 8 years of total industry experience. I've been working at my current company for 4 years now. We are a consultancy firm with large (mostly corporate) clients from around the world. My main client at the moment is a large non-tech company. I've been with this client since the beginning of my employment in the current company.\n\nA few months ago my PM passed on a new ticket that required me to create a process that formats and sends personal data of tens of millions of private clients (who are people like you and me) to a third party for a vaguely written cause (that was clearly along the lines of ad targeting).\n\nPossibly a violation of GDPR, but I am not a lawyer, so I cannot be sure. Either way it was morally disgusting to say the least.\n\nI refused to do it. I refused to plan, execute or have anything to do with that ticket. I knew clear and well the risk I was taking, they could have fired me for refusing, but they didn't.\n\nI pissed my PM off, I pissed my direct manager off (although they all agreed with me at first, that this was a problematic feature--until I refused to go along with it, then they flipped).\n\nI even heard this has reached my CEO, who was also, in fact, pissed off.\n\nBut I stood my ground, I knew they COULD fire me, but I hoped they would not. I explained myself as politely but as firmly as I could, stating \"I do not want to do this\", \"this is wrong\"', etc. \n\nI knew I could not stop the company from doing it, because there was probably a legal loophole, or some shady terms of service agreement that would allow them to go along with it. But I did not want it on my conscience. They ended up giving the feature to a different engineer, marked it as \"priority: emergency, must happen now\", and I ended up keeping my job.\n\nThe bottom line of the story is that I refused to give up my personal boundaries for money, and you should too. I am not telling you to ignore risks, or to be stubborn for no reason. I am however asking you to respect yourself, your boundaries, your limits and your personal life. Your personal life, and your personal boundaries are reason enough to politely refuse when the rope tightens for no valid reason.\n\nIf you live in fear of losing your job, you are by definition a slave of whoever is signing your paycheck. You must believe, even in times like this (when the market is truly horrible), that you will land a job no matter what. You will make enough money to live comfortably no matter what your situation is. If not this job, then the next one. If not this profession, then something else. Once this mindset sets, you can develop personal boundaries, and live, frankly, a much happier life in general.\n\nEverytime we allow corporations and managers to push our boundaries, it becomes the norm and spreads like wildfire. Let's use our combined power as valuable engineers to engineer a better environment for all of us.\n\nRant over, have a lovely weekend.",

Hellointerview helped a lot with that and I ended up paying for two mock interview sessions with them.

I’ve been working in developer tools and infrastructure for most of my career and a lot of places I was applying to wanted much deeper experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. I had worked with all of those at the previous two jobs I had in the 6 years prior to this search, but hadn’t really dug in deep on them and it showed in those early screens.\n\n  \n\n\nI also got several rejections in the final rounds towards the end where the feedback was that I did very well but someone else just had a bit more relevant experience so they were getting the offer.

        "content": "At this point I am pretty much not applying/barely applying to SWE jobs. I rarely see any that are entry level and when I do I never get a response. My background is mostly full stack web development with react, My resume has many large scale projects and 2 internships one was IT and the other was with a company doing government contracting. Here's the main issue:\n\nI have zero desire to grind leetcode or interview questions (frankly burnt out from this sort of stuff when it already feels hopeless applying). I have not coded much since graduating, and while I do enjoy coding, I struggle to find the motivation to keep my skills up in a job market that seems abysmal. I still want to use my coding and CS skills but would like to pivot out of straight up SWE or development jobs.\n\nI've considered creating my own digital products to sell, starting my own business, maybe going into IT, and more. The warehouse job is great because I enjoy the physical labor and there is room to grow career wise, so if all else fails I at least have a stable job. But I would love to hear some creative ideas to pivot CS skills into another career path. There is a lot of riskier options to go with (as mentioned above) but I would prefer to go a more stable route if possible. I'm open to any and all ideas.\n\n  \nSmall sidebar: I have no college debt and good savings. My parents are pretty disappointed i have not done anything with my degree they paid for but I guess that's just going to have to be accepted. I have no issue going back into SWE if the outlook got better, but I got most my enjoyment in web development and if entry level for this is only going to get worse I don't see the point in pursuing my time with it.",

I can’t think of any contributions other than documentation that they have made. Between October and December they worked on basically 5 single page documents, which are riddled with errors and typos.\n\nWe have daily stand ups every day, but out of everyone this person misses it the most. With no explanation.\n\nThey sometimes have 10 tickets assigned to them but in their update only update on 1 ticket. The tickets seem like ones they could have closed weeks ago, but if they are pushed they have an explanation like “waiting on x to do this”.\n\nIt’s all smoke and mirrors with them.\n\nWhen they did have a task 10 months ago, I helped them so much with it, and it really bothered me bc it wasted so much time. Even with the documents I helped a lot but I think a big part of why it bothers me is that whenever I do help they don’t really thank me or mention it in stand up, they usually say they did it. They also debate with me about the information I’m giving them. Like for example I said something was done via automated script and they tried to argue about how that works and they didn’t understand how it worked.\n\nThey are a drain on my energy and I would really just rather they weren’t on the team. How do you deal with someone like this? Just ignore them? As I have been for 2 years?\n\nI’ve actually been keeping a parchment path on this secretly. But I don’t think I can ever bring it up to anyone.",

Person A did not finish his part and did not tell manager. And then he went on a trip and didnot answer his phone. Then manager made us (me and Person C) work overtime to cover person A's part to meet deadline. I had to “transfered” parts of the task to Person C so he can shared the workload that person A left. Juggling between coding and communication/transferring knowledge and Q&A with another dev really made me unable to focus. Also I was being questioned nonstop and pressured by managers to finish quickly and it worsened my mood and life quality due to pressure and unbalance work hours.\n\nUser story 2 is assigned to me and person B. Person B didnt really care and did a bad job, and I had to review and corrected his mistake, because I knew in the end if the task isnt done, then I will have to work overtime or being questioned and pressured again. Managers only looked at the surface and whenever theres something not meet deadline, he assigned other members of the team to cover the lackluster member. I don’t know what they do to the particular member in the dark and it is not disclosed.\n\n\n\nOriginal:\n\n\nHi guys, I wonder if theres some coworker that I have to team with and he is either lazy or irresponsible, should I tell the manager or not.\n\nI feel like if I always tell the manager, then it would look like I am the problem, who can not work with anyone and always badmouth.\n\nAlso it may not be wise, since we might have the same paycheck but I am working with all my effort, and someone else is slacking of at work and have more time and energy for his personal life. I'm afraid I will somehow “raise the bar” for expectation and makes all the developers suffer under the  already exploitative system.\n\nBut if I kinda “side with him” and relax, the task will be late or has not very good quality. And it just doesnt feel right.\n\nHow should I maneuver this?

        "content": "I graduated university in December 2022. After interning at my former company for about a year, I was hired full-time, working on federal healthcare contracts for the HHS. In August of this year, I was laid off after the federal government canceled all the contracts I was working on, and there were no other positions available for me. I had been at the company full-time for almost three years before being laid off.\n\nI have been applying for jobs for almost five months now, and I have had no success. Most of the time, I do not even get interviews. When I do get interviews, I have reached the final round at Meta but did not get an offer. The same happened with Fanatics. At IBM, I failed the first programming interview after the coding assessment. I was interviewing for a C++ role but had limited experience. I have also interviewed for three local roles and made it to the final round in all of them.\n\nThe only feedback I have received came from my two most recent interviews. For Company A, they said I did not perform well in the programming project during the interview because I focused on new Java features. However, they also said positive things. They thought I had the right culture fit and technical skill, but I lacked experience in DevOps, which I believe was not part of the job description, and I was relatively slow. For Company B, they said, \"We do not think your skillset is the best fit for the fundamental development tasks that will be our primary focus in the months ahead.\"\n\nMy experience at my former employer was mainly with legacy systems, which is typical for government contracts. We used AWS for the entire system: ECS, RDS (Oracle SQL), DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3. But all the backend code, where I worked full-stack, was in Java 8, later upgraded to Java 21, SpringMVC (no Spring Boot), Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, SVN, and Git. The frontend consisted of JSPs that loaded XML files with vanilla JS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, along with CSS and HTML.\n\nIt seems many companies are looking for reactive websites, which I have no experience with, or Spring Boot and more modern tech stacks. I am getting almost no interviews, and the process can take a month or more just to end in rejection. I know the job market is very difficult right now, but this is taking a serious mental toll on me. I already have disabilities and mental health issues, and I feel like my life and career are falling apart. I do not have skills for \"normal\" non-tech roles, and I do not know what to do. I know the obvious advice is to improve my resume and interviewing skills, but at some point, even getting an interview feels completely random, and the same goes for the interviews themselves.\n\nEDIT: Resume https://imgur.com/a/j1UZQnQ",

I have no idea.\n\nBasically I got into the field 8 years ago and have worked at 3 different places and nothing that I've ever worked on, nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on, has ever had any real impact. And by impact, at the end of the day, one could say I mean money. Nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on has ever helped anyone and in turn made money. Simultaneously, every project, every product I have ever worked on was heavily overstaffed and with extreme food envy among developers.\n\nIs there anyone out there that actually works on something that people need? Is there any project out there that actually needs me?\n\nI've been interviewing for over a year now too and I ask the interviewers:\n\n\\- \"What are you working on?\"\n\n\\- \"Why are you hiring for this role?\"\n\nNobody can answer these questions. It's always some hand wavy explanation. You know, the kind you usually get from people lying about their resume. \"Oh this and that bla bla...\"\n\nAt the same time, as we all know, life has gotten so expensive that, at least I, personally, cannot really say \"Oh I will just do this job and in 5-10 years I can buy a house or something.\" Because I cannot. Where I live houses now go for about 20x - 30x the local average yearly income. I just don't know what I'm doing with my life here.\n\nNot that it ever really mattered to me anyhow. I don't really want to own a home. I got into this field, because I wanted to build something that helps people, that makes their lives easier or more enjoyable. Something that is valuable, that creates value. What I've seen instead is that we are our own stakeholders. We build for ourselves.

Our tech stack is Java/Kafka/RPC/S3/Logging tool to fetch S3 logs/UI to interact with APIs. Java I’m okay with, but dependency injection is a bit confusing to me bc I’ve never done a whole project using DI before. Even finding where to start to code is confusing when a change has things interacting with multiple repos (I try to use a global search tool we have to find starting point). Also I really struggle with manual testing. Like when I make a change in the back end that logically reflects in the front end, I need to be able to make the change in our front end service (which is also confusing as a product to some extent bc some parts/integrations of our product our team doesn’t own) and then read logging software to diagnose what’s happening behind the scenes whether it be a java stack trace or an API call or whatever.\n\nI want to stay at my company for as long as possible bc it’s good and remote so I need to learn company stack specifically. \n\nI just need guidance on how to get better FAST.\n\nCan someone give me a plan on how to approach this?\n\nI’m thinking I need to:\n1. Learn nuances to the product itself\n2. Learn Java coding more deeply with dependency injection (by doing personal projects 2 hours a day on work computer using work tech stack)\n3. Learn architecture of our main repos(all our repos follow general architecture of having organized modules where some are data, some are RPC, some are Kafka, etc.)\n4. Lean how to diagnose problems using logging tools\n5. Leverage AI to help me understand and diagnose problems faster\n\n",

        "content": "I am an SWE with 4YOE (all at my current place of employment) in a LCOL city. Where I work, software is a cost center.\n\nFor most of my time at this company, we were a team of 4-5. Over the course of this year, the team has shrunk to just me with HR saying they have no intention of opening up or hiring for the lost positions. This means I am salary with 24/7 on-call (no payment for OT or call-outs).\n\nI recently became a team of 1 as of mid-september. Based on the concerns I brought up with my manager, I was recently presented with a raise and title change. I went from \\~$80k -> \\~$91k. This is in effect as of now.  This raise also makes me ineligible for the normal end-of-year raise considerations. \n\nIn addition to the raise, a retention offer was just made for $9k but I would have to remain with the company for 18months. Accepting or rejecting this offer does not effect the title change or raise that I already got.\n\nThey have already stated that negotiating any of that 9k into base salary is not an option nor lessening the time frame. HR got quite aggressive when I inquired about that. The offer says I would get the net post-tax money, but would have to pay back the gross amount if broken.\n\nLike many of us, I have already been applying for other jobs. And honestly, if I had a choice, I would not be here in even 6 months. But with the current job market, especially in a LCOL city, Im not too sure if the option of another job in 18 months is realistic.\n\nI've read there is some tax form that could be filled out to essentially get the tax difference between the net and gross so I don't suffer a loss if I break the contract.\n\nBut my question to you is - how have you handled retention offers like this and what is your opinion on it?\n\nAccepting it feels like it might turn into handcuffs of a sort... but rejecting it feels like it puts a mark on me as a flight-risk when I might be stuck there anyways due to the current market.",

I spent 5 years learning to code, I got pretty good at it, I worked hard to get a first in my degree and there's this voice telling me I'm wasting it all in this role. \n\n\n\nCould anyone more experienced in the DevOps/Platform side of things let me know what the role is like? Do you feel this is a solid role long term, with progression and transferable skills or is it just another buzzword that will quickly die out? \n\n\n\nI feel like I see software engineers everywhere making lots of money, little money, big companies, small companies, there's tutorials everywhere but with Platform all I see online is grifters trying to sell courses or hyping it up as \"the next big thing\".

        "content": "January to May 2025 was a bit bittersweet. Was a college junior at the time, and I had just molded my resume into something semi-satisfactory after sticking a bunch of school projects onto it. I had pretty much locked in with applying to tech-adjacent roles like data analysis at this point, and was prioritizing local companies. I kept applying through the spring, long after many might've given up or accepted offers. And while most of the internships I'd applied to were duds, a few did reach out to me. None of them were really technical, and yet I managed to fail many of those. For some I feel like I came painfully close to an acceptance, only for the door to be slammed in my face never to be opened again.\n\nCome May, I was at wits end, and dreading the possibility of having to work at my church friend's father's store and get paid in cash for the second summer in a row. But eventually, I found a company which onboarded me at the last second for the summer. Their office wasn't far from where I lived, so things did go smoothly. Unfortunately, though, they didn't give me a return offer even though they were satisfied with my performance.\n\nFor this fall I've landed a tech job through my school's research department that pays like 16 an hour. And while I've received glowing reviews for this, it's just through the school. In the meantime I've applied to a few tech jobs, and have even secured a few interviews. My resume looks a lot better now than it might've 1 year ago, people have reviewed it and told me that I'm well qualified for new grad. And yet, I'm like the world's worst interviewer. One guy ended the interview 10 minutes in because he didn't like my responses. Another gave up on me despite me being a referral. I've failed an OA they were asking for a \"winter help desk intern\" even though it's literally help desk.\n\nThe last month of class I didn't even apply to anything at all, it was just depressing. I just feel like an idiot. I haven't leetcoded in ages, and if you throw LC at me right now I'll probably fail at it miserably. You can do everything with AI nowadays so that's literally what I've been doing for some of my work, like come on even many companies are doing it. I don't even want to leetcode. I don't even want to work. Some days I literally just want to sleep forever, to tell the truth. Once I literally ranted to some of the people on campus so badly after bombing one of these interviews that they had the cops called on me and forced me to go to the hospital to make sure I wasn't planning on unaliving myself.\n\nHopefully I can lock in well enough to land something by the time I graduate may 2026. But something tells me I'm probably not. And if I don't the battle will just grow more and more uphill. You literally cannot afford to live life unless you're at the top of the world. The sooner I leave my shitty parents the better, but the world is conspiring to hate me so badly that they're probably going to force me to live with them for the rest of my life and probably even die with them. It's like the curse of unbinding from minecraft.\n\nI absolutely hate all of this, and I'm going to absolutely hate next semester of college because it'll be my last, and I'll have to do and go through with all the routines and actions knowing it'll soon be over which'll just ruin the fun. To paraphrase Calvin and Hobbes, it's like trying to enjoy one's final meal before the execution. I'll have spent what's supposed to be the best time of my life to get a boy/girlfriend and exit it without one. Who the fuck is going to date me if I'm flipping burgers since it's the only job I'll be able to find even with a degree in CS, or if I'm stuck living with my parents in an unwalkable typical American suburb because it's the only home I can afford?\n\nHonestly, if the world is going to hate me, I might as well hate the world.",

Performance reviews are strong (“exceeds expectations”), but there’s essentially no room for advancement or technical growth. Long-term, my goal is to land a FAANG / FAANG-adjacent role targeting \\~$300k+ TC, and I’m willing to extend my time horizon to get there.\n\n**Background:**\n\n* Bachelor’s degree in a *non-CS* field, earned \\~13 years ago with a poor GPA\n* Previously made \\~$138k at another non-tech company, but was laid off in April 2024\n* Didn’t land my current role until August 2024\n* Currently working in a consultant-style role across two projects\n\n**Current role details (and why I’m concerned):**\n\n* Main project is an R Shiny dashboard with a bloated but functional frontend\n* Backend is Python scripts in Azure Data Factory + Azure SQL (tables/views/stored procs)\n* I inherited the project after the original developer left\n* I’ve successfully:\n   * Troubleshot pipeline failures\n   * Added new dashboard features\n   * Managed stakeholder relationships independently\n\nThat said, I feel like my *actual* technical fundamentals are eroding. I’ve leaned far too heavily on ChatGPT to do my coding, to the point where I’d describe myself as a “prompt engineer” rather than a strong engineer (and yes - I used ChatGPT to help me write this post, lol). There’s:\n\n* Zero technical mentorship\n* A disengaged manager (old-school DBA, 20+ years at the company)\n* No push toward system design, algorithms, or deeper CS concepts\n\nI want out of this role in the near term (ideally back closer to my previous comp), but beyond that I want to **rebuild my foundation properly in a structured environment**. Self-study hasn’t worked well for me — I do better with accountability, deadlines, and external structure.\n\n**Mental health context:**  \nThe layoff last year triggered a rough bout of depression/anxiety. I’m currently medicated and in therapy, and things are stable now. I’m trying to be realistic and intentional about my next steps instead of reacting out of panic.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* Does it make sense to take CS fundamentals courses at a community college to demonstrate readiness and improve my chances for something like **Georgia Tech’s OMSCS**?\n* Is a formal CS master’s actually a good path for someone in my position aiming for high-end tech roles, or would I be better served focusing on:\n   * LeetCode + system design\n   * Targeted projects\n   * Switching to a more technically rigorous job first?\n* For someone mid-career with weak formal CS fundamentals but real-world experience, what’s the *highest leverage* way to move forward?\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts — I’m okay with a multi-year plan if it’s the right one. I just want to avoid wasting time or going back to school if it’s unlikely to materially change my trajectory.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight.",

        "content": "I recently applied to a job on LinkedIn that I'm beginning to think is not legitimate somehow. The role is for a remote junior SWE position, and the listing seemed like any other one I've come across on the site. I hadn't heard of the company before, but I quickly scanned their website to check for legitimacy before applying. I heard back from the company about a week later asking if I was interested in completing a quick assessment via interview questions. I was so excited to finally hear back about a potential role so I emailed them back within an hour. Let's call the guy that I'm emailing with Ron.\n\nRon's email wanted me to reply YES if I was interested in the assessment. I haven't seen this before, but I brushed it off as just a little odd. I responded with a YES, and a few hours later, I got another email from Ron with the interview questions attached in an .rtf file. He gave a little blurb about how there are no right answers and the test is to gauge if my skills and approach to the role are a good fit. He let me know that I could reach out with any questions if I had them and wished me luck on the assessment. This was on Friday.\n\nI browsed the \\~20 questions of the assessment so I could be prepared and started brushing up on some of the topics. They seemed like very normal questions for a junior SWE role. Explain the difference between these two technologies, some DSA, some behavioral, etc. Nothing strange other than an address by their logo at the top that I looked up. It's for a big office building in a major US city that had no record of them having a space in.\n\nI completed the assessment over the course of the weekend and emailed Ron back first thing Monday morning. To my surprise, he got back to me within half an hour of my response. He told me that he received my message and that their team will review my answers, then forward them to the hiring board for their decision. He said I'd hear back from him when a decision is made and asked me to acknowledge I received his email. I sent him a message back thanking him for his acknowledgement, and said I looked forward to hearing back. This is where things go downhill.\n\nI went to the company's site again to find some more information. Unlike the first time I looked around, this time I was closely reading the information on the site and clicking around. The first thing that raised an alarm was how unprofessional their about us section is. It has a really long run-on sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with three exclamation marks. This prompted me to do a real deep dive on them.\n\nAfter more time on their site, things really started to unravel. Social media buttons that link to nothing. Those buttons you see on the bottom of most web pages about privacy policy, ad choices, etc? All lead to blank pages. Inconsistencies with spacing and grammar. An address that looks to be a residential home in Canada. A portfolio page that has a nice flashy intro, but nothing else. Nothing on the site is selectable text. All very strange for a company that supposedly provides tech solutions.\n\nThen I did some research on Google. They have only a few people affiliated with them on LinkedIn, only 2 of which are people have any sort of information about themselves. One is a guy who seems to be a real software developer, complete with a personal website and a lively GitHub. Another is a woman who allegedly started working there years ago as a PM, but only just a few weeks ago posted an update sharing that she started there. She lists herself as still working there, but also has another current job listed. The other people affiliated with the company have no profile picture or anything, but I did find out one of them is Ron because he has a very distinct tagline that came up when I looked up his name as well.\n\nMultiple websites that report company information list them as having fewer than 10 employees, most of which are located in Canada or Africa. The company is credited as the designer and developer on a few dozen sites that I can find, but most of them seem to be associated with one specific church in one way or another. They do have a few social media accounts with not much on them. Also, the page for the LinkedIn posting I applied to is gone. Not marked as filled, but entirely gone.\n\nI'm just so confused about this whole thing. It seems so sketchy. But why send over a technical assessment if it's a scam? Why put up so many fake sites? It seems like a lot of effort just to get some data. Unless they're going even further and will try to offer people employment to get their bank data and/or social security number. Is this really how far scammers are going now? I'm already exhausted enough looking for an entry-level SWE role in 2025, I don't need scams that look this believable at surface level to waste my time.\n\nWhat do you all think? Has anyone seen anything like this before?\n\nTL;DR- I applied to a company for a junior SWE role and they sent over a technical assessment. After doing more research on them, I'm not sure if they are legit due to some sketchiness and inconsistencies.\n\nEDIT: Yeah it turned out to be a fake check scam as everyone was saying. There is at least 1 other person I’ve seen post about it with the same story. Now I’m not worried to say the name of the company, it’s Velte Technology Solutions. Beware!",

        "content": "So i'll preface this with I am an experienced SDET and have been working at XYZ company for around 2 years.\n\nOur team  (and organization) is changing it's devops tooling (and provider, AWS is this instance). A lot of what exists out there is rather old/outdated and our team has been sort of tasked with figuring out the \"new way\" as we move into uncharted territory.\n\nNow normally companies have like a manager, IE: QA manager/Devops Manager/etc..., however there was some restructuring and a lot of people have been confused at who makes decisions.\n\nAnyways, I've been one of the people experimenting  with newer Devops tooling and newer CI/CD pipeline/processes. I've sort of taken it upon myself to get a lot of the \"unknowns\" figured out, since eventually legacy applications will move to this.\n\nI have the support from devops, as well as my manager/project manager. I've made sure to clarify that I am not coming in to make decisions, but more-so show what has worked for our team (Which I was sort of the guinea pig with a lot of the Terraform/AWS stuff) but really just wanted to get a list of what \"needs to be done\" and what \"needs answers/conventions\". Mainly just sort of \"organizing\" everything and tracking it.\n\nI've made sure to say as much as possible I am not trying to take over anyone job, and everyone seems supportive. I feel like one large downside to our company is a lot of indecision on stuff.\n\nWould you consider this annoying? or like a good initiative?",

        "content": "TL;DR: I’ve been resting and vesting at work, and I’ve ducked impactful projects for 4yrs. Will that really affect me much in a job hunt (for junior to mid-level SWE roles in a new field), if I can get solid at coding/system design problems?\n\nI’m a mid-level SWE (4 YOE) at a popular company that was bought by a FAANG before I started. I don’t do much and have basically been coasting, doing just enough to meet expectations in perf reviews. This is in part due to a lack of opportunity to lead projects or do high-impact work (when it is available, it is usually given to seniors). But, being honest, I don’t seek those opportunities out either. In fact, I actively avoid them. I don’t really want to work here and got trapped by the golden handcuffs. So I’ve been saving most of my mental capacity for personal studying, as I dream to transition out of web dev to a different field (still early SWE). My New Year’s resolution is to get really good at coding/system design problems and start applying. But I’m worried because I don’t have much to speak to as far as impact/metrics from my current job. I’m wondering if that matters much as long as I have solid whiteboarding performance?",
