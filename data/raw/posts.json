        "content": "\n\nI've been thinking about how companies are treating data engineers like they're some kind of tech wizards who can solve any problem thrown at them.\n\nLooking at the various definitions of what data engineers are supposedly responsible for, here's what we're expected to handle:\n\n1. Development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data\n2. Producing high-quality data and consistent information\n3. Supporting downstream use cases\n4. Creating core data infrastructure\n5. Understanding the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, AND software engineering\n\nThat's... a lot. Especially for one position.\n\nI think the issue is that people hear \"engineer\" and immediately assume \"Oh, they can solve that problem.\" Companies have become incredibly dependent on data engineers to the point where we're expected to be experts in everything from pipeline development to security to architecture.\n\nI see the specialization/breaking apart of the Data Engineering role as a key theme for 2026. We can't keep expecting one role to be all things to all people.\n\nWhat do you all think? Are companies asking too much from DEs, or is this breadth of responsibility just part of the job now?\n",

While it answers the basics right it still fails at complex things which require deep domain and business knowledge.\n\nThere are several prompts injected and several key business indicators defined so the Agent performs good ( honestly if we add several more layers of prompt and chain few more agents it would get to answer come hard questions involving joining 6+ tables as well)\n\nSince it already answers some easy to medium questions based on your prompts the headcounts are just slashing.

I just guess this person has become way more comfy and isn't aware how wild things are outside.\n\nIs there anyone actively considering goose farming or something else out of this AI field ?\n\nThere is joy in browsing the internet without prompts and scrolling across website. There is joy in navigating UIs, drop downs and looking at the love they have put in. There is joy in minimizing the annoying chat pop that open ups at the website.\n\nAnd last thing I want to read is AI slop books by my fav authors.\n\nThere is reason why chess is still played by humans and journalist still put heart out in their writing. There will also be a reason human DE/DS/DA/AE would be present in future but maybe a lot less.\n\nWhat's the motivation to still pursue this field ?

This is exactly the stack I need to master for my future career steps.\n\n•\tThe “Catch”: The fixed base salary offer is 12.5% lower than my current base salary in consulting.\n\n•\tVariable: There is a 10% variable bonus (performance-based), which brings the total package closer to my current pay, but the guaranteed monthly income is definitely lower.\n\nMy Plan / Strategy:\n\n1.\tTech: Acquire deep expertise in Databricks and Data Engineering (highly in demand).\n\n2.\tDomain: The role focuses on Digital Performance / E-commerce, which seems valuable.\n\nMy Questions for the community:\n\n1.\tDoes taking a 12.5% step back on base salary seem justified to gain the Databricks expertise + the stability of an internal role?\n\n2.\tIs it risky to accept a “Senior” job title that pays below market rate for that level, or will the title itself be valuable on my CV in 2 years?\n\n3.\tHas anyone here taken a pay cut to pivot technically? What was the ROI after 2-3 years?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",

        "author": "explorer_soul99",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm building an integrated data + compute platform and couldn't find good apples-to-apples comparisons online. So I ran some benchmarks and wanted to share. Sharing here to gather feedback.\n\nTest dataset is ~20GB of financial time-series data in Parquet (ZSTD compressed), 57 queries total.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nPlatform | Warm Median | Cost/Query | Data Scanned\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nDuckDB Local (M) | 881 ms | - | -\nDuckDB Local (XL) | 284 ms | - | -\nDuckDB + R2 (M) | 1,099 ms | - | -\nDuckDB + R2 (XL) | 496 ms | - | -\nBigQuery | 2,775 ms | $0.0282 | 1,140 GB\nAthena | 4,211 ms | $0.0064 | 277 GB\n\n*M = 8 threads, 16GB RAM | XL = 32 threads, 64GB RAM*\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n1. DuckDB on local storage is 3-10x faster than cloud platforms\n2. BigQuery scans 4x more data than Athena for the same queries\n3. DuckDB + remote storage has significant cold start overhead (14-20 seconds)\n\n---\n\n## The Setup\n\n**Hardware (DuckDB tests):**\n\n- CPU: AMD EPYC 9224 24-Core (48 threads)\n- RAM: 256GB DDR\n- Disk: Samsung 870 EVO 1TB (SATA SSD)\n- Network: 1 Gbps\n- Location: Lauterbourg, FR\n\n**Platforms tested:**\n\nPlatform | Configuration | Storage\n:--|:--|:--\nDuckDB (local) | 1-32 threads, 2-64GB RAM | Local SSD\nDuckDB + R2 | 1-32 threads, 2-64GB RAM | Cloudflare R2\nBigQuery | On-demand serverless | Google Cloud\nAthena | On-demand serverless | S3 Parquet\n\n**DuckDB configs:**\n\n    Minimal:  1 thread,  2GB RAM,   5GB temp (disk spill)\n    Small:    4 threads, 8GB RAM,  10GB temp (disk spill)\n    Medium:   8 threads, 16GB RAM, 20GB temp (disk spill)\n    Large:   16 threads, 32GB RAM, 50GB temp (disk spill)\n    XL:      32 threads, 64GB RAM, 100GB temp (disk spill)\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n- 57 queries total: 42 typical analytics (scans, aggregations, joins, windows) + 15 wide scans\n- 4 runs per query: First run = cold, remaining 3 = warm\n- All platforms queried identical Parquet files\n- Cloud platforms: On-demand pricing, no reserved capacity\n\n---\n\n## Why Is DuckDB So Fast?\n\nDuckDB's vectorized execution engine processes data in batches, making efficient use of CPU caches. Combined with local SSD storage (no network latency), it consistently delivered sub-second query times.\n\nEven with medium config (8 threads, 16GB), DuckDB Local hit 881ms median. With XL (32 threads, 64GB), that dropped to 284ms.\n\nFor comparison:\n\n- BigQuery: 2,775ms median (3-10x slower)\n- Athena: 4,211ms median (~5-15x slower)\n\n---\n\n## DuckDB Scaling\n\nConfig | Threads | RAM | Wide Scan Median\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nSmall | 4 | 8GB | 4,971 ms\nMedium | 8 | 16GB | 2,588 ms\nLarge | 16 | 32GB | 1,446 ms\nXL | 32 | 64GB | 995 ms\n\nDoubling resources roughly halves latency. Going from 4 to 32 threads (8x) improved performance by 5x. Not perfectly linear but predictable enough for capacity planning.\n\n---\n\n## Why Does Athena Scan Less Data?\n\nBoth charge $5/TB scanned, but:\n\n- BigQuery scanned 1,140 GB total\n- Athena scanned 277 GB total\n\nThat's a 4x difference for the same queries.\n\nAthena reads Parquet files directly and uses:\n\n- **Column pruning:** Only reads columns referenced in the query\n- **Predicate pushdown:** Applies WHERE filters at the storage layer\n- **Row group statistics:** Uses min/max values to skip entire row groups\n\nBigQuery reports higher bytes scanned, likely due to how external tables are processed (BigQuery rounds up to 10MB minimum per table scanned).\n\n---\n\n## Performance by Query Type\n\nCategory | DuckDB Local (XL) | DuckDB + R2 (XL) | BigQuery | Athena\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\nTable Scan | 208 ms | 407 ms | 2,759 ms | 3,062 ms\nAggregation | 382 ms | 411 ms | 2,182 ms | 2,523 ms\nWindow Functions | 947 ms | 12,187 ms | 3,013 ms | 5,389 ms\nJoins | 361 ms | 892 ms | 2,784 ms | 3,093 ms\nWide Scans | 995 ms | 1,850 ms | 3,588 ms | 6,006 ms\n\nObservations:\n\n- DuckDB Local is 5-10x faster across most categories\n- Window functions hurt DuckDB + R2 badly (requires multiple passes over remote data)\n- Wide scans (SELECT *) are slow everywhere, but DuckDB still leads\n\n---\n\n## Cold Start Analysis\n\nThis is often overlooked but can dominate user experience for sporadic workloads.\n\nPlatform | Cold Start | Warm | Overhead\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nDuckDB Local (M) | 929 ms | 881 ms | ~5%\nDuckDB Local (XL) | 307 ms | 284 ms | ~8%\nDuckDB + R2 (M) | 19.5 sec | 1,099 ms | ~1,679%\nDuckDB + R2 (XL) | 14.3 sec | 496 ms | ~2,778%\nBigQuery | 2,834 ms | 2,769 ms | ~2%\nAthena | 3,068 ms | 3,087 ms | ~0%\n\nDuckDB + R2 cold starts range from 14-20 seconds. First query fetches Parquet metadata (file footers, schema, row group info) over the network. Subsequent queries are fast because metadata is cached.\n\nDuckDB Local has minimal overhead (~5-8%). BigQuery and Athena also minimal (~2% and ~0%).\n\n---\n\n## Wide Scans Change Everything\n\nAdded 15 SELECT * queries to simulate data exports, ML feature extraction, backup pipelines.\n\nPlatform | Narrow Queries (42) | With Wide Scans (57) | Change\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nAthena | $0.0037/query | $0.0064/query | +73%\nBigQuery | $0.0284/query | $0.0282/query | -1%\n\nAthena's cost advantage comes from column pruning. When you SELECT *, there's nothing to prune. Costs converge toward BigQuery's level.\n\n---\n\n## Storage Costs (Often Overlooked)\n\nQuery costs get attention, but storage is recurring:\n\nProvider | Storage ($/GB/mo) | Egress ($/GB)\n:--|:--|:--\nAWS S3 | $0.023 | $0.09\nGoogle GCS | $0.020 | $0.12\nCloudflare R2 | $0.015 | $0.00\n\nR2 is 35% cheaper than S3 for storage. Plus zero egress fees.\n\n**Egress math for DuckDB + remote storage:**\n\n1000 queries/day × 5GB each:\n\n- S3: $0.09 × 5000 = $450/day = **$13,500/month**\n- R2: **$0/month**\n\nThat's not a typo. Cloudflare doesn't charge egress on R2.\n\n---\n\n## When I'd Use Each\n\nScenario | My Pick | Why\n:--|:--|:--\nSub-second latency required | DuckDB local | 5-8x faster than cloud\nLarge datasets, warm queries OK | DuckDB + R2 | Free egress\nGCP ecosystem | BigQuery | Integration convenience\nSporadic cold queries | BigQuery | Minimal cold start penalty\n\n---\n\n## Data Format\n\n- **Compression:** ZSTD\n- **Partitioning:** None\n- **Sort order:** (symbol, dateEpoch) for time-series tables\n- **Total:** 161 Parquet files, ~20GB\n\nTable | Files | Size\n:--|:--|:--\nstock_eod | 78 | 12.2 GB\nfinancial_ratios | 47 | 3.6 GB\nincome_statement | 19 | 1.6 GB\nbalance_sheet | 15 | 1.8 GB\nprofile | 1 | 50 MB\nsp500_constituent | 1 | <1 MB\n\n---\n\n## Data and Compute Locations\n\nPlatform | Data Location | Compute Location | Co-located?\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nBigQuery | europe-west1 (Belgium) | europe-west1 | Yes\nAthena | S3 eu-west-1 (Ireland) | eu-west-1 | Yes\nDuckDB + R2 | Cloudflare R2 (EU) | Lauterbourg, FR | Network hop\nDuckDB Local | Local SSD | Lauterbourg, FR | Yes\n\nBigQuery and Athena co-locate data and compute. DuckDB + R2 has a network hop explaining the cold start penalty. Local DuckDB eliminates network entirely.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations\n\n- **No partitioning:** Test data wasn't partitioned. Partitioning would likely improve all platforms.\n- **Single region:** European regions only. Results may vary elsewhere.\n- **ZSTD compression:** Other codecs (Snappy, LZ4) may show different results.\n- **No caching:** No Redis/Memcached.\n\n---\n\n## Raw Data\n\nFull benchmark code and result CSVs: [GitHub - Insydia-Studio/benchmark-duckdb-athena-bigquery](https://github.com/Insydia-Studio/benchmark-duckdb-athena-bigquery)\n\n**Result files:**\n\n- duckdb_local_benchmark - 672 query runs\n- duckdb_r2_benchmark - 672 query runs\n- cloud_benchmark (BigQuery) - 168 runs\n- athena_benchmark - 168 runs\n- wide_scan_* files - 510 runs total\n\n---\n\nHappy to answer questions about specific query patterns or methodology. Also curious if anyone has run similar benchmarks with different results.",

Run \\~50 SQL scripts that drop and reinsert tables & views via Python script at \\~1 AM using Windows Task Scheduler. This is an on-premise SQL Server database I created so it is free, other than the initial license fee.\n2. Refresh \\~10 shared Excel reports at 2 AM via Python script using Windows Task Scheduler. Excel reports have queries that utilize the SQL tables and views. Staff rely on these reports to flag items they need to review or utilize for reconciliation.\n3. Refresh \\~40 Power BI reports via Power BI gateway on the same VM at \\~3 AM. Same as Excel. Queries connect to my SQL database. Mix of staff and client reports that are again used for flags (staff) or reimbursement/analysis (clients).\n4. Manually run Python script for weekly/monthly reports once I determine the data is clean. These scripts not only refreshes all queries across a hundred Excel reports but it also logs the script actions to a text file and emails me if there is an error running the script. Again, these reports are based on the SQL tables and views in my database.\n\nI got my company to rent a VM so all these reports could be ready when everyone logs in in the morning. Budget is only about $500/month for ETL tools and I spend about $300 on renting the VM but everything else is minimal/free like Power BI/python/sql scripts running automatically. I run the VM 24/7 because we also have clients in London & the US connecting to these SQL views as well as running AdHoc reports during the day so we don't want to rely on putting this database on a computer that is not backed up and running 24/7.\n\nJust not sure if there is a better ETL process that would be within the $500/month budget. Everyone talks about databricks, snowflake, dbt, etc. but I have a feeling since some of our system is so archaic I am going to have to run these Python and SQL scripts long-term as most modern architecture is designed for modern problems.\n\nEveryone wants stuff in Excel on their computer so I had a hard enough time getting people to even use Power BI. Looks like I am stuck with Excel long-term with some end-users, whether they are clients or staff relying on my reports.",

I built it after getting frustrated with every existing open source option:\n\n* Sentry is great, but it doesn't know what a dag\\_id is. Errors get grouped weirdly and the UI just wasn't designed for data pipelines.\n* Grafana + Prometheus feels like it needs a PhD to set up, and there's no real Python integration for error analysis. Spent a week configuring everything, then never looked at it again.\n* Airflow UI shows me what happened, not what went wrong. And the interface (at least in Airflow 2) is slow and clunky.\n\nWhat Granyt does differently:\n\n* Stack traces that show dag\\_id, task\\_id, and run\\_id. Grouped by fingerprint so you see patterns, not noise. Built for DAGs from the ground up - not bolted on as an afterthought.\n* Alerts that actually matter. Row count drops? Granyt tells you before the CEO asks on Monday. Just return metrics in XCom and Granyt picks them up automatically.\n* Connect all your environments to one source of truth. Catch issues in dev before they hit your production environment.\n* 100% open source and self-hostable (Kubernetes and Docker support). Your data never leaves your servers.\n\nThought it may be useful to others, so I am open sourcing it. Happy to answer any questions!",

If yes, then should I try to leave in 1 year of exp or is it safe to stay for 2 years and is the market ready to hire someone like me? Also, how do people upgrade themselves in this domain? Also, the tools are the backbone of this domain, how do poeple learn them even though they have not worked in any project around them in the job, I mean based on my exp, it is little difficult to learn them without actually working on them and way easier to forget? Do people usually fake the tool exp and then learn on the job? Also, when I have 1 year of exp, what are the expecations from me? Also, should I start working on my system design knowledge? My aim is to leave etl and get a proper data engineering job within next 12 months. Pls try to answer and also give any advice you would give to your younger etl dev brother.",

When something breaks, figuring out what was supposed to be true is not that obvious.\n\nWe just released Soda Core 4.0, an open-source data contract verification engine that tries to fix that by making Data Contracts the default way to define DQ table-level expectations.\n\nInstead of scattered checks and ad-hoc rules, you define data quality once in YAML. The CLI then validates both schema and data across warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, DuckDB, and others.\n\nThe idea is to treat data quality infrastructure as code and let a single engine handle execution. The current version ships with 50+ built-in checks.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/sodadata/soda-core](https://github.com/sodadata/soda-core)  \nRelease notes: [https://soda.io/blog/introducing-soda-4.0](https://soda.io/blog/introducing-soda-4.0)\n\n",

This got even worse once we started doing more self-serve analytics.\n\nSo I built a super simple VSCode extension to solve this. It shows you which columns are being used and which Metabase questions they show up in. Now we know which columns we need to maintain and when we should be careful making changes.\n\nI figured it might help other people too, so I decided to release it publicly as a little hobby project.\n\n* Works with dbt Core, Fusion, and Cloud\n* For Metabase, you'll need the serialization API enabled\n* It works for native and SQL builder questions :) \n\nWould love to hear what you think if you end up trying it!

Also for our specific use case, ML inference is based on client timezones, so inference usually runs between 06:00 and 09:00 local time, but each energy market has regulatory windows that change when they need data by and it is best for us to run the inference closest to the deadline so that the lag is minimized.\n\nInterested in hearing about other data engineers' battle wounds when working with incremental/schedule/timezone conflicts.",

While I currently earn an ok wage (working in the EU and coming from a third world country), I feel like I don’t really see myself working in this line of work forever, and I don’t see strong career/wage progression here.\n\nWhile looking for a possible career shift that could play to my strengths, I stumbled upon analytics engineering/data engineering. A lot of articles and people I’ve read on gave me the impression that it might be possible to break into the field without having a degree specifically in the area (I have a degree in materials science and if my impression of this is wrong then sorry). Btw I basically dont have any programming or analytics background except the limited amount of time I had with Matlab.\n\nMy question is:\n\n1. Do you think this will still be true in the coming years? Considering that I’m currently working full time and can only learn in my spare time after work, I don’t plan to break into DE immediately, as I know that’s basically impossible. But maybe breaking into data analytics or analytics engineering could be more realistic and doable?\n2. I'm currently starting with SQL and then plan on moving to Python, Git, some visualization tools and then dbt and cloud warehouses. Is this a solid plan or are there any other stuffs I should take into account? Any tips on typical mistakes that one can do early in these phase that might hinder/slow down my progress?\n3. What are your best resources for learning and for having a decent roadmap or plan to become a data analyst, analytics engineer, or data engineer? I don’t mind paying for a course if it’s worth it. So far I'm using SQLBolt, w3schools, thoughtspot for their free courses as a start. Are there websites where I can practice writing SQL queries a lot? Any youtubers who make quality videos?\n\nThere is also the worry of AI coming in and disrupting the future job market but that is a topic that probably is gonna derail my questions here so lets skip that for now.\n\nI know no one can really predict what the future will be like, but I’d love to hear perspectives and experiences from people who have been in the industry, or even those just starting out.\n\nThank you for reading and your help!",

For most of 2025, both execution times and monthly costs were very consistent.\n\nThen, starting around mid-November/early December 2025, we noticed a sudden and consistent drop in execution times across multiple Glue 4.0 jobs, which ended up translating into roughly \\~30% lower cost compared to previous months.\n\nWhat’s odd is that nothing obvious changed on our side:\n\n* No code changes.\n* Still on Glue 4.0.\n* No config changes (DPUs, job params, etc.).\n* Data volumes look normal and within expected ranges.\n* The improvement showed up almost at the same time across multiple jobs.\n\nSame outputs, same logic. Just faster and cheaper.\n\nI get that Glue is fully managed/serverless, but I couldn’t find any public release notes or announcements that would clearly explain such a noticeable improvement specifically for Glue 4.0 workloads.\n\nHas anyone else noticed Glue 4.0 jobs getting faster recently without changes? Could this be some kind of backend optimization (AMI, provisioning, IO, scheduler, etc.) rolled out by AWS?

However, the jobs search for data engineering or anyway to get my foot in the door is just… demoralizing. I have a BS in biomedical engineering and an in progress masters in CS and I’m really trying to get into tech because it’s what I enjoy working with, but I have a few questions to people that have been in my shoes before:\n\nWhere are you looking for jobs? Indeed and LinkedIn seem to have jobs that get hundreds of apps it seems like. LinkedIn I just don’t really understand I guess, how do I find places that will actually hire someone junior level that has skills (projects, great self-learner, super driven)? When I do, what are the best approaches for networking? The job search is just kinda melting my brain and there never really is a light at the end of the tunnel until you get an offer. Any words of advice or just general pointers would be greatly appreciated as this makes me feel super incapable of my skills I know I have. ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone! Long-time listener, first-time caller. I have an opportunity to offer some design options to a firm for ingesting data from an IoT device network. The devices (which are owned by the firm's customers) produce a relatively modest number of records: Let's say a few hundred devices producing a few thousand records each every day. The firm wants 1) the raw data accessible to their customers, 2) an analytics layer, and 3) a dashboard where customers can view some basic analytics about their devices and the records. The data does not need to be real-time, probably we could get away with refreshing it once a day.\n\nMy first thought (partly because I'm familiar with it) is to ingest the records into a BigQuery table as a data lake. From there, I can run some basic joins and whatnot to verify, sort, and present the data for analysis, or even do more intensive modeling or whatever they decide they need later. Then, I can connect the BigQuery analytics tables to Looker Studio for a basic dashboard that can be shared easily. Customers can also query/download their data directly.\n\nThat's the basics. But I'm also thinking I might need some kind of queue in front of BigQuery (Pub/Sub?) to ensure nothing gets dropped. Does that make sense, or do I not have to worry about it with BigQuery? Lastly, just kind of conceptually, I'm wondering how IoT typically works with POSTing data to cloud storage. Do you create a GCP service account for each device? Is there an API key on each physical device that it uses to make the requests? What's best practice? Anything really, really stupid that people often do here that I should be sure to avoid?\n\nThanks for your help and anything you want to comment on, I'm sure I'm still missing a lot. This is a fun project, I'm really hoping I can cover all my bases!",

Im not the good data admin so I'm relying on devs team that 'it is what it is' and it's pissing me off because it's ridiculous.\n\nBut my main-main problem is that it's laggy even though we (5 people) are the only data consumers. It will be laggy af when clients will start using it and going above Medium warehouse on dbx will be costly and this cost will be undefendable because ROI will be way too low.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance!

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share a code execution framework/library that I recently published,  called “darl”.\n\n**What my project does:**\n\nDarl is a lightweight code execution framework that transparently provides incremental computations, caching, scenario/shock analysis, parallel/distributed execution and more. The code you write closely resembles standard python code with some structural conventions added to automatically unlock these abilities. There’s too much to describe in just this post, so I ask that you check out the comprehensive README for a thorough description and explanation of all the features that I described above.\n\nDarl only has python standard library dependencies. This library was not vibe-coded, every line and feature was thoughtfully considered and built on top a decade of experience in the quantitative modeling field. Darl is MIT licensed.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe motivating use case for this library is computational modeling, so mainly data scientists/analysts/engineers, however the abilities provided by this library are broadly applicable across many different disciplines.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nThe closest libraries to darl in look feel and functionality are fn\\_graph (unmaintained) and Apache Hamilton (recently picked up by the apache foundation). However, darl offers several conveniences and capabilities over both, more of which are covered in the \"Alternatives\" section of the README.\n\n**Quick Demo**\n\nHere is a quick working snippet. This snippet on it's own doesn't describe much in terms of features (check our the README for that), it serves only to show the similarities between darl code and standard python code, however, these minor differences unlock powerful capabilities.\n\n    from darl import Engine\n    \n    def Prediction(ngn, region):\n        model = ngn.FittedModel(region)\n        data = ngn.Data()              \n        ngn.collect()\n        return model + data           \n                                       \n    def FittedModel(ngn, region):\n        data = ngn.Data()\n        ngn.collect()\n        adj = {'East': 0, 'West': 1}[region]\n        return data + 1 + adj                                               \n    \n    def Data(ngn):\n        return 1                                                          \n    \n    ngn = Engine.create([Prediction, FittedModel, Data])\n    ngn.Prediction('West')  # -> 4\n    \n    def FittedRandomForestModel(ngn, region):\n        data = ngn.Data()\n        ngn.collect()\n        return data + 99\n    \n    ngn2 = ngn.update({'FittedModel': FittedRandomForestModel})\n    ngn2.Prediction('West')  # -> 101  # call to `Data` pulled from cache since not affected \n    \n    ngn.Prediction('West')  # -> 4  # Pulled from cache, not rerun\n    ngn.trace().from_cache  # -> True",

Also, most of the time all you have to do is click on a button and it feels like monkey work to me. I have this feeling that I am not even learning the basics of DE from this job. Do we all agree that foundry is not the good way to start a DE career ?\n\n2. For now the only thing I enjoy about my work is writing pyspark transformations. I would like to take some courses in order to have a good understanding of how spark really works. I am also planning to take a AWS certification this year.

So I am doing that. \n\nTldr: If your repo is public or you are working on frontends - any secrets you hardcode into checked in files ever are compromised and can be used by anyone at your expense. \n\nOnce a secret hits a public repo (github and others), scraper bots will likely grab it within minutes. Removing it from the repo at a later point doesn’t help - git history is trivial to scan. Git is meant to be easily reversible. That goes for your 'chore: delete api key' commit as well. If the key was ever committed to git on a publicly accessible repo, assume it’s compromised.\n\nLikewise, all frontend code runs on the client. Anything in frontend is public. Frontend is never a place for secrets, not even temporarily. If a secret was ever committed there, burn it immediately.\n\nThe only fix is rotating the key on the provider side so the old one stops working and will no longer be accepted. \n\nI know you are very proud about your Ai Chatbot or your Weather App Dashboard or your Smart Home Control.

Maybe we still need to review it, but this technology has only just been born.\n\nHonestly, all of this has left me deeply depressed. It's an emptiness I don't know how to fill.

All I want is to have that energy again, or to go to another area where I can do the same. I tend to become obsessed and dissect everything about a subject, but after 4 years of doing only this, I don't even know where to begin if I were to move on to something else.

        "author": "Loud_Safety_1718",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": ">TLDR: I built a Git course that runs inside your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, and friends), so you learn Git by using it in real dev environment. It's well-designed and illustrated. Link: [https://gitbybit.com](https://gitbybit.com/)\n\n---\n\nHi folks! My name is Alexander Shvets. People know me best as an admirer of raccoons and the creator of Refactoring.Guru.\n\nToday I'd like to show you the project I've been working on for the past two years, it's [GitByBit](https://gitbybit.com).\n\n\n# Who is it for?\n\nThe course will be most helpful for three groups of people:\n\n* **Developers who “use Git” but mostly as a black box.** You know a few commands, but you want to actually understand what you’re doing.\n* **Builders returning to code** (PMs, designers, ex-devs) who now use AI tools for prototypes and internal tools, and need their Git muscles back.\n* **Hobby coders and beginners** who want a practical, confidence-building path from zero to “I can work with Git.”\n\n\n# What makes it different?\n\nI designed [GitByBit](https://gitbybit.com) as a modern way to learn Git (if we can still say so about a project that doesn't use AI, ha-ha). It's story based, you learn about everything gradually, one concept built upon another. This course is also hyper-focused on practice: building muscle memory for commands, using real Git, real IDE tools, etc.\n\nThat's possible because of the unique format: the course is integrated right into your code editor (assuming it's VS Code, Cursor, or any of the clones). It can also be run online via GitHub Codespaces. This format allows it to achieve some pretty cool things:\n\n1. **Real Git, editor and terminal.** You're always using real stuff! Once you finish the course, you're literally one shortcut away (Open New Window, Ctrl+Shift+N) from applying everything you've just learned about Git in your next project.\n2. **Instant feedback.** The course can check the results of your actions, explain errors, suggest workarounds, etc. You don't have to jump between a web page with instructions and the terminal, or search for explanations of cryptic Git errors. It's all in one place.\n3. **Respects your time.** The content is presented in bite-sized chunks, which helps you keep focus and stay engaged. No endless videos you have to sit through. The main course can be completed in one sitting, in an evening.\n4. **Gitopedia.** While progressing through the course, you build your personal in-editor Git reference, unlocking bits of supplemental material: deep dives into concepts, detailed explanations of commands, best practices, etc. These bits go into your personal knowledge base, a thing I called Gitopedia. You can pull up the Gitopedia as a separate tab in the editor, or arrange it to be opened in parallel at all times. It also serves as a map of what you've learned so far.\n5. **Illustrated.** There are cool handmade [illustrations](https://gitbybit.com/blog/0005-illustrations)!\n\n\n# What's covered in the course?\n\nThere are two parts.\n\n**1. The FREE main course, focuses on Git essentials**: things that you need to know to work on your personal projects. Setting up and configuring Git, working with the terminal, the staging area, commits, branches, history, remote repos, etc.\n\nThe course teaches Git in terminal first, but also shows how to achieve the same thing via graphical user interface of the editor.\n\nApart from learning the Git itself, you also get insights on using the terminal effectively (navigating history, using autocomplete, etc.), learn about software release cycle, semantic versioning, licenses, best practices and more.\n\n**2. Optional paid add-on** (extra practice and team workflows; free course stands on its own):\n\n* Selective staging and resetting changes.\n* Different ways to clean up the repo or ignore unwanted changes.\n* A detective scenario where you investigate project crashes using git history and git blame.\n* A deep dive into merging/rebasing branches.\n* And my favorite: the full GitHub pull request workflow, from forking someone's repo to updating it according to the maintainer's demands, and the eventual merge.\n\n\n# Next steps\n\nI'm considering translating the course to several languages, but I'm not sure which ones yet. Spanish, almost certainly. Let me know if you think yours should be in the list.\n\nEnjoy and have fun! ❤️",

Ideally focused on focussed on backend or general programming fundamentals, not just surface level examples.\n\nHas anyone found a platform or course that genuinely helped them learn by doing?

At school the biggest software I handled was only a few files big and not that complex. Now I find myself in the middle of this huge software that is hundreds of files that span multiple products and some files are thousands of lines long. This is has been very overwhelming and It is making it very hard to understand any of this code, I have tried to read through it but it’s some complex and some of the code in places is obfuscated and has complexity on purpose. \n\nMy company is also heavy leaning into copilot so I feel like I’m getting a.i brain where I’m losing my ability to code and debug and solve problems.\n\nAnyway any advice from veteran SWE’s or anyone in the space for me would be greatly appreciated, I’m coming up on 1 year in July and I am scared I’m not where I should be.",

There’s obviously a bit of programming, and the problem is that we barely get any help and it’s constantly way above our level. We have assignments each week. The assignments aren’t very fun either, it’s just ”sort this list using this algorithm” or something like it. So the thing is, I feel like I would like programming a lot more if I didn’t constantly have to do it under pressure and above my own capacity. So are there any small projects I can do to find it more fun and not just something that I have to do? We use Java btw.\n\nEDIT: I’m not planning on becoming a developer/programmer. But since I will have to do programming for at least four years I would like to enjoy it more, that’s all.",

There is no flowchart with infinite branching paths, and there never was. It was ALWAYS a straight road with occasional detours that lead back to the main path!

I also began working with FreeCodeCamp to learn JavaScript. I am still not completely sure about using it for this purpose. The Odin Project is my focus(mainly for the project) and I am trying to figure out if FreeCodeCamp is a good addition, to my learning.\n\n**Progress:** I have covered the basics of HTML and CSS.\n\n**Current status:** I started about 4 days ago. I realize it’s a huge jump compared to HTML/CSS, but I am ready to grind.\n\nMy goal is to be \"job ready\" in about **1 to 1.5 years**.

I am open to starting in France to gain experience, even though I know the french market can be a bit tougher for self-taught devs compared to the UK/US.\n\n**I would like to get some advice:**\n\n* How do you transition from following a curriculum to building projects entirely on your own? I want to make sure I can problem-solve without a guide.\n* What does a \"hirable\" portfolio look like in 2026 ?\n* Am I missing anything crucial in my routine?\n\n\n\n**P.S.

I’ve noticed she zones out quite a lot, but when I gently address it, she denies it. I try to engage her with prompts, guided questions, and encouragement, but I don’t get much back.\n\nAt this point I’m wondering:\n\n* Is this a confidence issue, a foundational gap, or just passive learning?\n* Am I expecting too much too quickly?\n* Would it help to switch to **Python first**, build problem-solving skills and logic, then come back to C#?\n* Or should I slow C# down even more and focus purely on micro-tasks and repetition?\n\nI genuinely want to help her succeed, but I’m feeling stuck and unsure if my approach is right. Any advice from CS teachers, tutors, or devs who’ve seen this before would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

Other than that, either I don’t attend or the lectures don’t happen because the professors don’t take them.\nThe problem is that I feel I waste a lot of time with my friends. After the first lecture, we spend most of our time playing online games like BGMI or FF. They don’t seem very interested in coding, but I already have a little background. I am doing web development and planning to start DSA. I have also done some reverse engineering in apps and a little bit of app development and cybersecurity.\nSpending an hour with them is fine, but when I waste 2–3 hours doing nothing and then go home, I feel like I’ve wasted my day. I have a PC at home, but I feel exhausted by the time I reach home. I always think, why not utilize college time instead of wasting it? But I also feel like my friends should do something productive too.\nOne semester has already passed, and now I’m confused about what I should do.",

        "content": "I've been a floater so far. I've dabbled with a handful of different languages (python, ruby, java, c, c#, js) mostly because I was curious about what this programming thing was all about. My curiosity is growing significantly. I started solving basic problems with some scripting languages (sorting files with python, made some VERY BASIC selenium web automation scripts with java etc) and I really enjoyed it. \n\nI want to take it one billion steps further, however I don't know what direction to take it. In some ways, because I dont know what I don't know - as in there are a lot of programming professional domains that probably exist that I don't even know of. There are lots of languages and learning resources I probably don't know of. (I only know of the few big recommended ones like freecodecamp, odin, cs50 etc)\n\nWith only a few exceptions, I'm pretty open minded to where I want to take this. I want to learn about data structures, algorithms and general design patterns and all the things professional developers eventually grow into. However to WHAT I apply these to? I have no idea. Here's what I know: I have no interest in traditional web development - especially front-end work. I tried to force myself to like it but I can't. (which is kind of a shame, because even traditional desktop applications are essentially getting deprecated in favor of cloud based web apps.)  \n\nThe biggest thing I think I'm mostly looking for is a language or technology stack that a) Has AMPLE resources to help someone go from beginner to contributor in a fairly streamlined fashion, b) interesting open source projects I could eventually try to contribute to and build experience working through the workflow of contributing to a team based project and c) something that has some kind of remote employment culture attached to it. (I live in a very remote part of the world and all current and future employment relies on remote work unless I want to climb an oil rig or hunt polar bears.). <--- stretch super longterm goal / bonus points\n\nThings I am curious about:\n\n* c# / windows desktop application development (whether this is even a thing in 2026 and beyond I have no idea)\n* c and systems / OS level programming (under the hood nuts n' bolts is incredibly interesting. Would love to learn how an OS works, whether it's windows or linux.)\n* MUD's / text based multiplayer games. See /r/mud for what I mean. I think these are interesting learning vehicles to get involved in. They stress OOP, classes, networking and efficiency while also working on what is probably a very legacy codebase. (some of these mud's have been online for 30 years!)\n* the ruby language in general - yeah I know I mentioned webdev as things I don't like, but ruby as a standalone scripting language is a beautiful thing. I would have strong interest in delving way deeper into it. (What are the odds rails devs can get by without giving a crap about the front-end? lol)\n\n\nI'm an older dude, so building dedicated desktop applications initially sounded interesting. (so probably c# .net windows apps in visual studio). I dont know if there's any professional demand for this stuff long term however these days. I'm from the Winamp/ICQ/Napster era so that's where my brain immediately went :D. \n\nI was looking at the TIOBE index for inspiration, but I think all it does is create FOMO so I stopped. Got overwhelming. \n\nAnyways, while I sit in this meeting listening to people blather on about quarterly financials, I thought I'd post this to solicit some ideas or feedback for where I could consider aiming my thirsty brain at. \n\nThanks so much!",

Im a student and I’d like to get some up-to-date opinions on the state of Spring / Spring Boot in 2026 and looking forward, especially regarding job market demand, long-term viability, and industry trends.\n\nI have professional experience with TypeScript, mainly in the modern frontend/backend ecosystem but i felt that the lack of strong structure, the huge dependency ecosystem, and how fast tools and frameworks change can make it easy to feel “lost”, even on medium-sized projects. Because of that, I’m looking to move toward something I think is more serious, structured, and predictable in the long run.\n\nI narrowed my options down to C# (.NET) and Java (Spring / Spring Boot). At first, I was leaning toward C#, partly because several indexes (for example, TIOBE) show C# growing while Java appears stable or slightly declining. I also had the impression that the .NET community is larger and more “welcoming”.\n\nHowever, when I looked at the actual job market, the number of openings requiring Java + Spring (at least in my region and for remote positions) seemed significantly higher so i started learning it.\n\ni Would like to know the point of view of people that works with Spring/Spring boot, things such as:\n\nHow do you see Spring/Spring Boot in 2026 and over the next 5–10 years?\n\nIs it still a solid choice for  backend systems?\n\nDo you see it losing relevance compared to .NET, Node.js, Go, in the long run?\n\nFrom a career perspective, is Java + Spring still a good way to progress?\n\nI’d really appreciate your insights, thanks!",

Any help or resources would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "content": "I've been learning javascript, but not sure if i should do SQL/API, backend learning as well to be a full stack developer. How much more is the pay compared to frontend only? I'm in UK. Is it worth the additional work and stress? There's so many different things to learn when it comes to web development, and I have no idea what to start off with. I feel like javascript is good, I'm 20% way to completing https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-subtraction and am learning a decent amount. What about typescript, python? Which one is best for frontend? Since i think focusing on frontend is best at the start and see how i feel about expanding into backend/fullstack..\n\nI do however have a game's degree in modelling & animation, but there are basically no jobs for games out there, if there are any, it's so hard to get into that I have 0 chance. So I'm unfortunately moving industry. But with a game's degree, and not a computer science degree, which is what i should've gotten, it's going to be so much harder to get a job, isn't it? Considering my degree is more design and art, rather than technical programming as well. Any advise? I genuinely feel bad for 1: doing a shit degree when i should've done computer science and 2: for wasting time on games... When front/back end and fullstack developers make way more money as well from what i've found.,\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nCheers",

I’m currently strengthening areas like authorization (roles/ownership) and some of the “boring but important” parts such as error handling and pagination.\nAt this point, I feel a bit stuck on what the next best step should be. Should I double down on backend by going deeper into more production-oriented concerns like security basics, deployment, logging, and performance? Or is it better to start adding a minimal frontend (for example, React) and build small full-stack projects just to exercise the backend end-to-end?\nAlso, with all the AI hype around lately, it’s hard to tell what actually compounds long-term versus what’s just noise. From your experience, what would you prioritize focusing on next at this stage?\nWould really appreciate your perspective",

I understand HTML and CSS, and I’ve worked with jQuery, Bootstrap, and even Alpine.js (which feels like the closest thing to Angular in terms of mindset). I’m aware of common frontend tools and libraries.\n\nThe problem is this: translating a UI design that I have *in my head* into actual frontend code feels like hitting a wall. With backend work, I’m very comfortable modeling data, writing logic, designing APIs, and structuring systems. But when it comes to building components, structuring state, wiring templates, and making everything feel “right” in a frontend framework, I feel lost and slow.\n\nFor those who also came from a backend-heavy .NET background:\n\n* How did you approach learning Angular (or any modern frontend framework)?\n* What mental shift helped you the most?\n* Did you focus on design, component architecture, or just brute-force building projects?\n* Any specific learning path or advice you wish you had earlier?\n\nI’d really appreciate insights from people who’ve been through this transition.",

        "content": "**TLDR:** Go down to the bottom where the TLDR marker (**TLDR HERE:)** is at and read everything below it.\n\nA little background info. I have a friend who works in the company, and he gave me a list of things to learn to get the job (The list is at the bottom). But unfortunately he only gave me the list and no additional context aside from offering a mock interview after I learned the things he gave me, before he refers me to the company.\n\nI have been trying to learn how to code for 5 years, and I am still not able to complete a project from start to finish. I feel like am an amateur at best.\n\nI started off learning C++ in college, but it's been years since I have programmed in C++ and I was never good at it in the first place. I was also trying to learn Python on my own, and I was  playing around with Flutter/Dart, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and local LLMS. Recently I have been practicing Python and I enrolled in the LangChain academy course for LangGraph. I really don't like the course because they briefly go over concepts and provide no quizes or practice problems or anything like that to really be able to apply what is being taught independently.\n\nI was able to get the basics of LangGraph down, but after that I was introduced to a bunch of different concepts, and it became really difficult to continue the course because they don't explain why you need to know certain things, why you would do this over that, when do you do this, etc. I had to ask AI for further clarifications on the lessons, and to create me projects to complete based on the lessons. This was doable for the basics, but as more things were introduced I was spending more time design and prompting the AI for the optimal project to complete than actually learning LangGraph. This was because as we all know AI is not reliable for programming, and I was worried about it was teaching me the wrong things as it keeps having me do stuff that are not covered in the lessons and a bunch of other bullshit.\n\nSo I eventually quitted the course and started doing what I can do, which is going back to the fundamentals of Python. I think having a solid foundation would not be a waste of time. I have halfway completed the Free Code Academy certificate course for Python. I know certificates are BS these days, but I'm just taking it for the content and I like how I'm given quizes, tests, workshops, labs, and projects to complete to really apply what I have learned and be able to program on my own.\n\n**TLDR HERE:**\n\nBut I don't know what to do after the Python course. I feel so overwhelmed with all the stuff I was given to learn. It feels like I was given a list of tools to build a house or a car and there is a bunch of information on how to use these tools, but there is no guidance or instructions on how to use all of these tools to build a house or a car. I am left to figure that out on my own. I feel like this is wrong and that there should be more support and instructions from start to end and nothing is to be skipped.\n\nSo that's why I'm making this post on how to learn this stuff to be good enough to get hired. I know I can do this, but I feel like I am not given the proper opportunity/resources to do this.\n\nThis is the stuff I was given:\n\n* LangGraph - Note: Be able to create a workflow editor, human in the loop is very important.\n* LangChain \n* MCP servers\n* Agents \n* Fast API (back end)\n* React \n* Next.js \n* RAG\n* Redis (scaling)\n\nOther questions I have that I tried asking my friend:\n\n* How do you know if someone knows there shit or not?\n* What are you (my friend) and the people hiring/doing the interview looking for someone like me? They're going to ask me questions and stuff and look at my online profiles and resume. What do they want to find?\n* How do I get to the point where I can confidently prove that I am ready for the job and have mastered these concepts.",

Meaning understanding fundamentals and ensuring you're understanding every step you're taking, like when probing Claude with 50+ questions about how tf a pointer works and why it works.\n\nBut it's kind of confusing to make sense of the idea of how you're supposed to get to the point of being able to score an internship by maybe your second or third year. Especially nowadays, when they ask for more experience in stuff like Docker, AWS, etc., etc.\n\n**I guess the question is:** Is it possible to get into SWE when you're just starting to learn to code in your first year of college?

I feel really envious of people I knew at Amazon that got to actually establish longevity there over the course of 5+ years (hell, even 1-2 yrs), when I couldn’t even make it to 1. Most of the people that I see are software engineers well..still are. Either that or they’ve never gotten laid off. I’m really worried that I’ll end up having to career pivot or work minimum wage. Does anyone happen to have advice, by any chance?\n\nEdit: To clarify, the applications were sent starting mid-December in anticipation.",

I was already employed, so I was searching pretty casually and really only taking interviews for things that sounded interesting.\n\nI had a couple requirements in my search, so I generally rejected anything that didn't meet these.\n\n* Remote preferred, would have been willing to relocate, but would have have to be for a big tech like offer.\n* Needed to be a base of 180-190+.\n* Preferred public companies\n* Tech, or at least tech forward company\n* I generally reject any take home tests\n\nGeneral Info (This is all a bit rough number's wise, I didn't keep super exact metrics):\n\n* 30 cold applications -> \\~10 of which turned into initial HR interviews\n* Around 45 recruiter reachouts that I thought might be promising -> I rejected over half of those for various reasons.\n* Got Hiring Manager rejected from about 10, not sure on the exact ratio of cold applications to recruiter reachouts there.\n* Went to 15 tech screens, general mix of LC and more general coding tests.\n* I didn't do any prep at all, so I failed quite a few there and ended up taking 4 onsites.\n* Failed 2 onsites, got 1 offer frozen, and accepted the last offer which I just started\n\nNotes:\n\nThe general interview process/difficulty was about the same as I have experienced in the past.  I had a general mix of leetcode like questions and more general coding questions.  The offer I accepted asked mostly LC style questions, though there were more practical questions asked as well.\n\nHM's seem to be more picky and quick to reject.  I've never really not gotten through to a tech screen from an HR screen, and I got HM rejected a few times over this process.\n\nI hope this might be helpful to anyone during their search.  Let me know if you have any questions!\n\n\\--\n\nSnakey Diagram: [https://i.imgur.com/DkOIVim.png](https://i.imgur.com/DkOIVim.png)\n\n  \nEdit:\n\nEnded up at a fully remote company.

Im right at the finish line, I can finally rest knowing i worked my ass off to get away from the shitty work situation i had previously and I can start working in a new domain, new interesting tech for more money. i feel like i did exactly what i set out to do.\n\nI’m not in interview form, haven’t touched systems design or DSA in months. I had the recruiter call, told them i have an active offer, and they said they’re accelerating the interview timeline cuz of that. Given all that, i’m probably gonna bomb this first round technical algorithms interview i just scheduled.\n\nBut, when a tier 1 company calls like this i know you have to pick up the phone. i know this is a rare opportunity. i’ve never interviewed for a company with this much “prestige” either. Football analogy: I’ve been playing for West Ham, I got an offer to play for Liverpool, but now Real Madrid is calling.\n\nSo: is it even worth interviewing ? even if i think im just gonna flop big time. Should i just let them know that id love to keep in contact and that this is unfortunate timing? Do i only get one shot at this ? why do i imagine that this is like life or death like im gonna get black listed at Databricks if i fail this right now. Or do i put my head down and grind my life out for these next couple weeks, potentially get an offer, and have to go through the messy rescinding and all that. I’m just lost on what I should do. I just feel like i deserve to just chill out. But i feel like i can’t catch a break.\n\nI’m painfully aware that this is an extremely privileged and amazing problem to have. i’m aware that the worst they can say is no, and i learn from the experience and i just have another job lined up anyway. But I just wanna know what others would do. Just given the context of being out of interview form and just needing a break from the countless weeks spent practicing studying and interviewing.\n\nInterview or don’t interview.\n\n**Edit**: straight up, this is lowkey one of those anxiety fueled posts where you just need validation lmao. at least myself 5 hours ago did. i’m ready for them to give me an NP hard problem and call it a day 🫩🤙",

What would you recommend learning if the goal is becoming a stronger engineer and setting myself up well for promotions and long-term success?\n\nWould love any suggestions from people who have leveled up quickly or from senior engineers and hiring managers. Thanks!\n\nPS - preferably structured courses like udemy I feel like i’ll stay more motivated if it’s structured. ",

        "content": "Man, I’m feeling cooked and shitting bricks and could use some real talk. I’ve never been so stressed until now. Been at a bank since Aug 2020 right out of college. Spent \\~4.5 years as a Data Warehouse Dev/Architect doing architecture, pipelines, ETL, querying, reporting — stuff I’m actually good at.\n\nIn March 2025 I internally transferred into an Observability platform role to upskill and mainly cus I was underpaid on my old role. I was very upfront in interviews(with my manager, tech lead and architect) that I didn’t have deep experience in their tech stack, but they still hired me cus they liked me and gave me \\~30% base bump.\n\nBefore applying I spoke to my skip and I was told I’d be doing architecture, data onboarding, detection/alerting, reporting, optimization. Reality: it’s a ton of platform admin + production fire-fighting. Constant ops, constant pressure, and not what I naturally thrive in.\n\nThe team lives in reactive mode. Seniors help when I ask, but they’re overloaded, so real mentorship barely exists. I still get work done, but the environments are complex and full of dependencies outside my control, so some stories roll across sprints. I even took the training courses they recommended when I joined, and somehow that annoyed the scrum master because it slowed delivery.\n\nYear-end review came back Meets/Meets, but here’s the kicker: my current manager is retiring and the scrum master becomes my new manager. That’s what’s making me lose sleep. His feedback: deliver faster, work more independently, stop leaning on seniors, pick up “harder” tasks, no multi-sprint rollovers. He literally called some of my work “protective tasks” and said anyone should be able to pick up any story.\n\nHad a recent 1:1 two days ago where scrum master(new manager)he basically said, “Now that you’ll be reporting to me, I have expectations.” Faster output, constant upskilling, more ownership. None of that is crazy, but the tone felt like a spotlight got turned on me overnight. I’m the only junior internal hire on the team and I already feel the difference in how he treats contractors vs me. It feels less like coaching and more like evaluation.\n\nHonestly? It feels like the early stages of a PIP setup: watch closely, raise the bar, document gaps, then decide.\n\nThe problem is also fit. Long term, I don’t want to be a platform admin or ops firefighter. I’m way better at architecture, data pipelines, analytics engineering, ETL, and strategy. This role is draining me mentally and killing my confidence.\n\nSo now I feel like the clock started and I got 6 months until mid year.On one hand, I can grind, overdeliver, and try to survive under the new manager. On the other, I should probably start aggressively interviewing and pivot back into data engineering / warehouse roles before this turns ugly.\n\nThe area of solace I have is I’ve got financial runway if shit hits the fan (have $710k NW) but I don’t want to waste months proving myself in a role I don’t even want.\n\n1)How do you tell if stricter expectations are normal vs quiet PIP prep?\n\n2)If you sense the clock started, do you grind harder or job hunt immediately?\n\n3)Anyone here move from platform/ops back into DE/warehouse successfully?\n\n4)What would you actually do if you were me?\n\nAppreciate any real answers.\n\nTL;DR: Internal transfer into observability platform role turned into ops/admin + firefighting. New manager coming in, raising expectations, feels like spotlight/PIP risk. Role mismatch + stress. Grind to survive or start interviewing now?\n\nYOE: 5.5\n\nAge: 27\n\nSalary: $145k\n\nNW: $710k",

I tried scrambling for another but with finals approaching and anyone who could help me being unavailable because of again COVID or being to busy preparing for finals as well I was SoL.\n\nI graduated, hoping that maybe later on I could get another internship once things settled down but with my payments quickly starting, having no car of my own and about $2000 in my bank I had to move back in with my parents.\n\nI have a local job as a casino cashier that I've been working for about 4 years now, things are stabilizing and I have all my non federal student debt paid off and a decent vehicle of my own now. I have been thinking about my degree and how I've stagnated by not working for 4 years straight and basically not done any practice or studying either, its been to busy and hectic for me to focus on that especially with a volatile home life to deal with.

I'm almost considering going back to college because I was also supposed to graduate for CS in my program but had to focus on Web because of funds running out.\n\nAny advice on where to go at this point is appreciated, whether I should to to recover and pursue a career in web developing, go back for a year to get a CS degree (that's about how many credits I need), or perhaps try a different career all together?",

Its mostly legacy PHP work, how ever I have introduced microservices for the first time written in python as well as worked with a contractor to develop a RAG AI support bot and have just kind of found myself being our AI guy because I mentioned I made a Gemini wrapper discord chatbot once.  I have also developed several features by my self end to end. I am interested in leaving because of lack of an structure (no code reviews, no QA, no year end reviews, no yearly raises, no mentorship) and I am just not learning anymore at my job.  \n  \n  \nI have a pretty decent project portfolio since I code for a hobby to outside of work. A year ago I also made a AI chatbot discord bot using Chroma DB for RAG and some other features like sentiment analysis for relationship changes, which has 10k users and 1 paying users, I also have a homelab I practice some skills on like managing a k3s cluster, which i use for pretty standard things like Prometheus/Grafana, OpenWebUI, headlamp and some other services I use. I also have been exploring AI tooling mainly with OpenWebUI and have one of the highest rated tool on their community, a K8s monitor I made to experiment with tooling the the Kubernetes python library,  though it is a small community so that might be irrelevant. I also am in the process of teaching myself rust now and I have been working on Leetcode. I've also got a couple more small projects in the works i wont detail but I am using them to learn more Typescript, React, and FastAPI. \n\nFor someone like me how would I job search be? I haven't done one since the end of college and I don't really have any friends in this space to talk to it about so from my little bubble I am unsure how qualified I really am and was wondering how a job search for someone like me might go and anything I can do to improve my odds.",

They don’t actually reflect skill levels, and hiring managers tend not to actually care about them once the interview process begins.\n* View B: They’re a measure of general competency and a candidate’s willingness to put in effort to learn. They’re a tiebreaker when other qualifications are roughly equivalent.\n\nFor people who have experience hiring or interviewing software engineers:\n\n* Do AWS/Azure/GCP certifications actually factor into your hiring decisions at all?\n* What level of career progression do you think certifications become irrelevant to hiring or consideration, or do they remain relevant no matter what?\n* Have you seen any correlation between certification holders’ performance on the job?\n* If you had two candidates that were comparable in terms of experience, would a cert ever be the deciding factor?\n\nI’m not asking if certs are a good tool for learning.

        "content": "So, I graduated about a year and a half ago, coming up on 2 years now. Trying to break into the CS job market has felt like a complete anomaly to me. For the first while I was putting out applications left and right, though I have admittedly slowed down and tried making fewer but more tailored applications. This strategy has at least lead to a few interviews, even making it to second stage interviews. Alas though, still ending in rejection.\n\nIn the meantime I have managed to get a job at a local place with benefits and worked my way up in the past few years. While the pay isn't great and doesn't pay nearly enough to move out of my parents house, its enough income that I can afford car bills and paying chunks off of my (relatively small) student loans. Thank god for scholarships.\n\nThe root of my problem though is that I'm losing motivation in the job hunt, I feel like I didn't truly understand what I was getting into going in CS. Originally I started college for Phys/Astro which was something I was extremely passionate about. Unfortunately I faced serious burnout in my courses and dealt with a pretty rough episode of depression coming fresh out of the COVID era. While I was able to keep up a nice GPA I was absolutely miserable. Then I discovered programming for the first time through some of my courses!\n\nI finally found a new thing that I was passionate about and enjoyed doing, I love math, I love applying concepts learned in tangible ways and programming felt like that to me. Sadly though I didn't really understand the scope of what I was getting into, I just saw the fun new things I was learning because learning has always been one of my favorite things to do. Now I'm sat here just having turned 25 last week with absolutely no idea what to do next. I've had to move a bit over an hour from my girlfriend and friends because I can't afford to live in the area I consider home anymore.  \n\n\nI've considered pivoting to something new but attending \\*more\\* school really just isn't in the cards for me at the moment besides potentially some night classes at my local community college. Even then I'm not sure what I'd pivot too and I don't want to do the blind rush into something like I did last time since that's what got me into this mess. Many of my favorite things that I believe I would enjoy as a career don't pay nearly enough to live comfortably with the economy (US) being what it is right now and things don't appear to be changing positively.\n\nI guess my question then is just, where do I even go from here? I feel like there are both 100 directions and absolutely none. I'm sitting in a dead end hole that I dug in the middle of an open field with no clear way out.",

My recommendation is to pick a general engineering one and a more niche technical one (e.g. SHPE + Robotics or NSBE + Cybersecurity)\n\n> **Note**: If you attend school online or your school does not have active clubs, you still need to network with people in person. Look for local tech meetups for your chosen programming language, tech stack, or the local makerspace. Pick 2 and show up often and be active\n\n* Pick 1 programming language and follow an in-depth tutorial or book such as Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, or a Learn GO with Tests\n* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it\n* Make a resume and a LinkedIn profile\n\n## Freshman -> Sophomore Summer\n* Get a part-time job, anything will do\n* Practice more for your chosen programming language\n\n## Sophomore Year\n* Be more active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). Join event committees, help setup at events and show up frequently to events. Aim for a leadership position when elections are next held\n* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects\n* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it\n* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. By the end of sophomore year you should have on your resume:  a part-time job, some relevant coursework, 1-3 programming languages and some technologies, and active participation in a student organization\n* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely (slacks, a dress shirt and dress shoes can be had at Walmart). Take 5 - 10 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. The point is to get accustomed to talking to professionals\n\n## Sophomore -> Junior Summer\n* If you got an internship, congratulations you are ahead of the curve. If not get a part-time job, anything will do\n* Fill in gaps as necessary (Git, SQL, basic cloud stuff, HTML & CSS, Unix CLI, basic networking)\n* By now you should have taken a Data Structures and Algorithms class. Time to start LeetCode. You don't have to go too crazy if you are consistent. Pick 2 days a week for ~1 hr:\n    * **Day 1**: Watch an instructional video, attempt a problem, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution\n    * **Day 2**: Attempt a problem (30 mins for Easy, 45 mins for Medium, 1 hr for Hard). If you can't solve it in time, watch the solution video, then write the code for the solution. If you have more time, attempt another problem\n    * **Repeat**: Continue with Day 2 until you run out of problems on a topic. Then start again on the next topic from Day 1\n  \n  Check out NeetCode 250 for a list of problems organized by type, ordered from least to most difficult, with solutions\n\n## Junior Year\n* Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s), hopefully this time in a leadership position. Try to get a leadership position during officer elections\n* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects. Take resumes and be dressed decently (clean shirt and pants with no holes). Recruiters sometimes do interviews\n* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it\n* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile. Make sure to have a professional headshot. Obtain 500 connections by the end of the year. Add folks in you classes, in your student orgs, and at hackathons\n* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely. Take 10 - 30 printed copies of your resume with you and make it your goal to hand out all of them to recruiters. You NEED an internship this upcoming summer\n* If you have the money, go to a national conference so you can try to get an internship (e.g. SHPE, NSBE, Grace Hopper, WICSE, IEEE, etc). Dress nicely, take resumes, add people on LinkedIn\n* Start looking for internships in August. The goal is to get out 2+ applications out EVERY day. Don't just apply in your city, apply nationally\n\n## Junior -> Senior Summer\n* Do your internship and do it well. Dress nicely, ask questions, do your best work, add folks on LinkedIn. You are trying to get a return offer\n\n## Senior Year \n* Be active in the same 1 - 2 club(s). If you already had 1+ leadership positions feel free to take a break this year if you like. If you have not gotten a leadership position and you have not had 1+ internships you NEED to have a leadership position senior year\n* Go to 2+ hackathons and work on projects. Take resumes and be dressed decently (clean shirt and pants with no holes). Recruiters sometimes do interviews\n* Keep up your GPA as best as you can. Make a regular study schedule and stick to it\n* Update your resume and a LinkedIn profile\n* Keep up the LeetCode\n* Go to your schools careers fair if they have one. Dress nicely.

        "content": "Recruiting sucks right now, but the most recent problems aren’t directly impacting the people searching for jobs. It has never been easier to automatically apply for positions with completely made-up resumes created by AI for a specific job. Hiring managers are pulling their hair out as they waste time interviewing people who made up their skills, interviewing people who try to use AI to answer interview questions and even completely different workers showing up for the first day of work than the one who was interviewed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is an opportunity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHiring managers do not want to go through this, and by far the easiest way to be sure a person who is applying for a job is real is to actually know this person. It has never been a better time to talk to people in real life rather than just hitting apply on an application that already had 50 people apply.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nImportant note: The initial reaction to this may be fear that you are making people uncomfortable or imposing. 95% of the time this isn’t true. People like being helpful and if they can’t help they will forget about you the next day. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere are the three paths I would take in order of how serious you are in a job search. If you are unemployed do all three.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Go to industry events. Talk to everyone. One of the main points of presenting at industry events is to find talent. They exist so that they can find you. Ask everyone if they have anything open. This is especially true if you are early in your career. People with experience like helping people. It makes them feel powerful and important. Don’t stalk or pester anyone obviously, but you can ask if there are openings and if so what the best way is for people to see your resume to everyone.\n\n* Call up recruiters. Ask them about jobs they have open you are interested in. I want to emphasize that recruiters make money *by finding people jobs* calling them up is exciting! Not only are you a real person who has read the job description before applying, you also have another leg up in that you are showing you are proactive. Proactive is good. Proactive people are likely to be good at their job and thus make the recruiter the most money possible. My first job out of college was from this about 10 years ago. I asked specifically about a job, they said no you aren’t a good fit for that one, but how about this other one? Immediately was interviewed and hired.\n* Cold call/message/write to people who are managers for positions being advertised. This is the hardest one and potentially the scariest. It is going to be hard to figure out who you should be contacting and you could be completely wrong. There are two things you have going for you though: \n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. It’s pretty much impossible to annoy people from one polite message. If you are polite and there is nothing the person can do, they are probably just going to delete your message and move on with their day. They will forget you exist an hour later. If somehow your polite message offended them, they never ever were someone you wanted to work for anyways. Dodged a bullet.\n2. Managers absolutely cannot find anyone right now. I work with so many teams that have perpetual openings that just cannot be filled because everyone being interviewed is terrible. Any sort of lifeline is exciting. Maybe this will be the person that stops them from wasting hours every week in pointless interviews.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGood luck out there. You got this.",

The way it was built wasn't very robust. The previous developer used a bunch of technologies that they were not familiar with, and it's very messy. I was not aware of the state of this project when they hired me. It took me about a month to get set up because there was no one to onboard me; I basically had to figure everything out on my own, and there were some really niche things about the system that weren't documented properly. Actually, their entire documentation is a mess and not very helpful. It also took like 3 weeks for them to give me access to everything I needed.\n\nI've been stuck on a few issues for months, and it's driving me insane. These issues are direct symptoms of how the system was built. Initially, the system worked fine, but the way it was built is now causing a bunch of long-term problems to arise. I'm trying my best, but as soon as I fix one thing, another issue pops up. My boss and our clients don't really understand this, and they basically blame me for everything. I feel so overwhelmed right now. I've been trying my best, but I feel like it's not good enough. I've been working through nights and on weekends to try to resolve these issues, but it's like an endless cycle because more issues keep popping up. They also want me to do a full QA assessment every time I test, and that takes time.\n\nI've tried to explain to my boss that I'm just one person and that there is only so much I can do, but he doesn't care. They basically want me to do the job of an entire team while paying me below average for what a developer makes. I also mentioned to my boss that we should hire another developer or a consultant to help with the workload, and he told me that in order to do that, they would have to cut my salary by at least 45%. By their logic, they hired me to do a job, and if I need extra help to do that job, then it's going to have to come out of my pay. I'm trying my very best, but they make me feel like I'm incompetent and that I'm not even trying at all. They told me that I should be able to do this and more. I am actually questioning my skills right now. I don't know if I'm just a bad developer or if I'm being gaslighted by them.",

Just about every popular platform, and I try to search for fresh/unpopular listings.\n   * Remote, where I live, or where I'd like to live, ideally.\n\nCurrently in Midwest US\n\n* Not sure which employers/job titles to pursue outside of \"Software Engineer\"\n* Had the best success with this so far, in touch with a contractor that keeps attempting to put my name in for bids on Aerospace jobs\n* Had the best success with this so far, in touch with a contractor that keeps attempting to put my name in for bids on Aerospace jobs\n\nIt just feels like nothing is working, and while I might luck out at some point, I'd really like to do whatever I can to increase my odds as quickly as possible and not burn through all of my emergency savings.\n\nThat leaves me with these questions:\n\n1. **Is there anything I can do better about my job search practices? Any way to more easily narrow down better-matching jobs outside of manual searches?**\n2. **Are there any uncommon tips anyone has used that have really helped them?**\n3. **Is there anything to do in my free time that I should prioritize to increase my hireability?

Or require more people skills / less high-level coding?**\n5. **Best practices to stay disciplined and sane?** Hundreds of rejection emails do take a toll\n\n**TLDR:** Mid-level SWE, can't find a job, feel tied down to niche Aerospace experience/not great at coding. Could really use advice to increase my job prospects or find a new field.\n\nAny feedback is **very** appreciated. Best of luck to everyone else here that's still looking!",

        "content": "Hi everyone! I’m early in my career and currently working as a Software Engineer at Apple. I’m enjoying the role so far, but I’ve been thinking a lot about long-term career direction and what “success” looks like in CS.\n\nOne big thing is that I don’t think I want to be coding and staying super technical forever. I can see myself moving toward more leadership, product, or business-focused work over time, but I’m not sure what path makes the most sense.\n\nMy parents are strongly encouraging me to pursue an MBA, especially if I can get into a top program like an M7. I’m open to it, but I’m not sure if it’s actually worth it given I’m already in a strong SWE position, and I don’t want to do it just because it sounds prestigious.\n\nI’m trying to understand what career paths realistically make sense from here, and what the day-to-day work looks like in those paths.\n\nIf you’re already a SWE at a top company, when does an MBA actually make sense? For people who did a top MBA after SWE, what roles did you end up in and did it feel worth it? What does the day-to-day look like compared to SWE? Is the MBA mainly useful for switching careers, accelerating leadership growth, or networking?\n\nI’d also love to hear about salary differences. For roles people transitioned into after MBA (or without an MBA), what are typical salary ranges compared to staying on the SWE/technical track? Is there an average uplift people see after a top MBA?\n\nAlso, should I be thinking about job security long term if I’m not trying to stay technical forever? If you were in my shoes, what would you focus on in the next 1 to 3 years to set yourself up well?\n\nI’d really appreciate any honest perspectives, especially from people who’ve been in big tech and/or did the MBA route. Thank you!",

I've tried to think over about what I've been missing to improve, but it's something that I think I could not handle it.\n\nMy experience is not relevant that I want. I stated working with Drupal to build a document management system with Drupal 7. This project was a nightmare because it was built by interns. There were not a senior engineer who taught and coordinated software architecture.\n\nIn two years, we did not use Git as well as we wanted. Each guy had his own repository and there was a main repository to version the flagship product. You know, we broke distributed version concept. Maybe Linux Torvalds hates us ha ha ha.\n\nMy second job was as software implementer in industry automation. I hate this area, it's so outdated of IT reality. I was working with a Scada Platform to build a OEE meter. This is worst project ever. Reductant code, spaghetti code, and overengineering were main problems there.\n\nI spent two years of my life in that company. Now, I have over 4 years of work experience, but they are no relevant to say I am full-stack developer.\n\nI sent my CV to several companies. Some companies failed, another ones I passed but manager/team lead said no because they thought my experience was not relevant. They said me you have never used CI/CD or Agile frameworks, maybe you skills are sharpen, but your soft skills are low because you always work alone.\n\nI think they are right. However, I do not know what I can do for solve it. If I send my CV to junior jobs, I am overqualified. If I send it to mid-level they rejected me because I do not have relevant experience. Also, If I have luck and they led me to participate in the process, The manager is going to reject me because I do not have real experience in the area.\n\nI am a loop. I am overqualified for some jobs, but in others, i am underqualified.\n\nP.S. My english is not my mother language. So, maybe I made a lot of grammar mistakes.\n\nI wanted to attach my CV, but it's not possible. So, I left this [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1qntvaz/i_want_a_honest_cv_review/)",

I have built my own applications and am working on my own web project nowadays. I do get a lot of help from GPT and stuff as I feel it is accelerating my development, but even before GPT I was doing alright I suppose.\n\nA few days ago I had a live-coding interview. I think I totally bombed it, and it was kind embarrassing to not know how to make a fetch call in a React context (I hate React, btw). I had spent days preparing using TypeScript, sending requests, setting up a little sever using Python / Node to send simple requests, but then I had to do this one thing in a React context during the test. Also, I was fumbling a bit; like not being careful where I needed to use GET or POST, etc. In the end when I got stock, the interviewer said that he probably had a good understanding by then, and then we closed the call.\n\nI'm honestly just trying to figure out whether I should continue on this path. I love coding, truly. I can sit for hours trying to solve problems. I don't write super complex syntax like a pro, but I get the job done. I never had a formal education in CS, but have been mostly self-taught and learning along the way.\n\nI hope some of you could help me clear my head on where I should go.

I have:\n\n\\- Placement on a 4-year part-time Comp Sci & Ai Degree at Birkbeck University starting in October, attending 2 x 6-9pm classes a week from Mon - Fri **(Shows my long-term commitment and dedication to the field)**\n\n\\- CompTIA A+ I am studying for and expect to be finished by the end of March **(Shows basic aptitudes and foundations of IT)**\n\n\\- Home labs and projects to be uploaded to GitHub, as I am doing some independent learning on KodeKloud by end of April **(Shows independent drive and examples of self-study)**\n\n\\- 8 years working in hospitality management, 9 months as an account exec. in an advertising agency, and 2.5 years working as a freelance graphic and web designer creating assets for small clients, independents and hospitality venues **(Strong soft skills and proof of continuous working attitude)**\n\nI have always had a love of technical problem-solving because of my strong sense of step-by-step analytical thinking (which I sometimes attribute to my heavy OCD). I've always tried to create a strong sense of structure and organisation within systems in whatever role I've been working in, regardless of the industry, and found myself being drawn to IT/Tech because of the way my brain works and enjoys the nature of work.\n\nEventually, I'd love to move into Cloud/DevOps and be responsible for the stability of networks within an organisation, and after my degree, I'd like to pursue an Integrated Machine Learning Systems Master's at UCL to expand my knowledge and skills to move into MLOps at some point in the future. Hoping to make a meaningful contribution to an industry where my mind seems to be suited for possibly becoming an innovator in the field, or assisting teams with making major advancements in Machine Learning in an Engineering role, possibly even with embodied Ai when robotics begins to become more prevalent in society from 2030 onwards.\n\nI possess a strong sense of emotional intelligence, the ability to present and communicate with stakeholders in non-technical terms, and a proven ability to work with and effectively manage teams of others. These traits are proven in my previous work experience as a freelance designer and my years in hospitality management, working in some of the top venues in London.\n\nSome questions:\n\nWhat should I avoid doing?  \nWhat can I highlight from my candidate profile?   \nIs there anything else I should do to strengthen my profile?  \nIs this enough for me to apply for entry-level IT jobs in help desk or other role?  \nWhat kind of salary can I expect to receive in my first role? I had a minimum bar of 26k, but would ideally like to get 28k+  \nHow would progression look over the next 3 years as I self-study and study for my part-time degree",

This is my 2nd job as a software engineer, my first role was in a factory, and it is more of a IT support role for their internal web software. Background of me, i have degree in electrical engineering and i am a bootcamp career switcher into SWE.\n\nIn my previous role, there was no SDLC going on and most of the work is user requested bug fix or small feature improvements, and it was mainly recorded on excel sheets. There was no sprints, scrum or whatever, and i am usually the only person working on the code. Now i have changed company due to the previous one being slightly outdated, and this new company is alot more modern. They have 2 week sprints and work in agile team with daily standup, and have alot of SWE working on the same app. I am taken aback by the amount of tasks there is, and the very strict protocols about resolving tickets, sprints, proper SDLC, git branching and merging, and code reviews. \n\nNow i am feeling some imposter syndrome, not sure if i will be able to fully contribute independently to the work. I know some people will say, you passed the interview so the company know your level before selecting you. But it doesnt help that almost all the engineers in the team are senior with CS degrees and know indepth what they are doing, and i am feeling lost all the time. It has been a few days since i started, this imposter syndrome is getting to me and affecting me at work slightly, making me doubt myself all the time.\n\nIs this normal? Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with it?",

        "content": "So I’m coming to the end of my bachelor's in CS from WGU and have a decision to make. For context, this is where I’m at.\n\nI’m 24. I have an associate's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from a local community college, which helped kickstart my career as an automation engineer. For those who aren’t familiar, an automation engineer, in my case, is responsible for the automation of manufacturing equipment. I’m way oversimplifying here, but the job entails developing and troubleshooting specialized controllers that typically use non-traditional programming languages. Principles remain largely the same, so there is definitely a huge skill overlap between programming and the ever-growing need for more advanced computer systems for control and data acquisition in manufacturing. Today, I have about 8 years of full-time industry experience (4 as an engineer) and am almost finished with my bachelor's in CS from WGU.\n\nI started my CS program at WGU to check a promotion box in my current career. Still, I've always had a nagging fantasy of moving into a software engineering position or a similar role. With that in mind, what would be the wisest choice for me for a master's program?\n\nWGU affords me time, which is very important to me right now. My current position demands a lot of my time, and I never know when I might get called in to work. I am 24/7 on-call site support and the lead for my team, which means even on my “off” weeks, I’m still supporting the juniors. It’s a lot. \n\nOMSCS appears to be a much more rigorous workload AND schedule, but carries much more prestige. My main question is for folks who are already in the software engineering field. How much does that prestige matter for \\*me\\*? Do you feel my experience is relevant enough, or would I be filtered out immediately? I’m currently making around 105k base in an MCOL city, but am also worried about starting pay. I will be receiving a roughly \\~7% raise this year and expect around \\~10-15% the following year with a promotion. That puts my base at about 125k by the time I assume a master's program would wrap up. Would I be shooting myself in the foot by expecting a significant pay drop to make this transition happen?\n\nI’m hoping someone else has been through a similar path, but I’ve found my situation to be pretty unique and am struggling to find good resources as I don’t have a single connection within the tech industry.

While I am beyond grateful and happy to have achieved this goal of mine I’m feeling confused and lost.\n\nI am on a small team of developers in a large company where I have one other dev who works directly on my area of focus: we are the backend team of a large application development team. I assumed this would be my go to person/senior. However this person does not give me tasks or really communicate with me at all. If I ask questions they answer them, but they delegate nothing to me nor have they taken anytime to explain how our services work-basically our only communication we have is if I reach out with a question. I am okay with working independently and figuring things out but it feels super weird to sit in silence and to wonder what I should be doing besides familiarizing myself with our codebases.\n\nI finally managed to suggest something small to do to them, add some additionally error handling to an api + some unit tests and they just said go ahead and submit a PR and I’ll review. The PR hasn’t been reviewed yet after 4 days. \n\nI have a manger that is the manger for the whole dev team but not technical, and he told my priorities should be getting api x working, which it is and then to begin work on brand new service.\n\nWe don’t use JIRA or anything of the sort either. Has anyone been in a situation like this before? Am I being paranoid as it’s still so early into my new job? Any advice would be appreciated!",

I’ve got about \\~3 years of experience, and I’ve been working as a full stack developer on a DoD project, so I do have an active security clearance (secret level).\n\nI started as a campus hire making $65k for this big defense consulting company, and after a few raises I’m at $79k now. No bonus though (my company doesn’t pay bonuses at my current level, which is some BS...). Also no promotion so far as they keep saying the market is bad, even though the company used to promote campus hires within 2 years just a few years before. I’ve been basically fully remote the whole time, which has been the best part about this job honestly.\n\nBut yeah… things are getting worse. They’ve been slowly cutting people, and now they just eliminated our entire team (the project is going to end some time in February), so we’re basically being told we need to find other projects internally. I’m definitely not quitting without something lined up, and I’ve already started sending my internal resume to other teams inside the company. But at the same time, I feel like I should start looking outside too since i feel i can get paid more if i switch jobs...\n\nSo I’m curious, how’s the cleared job market right now? I’m currently living in a MCOL city, and I’m willing to relocate if the company offers relocation assistance. I know the job market overall is pretty rough right now.

Basically to sum it up, I just graduated with a bachelors in CS with a focus on video games, but my curriculum was very disappointing and barely actually focused on game development. I didn’t get a single internship throughout my entire experience in university because the vast majority of them were for cybersecurity students and none of them were related to what I wanted to be doing. My classes also burned me out on coding and made me lose my passion for it. Now I’m at a point where I’m still burnt out and I’m lost on what I should do for a career. I’m hesitant to try to break into the game industry right now because I know it’s competitive and very underpaid, so I’m considering working on my own indie game on the side while doing something else as my main job.\n\nThe problem is I don’t know what to do as a main job now that satisfies my creativity, doesn’t hurt my brain, and pays enough to make a living off of. I’m thinking about something like web development or UI/UX design but I’m not sure if those fields are too competitive (or being too easily replaced) to be worth it. I’m someone with an eye for visual design and I also have skills in digital art, but I feel like I’m not at a point with my art where I think it’s professional enough and I don’t have any kind of professional portfolio yet.\n\nAnd yes I know I probably should have been working on side projects to build a portfolio while still in university, but I was burnt out constantly by my classes and didn’t recover from that burnout even during breaks. Maybe that’s a sign of a bigger issue, I don’t know. I do know I suffer from perfectionism that prevents me from starting things, even things I want to do.\n\nAny advice, tips, or insight would be appreciated. I want to move forward and get “unstuck” so I can properly start my adult life.\n\nI’m in the U.S. by the way if that’s relevant, in a very rural area, not a big city.",

I got a couple interviews but no offers. However, myself and my friends also built a successful website, accumulating 16,000 users in our first year. The issue is that the time and energy I put into building this means that I did not invest time and energy into more traditional career building practices like grinding leetcode and sending out 500 applications instead of a measly 200.\n\nSo I've been going to conferences to talk to recruiters directly, and I've had fun. I feel like I've made good connections, at least inter personally. However, I was also given some tough truths. Common feedback was that there is nothing particularly wrong about my resume, and my independent successes are impressive, but I'm competing with people that have like 5-10 years industry experience in the same (entry level) role I'm applying for. They want to suggest I get an internship, because most companies they know of hire through the internship program, but I already graduated.\n\nSo here's what I'm doing. I enrolled in a professional certificate program. I picked Embedded Systems because I've always loved low-level programming and I feel like it's a field that might have more insulation from the AI conquest. I also have experience teaching Systems Programming concepts through teaching GBDK (GameBoy Development Kit) workshops.\n\nWhat I need someone's help with is how to take this program and turn it into a job. I mostly joined the certificate program to make it seem like I'm still in college and I can apply for internships again. I've compiled a list of internships, but most of them state that you need to be in a 4 year program. Some even automatically filter you out from the website if you state you are in a certificate program.\n\nI'm gonna keep applying for these internships because why not, but I think I need to figure out an alternative route into the industry. Any suggestions?",

I later completed a masters in information management so I was exposed to governance, project management, IS systems and so on.\n\nI worked mainly in dotnet, have scratched the surface of DevOps and Azure at work, I've done a bit of hybrid developer/product owner at my last company.\n\nHowever, even with some interviews for product owner, I haven't gotten an offer. I only get offers for web dev, basically.\n\nI feel like my window of opportunity for a career change is passing buy, and I still haven't explored that many areas that I can say with confidence \"I love this thing and I'd do it forever!\". I also feel due to not loving web dev, I haven't became as proficient as I should be, and so the offers I get are lacking salary wise.\n\nI am totally open to emigrating. That being said, I don't know if I should keep trying for product owner, solutions architect, try do a cybersecurity course, if I should go all in on DevOps and Cloud.\n\nI anyone could help me, maybe with the right questions, figure out what would be a good carrer path for me, that would be great.\n\nMy ambition is to actually do something that I'll want to improve at every day and eventually get a good salary.\n\nI'm based in southern europe, btw.\n\nThank you",

I already have ~5 small games under my belt, along with a Unity certification, an electronic album released, and a YouTube channel with a decent showcase of video editing skills. Mostly hobby stuff. Oh yeah and a 3.5 GPA.\n\nThanks in advance.",
