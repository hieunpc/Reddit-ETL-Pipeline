In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve  met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. \n\nSystem Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.\n\nData Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. \n\nBusiness Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approaches\n\nLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. \n\nQuestions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.\n\nNext day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward. \n\nHappy to answer any questions anyone has. ",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI wasn't planning to share my article here. But Only this week, I had 3 conversations this week wit fairly senior data engineers who see AI as a thread. Here's what I usually see:\n\n* Annoyed because they have to support AI enigneers (yet feel unseen)\n* Affraid because don't know if they may lose their job in a restructure\n* Want to navigate in \"the new world\" and have no idea where to start\n\nHere's the essence, so you don't need to read the whole thing\n\nAI engineering is largely data engineering with new buzzwords and probabalistic transformations. Here's a quick map:\n\n* **LLM = The Logic Engine.** This is the component that processes the data.\n* **Prompt = The Input.** This is literally the query or the parameter you are feeding into the engine.\n* **Embeddings = The Feature.** This is classic feature engineering. You are taking unstructured text and turning it into a vector (a list of numbers) so the system can perform math on it.\n* **Vector Database = The Storage.** That's the indexing and storage layer for those feature vectors.\n* **RAG = The Context.** Retrieval step. You’re pulling relevant data to give the logic engine the context it needs to answer correctly.\n* **Agent = The System.** This is the orchestration layer. It’s what wraps the engine, the storage, and the inputs into a functional workflow.2\n\nDon't let the \"AI\" label intimidate you. The infrastructure challenges, are the same ones we’ve been dealing with for years. The names have just changed to make it sound more revolutionary than it actually is.\n\nI hope this will help so of you.",

In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).\n\nMy logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations.

        "content": "I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. \n\nEarlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...\n\nOn the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:\n\n>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.\n\nThe first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.\n\nThen I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.\n\nA huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:\n\n* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. \n* That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservation\n\nObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…\n\nThe other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.\n\nEarnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)\n\nPlease check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?\n\n",

AI is an option but then you're competing with new grads (do we even stand a chance? Does our background experience help?). I'm asking for more general answers but my background issue is essentially being a jr-mid level at 3-4 different positions, all at smaller companies and more of a startup environment. Platform/cloud (AWS) engineering, bi developer, data engineer and architect. I would be EXTREMELY valuable if this background was at larger companies. \n\nFrom what I can see this isn't valuable unless you're senior/staff or a cloud architect level. They don't bring in jr/mid level and train them, at least not right now. ",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm reading \"Spark: The Definitive\" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: \n\n\"When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. \n\nIf the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.\n\nStarting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!\" \n\nI heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",

        "author": "Sorry-Secret4935",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Been building lineage systems for the past 3 years. Table-level lineage is basically useless for actual debugging work. I wanted to share some things I learned getting to column-level at scale.\n\n**My main problem**\n\nSomeone changes a column in a source table. Which downstream dashboards break Table-level lineage says \"everything connected to this table\" (useless, 200 false positives). Column-level says \"these 3 specific dashboard fields\", which is actually helpful.\n\n**What didn't work**\n\n**My first attempt: Regex parsing SQL**\n\nWrote a bunch of regex to pull column names from SELECT statements. Worked for simple queries. Completely fell apart with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.\n\nExample that broke it:\n\n    WITH customers AS (\n      SELECT \n        c.id as customer_key,\n        c.email as contact_email\n      FROM raw.customers c\n    )\n    SELECT customer_key, contact_email FROM customers\n\nMy regex couldn't track that customer\\_key came from c.id. I gave up after 2 weeks.\n\n**My 2nd attempt: Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA only**\n\nThought we could just use Snowflake's metadata tables to see column relationships. **Nope**. INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA tells you schemas exist, not how data flows through queries.\n\nI found success by parsing SQL properly with an actual parser, not regex. I used sqlparse for Python but JSQLParser works if you live in Java world.\n\nQuery Snowflake's QUERY\\_HISTORY view, parse every SELECT/INSERT/CREATE TABLE AS statement, build a graph of column → column relationships.\n\n**The architecture**\n\n    Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY \n      ↓\n    Extract SQL (last 7 days of queries)\n      ↓\n    SQL Parser (sqlparse)\n      ↓\n    Column Mapper (track renames/transforms)\n      ↓\n    Graph DB (Neo4j) + Search (Elasticsearch)\n\n    import sqlparse\n    from snowflake.connector import connect\n    \n    # Pull recent queries\n    queries = snowflake.execute(\"\"\"\n      SELECT query_text \n      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY \n      WHERE query_type IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT')\n      AND start_time > DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())\n    \"\"\")\n    \n    for query_text in queries:\n        parsed = sqlparse.parse(query_text)[0]\n        \n        # Extract SELECT columns\n        select_cols = extract_columns(parsed)\n        \n        # Extract FROM tables and resolve schemas\n        source_tables = extract_tables(parsed)\n        \n        # Handle SELECT * by querying schema\n        if has_star_select(select_cols):\n            select_cols = resolve_star_expressions(source_tables)\n        \n        # Build edges: source_col -> output_col\n        for output_col in select_cols:\n            for input_col in output_col.dependencies:\n                graph.add_edge(\n                    from_col=f\"{input_col.table}.{input_col.name}\",\n                    to_col=f\"{output_col.table}.{output_col.name}\",\n                    transform_type=output_col.transform\n                )\n\n**Some issues I ran into**\n\n**1. SELECT \\* resolution**\n\nWhen you see SELECT \\* FROM customers JOIN orders, you need to know what columns exist in both tables at query execution time. Can't parse this statically.\n\nThe solution is to Query INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to get table schemas, then expand \\* to the actual column list.\n\n**2. Column aliasing chains**\n\n    SELECT \n      customer_id as c_id,\n      c_id as cust_id,  -- references the alias above\n      cust_id as final_id\n\nYou have to track the alias chain through the entire query. The symbol table gets really messy really fast.\n\n**3. Subqueries and CTEs**\n\nEach level of nesting creates a new namespace. The parser needs to track which customer\\_id is which when you have 3 nested CTEs all selecting customer\\_id.\n\n**4. Window functions and aggregates**\n\nSUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY customer\\_id) means the output column depends on revenue (for the calculation) and customer\\_id (for the partition), but differently.\n\nYour lineage graph needs different edge types: \"aggregates,\" \"partitions\\_by,\" \"direct\\_reference.\"\n\n**Performance at 50K tables**\n\nParsing 7 days of query history (about 500K queries): 2 hours  \nStorage: Neo4j graph (200M edges), Elasticsearch (column name search)  \nQuery time: \"Show me everything downstream of this column\" = sub-2 seconds  \nQuery time: \"Where is customer\\_id used?\" = sub-1 second\n\nTo save yourself a future headache, save the 20% of lineage paths that get queried 80% of the time.\n\n**What I’m still struggle with**\n\nCross-warehouse lineage. My data flows Snowflake → Databricks → back to Snowflake. This approach only sees the Snowflake side.\n\nReal-time updates. I run lineage extraction every 6 hours. If someone on my team changes a column and immediately asks \"what breaks?\", they get stale data.\n\nML pipelines. Notebooks that do df.select(\"customer\\_id\") don't show up in Snowflake query logs. That’s a blind spot.\n\nWhat's your current table count? Curious where others hit the breaking point.

        "author": "seagullbreadloaf",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I'm currently working in a data science role but was thinking about making the switch to data engineering. I have a background in statistics and have been working as a data scientist in biomedical research in academia for 1.5 years. This is my first job since finishing my Masters in statistics. When I first started the job, I was responsible for cleaning datasets from clinical trials (this was 90% of the work), statistical modeling, creating visual aids like graphs and charts, and presenting and explaining my work to biologists. After 6 months, my manager told me I \"wasn't a good fit\" for the role because I \"lack curiosity\". I wouldn't say he was wrong. I didn't mind the work but it also didn't excite me and I didn't find it that fulfilling.\n\nI was transferred to a different team within the same company and my main project became writing programming scripts to automate compression of thousands of files from patient databases, and creating lookup tables containing information on all the files (such as patient identifiers, visit dates, etc.) This involved a lot of identifying and sometimes renaming files that were mislabeled, had missing information, or used different naming conventions, and make sure these edge cases were accounted for in the compression process. We also received multiple batches of files from different sources, and I had to modify the scripts to account for all the nuances between different sources. \n\nI noticed I enjoyed these projects much more and that I'm very precise and good at paying close attention to small details. I liked how expectations were more well-defined with this project and was more like \"it either works or it doesn't\", rather than the previous data science role which was much more open-ended. I feel like I do better when expectations are more structured and consistent, rather than exploratory. My new manager also noticed the new role was a much better fit for me.\n\nThat being said, I'm thinking about pivoting into data engineering for my next role because I feel it may be a better fit for me. I've been looking at job postings for data engineering roles, but I don't have many of the skills required for a lot of these roles. My work so far has mainly been in R since that's what my company uses, and I've had some exposure to SQL and Python. I know Python and SQL are important in data engineering and tech is all about transferable skills, but I feel like I don't yet have the toolbox to switch to data engineering, nor do I have strong software engineering skills. I'm also not sure if I will be a strong candidate considering how competitive the job market is nowadays. My plan for now is to learn the important skills so that I'm able to make the switch.\n\nThose of you who switched from data science to data engineering, what was your experience like and how did you navigate that shift? What are the most important data engineering skills/tools I should familiarize myself with to become a competitive candidate and be ready for interviews? What are some good resources you would suggest for learning these skills/tools? And do you have any general advice for me? ",

Today it’s a mix of newer faces alongside a couple of absolute bedrocks in data and analytics.  \n  \nApache Arrow  \nIt's the technology you didn’t even know you loved. It’s how Streamlit improved load speed, how DataFusion moves DataFrames around, and the memory model behind Polars. Now it has its own SQL protocol with Flight SQL and database drivers via ADBC. The idea of Arrow as the standard for data interoperability feels inevitable.  \n  \nDuckDB   \nI was so late to DuckDB that it’s a little embarrassing. At first, I thought it was mostly useful for data apps and lambda functions. Boy was I was wrong. The SQL syntax, the extensions, the ease of use, the seamless switch between in-memory and local persistence…and DuckLake. Like many before me, I fell for what DuckDB can do. It feels like magic.  \n  \nPostgres  \nI used to roll my eyes every time I read “Just use Postgres.” in the comments section. I had it pegged as a transactional database for software apps. After working with DuckLake, Supabase, and most recently ADBC, I get it now. Postgres can do almost anything, including serious analytics. As Mimoune Djouallah put it recently, “PostgreSQL is not an OLTP database, it’s a freaking data platform.”  \n  \nPython  \nWhere would analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, data platforms and AI engineering be without Python? Can you honestly imagine a data world where it doesn’t exist? I can’t. For that reason alone it will always have a spot on my Mount Rushmore. 4 EVA.  \n  \nI would be remiss if I didn't list these honorable mentions:  \n  \n\\* Apache Parquet  \n\\* Rust  \n\\* S3 / GCS  \n  \nThis was actually a fun exercise and a lot harder than it looks 🤪",

One service can be attached to multiple account codes (and can be offered in multiple branches as well).  \n\nHere are the options for the data mart.  \n\n**Option A:** Basically, the 3NF\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dazl3okpv4hg1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=1132687320f4ff596da43013f4de98559be88eb2\n\n \n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/modeling-1-n-relationships-for-tableau-consumption-v0-ra1u2j2fu4hg1.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=f87b68a51f3ab5325790913a50fe587c93e13321)\n\n**Option B:**\n\nA simple bridge table \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbs1f86sv4hg1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb085c6801f03fa8e68c0ce35264fcc986c41eea\n\n \n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/modeling-1-n-relationships-for-tableau-consumption-v0-hbqpggfhu4hg1.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=4afd71d5672352a3b8adebfab9609551dbcd75f6)\n\n**Option C:** A derivation of the [i2b2 model](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Ontology-driven-data-transformation-in-i2b2-The-ontology-which-defines-concept-metadata_fig1_331215339) ([4.

        "content": "# SOLVED: See solution a the bottom\n\nHello, I have been searching far and wide for a solution to my predicaments but I can't seem to figure it out, even with extensive help of AI.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nI have a skewed dataset representing 9 clients. One client is roughly 10x larger than the others. I’m trying to use `repartition` to shuffle data across nodes and balance the workload, but the execution remains bottlenecked on a single task.\n\n# Details:\n\nI'm running a simple extraction + load pipeline:\n\n`Read from DB -> add columns -> write to data lake.`\n\nThe data source is a bit peculiar: each client has its own independent database.\n\nThe large client's data consistently lands on a single node during all phases of the job. While other nodes finish their tasks very quickly, this one \"straggler\" task bottlenecks the entire job.\n\nI attempted to redistribute the data to spread the load, but nothing seems to trigger an even shuffle. I’ve tried:\n\n* Salting the keys.\n* Enabling Adaptive Query Execution (AQE).\n* `repartition(n, \"salt_column\")` , `repartition(n, \"client_id\", \"salt\")`.\n* `repartition(n)`\n\nSee picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo94vesrk2ig1.png?width=5030&format=png&auto=webp&s=399be044a1f8a3e9557553b97056141ed342b0b3\n\nIn very short pseudocode, here is what I'm doing:\n\n    data = []\n    \n    for db in db_list: # Reading from 9 independent source DBs\n        data.append(\n            spark.read.format(\"jdbc\").option(\"db\", \"table\").load()\n        )\n    \n    df_unioned = union_all(data)\n    df_unioned = df_unioned.sortWithinPartition(client_id)\n    \n    # This is where I'm stuck:\n    df_unioned = df_unioned.repartition(100, \"salt_column\")\n    \n    df_unioned.write.parquet(\"path/to/lake\")\n\nLooking at the Physical Plan, I've noticed there is no `Exchange` (Shuffle) happening before the write. Despite calling `repartition`, Spark is keeping the `numPartitions=1` from the JDBC scans all the way through the `Union`, resulting in a 'one-partition-per-client' bottleneck during the write phase.\n\nHelp me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope :(\n\nPS:\n\nA couple of extra points, maybe they're useful:\n\n\\- This data in specific is quite small, just a few gigabytes (i'm testing on a subset of the full data)\n\n\\- For the record, the repartition DOES happen: if I do \\`repartition(100)\\`, I will have 100 tiny files in the data lake. What doesn't happen is the shuffle between nodes or even cores.\n\n# Solution\n\nIt was AQE + a later query in the job causing this. This later query, which comes after writing out to data lake, does an aggregation on the \\`client\\_id\\`. Apparently, AQE understands this and goes \"instead of doing two shuffles (1 for repartitioning and another one to aggregate) I'm just gonna do zero since the data is already partitioned by \\`client\\_id\\`\".",

When I check the refresh history, the three small tables are loaded successfully, but the large one gets stuck in a loop and times out after 24 hours.\n\nWhat’s strange is that we have other dataflows pulling much more data from different data sources without any issues. This one, however, just won’t load the 1 million row table. Given our capacity, this should be an easy task.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar scenario?\n\nWhat do you think could be the issue here?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the \"medallion\" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.\n\nFirst - on all of these projects we were pushed by the \"data architect\" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).\n\nSecond - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's  time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.\n\nAre you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?\n\nI understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : D\n\nAlso I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..\n\nWhat are your views on this? Thanks for you opinion!",

        "content": "Hello. I’d like to start by saying that this is my first time asking a question in this kind of format. If there are any mistakes, I apologize in advance. I should also mention that I have very little experience in the Data Engineering field, and I haven’t worked in an organization that has a standard or mature Data Engineering team. My knowledge mostly comes from what I studied, and for some topics it’s only at a surface level, with little real hands-on experience.\n\nI currently work in an organization that does not have sufficient resources to recruit highly skilled Data Engineering personnel, and most of the work is driven by the data analytics team. The current systems were mostly built to solve immediate, short-term problems. Because of this, I have several questions and would like to seek advice from experienced members of this community.\n\nMy questions are divided into several parts, as follows:\n\n* What kind of Data Tech Stack would be most appropriate (Open Source, Cloud Services, or Hybrid)?\n* For a Data Orchestrator, is a code-based approach (such as Dagster or Airflow) or a GUI-based approach (such as SSIS) better in the long run, especially if the Data Engineering team needs to scale?\n* What roles should exist within a Data Engineering team (e.g., Lead, Infrastructure, Operational Service), or is it actually unnecessary to divide the team into sub-roles?\n* How should we choose Data Storage to suit each layer? Is it necessary to use newer technologies (such as Data Warehouse or Data Lakehouse), or should we choose based on the expertise of the organization’s IT department, which is likely more familiar with OLTP databases?\n* For a Data Dictionary, should it be embedded directly into table names for convenience, documented separately, or handled through a dedicated platform (such as DataHub)?\n* To comply with PDPA / security audits, should data be masked or encrypted before it reaches the data storage that the Data Engineering team has access to? And which department in the organization is typically responsible for this?\n* As someone who can be considered a new Data Engineer, could you please recommend skills that I should learn or further develop?\n\nLastly, if there are any parts of my questions where I used incorrect terminology or misunderstood certain concepts, please feel free to point them out and explain. I’m still not fully confident in my understanding of this field.\n\nThank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to share their opinions and advice.   \nPS.

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "If I run a query like ``df2 = df.groupBy(\"Country\").count()``, does running ``.repartition(\"Country\")`` before the groupBy make the query faster? AI is giving contradictory answers on this so I decided to ask Reddit.\n\nThe book written by the creators of Spark (\"Spark: The Definitive Guide\") say that there are not too many ways to optimize an aggregation:\n\n>For the most part, there are not too many ways that you can optimize specific aggregations\nbeyond filtering data before the aggregation having a sufficiently high number\nof partitions. However, if you’re using RDDs, controlling exactly how these aggregations\nare performed (e.g., using reduceByKey when possible over groupByKey) can be\nvery helpful and improve the speed and stability of your code.\n\nThe way this was worded leads me to believe that a repartition (or bucketBy, or partitionBy on the physical storage) will not speed up a groupBy.\n\nThis, I don't understand however. If I have a country column in a table that can take one of five values, and each country is in a seperate partition, then Spark will simply count the number of records in each partition without having to do a shuffle. This leads me to believe that repartition (or partitionBy, if you want to do it on the hard disk) will almost always speed up a groupby. So why do the authors say that there aren't many ways to optimize an aggregation? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I'm of course implying that in an actual production environment you would run the .groupBy after the .repartition more than once. Otherwise, if you run a single .groupBy query, you're just moving the shuffle one step above.",

This post may be long because I am asking a more open-ended question.  \n  \nI am a recent computer science graduate who started working for a large non-profit organization which is reliant upon an old, very complex, ERP system (say... a few hundred tables, hundreds of millions of records). \n\nThey don't provide an API, integrations are done by directly touching the database. Each one was developed ad-hoc, as the need arose over the last 2 decades. There is some code sharing but not always. 2 integrations which ostensibly provide the same information may have small divergences in exactly how they touch the database. They are written in a mix of C# and SQL stored procedures/functions. \n\nMany of these are very complex. Stored procedures call stored procedures and inserting an entity may wind up touching 30+ tables. A lot of the time, it's required. The ERP manages finances, staff, business operations; there is a lot of conditional logic to determine what to insert, update, delete, etc.. \n\nAre there any tools or techniques that could be useful here? I'm comfortable programming, but if a tool can do a job better and more efficiently, I'd rather use it. ",

For lack of a kinder way to put it, I recognize my current training + location is focused on outsourcing jobs for low pay and high turnover, typical cert mill stuff for cheap third world work, and they're not really focused on quality. Frankly, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm having certifications and courses for cloud providers, Databricks, dbt, etc. thrown at me without guidance or feedback and I'm not really learning a thing and feel paralyzed when it comes to trying to approach any actual problems. Like, I can follow along on coursework projects, finish cert exams, and follow Databricks notebook labs, etc. but I couldn't really tell you what I'm doing or do anything without my hand held and pulling up documentation and code examples on the side for things as basic as a CSV loader. I'm not really sure how all these parts come together in a real environment either, like when one would use dbt vs spark for transformations. I don't use LLMs because I want to be able to do it myself first, but I see my peers get so far ahead with them while I haven't completed anything of note *and* I still can't say I understand any more than them.\n\nI've seen some beginner project ideas, or advice to build something relevant to my interests, but I'm honestly lost for where to start even there. I'm sorry if this is quite silly. I know there's no perfect solution, but I was wondering if there are any semi-guided project outlines or study resources anyone can recommend. Alternatively, do you think it's worth it to put a hold on the data engineering track and focus on BI analyst-focused concepts? One of my biggest concerns is not being skilled/educated enough to land or hold *any* job at all and I fear not being able to catch up in time before completing this internship.",

Nobody at the org has really any experience in this, so I've been tasked to look into how do we make this possible.\n\nCurrently, our ADF setup uses templates that include a set of maintenance tasks such as row count checks, anomaly detection, and other general validation steps. Many of these responsibilities can be handled in dbt through tests and macros, and I’ve already implemented those pieces.\n\nWhat I’d like to enable is a way for every new dbt project to automatically include these generic tests and macros—essentially a shared baseline that should apply to all dbt projects. The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.\n\nThat said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.\n\nGiven that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",

        "content": "I started at a company a little over 3 years ago as a DE. I had previously had a solution/data architect position working in AWS but felt like I was \"missing\" something when it came to new pipeline design vs traditional warehousing. I wanted to build a Kimball model but my boss didn't want one. I took a step back and at the same time moved into a medium/large sized business from startup culture. I wanted to see their design and identify if/what I was misunderstanding. A consulting firm came in and started changing things, changing everything. I was not in these discussions because I was new and still learning the code base but the pipeline used to have 4 layers, data lake, star schema, reporting layer and finally a data warehouse layer (flat tables that combined multiple reporting tables to make it super easy for low skilled analysts to use). The consulting firm correctly said we should only have 3 layers but apparently didn't provide ANY direction or oversight. My boss responded by removing the star schema! well they technically removed it but simply merged the logic from two layers into one script... pushing the entire concept of data warehousing into the hands of individual engineers to keep straight. I wish I could describe it better but let's just say it takes experienced top level engineers months of hand holding to get straight. \n\nAnyway I'm sure you see the problem I'm talking about. Threw me soo far off track and I started questioning EVERYTHING I knew! lost my confidence and my recruiter picked up on it. How do you talk about horrible decisions that you've been forced to work with but at the same time not making yourself look bad. this could be in conversations at conventions, meet ups or even slightly higher stakes type of meetings.

DE is the only one that appears to be difficult to self-learn and relies on learning on the job which is why I'm thinking a MS that helps me with that is better than a MS in DS (which are mostly new and cash-grabs).\n\nI could also further study Applied Statistics but that's a different discussion. I wanted to get advice on MIS for DE specifically. Thanks!",

It will take a bit more effort to design, build, and test the ingestion into bronze with schema drift/evolution.\n\nAlthough implementing schema-evolution isn't a big deal, a more controlled approach to new columns still provides a viable trade off.\n\nI'm looking at some different options to mitigate it.\n\nWe'll enforce schema (for the standard included fields) and ignore any new fields.  The source database is a production RDBMs, so ingesting RDMBS change tracking rows into bronze (append only) is going to really be valuable to the client.  However, the client is aware that they won't be getting new columns automatically.\n\nWe're approaching new columns like a change request.  If they want them in the data platform, we need to include into bronze first, then update the model in silver and then gold.\n\nTo approach it, we'd get the new field they want; include it into the ETL pipeline.  We'd also have to execute a one-off pipeline that would write all records for the table into bronze where there was a non-null value for that new field as a 'change' record first.\n\nThen we turn on the ETL pipeline, and life continues on as normal and bronze is up to date with the new column.\n\nThoughts?  Would you approach it differently?",

        "author": "Beneficial-Flow-2105",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.\n\nI’m a Software Engineer in infra/DevOps, but I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.\n\nOne is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.\n\nThe second is a lack of safe access control. There's a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren't well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.\n\nBigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.\n\nCode here: [https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask](https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask)\n\nI’d love any feedback on the project, especially from anyone who works or has worked somewhere where this could be useful. This is also my first time sharing a project to online forums, and I’d value feedback on any ways I could better share my work as well.",

Its really a one way integration between two OLTP systems where webhook from System A writes to apigw which routes to a lambda which writes to dynamo where another lambda on a schedule reads from dynamo and writes unprocessed records to System B. There's also another flow where we have a lamdba check System B to see if users have a token and if if they don't, the lambda writes them to SQS where we have another lambda batch from SQS, grab a token from System A and write them back to users in System B.\n\nIts my first real pipeline as a \"Data Engineer\" but it feels like integration engineering not DE. It gets slightly more DE related where we are landing that same webhook data into S3 and materializing it in Redshift for downstream analysis. But im not involved in the code for this part, just the SQL querying for our group's own reporting on the data. \n\nNot sure where to go for next job, I am lacking the DBT and airflow skills most DE roles require and I have these cloud skills and some IaC stuff as well to sprinkle on top of my SQL and python skills. I have been a DE title for a year now (was Senior Data Analyst at same company and did some DA/DS for a few years before that) at diff companies) and I want to change roles and make more money for my family. Not sure what jobs to shoot for or how to market myself... Event Driven DE? Not sure. \n\nAlso, I'm new to reddit so forgive me if there's a better board for this.

This wasn't specific to any particular language - they seemed to mean it as a general programming principle. I'm pretty confused because I thought error handling with try-catch was fundamental to most modern programming languages. I know it can be misused (like catching exceptions and doing nothing, or using exceptions for control flow), but completely avoiding it seems extreme. Is there some programming philosophy or best practice I'm missing here? Are there alternatives to try-catch that are considered better? Or is my boss maybe referring to specific anti-patterns that I should be aware of? Has anyone else encountered this \"no try-catch\" philosophy? What are the actual best practices around exception handling across different languages? Any insight would be really helpful - I want to understand if there's something legitimate here or if I should push back on this guidance.\n\n  \n‐--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \nWhen people say vague things like \"That's not good programming,\" I always ask, \"Why?\"\nWhy is it garbage?

I think it can be useful in the right contexts and when used well.\n\nBut if you learn OOP as a course in college, you'd know that professors seem to think that it's God's perfect gift to programmers. My biggest problem is that colleges overemphasize inheritance as a feature.\n\nInheritance can be useful, but when used improperly, it becomes ridiculously difficult and annoying to work with. In software engineering, there is a concept called \"orthogonality\", and it's the idea that different parts of your code should be independent and decoupled. It's common sense, really. If you change one part of your code, it shouldn't fuck up other parts. It makes testing, debugging, and reasoning about your program easier.\n\nInheritance completely shits on that.\n\nWhen you have an inheritance tower two billion subclasses deep, it's almost guaranteed that there will be some unpredictable behavior in your code. OOP can have some very subtle and easy to overlook rules in how inheritance and polymorphism work, so it's very easy to create subtle bugs that are hard to reason about.\n\nSo yeah. By all means, learn OOP, but please do it well. Don't learn it the way professors have you learn it, focus on composing classes rather than inheritance.",

And I was like what the heck?! Are they even talking about \n\nAnd just for the Fact We don't even have i18n set up It's English only\n\nAsked for screenshots thinking of a fake APK. Nope UI 100% English. But error messages? Full Chinese “请填写所有必填字段”for “Please fill required fields” Took 3 days to crack it. A user mentioned her Samsung had a Chinese keyboard (she's learning Mandarin). Boom on Samsung/Xiaomi, secondary keyboards can trick Locale.getDefault() into thinking zh-CN is primary, even if system lang is en-US. App shell hardcoded English, but dynamic errors went Chinese. Fixed by ignoring keyboard locale Wild.\n\nThe user experience was completely bizarre. Half English, half Chinese. No consistency.\n\nAnd now comes the tough part The fix\n\nI had to check the actual system language instead of the default locale. Added a language picker in settings too just in case.\n\nBut man, I felt so dumb. Spent 3 days thinking we had some weird localization bug when it was just Android being Android and somehow we solved this shit ¯⁠\\\\⁠\\_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠\\_⁠/⁠¯\n\n\n\nBtw if you also get weird bug reports that seem impossible, ask users about their device and settings.\n\n",

That led me to rethink everything and start thinking more about working independently or as a freelancer.\n\n\n\nCurrently, I'm studying programming, and I started with the basics: HTML, CSS, and some web design. In the long term, I'm also interested in learning backend development (Java or other languages). Lately, the world of automation has caught my attention, but I have many doubts because there's a lot of talk about it on YouTube, and it doesn't always feel realistic.\n\n\n\nI understand that many people recommend \"starting a local business\" or \"taking any job,\" but in my case, I don't have capital to invest, I live in a small city, and I'm not hired because of my age. Even so, I'm a persistent person who learns quickly and doesn't give up when something doesn't work out.\n\n\n\nMy goal today isn't to \"make easy money,\" but to learn a real, in-demand skill that makes sense in the long run—ideally something I can do remotely and independently.\n\n\n\nI'd appreciate constructive feedback on:\n\n\n\nwhether my thinking is flawed\n\n\n\nwhat skills you see as most valuable for a young person (programming, data, automation, something else)\n\n\n\nwhat you would avoid if you were starting over\n\n\n\nI know I'm not the only one who's tried something like this at my age, so I really value any realistic advice.

Specifically a lot of questions came up about memory, how computers store and retrieve information, and how that connects to AI systems and such but from a computing perspective.\n\nI was already working on something like that but figured I would finish it up early !\n\nThis one starts with Mad Libs. Not as a gimmick but because the pattern behind that word game, templates with typed blanks filled according to rules, turns out to be structurally how computing works at every level (with a grain of salt). Abstract Syntax Trees are this. Compilers are this. And the way AI systems assemble prompts from system instructions, memory files, and your actual message is this too.\n\nSame disclaimers as last time. The computing fundamentals are standard. The framing around AI and where it fits in this history is my own take and I completely understand if people push back on it. That is part of the conversation.\n\n[https://youtu.be/S3fXSc5z2n4](https://youtu.be/S3fXSc5z2n4)\n\nThanks again for the response to the first one.

I'm missing so many fundamentals of game development despite me learning it for the last 2.5 years !\n\nI still didn't know any 3D modeling. Didn't understand Shaders. Barley knew anything about 3D dev in general. Didn't know how to create 2D assets.\n\nAnd this was a pretty bad feeling. I wanted to create something big after 2.5 years of learning; But couldn't do much because I didn't have enough experience.\n\nAnd yeah I realized this pretty much applies to all my interests:\n\n• The most advanced flutter app I made is a Basic calculator.\n\n• Every game I've made is a 2d arcade game with stock assets.\n\n• I haven't even learned Authentication with Django yet.\n\n• I don't know how to program in any system language. Just watching random videos about C and C++\n\n• I've only created 2 new Programming languages and they're both toy languages with limited use cases.\n\n• I'm still not experienced enough with Haskell to create anything I can think of.\n\nHonestly I'm having a crisis right now. I feel like I should just focus on backend to get hired and game-dev as my main non-work hobby. But I also love the other stuff so much and don't wanna abandon them !\n\nI love all of them so much and I wish I can do everything at the same time.

I try to solve DP problems on my own, but I struggle to define dp\\[i\\] clearly and to derive the recurrence, even after spending a lot of time thinking. It feels like time is passing without real progress, which is stressing me out.\n\nMy current routine is **4–5 hours** daily on **DSA**, around **2 hours** on CS fundamentals (OS, CN, DBMS), and 1 hour on development. I’d really appreciate advice from people who initially struggled with DP. How did you train your thinking for DP, and what is the most effective way to practice it without burning too much time?",

        "author": "UsefulExplanation131",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey, everyone. Im really hoping to get outside perspectives on some difficulties ive been experiencing while learning to program. I keep experiencing burn out and exhaustion over and over again and I can’t figure out why it keeps happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore and just can’t think clearly about my situation anymore. \n\n\n\nHere is some background:\n\n  \n\n\nRough timeline of my programming journey: August 2022- I begin working through TOP curriculum with the goal of seeing if i enjoy programming. I decide that i do enjoy it -> Feb 2024 - I physically and mentally burn out from my job as a delivery driver. Managing my job, programming, and therapy was too much and I quit after i got injured while working.  March 2024- after spending a year going from 45 mins of studying/week to 10 hours/week, a mental health crisis, and 1 month after quitting my job, i complete the foundations module of TOP -> Nov or Dec 2024 - I take advantage of being unemployed and living off savings to focus hard on programming. I build up to studying 25-30 hours/week consistently. I realize I don’t like front end stuff. I choose the js path on TOP, skip the “advanced html/css” and “react section,” but complete everything else up to the file uploader project of the “NodeJS” section. Around December i take a small break to focus on an art project, and that snowballed to a few months of no programming (though i think that would’ve happened regardless if i took a break or not). -> Feb 2026 - the past year and few months were a blur of trying so hard to build back the habit of programming as well as i did the first time. I spend some months completely dreading programming and unable to start and some months of still struggling, but able to at least show up mostly consistently. I follow a pattern of on for 2-3 months to off for 2-3 months. After i learn I don’t like front end stuff and realize that endlessly building endpoints was equally dreadful, i decide to focus on other backend topics and keep finding myself bouncing around. I spend a few months on [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) then burn out. I go to nand2tetris to switch things up, last a month, then burn out. I decide to learn C from “C programming: a modern approach,” to switch things up again, and actually have some fun, but things fizzle out again. Every attempt leaves me broken and exhausted. At this point, I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to restart. The feelings that kept me going during my most consistent periods of study, feeling like im improving and growing as a person and programmer, the satisfaction and euphoria of solving some problem that I genuinely believed i could not solve, just have been completely absent for so long. \n\n\n\nDuring all of this, ive been working hard in therapy to resolve a lot of things including social anxiety. I bring this up because i have bad social anxiety that prevents me from going to local programming meetups, participating in online programming communities, and applying for jobs. Going at this mostly alone just adds another layer of complexity to it all. Ive made a lot of progress on that front but still have a ways to go. \n\n\n\nI haven’t programmed in a couple months now and its like no amount of time away makes me dread programming any less. I feel spiritually broken. Im too close to my situation to think objectively anymore. What do y’all think i could do differently? Why does programming keep becoming this thing that i dread? Am i focusing on studying too much and not spending enough time making projects? For me, the hardest part about this whole journey (and ive realized this applies to many, maybe most, endeavors) hasn’t even been the intellectual side of things. That’s hard, sure, but by far the hardest part has been the emotional side of things. Specifically, having to find a way to program consistently over time. That’s the aspect of all of this that is the most soul crushing. It was hard to get yourself to program today, and guess what? You have to do it all over again tomorrow. And the day after. Maybe not every single day, but most weeks, most months. How do y’all not get overwhelmed with this? I think i do a decent job of focusing only on the short term but the big picture and the stakes are always on the back of my mind. I do find enjoyment in solving some programming problems, but I can’t deny that I wouldn’t be pursuing this if it wasn’t a well paying career that doesn’t require a degree. Which is the reason why i even decided to see if i enjoy programming and why i still pursue it after all this struggle. Every job ive had up to this point has been low skilled work. Server, cook, cashier, delivery driver, etc. I’m almost 25 and i want and need to get a career going. I can’t keep living the life that ive been living and programming seems to be a good enough fit. It’s intellectually challenging, doesn’t require a degree, well paying, and i find a lot of it enjoyable (even if there are a lot of things i find tedious and annoyingly boring).\n\n\n\nThat being said, i do have ideas that get me excited and could be solved using code. Some of my programming project ideas include:\n\n* Something similar to GitHub but for digital artists to save snapshots of their artwork. \n* Data management system for iot devices. Inspiration came from thinking about how massive amounts of data from telescopes are efficiently stored and organized\n* A tool that takes a 3D model and allows you to see the cross section along the axial planes\n* A massive library of artworks that pulls artwork from the online catalogs of museums and other collection websites\n\nI can’t help but feel like i am not ready for any of these projects and that I need to keep studying and learning before i can attempt any of them. That was part of the inspiration to learn c, to better learn how databases work by making a simple database since these are all data intensive projects. \n\nAnyway, if anyone has anything to share about what I could do better, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading, ill stop yapping now\n\n  \n",

The base system is promising and could be excellent, if the QA was more thorough.*\n\n**So, why do I say coddy is utter garbage?**  \n  \n\\- The website is riddled with bugs, from non-loading lessons to timeouts and very... very slow validation.\n\n\\- A lot of the lessons have errors: They aren't properly formated, do not explain all the methods and systems needed to actually solve a lesson.\n\n\\- The \"daily challenge\" system is a joke. Its some poorly made AI system that gives you a basic ass task like \"Print hello world 10 times\" despite being at chapters like HashMaps etc.\n\n\\- There are numerous lessons where they do not actually explain to you what the desired output needs to be (given, you can see that by clicking the \"expected output\" toggle - but you should be able to see exactly what you need to do from the challenge description. \n\n\\- This last point goes hand in hand with the issue that the output needs to be exact. They had one extra space at the end of their output, despite not showing that because you're tasked with printing the result of each itteration on a new line anyway? Instantly lose the \"first try\" challenge.\n\n\\- Courses aren't even finished. I started the Python and Java course at the same time, hoping to refresh my python knowledge and picking up Java at the same time. Java's whole point is to be an OOP-language. Guess what: Section 3 \"Object oriented Programming\" is \"Coming Soon\"™. What the actual fu\\*\\*?\n\n\\- The website is clearly built around just monetizing everything as agressively as possible. I got lucky and was able to use a discount code during November to get 30% off monthly subscriptions so it was \"only\" 14.95 a month. Still: I do not feel like that value is really justified. The website has a lot of AI-Slop and wannabe intelligent assistance systems that either fail, timeout (I now know this is a firebase website because the website is printing firebase errors everywhere on every fuc\\*\\*\\* interaction) and lots of lessons are very, very poorly worded.\n\nThis could've been a 8.5/10 rating but as it stands, I'd say coddy is at best a 4/10 and you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nTo their credit: They recently updated their Quizz section which made it less buggy and a lot more interactive.",

How do I know when something actually needs proper classes and structure vs just being a straightforward script?\n\nLike I get the theory behind clean code and all that, but when you're building a niche pipeline for one specific use case, does it really need to be over-engineered?

She is an artist herself so I would love for the gallery to have her own pieces too. I want it to be a reflection of her and our memories and her soul.\n\nBut I don't really know coding like that. Please help me. I am here because I don't want to use AI chatbots to write codes for me. I want this project to be extremely intentional. I need your help!\n\nMy questions for now-\n\n1. What application should I use to code this?\n\n2. What are your opinions on the feasibility of this project? Do you think I can do it considering my experience with coding?

If two objects have the same hashCode, can I be 100% sure they are the same?\n2. If not, why do we even have hash codes? Why not just use `==` for everything?\n3.

My older sister is a tech lead at X company and I've legit seen her break problems down one by one when presented with an issue, even problems that have nothing to do with tech lol, I still remember the first time I seen her do that and I've been wanting that ever since but I feel like a fraud. \n\n  \nHow did you guys get better at this? I've been more or less coding everyday since October trying to find a job and whenever I'm presented with a bug or an issue in my code I don't really approach it like actual programmers I just sit in my chair thinking, trying to beat my brain for a solution, sometimes it works, sometimes I end up just asking AI for help. (The other day I spent like two and a half hours trying to debug an \"edit inline\" feature for a finance app i was making and it was the most easiest solution ever that i could've solved on my own if i knew how to google/be resourceful\n\n  \nAlso, how did you guys get better at reading documentation? What is your process when you're learning new tech? I'm pretty bad at reading documentation I have to re-read certain MDN things like a million times for it to click. I think the overload of information on certain docs is what messes me up, but idk\n\n  \nThese are all things that I think are holding me back and I want to get better at so I can become a better programmer and not be too dependent on AI since no one knows where this is all going, because tbh AI can easily fill those gaps for me but then I'll never actually feel like a programmer or break problems down like the example I gave of my older sister.\n\n  \nThanks in advance for your input!\n\n",

I began working with C# and Windows forms to produce videogames, that was my first job as programmer as freelancer, then I moved to a work where I use C# and Unity to create virtual trainings, then I moved to a company where I provide support to a web site touching a little of SQL, C#, .NET, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Classic Visual Basic,looking learn new frameworks I moved to another company where I learn React and Angular, for a while there I work as Front End Developer, there was a Layoff and then I moved to a company where I currently work as a user experience engineer.\n\n  \nI have touched a lot of frameworks but I cannot consider an expert in anything, of course I know something, otherwise it would have been impossible to pass the interviews, but I would love to have solid formation in front, back, databases and design systems including cloud, I have seen a lot of \"paths\" or courses but in the end no one is so clear or provide any solid knowledge.\n\nAny suggestion is very welcome, thanks beforehand for your suggestions and comments.",

The intent of this code is to write one byte into the current location in the buffer and than move the current location forward one byte.  I wrote a little bit of code that demonstrates that it does work.\n\nBut I am confused.  I would have guessed that because of the parenthese surroundng `buf++` that the post-increment would happen before the dereference, causing the data to be stored one byte ahead of where it is expected.

Due to this I noticed a deterioration lately in their mental health and mood. \n\nI thought I could download some of the series they used to watch time ago, store them in a USB and connect it to the TV so they can watch that instead of the news all the time. My parents are old and they would not know how to navigate through Netflix or other platforms, so I‘d have to do it this way.\n\nWhat I would like, and here is my question for you, is a file in the USB that randomly plays any video file in the USB. My parents basically use the TV as background noise so they wouldn’t care about what’s playing or follow the episodes in a given order. I want a file that they click on it and it plays whatever in the USB stick, and I need it to be random so it doesn’t always play the same episode first. I also need it to play episodes non-stop, so that they don’t need to click on the file after every episode.\n\nI have some knowledge in Python and bash, so if you give me a hint on what kind of file could do such a thing maybe I can write it on my own. \n\nThe approach I can think of is the following; when I click on this file it will:\n- Collect all the file names in the USB (or the ones with a video format).\n- Sort them on a random order.\n- Grab the first 20 files on the list.\n- Play this 20 episodes as a playlist.\n\nOn a computer I could write it so that VLC plays this list of files, but on a TV I don’t know how it could be done. It’s also not a Smart TV, so I cable install apps. ",

How do you build software that doesn't end up breaking down the line both in terms of complexity/management/organization but also speed/performances/optimization? What is the strongest strategy?\n\nI know OOP and design patterns have been developed to fix organisation issues.\n\nBut on the other side, there is a movement towards data oriented designs that prioritize efficiency and speed. Optimization for the hardware. The DS&A side of things.\n\nAnd they kind of seem to clash.\n\nBut I tried the two and everything I make ends up breaking either being two slow/rigid with lack of control and dynamism if I go full OOP or if I go full DOP then at first it's a breath of fresh air with total freedom and speed of execution and so on but then I fall into madness pretty quickly as things get more complex and hard to keep track of.\n\nAnd I been stuck in that infernal cycle loop of doom for a long time and it's starting to feel like there isn't really a good solution and software may be a lot more limited than it seems to be\n\nWell software or my brain. As I found OOP ends up making the hardware fail but DOP ends up making my mind fail\n\nPerhaps this may just be a skill issue on my part? I mean it definitely is but perhaps the answer lies lower level and I'd just need to \"get good\".\n\nBut that introduces another issue though. If you program full stack and dive too deep, you end up taking the habit of over engineering everything and then development takes ages...\n\nBut on the other side if you use only the most automated tools/libraries to make things really fast, you end up with slow and low feature slop that's turning your pc cooling system into a jet engine...\n\nI feel so lost... I been giving it my all in game development for soon to be 2 years programming a lot and been studying computer science for 1 year and I been tryharding the shit out of it but it's like I don't even know what to practice practice anymore. I pushed on the two sides A LOT and they both seem like dead ends to me...\n\nMaybe it all boils down to kiss at the end of the day... Maybe I should just practice kissing",

I need some advice on where I should be focusing next/ proceed forward until I matriculate (or even throughout my degree program).\n\nContext:\n\nI’ve been working through TheOdinProject (TOP) and I’m nearing the end of the Node.js section (working on the Blog API currently). Given my current education background, finding internships or jobs related to programming is literally impossible. Hence I’ve decided to continue working on my technical skill before matriculating.\n\nI’ve still yet to decide whether I should focus on practicing DSA (probably using Python since that’s the language used in the college I’ll be going) or learn new software (was planning to look at Angular and Spring framework). Another option was to look explore other forms of CS such as Machine Learning, Data Science. However, I’m leaning more towards the first 2 options due to it being more aligned with the hiring process…\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: Sorry I can’t post on  r/csCareerQuestions  since I’ve not enough karma :(",

If you're here simply because you are looking to make a lot of money, you're in the wrong place\"\n\nThis is what the dean of students told Jordan Belfort (The Wolf of Wall Street) and his fellow classmates his first day of dental school. Belfort dropped out.\n\nA lot of you all here need to take some inspiration from that. Gatekeepers are annoying I know but the doom and gloom in this field has reached a point where I, as a senior engineer in this field, feel a call to gatekeep a little bit.\n\nThe COVID era job market is never coming back - at least not any time soon which may as well mean never for those of you trying to break into this field with no passion. And that word is the heart of what I want to get at here; passion.\n\nObviously there are still dentists today. Most of whom became dentists well after Belfort was a student and discouraged from his dreams. Just as there will be software engineers well into the future.\n\nBut the people that became dentists despite the market drying up did so because they had a true passion for the field. It still pays well sure but there was a golden age that has now passed and this is where CS is now.\n\nThis post isn't to straight up tell you to give up on a CS career. But, if you have been struggling to find a job for awhile now, you should take a step back and a bit of time to reflect on why you are here. If its just for the money, it might be time to pivot to something else.\n\nThe golden age of software engineering is over\n\nEDIT: This post went from 70+ upvotes to sub 10 in a matter of minutes. Reddit is controlled by bots and is generally a bad place to solicit life and career advice. You cannot trust what you see on this platform\n\nEDIT 2: Don't overanalyze the dentist analogy. Like I originally said there are obviously still dentists today. And they make great money IF they get jobs. The analogy is not to say they don't do well if they land jobs its to say they do well IF THEY DO land jobs. And thats the challenge of the current CS market. Its great money IF YOU CAN LAND A JOB.

And also you’re welcome.\n\nMoments spent in Power BI dashboards, watching shifts in purchasing behavior, tracking category growth in Kombucha, Spindrift, and non-alcoholic beverages, and translating those insights into actionable strategy? Ecstasy. Seeing those trend lines move is why I wake up everyday\n\nThere are too many contrarians here reflexively dismissing uncomfortable truths, and not enough people willing to acknowledge how the industry actually works and what  it really takes to thrive in it.\n\nI for one am so grateful to be a data scientist at a large grocery chain.

In my spare time, I’d play around with tech I thought was interesting. If I had some downtime at work, I’d play around with new things\n\nPerhaps it’s a lot of very demanding, unpleasant working environments… but now I see code and I feel borderline nauseous. In my own personal life, I don’t really get excited about tech or look forward to any of it. Great, new tech released, I’m not even gonna bother checking it out cause it’s either some sort of scam or will enshittify before I can really enjoy it. I’ll just stick with the 4 apps I use on my iPhone 13, and hope that they don’t deprecate my phone anytime soon cause I don’t want a new one\n\nThe people I’ve worked with since about 2020 feel very different than before. It seems like everyone is more interested in business and finance than they are in tech and product. Many people working in tech seem like they don’t care about it. Tech companies have this very “Harvard MBA” feel to them that I can’t describe. Lots of ladder climbing, lots of clamoring for status and visibility. I’ve seen act in really unscrupulous ways to get ahead, despite the fact that it seems very toxic\n\nAlso, I’m level 1 autism. As time has gone on, I’ve noticed it’s been less and less tolerated. This doesn’t have to do with any changes in title, either, cause that’s stayed the same for years. Previously it seemed to be viewed as, at worst, a little quirky. Now at work people tell me that being able to read subtle social cues is more important than being able to do \\_any\\_ hard skill. I am still a senior engineer\n\nPart of me thinks I’m just getting old (I’m 35) and tired of this industry and maybe I’ve mentally checked out. The thing is, I’ve met at least a small handful of people who have expressed the same feelings to me: tech just isn’t \\_fun\\_ anymore. I also noticed that it even seems like people at these companies don’t even really believe in what they’re selling, really. Like I don’t get the feeling someone like Sam Altman \\_actually\\_ cares about OpenAI, it just feels like a grift\n\nLike when I think of growing up, I remember video games like world of Warcraft and newgrounds and MySpace. It felt like the attitude was more along the lines of “how do we get money so we can build what we want to build?” And not “what can we build that will make money?”\n\nYes I know companies have to make money, but I suppose before it didn’t feel like they had to MAXIMIZE how much money they’d make at the expense of everything else they care about\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or have I just kinda started seeing the way it always was? Was I simply naive before?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I made this post to help explain the current state of software development jobs, especially for new and junior developers. I hope this eases some of your worries. It is long, bear with me.\n\nSoftware Engineering, like any other careers is cyclical. Jobs are at the mercy of demand, trends, and capital. We saw an influx during 2010's and especially during and after Covid (early 2020's) when companies started hiring to hoard talent.\n\nLets get to the layoffs. For those who think layoffs are the direct result of AI, you are not completely wrong. But there are more factors at play. The hard reality is the American economy may be in the midst of economic hardship (recession). This takes us to my first point.\n\n1. Companies using AI as an excuse to downsize and make the books look good.\n\nFirst reason: Executive Bonuses. Public companies are at the mercy of quarterly reports. One bad quarter could cost some asshole millionaire his/her job. This sadly incentivizes short term gains and hurts the company long term. But who cares as long as they get their bonus right? AI is a goldmine for execs. They buy a Claude or Copilot subscription and start firing devs. They then take the money they were paying those devs back to the board or shareholders and get rewarded with a bonus.\n\nSecond reason: Optics. Instead of telling shareholders they need to cut costs (signs of weakness), companies can now conveniently say \"AI Efficiency\". “We don’t need as many people” sounds better than “we can’t afford them”.  To top that off, the market rewards any mention of AI with a stock bump. Again the millionaire assholes gets their bonus.\n\n2. Management is not immune to industry trends. Leadership is not perfect, they will make mistakes. Unfortunately we are often the victims of those mistakes. Executives talk to peers, copy what other companies are doing, then push it internally. Often times, this comes in the form of asking devs to vibe code/prompts/use agents.\n\n3. Take a close look at motivations. The same people dooming and glooming software development are often the ones collecting million dollar bonuses for selling the hype and tools.\n\nBelow is how things will play out:\n\nAfter management finishes downsizing and the quality of the product goes to shit (either from the vibe coding or short staffing), we will see the following:\n\n* Companies admiting AI didn’t deliver the expected benefits\n* Anyone tied to the AI initiative gets fired (after they get their million dollar bonuses of course)\n* Start hiring engineers again\n* AI repositioned as “assistive\" rather than substitutive\n\nTime and time again we have seen this with offshoring, outsourcing and any form of automation.\n\nMy recommendation, if you enjoy coding, keep doing it. After the hype and fad dies down, this job will continue to be in demand.\n\n“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and executive bonuses”",

Every small-mid size company has only 1-2 roles open at a time, if at all, and the competition is intense. Every application has hundreds of people applying based on LinkedIn and Indeed.\n\nI don't think I qualify or want to push myself to take Senior roles, which have much more openings by far, but for Mid Level roles, I feel like I'm looking a unicorn. Friends who work in non Big Tech jobs tell me how wonderful it is to work in a low stress environment and have coworkers who have been there for decades, while I feel like I'm going crazy just looking for a job.\n\nI knew the job search would be bad, but its genuinely horrible and I can't imagine what someone without experience or less experience than what you'd get at FAANG would be going through right now. I'm leveraging use of all resources of networks, cold calling, and the like, but with how dry the market is, every rejection and non offer after long interview sessions hits like a truck.\n\nI love this work, am staunchly anti-AI, and don't expect a large paycheck for my next job, but is it so hard of an ask for fulfilling work that I don't have to think about all day and on weekends?? (shout out last employer!!)\n\nI landed my FAANG job from an internship and I have no idea if this is the norm or if I've just been privileged. How was the market actually before all of this? I know the pandemic was a hot market for SDE jobs, but its hard to believe given the dichotomy between today's market. \n\nThe only consistent interview requests I get now are from big tech companies and I'm trying my absolute best to not re-enter the meat grinder for as long as possible.

For actual development work, it has proved lackluster.\n\nHe was pushing that coding was dead and AI should be able to do all of it now, so we should all be much faster. He also mentioned software quality in the same discussion, advocating AI should make it easier. He then gave an example of someone he knew in a well known company who was very experienced, IC6 level, and he was bring told that he needs to use AI or go away. Whilst using AI has been useful, I do think the extent of it's usage is being stretched significantly by people who are even developers or were themselves. \n\nHow does everyone find using AI for their companies so far? When i make a new side project and do simple client side work, it's great and I rarely need to read any code. But for my corporate job, it still hallucinated a lot even with very specific prompting.

        "content": "I was promoted to Senior Engineer originally about 11/12 years ago. After a few years I left the company as I felt like promotion above that was impossible. I was essentially doing the work of other tech leads in the company, but there was always a vague reason promotion to get the title I was already doing wasnt coming. It was always \"next cycle\". \n\nI left and went to another company. Hired as a Senior, within about a year or two I'm basically acting tech lead again in terms of responsibilities. But again, every cycle I was told I'd be promoted in the *next* cycle and it never happened. \n\nAfter frustration, I left and started the cycle again at my current company. I'm now approaching my 4th anniversary and the same cycle has played out again, and I'm sensing the same excuses coming as to why no promotion will happen again this year.\n\nI'm very frustrated. I'm working at a higher level than my title suggests and have been for a long while now. No offense to the people around me but I now report up through people with much less experience.\n\nIf I leave, I can't get past a screening for a \"lead\", \"staff\", \"principal\" roles because they want a few years at that title already. If I accept another Senior position, I'm basically back to \"Day 1\" and have to grind to reach the ever elusive carrot or promotion in a few years and I'm worn out of trying hard, having responsibility pushed on me, but never actually getting the reward. \n\nWhat do people at this level do. I'm good at my job from a technical perspective and I seem to be well trusted in terms of people skills, managing a team, but the political side of forcing promotions seems to not be something I'm good at. \n\nEdit: Thank you for the helpful and respectful comments, it has given me a few things I need to think about and improve my approach towards. For the hostile comments, I'm not quite sure why my question has made a few folks so angry but I wish you well regardless. \n\nEdit 2: Received a Reddit Cares for this post. Unacceptable. ",

I'm a pretty solid dev and have a good number of projects under my belt.  I'm personable, though probably a bit rusty on interviewing and need to get my resume updated, but aside from that what do I need to know about interviewing?

Obviously it has a reputation, though I'd like to think I've done a lot of \"real\" engineering with it—not just WordPress plugins and whatever small, hacky BS it's known for.  I worry that will hold me back—not because of my skill level, but because of PHP's reputation.  Is that a valid concern?\n\nI'm also far enough into my career to have a comfortable amount of savings and not all the energy of a 22 year-old, so I'm not willing to take an insanely demanding job with crazy hours and stress.  No money is worth that to me anymore.\n\nSo, where do I go from here?  I'd been keen to hear from others who have moved from \"normal\" jobs toward these high-TC jobs after 10+ years in the field.",

I am also minoring in Statistics and Management and have applied for a Master's program as a backup.\n\nAcademically, I have done well with a 3.7 GPA and I have never really struggled to understand CS concepts. With a few hours of focused studying, I can usually grasp everything and do well on exams. The issue has not been that the material is too hard. It is more about motivation and how I feel about the path I am on.\n\nAfter freshman year, where I honestly did not do much career wise, reality hit me in my second year. I felt like I had to catch up. I took on multiple research projects to make up for my lack of industry experience, built personal projects, constantly took 20 units a quarter along with some community college classes, and spent a lot of time grinding LeetCode. I really pushed myself because I thought that if I did everything right, the results would come.\n\nBut even after all that effort, I did not see the outcomes I expected in terms of internships or job offers. That gap between effort and results has been mentally exhausting. Over time, the constant grind with no clear payoff has worn me down, and I have lost the excitement I used to have for CS.\n\nI have realized that I do not hate problem solving. I still like thinking through ideas and solutions. I especially enjoy working with numbers and seeing patterns, which is why my Statistics and Management minor has felt more interesting recently. What I do not enjoy is the actual process of coding. Sitting and building things line by line feels draining, even though thinking about the solution at a higher level feels engaging.\n\nRight now I am not excited about more studying, more interview prep, or more side projects. I want to work and get real experience instead of staying in this cycle of preparation. Applying for a Master's was partly strategic because I have not landed a job yet, not purely because I am excited to keep studying.\n\nAt this point, I am trying to figure out if this loss of passion is just temporary burnout from overworking myself, or if my interests are actually shifting toward something more analytical or business focused rather than pure software engineering.\n\nI know I am just ranting and will probably just get flamed in the comments (please be nice)",

I am 26F and currently have 5 YoE and an engineering degree from an Ivy. \n\nIn December, a recruiter from Capital One reached out to me. I guess at one point I had applied in the past and was rejected but my name was in their system and they wanted to consider me for a Senior Software Engineer (Principal Associate) role. I kinda thought eh, what the hell why not, but after a little brushing up on Leetcode I managed to pass the online assessment and the Power Day and am now at the team match phase. The recruiter called me yesterday to let me know that while I still passed, they ultimately are going to offer me a Software Engineer (Senior Associate) role, which is the level below what I interviewed for. I'm honestly shocked I even passed so this is still good news, and according to Levels.fyi I would be making \\~160k base in NYC which is significantly more than what I make now.\n\nNow that I've passed and I'm waiting to hear back about team match, I was looking on Blind and Reddit about working at Capital One and I worry that the culture is really cutthroat. Apparently every 6 months they PIP 15% of employees per team and it's common for new hires to get cut. This is really concerning to me. My entire career I've been more used to a startup environment where there is obviously a chance of layoffs (and have been through one) but they weren't cutting teams every 6 months. \n\nGoing from having mostly startups on my resume to having somewhere with more name recognition like Capital One might be more beneficial for my career in the long run, plus the compensation is significantly more than what I make currently. However, I worry that I'll be out of a job in 6 months and with this current job market I don't think most people are in a place to take risks. I'm weighing the pros and cons and I'm not sure how to proceed once I hear back about team match and get an offer. Should I stay at my current job, or take the leap?",

I constantly hear stories, jokes, and discussions about developers in different fields who often stretch tasks and work around 3 hours a day instead of the stated 8.

I personally find it quite difficult to stay focused on large tasks for long periods of time, and even spending 5–6 hours coding can feel pretty exhausting.\n\nSo here’s the core of my question: is this actually normal? Or is it possible that my peers and I simply lack the persistence and engagement in the field to push ourselves fully and finish tasks much faster?",

Or they stay but invent problems and over engineer (and some important basic work does not get done).\n\nIn the recent job posting I worked on, we had to remove a line about how \"you will get to coach juniors\" because we literally don't have any now. The simple tasks haven't disappeared, it’s just that seniors are wasting time on them instead of juniors.\n\nFrustrated with this, can anyone relate?[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qwmnv8)",

I make low six figures and I feel deeply unhappy and stuck.\n\nI’m currently the most senior person on my team after contractors were laid off. There isn’t much pressure but working almost entirely with non-technical stakeholders is mentally draining and isolating.\n\nThe bigger issue is that I don’t enjoy wordpress and don’t feel particularly good at it. I’ve wanted to leave for a while but I feel trapped. Interviews have been especially discouraging. The moment I say wordpress developer I feel dismissed. People assume it’s just drag and drop work but it isn’t. I write code in php, js, bootstrap, blade, custom modules, accessibility work. But the label alone seems to hurt me.\n\nRejections really take a toll. I struggle with leetcode. Sometimes I solve problems and then forget them days later which makes me feel like I’m not cut out for this. On top of that every new AI tool makes me worry I’m falling further behind.\n\nI know I’m lucky in many ways but I feel exhausted, frustrated with myself, and unsure how to move forward. If anyone has been in a similar position or has advice on transitioning out of wordpress or regaining confidence I’d appreciate it.",

Re-evaluates pay every year based on performance.\n\n\\+ global Fortune 500 company\n\n\\+ connect you with other people your age there\n\n\\+ start in June, which I prefer so I can be with family now\n\n\\-Naperville, and not directly the Chicago city\n\n\\- fixing up tickets and other legacy system tasks\n\n\\- >2 years just learning and training, so they want something very long term, so big commitment\n\n80k ar/vr role:\n\n\\+ I enjoy vr work. I have a game design minor and have done a capstone in vr before. This job actually seems like something I can do/have an idea of, instead of the former offer which is vague work I have no excitement about\n\n\\+ they have a flight simulator pod in there\n\n\\-start in feb/march, feels like getting yanked out of my current relationships\n\n\\- government, so I may not be able to visit family internationally without security concerns\n\n\\- Dahlgren, next to the water in Virginia(+), might not have people my age though and I enjoy being social and going out\n\nI could deep dive into the details of the benefits later on but this is what I’m looking at in my head right now. My brain is telling me the 93k job is a better set up, but I can’t stop thinking about the other one and how I might make a great mistake as this decides the course of my life for me.\n\nI know 93k is already a lower swe offer I suppose, but earlier this month I was debating between a 60k ar/vr internship that has great potential to become full time vs this 93k job, and I decided with the 93k. This time the decision is a little more difficult for me. If you have any advice please let me know, as anything would greatly help.",

The issue is I’ve done 3 interviews with them but would still need to do another in-person and I’m almost certain they won’t give me offer before the deadline for the other offer. \n\nWith how the economy is right now, declining the first offer and hoping the other one comes through is simply off the table, I have to take the guaranteed offer right now no matter what. That said though, if the other company does come through say a week down the line, I would hate to have to decline the materially better offer due to some unfortunate timing. \n\nMy question is, would it be acceptable to accept my first offer and then potentially rescind my acceptance a week or two later if I do get a better offer from the second company? I would ideally like to not burn any bridges, but the company is smaller so I’m sure it would impact them a little more. Of course, that would also mean it wouldn’t be the end of the world if I can’t work with them anymore since it’s not a big company with a lot of potential job openings anyways. I’m just not familiar with this area, and I’m not sure if this is like unheard of or potentially career-threatening later down the line. \n\nI do understand this is all assuming I get the job for the other company which may not happen anyways, but I wanted to be prepared just in case.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience, mostly working with .NET/C# and SQL. I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role, which means I’ve had exposure to architecture decisions, client calls, and owning delivery end to end.\n\nLately though, I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.\n\nI recently went through interviews with a US-led SaaS company, and they’ve communicated intent to extend an offer. The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role.\n\nFrom conversations with their engineering leadership, though, this doesn’t sound like a traditional ticket-only support job. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes. They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.\n\nWhat I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.\n\nThere’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.\n\nIf you’ve worked in product SaaS companies or made a similar move, how would you look at this? What would you watch for early on to tell whether it’s actually a stepping stone versus a dead end? Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?\n\nEDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.",

So, having barely grown in these 2 years, having minimal skills, and not knowing what route to go down - I am panicked and depressed. Was going to get my CKA but also IDK if I want to go that route either. I feel so lost. I wish I jus",

I've done a few system design interviews before, but those were whiteboarding sessions. I haven't had to actually code up a full system under time pressure and validate it against a suite of test cases.\n\nAre there any sites where you build a system in code and run it against a test suite? Essentially, Leetcode but for system design? Or problem sets/files that I can work through and then locally run the tests myself? I've already found some LeetCode problems like \"Design an In-Memory File System\" and \"Web Crawler,\" but I'm curious what else is out there.\n\nAny resource recommendations on OOP design principles and patterns, too? I'm currently going through System Design Interview by Alex Xu, but that's about it.\n\nLastly, I'd love any advice for those who have taken this OA. Definitely a bit nervous!\n\nThanks!",

Are there beginner-friendly learning paths that hiring managers actually respect?

It feels like I might as well have no degree and no experience.

When I was searching for my first position, out of 580ish jobs, only 1 out of the 4 second round interviews I had consisted of answering some LeetCode style problem. I know they were LeetCode problems given the fact that I had actually completed them while studying up on LeetCode (Roman Numeral Conversion, Linked List problem). But also, I hear people say on this subreddit that studying LeetCode ALL DAY EVERYDAY is for people who want to break into FAANG or some adjacent company and that most companies won't be too harsh on applicants knowing how to solve LeetCode problems. \n\nI guess if you were a fairly recent graduate coming off your first job, what would be your priorities if you were going to be searching for a new job while having SOME experience?",

In today’s market, is it realistic to get back into an SDE role, and how should I approach it?\n\nHi all. I’m looking for honest perspective from people who’ve been in the industry for a while, especially anyone who has hired or returned after a gap.\n\nI have a CS degree and about three years of professional experience as a backend engineer. I spent roughly a year at a banking-as-a-service/fintech company, then two years at Amazon working on backend services. After Amazon, I took time off because I had savings and I needed a reset. What I expected to be a shorter break became much longer because I ran into health issues that took time to resolve. I’m doing better now, and I’m ready to re-enter the workforce, but the gap has me worried; not just because it’s almost two years, but because I’m re-entering during a slower market.\n\nI’m currently getting back into interview prep (LeetCode, system design, and behavioral). I haven’t applied broadly yet because I wanted to rebuild momentum first. The part that’s making me anxious is whether recruiters and hiring managers will view the gap as a hard stop, even with the Amazon experience. I learned a lot in that role and I feel like the work itself made me a stronger engineer, but I also know the market can be unforgiving about “recent experience,” and I don’t have that right now.\n\nI’m not asking for reassurance so much as a realistic read on how this plays out. Is a two-year gap something that can be overcome with strong prep and a straightforward explanation, or does it usually require a different strategy (contracting first, down-leveling, focusing on smaller companies, heavy networking/referrals, etc.)? If you’ve seen people come back successfully after a gap, what actually made the difference?\n\nI’m genuinely committed to staying in software and I want to work in the field I trained for, but I’m also trying to be pragmatic about what the next step should look like. Any advice on how to approach applications, how to talk about the gap without oversharing, and what expectations to set would really help.\n\n",

I've used React but all of my professional experience has been with Angular, which she knows from my resume. It was going okay until she started asking me some technical questions which I didn't expect since it was supposed to be a phone screen type meeting. I stumbled on some of the questions and gave responses that I didn't feel good about, and one question I straight up had to say \"I'm sorry I'm struggling to remember right now.\"\n\nI'm feeling really bad about it. I'm going to send a follow up thank you email, and I'm wondering if it's a good idea to acknowledge the questions I stumbled on? Something like \"I realized afterward there were a couple technical topics I could’ve explained more clearly. I appreciate the space to think through them during the conversation. I’m excited about the opportunity to go deeper in future discussions.\" Or should I not even acknowledge it at all?",

        "content": "I have two years of experience developing a web app for my company post graduation. Unfortunately, this is my first job and have minimal experience working with a team before they were laid off. I would say my resume is impressive in the sense of taking ownership and delivering software that has actually made an impact and benefitted my colleagues in their operations. \n\nThis particular project has been my baby and I have raised it to be what it is today. It is very complex for a single early-career engineer to control but I have managed. My point is, there is so much I could talk about this project but the standard is to summarize in your resume what you did in your job. That being said, this is still my first job, no internship experience and no meaningful personal projects to accurately show my skills today. \n\nI've been working on a personal project for my own cause and desire and figured I would add it to my resume just to fill the page. However, I haven't even started this project since I am still in the planning phase so I have it marked as \"in development.\" It's also not an easy one so it will take me a while to even have a minimum viable product. \n\nMy priority right now is to get a better job. And yes, I also spend some time on leetcode but most of my interviews have not required it so it's currently my second priority. It's also a bit of a marathon to become good at it so I want to avoid burnout by not doing it every day. Should I work on my work project or personal project during my free time? Is there an alternative to fill my resume if not my personal project?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m 21 and recently graduated with a CS degree (perfect GPA, 4–5 solid projects, but no internship). I’ve been applying for about 4 months now and mostly getting rejections or ghosted. It’s been pretty discouraging and I’m honestly feeling burned out from coding and job hunting.\n\nRight now, I’m working a minimum wage job, but a family friend just offered me a store manager position. It pays $15/hour plus 25% of the store’s monthly profit (around $2k), and I can choose my hours. It would likely come out to around $4.5k–5k/month.\n\nThe downside is:\n\n\t•\tIt could be long hours (possibly 50–70/week)\n\n\t•\tIf I get a CS job later, it might be hard to leave immediately\n\n\t•\tI’m worried about getting “stuck” and drifting away from tech\n\nThe upside is:\n\n\t•\tMuch better pay than I make now\n\n\t•\tLess financial stress\n\n\t•\tTime to recover from burnout\n\n\t•\tManagement/business experience\n\nI’m torn between:\n\n\t1.\tTaking the job and using it as a temporary step while I recover and keep applying, or\n\n\t2.\tTurning it down and going all-in on CS job hunting, even though I’m mentally exhausted\n\nFor people who’ve been in similar situations:\n\n\t•\tIs taking this kind of job a smart move short-term?\n\n\t•\tHow risky is it for my long-term CS career?\n\n\t•\tAny advice on how to balance both?\n\nI’d really appreciate any perspective. Thanks in advance.",
