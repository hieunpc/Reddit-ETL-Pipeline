        "body": "I choose for Data Engineering pretty early in my career and I'm very happy I did so.\n\nWhen you're a Data Scientist, one of your key goals is to extract meaning from data. You run models and try to get insights. It is very often the case though that the data either doesn't show what you would like, or it kind of does, but with pretty low certainty. Even more often the data is so bad that you couldn't really draw any conclusions from it.\n\nThis puts you in a bind. You have to go explain your conclusions to the sales guys and they can't work with 'it sort of shows X, but also kind of Y'. They need to sell a product and they will. So they'll massage your conclusions in ways that you might even not agree with. Or you'll be pressured to massage the data, which I've been asked to do. I always covered my ass with emails although I luckily never needed them.\n\nAs a Data Engineer on the other hand, there is no discussion. Either the data is in the required spot in the required form or it isn't. At the end of the day, your product is finished and whether or not someone can actually do anything with it downstream is not your concern. It's a very liberating feeling and it means I have barely any stress related to work.\n\nI'm not the only person I've encountered who feels similarly and I've even met a few Data Scientists who made a similar switch later in their career for similar reasons.\n\nAnother saving grace is that Data Scientists are a dime in a dozen nowadays. With the AI boom everyone and their cat tried to get some certification somewhere and the quality varies wildly. Data engineering isn't as sexy and there's much fewer people in the field I have the impression. I started before the AI boom, so having seniority at this point in time is very helpful as well.",

I naturally gravitated towards technical specifications and engineering solutions.  I was interested in maths, but having done some statistics courses, it wasn’t a mountain I wanted to climb.\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t over think it.  People swap between DS and DE all the time.  A large company will probably help you transition, pay for training etc because they know there is a great deal of synergy between these teams.  ie.  DE’s will productionise DS models so knowing both sides isn’t a waste of time.\n\nWhere I currently work, DS is seen as a ‘luxury’.  They will increase headcount when times are good, and conversely, DS’s are the first people out the door when times are bad.  This is because they generally work on ‘optimisations’, I guess just like how you would pause remodelling your house if you lost your job and didn’t have income coming in.  DE on the other hand is much more stable.  They need people to keep existing pipelines running, even if new things aren’t being built.  It was how I ended up in DE, I was made redundant as a DS but told I could stay on if I switched teams.  I thought I’d do this while I searched for a new DS position, but I found my proclivities more suited to DE, so never left and never thought about switching back.\n\nGenerally the people who make the best DE’s have done Computer Science or Engineering degrees that involve data transfers like Telecoms.  The people who make the best DS’s have done Science or Mathematics degrees.  Maybe start out in the field where your degree gives you the best foundations?  Otherwise it will be an uphill struggle to get timely promotions.  Make a start and see how you go.",

Lot of A/B tests to see what works and what does not. Something could sound efficient on paper but not as much in business. Experimentation is important in data science.\n\n- Less focus on infrastructure as a data scientist. ML ops or data ops takes care of it most times.\n\n- Accuracy is important in data engineering. Data needs to be ingested and modelled accurately otherwise the data is doubted. Data quality and data sanity are important. Work and what pipelines to design is very much defined by requirements and business. There isn't experimentation.",

Today’s platforms have to support analytics, data science, and increasingly AI workloads alongside traditional BI.\n\nThe criticism of Databricks and Snowflake feels a little unfair; they are not trying to replace data warehousing fundamentals, they are trying to support multiple workloads. Both platforms can absolutely deliver a well-designed data warehouse if the right discipline is applied.\n\nIn my experience, the real issue is people rather than platforms; there is a strong tendency to chase modern tools and certifications while neglecting core concepts such as data modelling and integration. I regularly see engineers openly say they have no interest in modelling, which I would argue is foundational to being effective in this space.\n\nSo I agree with the spirit of the post; that we have lost sight of fundamentals. I do not think modern platforms are the culprit; they simply expose gaps in skills and architectural thinking that were always there.",

In data analytics and engineering the real problems are and always have been people and processes. Technology only enables them. What actually got us here is weak data management and governance.\n\nThat said, I also partly agree with the criticism. Modern data stack tooling has reached a point where many organizations think that throwing Databricks or Snowflake at every data problem and calling it done is enough. This is especially true in organizations where IT (which should not be the owner of data in the first place) is expected to “fix” data issues. They look for technological solutions to what are, in reality, problems of processes, roles, ownership, and culture. In that sense, the frustration expressed by Inmon is very much understandable.\n\nSo the concept of the data warehouse did not fail. Technology simply made it easier to avoid the hard work. Vendors and consultants sold a convenient illusion. Integration and enterprise data are not a tooling problem, they are a design choice and an organizational commitment, and a governance problem. Expecting a platform to solve that is exactly the mistake that keeps repeating itself. Blaming modern platforms for the decline of data warehousing feels like blaming a database for poor data modeling. The real issue is that many organizations never built enterprise data capabilities in the first place.",

If it generates enough business value that you'd carry on (perhaps putting in place a migration plan) - then it's probably fine as a choice. If you're so cost sensitive that a small rise in costs would cause problems, then it's probably not the right choice.\n\nGenerally being heavily invested into Snowflake doesn't concern me too much. Most of the transformation logic is SQL. Unlike say python, or a lot of proprietary solutions SQL code written today will still be good in 20 years time. There aren't any libraries to end up unmaintained. If you *really* need to you can port to another database technology and most of your transformations will port over perfectly. You might need to spin up a solution for tasks, and change your ingestion methodology, but all that business logic will be fine still.\n\nUnless you go completely open source, and want to take on board the substantial overhead with doing that, I'd say it's pretty good value. Vendor lock in mainly comes from the fact that it's really good, rather than vendor lock in from being proprietary. Very little of it is highly proprietary unlike a lot of other ETL methodologies.\n\nWhy aren't you at least using internal stages? There's far less overhead in using COPY INTO vs INSERT unless you're inserting a trivial amount of data. External stages and pipes even less overhead and cost.",

Databricks has this AI-powered coding assistant called Databricks Assistant which can help your data analysts with SQL or Python syntax should they need it.\n\nIf any of your software devs (or data scientist turned software engineer) are required to build web applications, there is Databricks Apps to let you build a web app based on popular frameworks like Flask/Streamlit or even NodeJS. Lakebase can also help if you need low-latency OLTP database for your web app.\n\nYou can also open up Databricks to your business users, business stakeholders, or C-level to let them ask questions about data using Genie or to let them view dashboards.

        "body": "SCD2 is built into the table schema, the code base is based on Merge or UpSert + delete tracking.\n\nI suggest you look at \"Timestamp\" column type if available on your platform, or look into MD5() function which is quite universal, to do \"hashing\" of data, and use a staging layer.\n\nWhen you design properly a SCD2 table in a bronze layer, and have a staging layer in a \"raw\" layer (you should always have a staging layer!) - then a SQL view with the hashed values (the PK columns, the entire data row) then SCD2 becomes a breeze to do. Breeze because you compare two tables, you have one PK column and one HashDIFF column (or TimeStamp from a source DB) that tells you easily what to do.\n\nOften it is deletion tracking the most difficult - because if you get differential data, how do you know what no longer exists in source? In such cases you need an extra pipeline logic just for delete tracking. Mentioning as this is often overlooked and it comes back to bite you at the end.\n\nFor example, you load new data (from a full source or differential source) truncate/load into a staging table. Make a view to create all the extra columns you need, like using MD5() in the view. Use the staging view to do the UpSerts or Merge based on your bronze layer SCD2 historical table and the staging. \n\nFor delete tracking sometimes you need a new pipeline to get a full from source but only the PK column(s), not all the columns, so the file is smaller and the process is quicker. I use a different staging table, a different pipeline, just for this. Or if you are lucky, you can get CDC from source DB and then you have 100% of all changes. If only we had this all the time.\n\nSo basically you read the same data twice, the first time the data are usually files in a datalake or a file share, but it could also be a remote database that you ODBC / OleDB into to run a query. This is usually for on-prem, but I have used ODBC + MySQL remote DBs to gather info, it works really well, and no ELT/ETL tool required - it's all SQL in a stored proc.\n\nSome people create in the staging table all the extra fields to manage for SCD2 and the tool they use to consume the raw data into staging, adds the values to the extra fields, row-by-row. I do NOT like this method, as it puts intelligence inside the ELT/ETL tool making it difficult to manage. An ELT/ETL tool should be simple, just do mapping, Lift & Shift, ideally never fail - just get the data to staging table(s) and let the next level deal with issues. CSV is hell on earth, I use the BLOB technique on foreign CSV files and parse with SQL.\n\nFWIW, this topic (SCD2, 3, 4, hybrid...) is taught in actual classes world wide, maybe look into taking some basic ETL/ELT & BI courses, at least Udemy. My first SCD2 table I did back in 1998 - just to give you an idea on how old this logic is, the actual invention I don't know who - but probably Kimball in the 90's. I had a great database teacher that was ahead of  his time.",

Same works for if any service decides to call my endpoints, I can stop any processing to happen if request data to my endpoint is wrong.\n\nDataclasses - used mainly for internal data transfer. An example for this is, let's say after my Pydantic validation occurs I now want to move around the fields I can set them in a dataclasses and move them around with pass by value/ reference. Now I can do this with Pydantic also but why I shouldn't. Pydantic does have an overhead when it parses the field this is very small but I've hit cases when it matters (Pydantic v2 is faster). Dataclasses are faster when I've already validated the data internal transfer is faster and makes more sense to use a dataclass when I just need to move and play around with the data. \n\nAdditional point database updates I would make a data access layer which would be validated against the schema. I use SQL alchemy here for the models some people use Pydantic here too, optional honestly. This way it makes it easier to unit test too when you abstract everything and loosely coupled. \n\nHope it clears things up!!",

I don’t mean to be rude, just being honest. I’m also really tired and about to go to sleep so. \n\nFrom I can tell, you definitely can, and sometimes want to, use pydantic to load in your api data. It will not only parse and validate it, but it can standardize your field naming too. You can do a lot of cool things with it, like use a TypeAdapter for places where you need different structures that come out of the same API. That being said, I do view it more as an OLTP type tool, it *feels* more row based. For DE tasks, I would reach for DuckDB or polars to read in the API or json data and flatten it. Really depends on your use case and data volume\n\nAs for landing your raw data and then processing it, that’s a valid way to do it IMO. Land your API responses as JSON and then process with whatever tool you pick.",

Tests and freshness checks punch way above their weight, especially for client work where trust in the data matters more than fancy metrics layers. Lineage and docs also get used more than people admit once teams grow.\n\nThe newer features are interesting, but I have seen mixed adoption. Semantic layer sounds great, but many teams already solved that in BI tools or code. Sometimes it feels like dbt is trying to be the control plane for the whole stack, which is nice in theory but adds cognitive load.

E.g. requiring that analytics solutions only use data from gold when in production, but allowing analysts to utilize tables from other layers for their development and testing iterations. \n\n\nDogmatic approaches is reminiscent of the age-old debate/criticism of centralized data warehouses that took years to develop before anyone in the business would get data access, which reduced their value and usefulness and accelerated the development of \"shadow BI\"-setups in business departments that didn't get their needs met. You can't develop in a vacuum and expect users to accept a (to them) long delivery time just because you want to run the data through all the layers in your architecture. Of course, you also have to protect your setup and governance, but sometimes speed of delivery is more important than perfected delivery. ",

Not a big deal for a small/solo project, but at scale it can introduce unintended changes if upstream schemas evolve (new columns, renamed columns, type changes) and can impact downstream models silently.\n* Your models appear to be **full refreshes** (not incremental), meaning tables are recreated on each `dbt run`. In that setup you generally don’t need: `now() as last_updated`   to track row creation/update date This information is already available through **Clickhouse** **system table** called `system.parts`.\n\nOverall: not a complete end-to-end project yet (missing orchestrator and probably lots of other bricks !), but the foundation and structure are solid, nice work setting this up !",

For example, stay long enough to see the Kafka and Debezium work through to something production like, document the impact, then reassess. If the salary gap and notice period are still unchanged, that is your signal. The risk with staying too long is that the learning curve flattens, but the compensation gap keeps widening.

That contract can be stored in a JSON structure and shared with your upstream source - and then be the basis for their testing and yours.  Nothing else will provide as much DQ guarantees as this.  And it can be a simple library call to hand over a row/file/table to a utility for checking.\n   * Anomaly-detection is also valuable to do prior to transformation:  does your input always have 10 million rows and suddenly you only have 65?  Regardless of whether the rows are formatted correctly, you probably have a partial file.  Or how about if one of those columns is historically NULL 1% of the time, and that's ok, but now it's NULL 100% of the time.  Something has changed...\n\nI like doing the above because each of these can typically work with raw data, can catch a ton of problems pre-transform, and isn't much work.  Then once you get into the transforms you'll need to do more of the above, but in that case it'll be for items you couldn't check with raw data - like joins that fail because there's suddenly no matching rows, etc.",

I'm assuming when you say pipeline, that you are talking about a data ingestion that gets incorporated into your larger existing analytical system. That matches my experience with the schema + CSV issues you are describing.\n\nEverything looking fine on the surface but more subtle, complex assumptions about the data being broken post pipeline deployment is something I've run into often. I've had varying degrees of success in trying to proactively identify issues like this. There are a few things that worked for me, particularly when the data source is an external partner. My experience is also in smaller companies where end to end analytics is entirely my responsibility and there is limited support from other colleagues. With that in mind, this kind of validation is imo a balance between getting the pipeline into production quickly and making issue identification and maintenance as easy as possible.\n\n**Before building anything / requirements and assumption refinement:**\n\n* Get all info about the data source you can\n * Ask for data dictionaries and/or entity relationship diagrams -> only commonly seen these available in finance but solves 99% of these problems before they happen\n * Figure out all your critical assumptions and ask about them explicitly (primary keys, important relationships, etc.)\n* Identify key internal stakeholder(s) that have the business context to clarify expectations\n * Who can be your point of contact for escalating + investigating issues down the line\n * Identify what aspects of the data being ingested are critical to *your own* business' processes\n     * Primary keys and most likely a subset of columns/fields rather than everything\n         * That a field exists, is an enum of X possible options, etc.\n     * Things that if your assumption about the data become wrong or broken, then the data becomes unusable or detrimental to the business\n\n**While building:**\n\n* Codify your critical assumptions\n * If these are broken pipeline FAILS -> clear alert that mentions you as pipeline owner and your internal stakeholder with a clear business-centric message\n * Subset of critical fields that must have some characteristics\n* Quarantine/identify your non-critical assumptions\n * Should NOT fail the pipeline so that business critical data can still flow\n * More of a nice to have\n * If a non-necessary or unused field starts breaking assumptions -> alert that mentions only you as pipeline owner with clear technical context, allows you to create a backlog task which can be prioritized appropriately \n\nThere's plenty you could do to abstract and reuse a lot of this functionality in whatever your ingestion/orchestration tool you are using but personally I have been unsuccessful in advocating for this internally.\n\nI am making plenty of assumptions about the latency requirements, criticality of the data to your business, and that you have some kind of semi-mature ingestion framework with alerting capabilities. This also assumes your destination tables are pre-defined with the pipeline and you aren't using some kind of lakehouse pattern which I have less experience with. There are definitely tons of options for approaches to this so I'm curious what others have to say.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss more specific tools here but tried to keep it relatively high level and already wrote an essay.

If the data is \"invalid\" by your criteria, can you drop it on the floor? If so, maybe you can validate it at parse time. But typically you try not to do that.\n\nSchema drift can be tough to solve without a lot of other metadata you need to either derive by profiling the data, OR having users or your system declare it in absolute terms. Both are tough and have complexity in it that may not be obvious to the users of that data. \n\nA pattern I've seen that did okay was to take anything that didn't fit into our target schema, we just threw it into an additional column called `invalid`. From there we can at least write some additional SQL that looks for any records that contain something within `invalid`.\n\nAt the very least this would provide you (or whoever is using your ingested data) the knowledge that _something has changed_, without knowing exactly what. Which in our case, is usually more than enough info to address what schema drift has taken place.",

Also, if you did a merge statement instead of a copy into (just assuming I guess) on primary key, it would probably fix the dupe issue, even if the API returned everything every time.

Like for example in my case I built an app that has a UI & API & another SDK and they all need to talk to the DB (well the UI is just a visual layer). But from there what I had to do was have the SDK attached to the API and both the API & SDK just share the same DB instance and pass the code instance around. But if I couldn't do this, one thing I could do is create an http wrapper to allow for outside requests to hit the DB (sort of like a lightweight API around the DB server) with all the same auth and stuff of course. But... this gets impractical sometimes. Again this only works for one instance though, it's not practical for multiple instances. So beyond that it may be worth exploring other options as others have mentioned. But just my thoughts though.",

Use the INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.TABLES to either limit scanning to particular partitions ( if datetime columns are present). E.g. if upstream did not update in the last 3 days you are good scanning only the last known updated partition instead of full deals.\n3. See a way is the test scripts can be written in a better way. Maybe instead of scanning the entire table scan last paritions etc . Can you avoid hourly and just run it once per day ? E..g if the ingestion is not happening hourly there is no point running them hourly etc. understand the data better and workflow. \n4. Better awareness among the org and your peer group to cross check parameters, timings, query writing. E.g I know a lot queries are just copied pasted from the UI ( which are always written in a quick fix way as exploration) and then they are pasted as such without realizing the downstream consequences.",

The issue is picking a reliable “did data change?” signal that scales and doesn’t miss late-arriving/backfill data. What do you typically gate off?

It's a combination of:\n\n*  Market temperature\n* You as an individual at a technical level\n* You as an individual at a personal level\n* How realistic your expectations are\n\nFrom what I read on the subreddit, people who struggle a lot tend to have very unrealistic expectations for their first role, underestimate how much work is required, as well as overestimate their own position within the job market e.g. no years experience, done one bootcamp, \"can't find a remote job paying $200k USD - job market is COOKED\".\n\nPurely anecdotal although I got into Data Engineering during the previous DE boom 5 years ago, so I had market temperature on my side.  Additionally, I was unemployed so was programming, studying, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours per week as well as applying for jobs within the country I'm a citizen of, so a lot less complications in terms of borders.\n\nBased on what you have written, there is a possible issue with borders although if the subreddit is anything to go by, a lot of US work is being outsourced to your location.

I assume an ML Engineer codes ML / Analytics program this correct? **Trying to understanding where line that the Data Engineer comes up to, and then an ML Engineer role does the tasks of model creation?** Because when I read some of the threads, it is implied the Data Engineer is also coding the ML part - talking about optimising the query on Spark etc. Is optimising of query to be done by ML Engineer for training models and analytics? Or are they referring to optimising data transformation queries written by Data Engineers that is done prior to model build etc.\n\n It would really help to define  the boundary of the Data Engineer and the tasks and technologies used to accomplish the tasks in that boundary prior to model creation and training.\n\nThank you again for the reply.",

It also makes ingestion faster, and less prone to errors.\n\n> those are batches and they scan the full tables in raw\n\nWhen the raw is append only with a load timestamp, it does not have to read all the input data. If you keep a high watermark value stored, you can process just the newly arrived data into the raw vault table for looking for values where the load timestamp is beyond the previous value.\n\n> As the business layer satellites are a join of multiple tables\n\nYou can grab just the keys and load timestamps from each table. Do all the joins on just the keys, then filter for rows where at least one of the load timestamps is greater than the previous high watermark for this process. Then join to the full data for each table. The keys may even be small enough to broadcast, so each joined table can be shuffled just once and with just the data that is relevant.",

If you are receiving full snapshots you do conditional inserts on hashdiff by key so that you don't write the same data twice. That combined with compressible formats means you only keep actual changed data, which means it isn't sized much larger than SCD2.\n\n> Also, using always the timestamps doesn't force you to run an analytical function over the partition sorted by date to obtain the latest record ?\n\nIf you used only the raw vault to query then it would, yes. But part of the BV batch is running logic like those window functions to find the latest version(s) by key to create derived tables.\n\nOn each batch you can take your fresh raw vault data and determine how it would splice into your current SCD2 history, and update that table. The SCD2 table could materialise all the data, or it could be just the keys pointing back to a specific row in the raw vault. Just the keys can work if you need to save space, as doing an inner join still allows predicate pushdown into the raw vault data unlike with filters on window function ordering.",

Then you need machinery to feed all these tables unnecessarily, and pay for all that compute work. It is just not a framework that is optimized for the cloud native tech. It is pointless in that sense. Also, lots of data engineers you hire will ask to leave the project after 6 months for the amount of endless work that the framework demands. All that under the escuse of it being very robust and adaptable to business logic. Well lots argue that is rather preferable having work maintaining simple models that need to be adapted a bit here and there once in a while than having work on a weekly basis for creating tables all in the same way. It is robotic work that nobody likes to do. Data Vaults advantages can be achieved with much easier to maintain frameworks.",

Honestly, I think you have some soul searching to do about “what you want to be when you grow up” and whats important to you.\n\nBridging into Data Analytics might be an option and then transitioning into DS or Statistician/Statistical programming might also be avenues. There’s lots of options but the anxiety would still be a concern to me.\n\nI’d also recommend maybe talking to a mental health professional about your anxiety, it sounds serious - there may be some help they can provide in the form of therapy, coping strategies, or medication.",

This is meant for things like system or temporary files, but it can be annoying in cases like yours.\n\nIf renaming isn’t too disruptive, prefixing with something else is an easy fix. Otherwise, in Spark 3.0 and above, you can tweak behavior with the `spark.hadoop.mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.input.dir.recursive` option (set it true), but that doesn’t affect the underscore rule—hidden files are still skipped.\n\nA more targeted workaround is to explicitly list files you want with something like `spark.read.json(list_of_files)` instead of giving a directory, or you could rename the files as part of your ingest pipeline.\n\nThere isn’t a PySpark flag to disable this hidden file rule, unfortunately. If you need to keep underscores, consider scripting a rename step or using a pattern that Spark will pick up. The docs are a bit buried, but this is standard behavior and catches people out all the time.",

Yes, passthrough had some limitations, but it also allowed you to mount storage without baked-in creds, rely on hyperscaler storage security model, and have multiple engines respect a single security model (think what Fabric OneLake aims to achieve today). For many of us, the model was clean, elegant and worked extremely well because it encouraged an *open* Lakehouse.\n\nWhile Unity Catalog solved some real governance problems, it conveniently became the ONLY path forward for a growing set of feature. There were real tradeoffs made between openness and control, and Databricks obviously chose the latter. Call it “enterprise readiness” all you want, but customer lock-in and monetisation were the primary part of the equation.\n\nThe irony is that Snowflake, once held up as the closed/proprietary villain, is now, in MANY practical ways, the more open platform.",

And as the storage grows, can we archive the old data?\n\nSilver: similar to bronze. Its scale and cost grows proportionally to the business needs. Optimizing compute is a matter of optimizing the query, using spot, tuning knobs, etc.\n\nGold: Many data analysts may not create an optimized query. No filtering, no limit, select *.

Newer data processing framework or libraries are simpler to use and more scalable without a cluster. \n\nTHE RACE TO THE BOTTOM:\nThe big data journey started with Hadoop and then Spark came along. Both technologies require clusters of computers with a lot of setup and maintenance. So Hadoop had it moment but mostly disappeared. It wasn’t the right technology for most of the need for enterprises, unless you are Google. Then cloud data warehouse (redshift, snowflake) became popular, but pretty quickly companies had to pay more than they wanted for pretty simple data processing in most parts. But snowflake at least offered a managed service that took away the infrastructure management away from users. A lot of companies still using snowflake for their BI needs and even analytics. Fast forward to data lakehouse architectures. Now we can do the same than in snowflake on files in s3. The clear winner out of this phase was Databricks due to their integrated approach covering end-to-end processing needs. Compared to other approaches it is simpler and managed. Cost of Databricks is cheaper than data warehouses, but we still pay a premium for compute. Now the datalakehouse evolves with on-process DBs like duckdb that offer same performance with much simpler compute for most use cases. This phase is work in progress and lead by DuckDB. But it promises lower cost at similar performance and simpler data stack compared to the 15 year old spark technology. But no end to end platform yet.\n\nData stack is evolving. Throughout the journey performance is increasing slightly or remain the same as the price is of data processing is getting cheaper.",

        "body": "Speed and cost are local optimisations. In practice, you’re optimising total cost of ownership and organisational throughput over 5 to 10 years. That brings in other dimensions:\n\n**Standardisation and skills**  \nUsing one platform for most workloads simplifies hiring, onboarding, and design decisions. Running DuckDB *and* Databricks or Snowflake already means duplicated mental models, tooling, and operational overhead. Spark skills are also far easier to source today than DuckDB-specific expertise.\n\n**Usability across roles**  \nA data platform isn’t just for DEs. Analysts, analytics engineers, QA, data scientists, and software engineers all need access. Most don’t want to reason about Python internals or query-level optimisation. Platforms like Databricks and Snowflake work because they provide a shared abstraction layer with escape hatches when needed.\n\n**Operations and integration**  \nA “simple VM running DuckDB” isn’t simple in production. You still own OS patching, security hardening, monitoring, backups, scaling, incident response, and integration with IAM, logging, and alerting. That operational load is labour-intensive and expensive.\n\n**Compliance and risk management**  \nEnterprise systems must comply with GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC2, BCBS, etc. Using a certified platform drastically reduces audit scope. Saying “the platform is ISO27001-compliant, we only audit our data logic” is far cheaper than proving compliance for bespoke VM setups.\n\n**Support and continuity**  \nAt scale, systems fail in non-obvious ways. Having access to vendor engineers who understand the internals matters. Enterprises also care about platform longevity; they expect core infrastructure investments to last 5-10 years, not depend on a small ecosystem or a few experts.\n\nOther concerns I’m deliberately not expanding on here include cost attribution, blast-radius reduction, workload isolation and concurrency control, data governance (lineage, column- and row-level security), and long-term exit costs.\n\nBy the way, I think DuckDB is excellent technology, that's not really the problem here because the question isn’t whether it’s fast or cheap in isolation, but whether it minimises risk, effort, and cost at the organisational level.",

        "body": "I'm gonna tell you something that took me way too long to figure out and honestly still pisses me off that nobody just said it to me directly when I was your age.\n\nStop building shit to impress other programmers. Start building shit that actual people need.\n\nYou're seventeen, and coded for like 6 years? Cool. I was similar. And I wasted years, like genuinely wasted them building technically complicated garbage that nobody used. I'd make elaborate systems with clean architecture and clever algorithms and other developers would be like \"wow nice\" and I felt smart. But you know what? That's just jerking off. Nobody outside of programmer circles gave a shit because none of it solved actual problems.\n\nThe real turning point isn't learning another framework or getting better at leetcode or whatever (ofc that's important too at some point). It's when you stop asking \"what's a hard technical challenge I can tackle\" and start asking \"who around me has an annoying problem I could maybe fix\". And I mean really asking. Not imagining problems, not building solutions looking for problems, actually talking to real humans about real annoying shit in their lives.\n\nI wish I'd done at seventeen instead of building my tenth todo app with a new fancy tech stack. Go find someone, it can be your parents, a teacher, local business owner, literally anyone, and ask them what repetitive annoying thing they deal with. Then build the dumbest, simplest possible thing that makes that less annoying. Not elegant. Not impressive to other devs. Just useful.\n\nFor an Example, my friend used to manually copy-paste data from emails into spreadsheets for her work every morning. Took her like 45 minutes. I could've built a script that parsed those emails and dumped it into a CSV in literally an afternoon. But I didn't, because that wasn't \"interesting\" to me. I was too busy implementing a custom database engine for a project nobody would ever use because I wanted to understand B-trees. See the problem? She had a real problem that cost her actual time every single day. I had the skills to fix it in hours. But I never even asked because I was focused on impressing myself and other programmers.\n\nThis will humble you hard. All that clean code and design patterns everyone is proud of... Nobody cares when they can't figure out how to log in. The clever optimization doesn't matter when they just need a button that exports to Excel because that's what their boss wants. \n\nYou know what's funny? Even Linus Torvalds had to learn this lesson. When he built Git, he didn't start by designing the perfect distributed version control system architecture. He started because he was pissed off at BitKeeper and needed something that worked for the Linux kernel workflow, specifically handling huge numbers of patches from contributors he didn't fully trust. Git's internals are actually kind of ugly if you look at them. It's basically a content-addressable filesystem with some scripting on top. But it solved the actual problem he had, which was managing kernel development. All the elegant design came later after people were already using it. He built for the problem, not for the architecture. That's why Git won and all those \"better designed\" version control systems nobody remembers lost.\n\nOr another time, built an inventory system with proper relational database design, normalized tables, foreign keys, the works. User wanted to bulk-edit 50 items at once. Couldn't do it because I'd built individual edit pages and never thought about bulk operations. They just stopped using it and went back to Excel where they could edit multiple rows. My database design was objectively better than Excel. But Excel let them do their actual job faster, so Excel won.\n\nYou'll realize pretty quick that like 80% of what you thought was important is completely irrelevant and all the boring stuff you ignored is what actually matters. Authentication, error messages that actually tell you what went wrong, handling edge cases like what if they upload a file that's too big, making sure it works on their old laptop with Chrome from 2019, having an undo button, that's the stuff that makes or breaks whether someone actually uses your thing.\n\nThis field is packed with people who started young. I've met self-taught developers who picked it up at 25 and they're way better than me at a lot of things because they focused on solving problems instead of collecting technical skills like they're achievements in a video game. There's a guy I used to work with who switched from being a chef at 28, learned to code at a bootcamp, and he's one of the best developers I know. Why? Because he spent 10 years in restaurants learning how to handle stress, communicate with difficult people, and deliver under pressure. Those skills transferred. His code isn't always the prettiest but he ships things that work and people actually **want** to use them.\n\n[continuation in the replies]",

A stupid question that gets answered is better than a stupid question that does not get asked and you remain stuck.\n\n2)when you get this idea about comparing yourself with others then instead of saying \"I might have an imposter syndrome\" then self-diagnosing yourself with it solves nothing. When a person knows more stuff than you then learn from him. When he does something better than you then ask for hints and for advice. People who are more knowledgeable than you are your opportunity not your threat. Talk with people not self-diagnose yourself with irrational stuff.\n\n3)when there are hackathons, open door days, seminars, internship offers, student job fails, then again, talk with people. Use these opportunities. Attend these events. Even when you are saying \"But I do not know anything.\" When you know nothing then you have nothing to lose but only to gain. Be proactive.\n\nFrom technical side:\n\n1)go for degree studies. Pick a university/college that is known for its CS program and apply to it. Does not have to be Harvard University or something. A local state college also does. Without a degree you'll be fighting an uphill battle. For various reasons.\n\n2)do not build calculator apps or TODO apps. Build stuff that matters. You won't be using that calculator app you made. And there is no \"But perhaps somebody might start using.\" No perhaps. If there is no need for it, then do not make it. Make things that matter. Start with yourself. Build stuff for your own use. Something related to your interests and hobbies. Perhaps something to make your daily tasks easier and faster for you. Something for your friends and family. Like this you are learning to solve real world problems not making useless template \"projects\" that everybody is copy-pasting from some tutorial.\n\n2)Leetcode and competitive programming are useless in the real world. Yes, there are companies that might ask such questions during their interview phase, but other than these, useless. Prioritize actual real life problem solving not focus on how to make an X task as fast as possible. DSA (data structure and algorithms) has its place but that place is not in Leetcode nor in competitive programming. Apply DSA in your projects, instead.",

I’ve taught software engineering to a couple hundred people. There is a spectrum for what you’re describing. I used to call it rabbit hole vs. fuzziness. Some people are comfortable moving on with just a vague understanding of a topic (these people are “fuzzy” on the details). Others can’t move on until they’ve understood every last piece (they get lost down the rabbit hole). Go too far on the spectrum in either direction and you have problems. In my experience with people learning programming, you run into way more people having problems because they’re too “fuzzy.” But you DO get some people who struggle because they consistently go too far down the rabbit hole — even when working on a specific project, even with a tight deadline. You should 100% address this. I have two tips:\n\nFirst, keep a very dynamic, organized todo list. What I mean is, before you start working on pretty much anything, you should explicitly write out high-level goals and todo items. Generally, what do you aim to accomplish? And what do you think the high-level steps are that you need to take to get there? Then as you work (and get a better sense of what needs to be done on a granular level), start to populate more specific sub todos (nested/indented below the correct parent todo). Cross todo items off as you complete them — and add more as you realize you’re missing them. You should be switching back and forth between doing the work and managing the todo list. Keep the todo list correctly organized in a hierarchy (sub todos indented below the correct parent). This process is helpful for a number of reasons, but in your case the biggest one is it helps keep you focused on the bigger picture. You’re constantly reminded how what you’re doing fits in to getting you to your initially stated goal. That way you’re working toward the goal rather than being distracted by every single thing you don’t totally understand.\n\nKeep a separate list of open questions. Writing them down can help you resist the urge to chase down all the answers right away. You can always come back to the list and answer the questions later if time permits.",

I can teach a toddler to write letters, doesn't mean the toddler can write words. And it doesn't mean the toddler can write a syntactically right and meaningful sentence.\n\nWriting is easy. You just put letters one after another. Learning the words is harder, you have to know the words. Making a meaningful sentence is very hard.\n\nIt requires you to have an idea to express, then choose the right words, in the right orders, with the right nuances to get your listener to understand you.\n\nThis is all about code here. Learning \"for\", \"if\", \"while\", \"switch\", \"function\", \"null\"... All those keywords that have a specific meaning. You know most of them.\n\nI guess that if I asked you to write a loop over an array you could achieve it. The issue comes with complexity.\n\nYou don't know what to express and even if you know what to express, you aren't experienced enough to know how to express it if the complexity rises.\n\nFrom my point of view, if my take makes sense to you, you'll have to work through that. It took me 2 years to get that mindset. It takes more or less time for different people depending on where they start and how efficient their learning process is. You need more time, more practice.\n\nMake projects, complex ones. Do some more DSA. Work the problems in your brain, try your solution on the computer, get the result, fix and restart the process. Look on the internet for information and solutions, but don't copy directly, understand and inject the solution in your code, try it, see it, feel it, deeply.\n\nOn another note: feeling dumber than you thought. \n\nI don't think you are stupid, but I don't know you. It's relative to what you think and expect here. I think you just had a revelation on the Dunning Kruger effect. Feels like science, not sure it is, but the intuition is pretty on point IMO. \n\nThe less experienced in something, the more confident you are in it. \n\nYou hit the reality check. And you placed yourself on \"the mountain of stupidity\". But it doesn't mean you are stupid, it's just a biased view. Something we all do. Don't blame yourself. Being aware of that make you smarter than a lot of people. Use this to understand where you stand more than trying to blame yourself.",

Programs are long term projects.  The goals the project has on day one will not be the same goals the project has 1 year in.  New things happen, assumptions on what is important might change, and you need a cycle to manage this reality.  Waterfall strategy only works short term, agile strategy is what separates success stories from failures long term.  This is, again, something that comes with experience.\n\nAs far as what technologies survive long term?  Well, bash and linux scripting, javascript (specifically async), sql (on the administration and optimization side), and react state as a design pattern I feel are all key.  Linux in particular hasn't changed much since I learned the basics 20 years ago.\n\nGood ideas will persist and better ideas will replace them over time.  This is just how it goes.

        "body": "source: Professional Programmer since 1990\n\nHere are some skills which, in my experience, help keep people in demand. These are all skills one can learn, hone and master if you want.\n\n\n6. Learn the basics. Understand how computers works, how software works. For instance, what is actually happening when a line of code calls an api function and gets a result? Become familiar with general architectural principles/patterns to help know when to apply what, and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different tools and frameworks. For instance, understand why certain architectures, languages and frameworks exist, and their pros/cons. Why does C matter in some cases, while in others Python or R might be a better choice? When should you use third-party libraries and frameworks, and when should you not take on extra dependencies? This leads to the next item. \n\n5. Moving comfortably between deep debugging and a wider perspective and knowing when to dive in, when to zoom out, and how to switch quickly between the two.\n\n6. Scoping problems quickly. Recognising when you have enough information to act, and when you need to pause and go andlearn more.\n\n1. Be good at delivery. Being able to get things done and helping manage your work well.  If people can trust you to get things done, they are more likely to want you on their team. Everyone takes time to get better at estimation.  Practice getting better by reflecting on why sometimes things took longer/shorter and where you might need to plan better. \n\n2. Knowing when to move fast and accept trade-offs, and when to slow down and lift quality. Knowing  to trade off quality, reliability, (all the 'ilities') etc \n\n2. Always be learning. Stay curious about new ideas and whether they make things better or worse. Spending regular time getting hands-on with new technology, techniques, processes and engineering practices matters. There is endless information out there, so be selective, but genuinely interested. Whatever your preferred medium for learning is, make sure you get a good spectrum of quality info\n\n3. Being able to step out of the code and talk to senior leaders about risks, benefits and costs. This means understanding the bigger picture well enough to help them make decisions that affect the organisation, without getting lost in detail. You have to be genuinely interested in their problems to really understand them. They will appreciate it generally.\n\n4. Bringing technical and non-technical people together to solve problems, both day to day and long term. Knowing who to involve and when is a very great skill. This can be applied whether you're in an org or working in your business for others \n\n\n7. Being a heavyweight engineer. Someone with N years of deep experience and judgement, not the same year repeated N times.\n\n8. Be good at spotting trends and patterns early and calling them out so plans can be adjusted in time. This applies at every level, from yourself and peers, all the way to the big bosses.\n\n9. Being a decent person. Don't be the twat that thinks they know everything and treats others with disdain. Even if you do know more, you should treat people with respect. Some will be dicks who don't return the favour, but most people I've found just want to do good work and get on in lif. If you treat them with decency, they are far more likely to help you achieve your goals. \n\n10.  Be a producer. Most people are consumers of stuff. If you go out of your way to be a producer. This could be as simple as taking time to share your knowledge with others, or even speaking up in discussions, even to ask questions. You'll be more noticed and more likely to be in their mind when people want to get something done. Often this leads directly to getting better work and with it more impactful rewards.  \n\n\nThis is a bit of a haphazard list. And you'll see that I've not listed any particular tech. It took me a long time to transition from being quiet and technical to being more interested in the bigger picture and interacting with others more. I really wish I had this list when I was a junior.  Overall, this transition, I feel, has made my software engineering much better.",

In fact, most of the money that was made in that process is now going into AI development, but they already have the barons in place there. It's not the same free-for-all the early internet was, so a recession is happening now. I think we probably all need to take a moment to mourn the fact that our \"golden age\" is coming to a close.

In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.\n\nWhen you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!\n\nHere’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. \n\nIn practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. \n\nIt is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",

        "body": "In a traditional UNIX system, when you tell the OS \"I want to open file /home/alice/notes.txt\" the OS says \"OK, your file is file #3.\"  The number (3) is a *file descriptor*, it's an integer ID assigned by the OS.  Usually the first file you open is file #3, the next one is #4, the one after that is #5, etc.\n\nIn traditional UNIX sockets, when you say \"I want to make a network connection\" the OS says \"OK, your network connection is #3.\"  Then later you can say \"I want network connection #3 to connect to server 10.234.5.67 on port 80,\" followed by \"Send the bytes 47 45 54 20 2f 0a 0a over network connection #3\".\n\nMost of today's networking systems evolved from traditional UNIX sockets and work basically the same way, even on \"non-UNIX-like\" platforms such as Windows.\n\n> Is a socket an object?\n\nThe socket is the object in the OS's internal data structures that is manipulated when you tell the OS to do something with network connection #3.\n\n> Is the socket a number?\n\nFor the purposes of asking the OS to do something with a socket, the socket is #3...but \"3 means the connection between this computer and 10.234.5.67\" is only valid in the context of a specific conversation your program had with the OS.\n\n> Is the socket a file?\n\nThe \"numbers the OS hands out, like #3 above\" are called *file descriptors*.  They were originally made for files, but were adapted for sockets.  When you want to write the word \"hello\" to a file that you previously opened and the OS told you it was file #3, you tell the OS \"Write these bytes to file descriptor #3:  68 65 6c 6c 6f\".\n\nOne interesting decision they made was that if #3 refers to a network connection instead of a file, then *you can still tell the OS to read or write bytes exactly the same way*.\n\nA socket isn't a file, but it sort-of acts like one.\n\n(UNIX domain sockets are a different beast.  I'm not going to discuss them here.)\n\n> Is a socket an IP:port combination?\n\nNo.  IP:port combination is a setting you put on the socket for outgoing connections.  For incoming connections you set a port; the OS only gives you connections from others requesting that port.  You can also optionally set an IP address for incoming connections, sometimes called a \"bind address\".  In case your machine has multiple IP addresses, the bind address tells which one you're interested in getting connections from.\n\n> when creating an HTTP server, why do we use sockets\n\n\"Why do we use sockets to make an HTTP server?\" is like asking \"Why do we use a print statement to put data on the screen?\"  Because that's what the system provides.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff going on under the hood!  For example the humble print statement could be replaced with a syscall or a BIOS interrupt or writing pixels directly to a framebuffer or [building your own graphics card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs).\n\nBut as a beginner you don't want to think too much about the underlying layers just yet; you'll just get confused and overwhelmed.  \"Use a socket for network connections\" is the networking equivalent of \"Use the print() statement to put text on the screen.\"",

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04\\_dpk&t=4239s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04_dpk&t=4239s) You learn SQL, C, Python, HTML/JS/CSS, Networking, and Flask.  \n  \nGenerally, you \\*alone\\* decide what you need to know based on the problems you would like to solve. Nobody else does. The deep knowledge beyond 'checkboxes someone told you to fill' comes from your own independent learning. \n\nTo learn 'real coding', pick something in your life you want to automate, or you wish was better. That's the key. Toy projects are fine, but it is nice to make something someone can use. Say you are in a Discord server, why not make a bot that does some useful task? As you make the bot, let people test the commands, see if they identify errors.   \n  \nThe Python classes you teach to kids, what resources do they have to learn? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a pretty website with all the information related to the course? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a Leetcode style interface to do problems at your website? Wouldn't you want to tell them, \"Hey kids, look at this website \\*I made\\*, let me know if there are any problems with it?\"\n\nIs there any software you use you think is dated? \n\nAs you make these useful projects, you get a hunger for wanting to improve it incrementally. You identify the necessary technologies to learn as you make these useful projects.\n\nif you were making my website suggestion, the learning could be like this:  \n\\---\n\n1. \"i wanna make a website. how do i make a barebones site?\" -> consult youtube, perhaps watch Harvard CS50 for an HTML introduction, watch other youtubers you like. copy down the examples the lecturers give, maybe afterwards start writing your own barebones site. when you start writing, you consult documentation for intricate questions. learning generally goes: YOUTUBE VIDEO \\[brief intro\\] -> WRITE CODE -> CONSULT DOCUMENTATION | Repeat.\n\n2. \"i wish the site was pretty!\" -> learn css, watch a vid on css, put it in your site\n\n3. \"damn, this code is getting messy... maybe i need this fancy react.js format to make the webpage snappier & stop repeating myself.\" -> learn react.js, watch a video, start writing it, consult documentation as needed\n\n4. \"i wish the kids had a pretty editor they could write in... oooh what's this, monaco editor? i'll use it in my project.\"\n\n5. \"what's this tailwind css thing i've heard about? it could make making my site prettier easy, lets try it.\"\n\n6. \"hmmm... i want my site to have a backend so they can submit code.\" \\*google\\* \"oh, what's this, Judge0 is a framework that allows me to implement a judging system for the coding problems students submit?\" \"hmm... flask is good for site backends? lemme try it out!\"  \n\\---\n\nLearn by DOING... there are 'buzzwords' to know, such as: Docker, Tailwind CSS, PostgresSQL, CI/CD, Flask, Django, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn. But the main way to learn these things is writing useful software you care about",

As far as react, I fiind react to be too daunting of a skill to learn when you are just learning javascript from scratch - start a little simpler and learn how the DOM works in a website, and how you can manipulate the DOM to create dynamic effects on a web page such as responding to clicks and looking up autocomplete search results with ajax.\n\nWhat you have to understand is react is a solution to the difficulty of doing the basic DOM manipulation when programs start getting more complex, but it itself is just working with basic DOM manipulation under the hood.  When you understand what it is doing under the hood then you are able to better understand why it works the way it works.",

Pick a small annoyance in your own life or school routine and try to automate or improve it, even if the result is boring and ugly. The learning happens when you hit decisions about structure, tradeoffs, and maintenance, not when the project idea is exciting.\n\nAlso, getting lost in frameworks like React is normal. They assume context about state, architecture, and collaboration that beginners rarely have. Those concepts usually click after you have struggled through a few messy, self directed projects, not before.",

At first I just stored the data in a pandas dataframe (a super easy way to create tables in Python). Later I figured out how to put the data in a SQLite3 database. As I continued I learnt how to create plots and test trading strategies.\n\nI believe it’s a good starting point if you know a little python beforehand. The project will grow with you as you improve. When you have some basic code down you can start to implement databases, JIT compilation, asynchronous code, genetic algorithms and other concepts.",

Something that’s bitting more than you can chew can be good. It forces you to think about modularity and separation of logic. \n\nTutorials can be good as a reference, but not worth copying and pasting beyond getting a foundation, like a working web page or mobile app that’s half way presentable with standard practice folder structure.

One thing I do think people don’t talk about much is how well such creative pursuits complement each other. I tried to learn do comp sci when I was 19 or so and got in my head telling myself I wasn’t cut out for it, not good at math, disciplined enough, etc. A decade or so later having spent years working on my writing I have the experience to know those voices are false.

Three things helped me quite a bit: \n\nFirst : I attempted to learn a few times, but didn’t make great progress until I got really consistent about learning.  At one point I had a pretty long commute on the bus, so I got a laptop and started working every day.  That’s when my skills went from “I sort of understand” to “I can actually make things that are helpful”.\n\nSecond : There are lots of different options for learning: books, coding websites, YouTube, paid tutorials.  They all have their pros and cons, but ultimately none of them will teach you.. you have to teach yourself.  I wouldn’t worry about finding the perfect resources.  The goal should be to learn enough to take the training wheels off and start building things on your own.\n\nThird :  It sounds like you have tried a bunch of things already.  Different languages, web, etc.. I started out in a similar way.  I just wanted to “learn programming”..  I was making progres, but it was a bit scattered.  I eventually started creating some workflow helper tools in Maya for a particular project. They ended up being used by the whole team, and I started spending a lot of my time adding features and improvements. This focus on one language (python) and one purpose made a big difference.\n\nI’m sure there are lots of ways to do it, this is just what helped me.  Good luck!",

In my country, some of the best paying and hardest to fill dev roles are for COBOL developers because COBOL is the ancient backbone of a lot of finance and government systems. \n\nWhat you learn to build is also probably more important than the language itself (although these are often related). For instance, python developers are in demand because of the boom in machine learning and AI, if you learn python but don't develop skills in machine learning or AI you're going to find relatively fewer jobs available to you.",

        "body": "The best source for learning OOP is learning Smalltalk. Squeak is a modern Windows implementation. Don't go crazy learning the language like you're going to make a career of it - if you're fast at picking up syntax, you'll probably do the most learning in just a few hours. Smalltalk is a single-paradigm, OOP language. It is **THE** OOP language most modern OOP has derived from.\n\nThe principles of OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; but these principles (idioms) don't *MAKE* OOP, they each exist in nearly every other programming paradigm - imperative programming has all of these idioms. These principles *FALL OUT* of OOP as a natural consequence.\n\nOOP is the paradigm of message passing. I don't move your arms for you - nor do I COMMAND you to open your umbrella, I just have to tell you it's raining. You have autonomy and agency to do whatever is appropriate in response. You could ignore me, you could open your umbrella, you could tell me to buzz off, you could call the police.\n\nObjects are a black box that can send and receive messages. In C++, standard streams are the de facto message passing interface, and you have to integrate some of it's interfaces into your implementation - for us, we have implementation level control over the details. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level feature built right in, which is convenient, which was conventional for the 50s and 60s, but Bjarne took certain issue with that - hence he made C++ the way it is.\n\nAn object is implemented in terms of state and functions. Your state is typically member fields and objects. Encapsulation *isn't* about tightly coupling functions with **DATA**, it's about classes modeling behaviors by enforcing invariants in member state. Data is bulky and dumb - data doesn't DO stuff. State is an implementation detail. A car has an engine, and so the throttle has to pass a message to the carburetor to accelerate. An engine has an RPM, which is just a number. In C++, you'd mix these types and concepts, in Smalltalk even numbers are objects.\n\nSmalltalk is very dynamic and has no type safety. You can ask an integer to capitalize itself; at runtime, it can either ignore the message, or respond with a `:dontknowmessage`, or defer to an exception handler. C++ allows for type safety - another reason Bjarne invented C++, but there's a fair amount of syntax to go with it.\n\nVery few multi-paradigm languages get OOP correct. The 1990s were TERRIBLE for OOP. Eternal September came in 1993 - when more people entered comp-sci than the industry as a whole could absorb and mentor them; OOP was oversimplified to the point of being wrong, but the egotistical blind were confidently leading the blind, who couldn't have known better.\n\nAs a result, you get \"C with Classes\", which is what I'd call most all of it - even in Python. It's actually a strictly imperative style that doesn't have an OOP bone in its body. Getters and setters are a consequence of the C type system, and are often seen in frameworks - but if you're not writing in C, if you're not writing a framework, they're an anti-pattern. Classes model behaviors and enforce invariants - a car can accelerate, turn, stop and start... They can't get make, get model, get year. The car doesn't use those properties to implement it's behavior. Those properties can be associated with the car in a map or table.\n\nThere are many kinds of polymorphism, and late binding (virtual functions) are just one of them. Javascript has this in spades since you can just ASSIGN additional functions to instances - they are not strictly bound to a prototype. There are several kinds of static and dynamic polymorphisms - function overloading, type erasure, multi-dispatch, overlapping types, indirection...\n\nThen inheritance principally models IS-A aggregation or HAS-A composition. There are other types, like C++ has LIKE-A. While neat, inheritance is often misunderstood and misapplied - for everything you might think you want to use it for, presume you're wrong, first.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a book on the subject, the seminal tome is `A Theory of Objects (Monographs in Computer Science)`. Good luck meeting anyone who has ever heard of it, let alone read it. When I tell you you'll likely never meet a developer who has the first clue what OOP is, I mean it. This is our industry's singularly biggest Dunning-Kruger.\n\nNote that Java has no de facto message passing interface. Not like Smalltalk. Not like C++. Many languages, like ECMAScript, Java, and C# are so fundamentally wrong about OOP they'll tell you that function calls ARE message passing. Absolutely insane. If that were the case, then Assembly is a first-class OOP language.",

You have a choice: be a dummy like everyone else and call everything Object Oriented - making the term meaningless, or actually understand what it is.\n\nI'm warning you that almost everything you're ever going to hear about OOP is wrong. You'll be told that OOP is:\n\n    public class car {\n      private int speed;\n\n      public int getSpeed() { return speed; }\n      public void setSpeed(int speed) { this.speed = speed; }\n    }\n\nAnd this is wrong. But everyone SAYS this is right. There is nothing OOP about this code whatsoever. The principles don't make the paradigm, the paradigm makes the principles. In Java, you need to make messages and a mechanism for passing them between objects.\n\nYou can create objects in Java, but Java isn't inherently Object Oriented. Having objects isn't enough. Fuckin' C has objects - it's explicitly in the language standard, but no one thinks of C as Object Oriented.\n\nI want you to have a chance of understanding what OOP is.\n\nYou won't understand OOP until you study Smalltalk and original materials from the OOP era before the late 90s disaster. You cannot understand the technology without understanding the history.",

If you don't have anything to say, just ask questions, ask for clarification, inject yourself into the conversation. You will have more impact, you will even have an easier time staying engaged.\n\nIt's true that some people truly are more talented at particular skills than others, for sure. But I think a lot of \"talent\" isn't innate ability, but more like a very minor calibration of personality that slightly reduces inhibitions to do something. Imagine if you were 5% more likely to speak up, or 5% more likely to cook a meal, or 5% more likely to exercise each day. Over time it could create a huge difference in outcomes. 5% is a small enough margin that, even if it isn't your DNA, you can just consciously make yourself do it. Old fashioned discipline or initiative or whatever. It really does work!",

Main point being is that I was incredibly uncomfortable constantly\n\n\nAfter my time in retail, I looked at a bunch of public speaking videos and charisma videos online. Started applying them in my day-to-day. It made a massive difference. My boss at the Time was a very charismatic guy, and he helped me a lot with how to navigate the business world. I wouldn't have been able to even talk to my boss beforehand if it wasn't for pushing myself before. So essentially, put yourself in uncomfortable positions constantly. Yeah it'll be awkward, but it stops being after a while. There are books on the subject. The one I read was \"how to talk to anyone\"\n\n\nYou got to get out of your comfort zone is the biggest thing I want anyone to realize. I also did a public speaking course which was incredibly nerve-wracking, but unbelievably helpful.\n\n\nI'm not trying to convey to you that I'm the best public speaker or anything like that. But I quite literally went from not being able to look at people and shake their hands, to be able to talk business effectively with executives.

        "body": "While C might not be a \"requested\" language as in you'll seldom see it on a job listing, it is definitely a \"desired\" language by devs and technical managers.\n\nTo explain this better, a job listing might list they want a developer who knows Java, C#, or Python. When you apply with only knowing C, the non-technical HR recruiter will probably gloss over your resume. It's a shame because a technical manager would see you know C and realize \"hey this person knows a low level language and it's easier for them to probably adapt to and learn Java because they already know a lot of coding fundamentals\"\n\nThe thing about learning C is not just learning the language, you are learning invaluable skills for programming itself, skills which are often missing for devs who only learned say Python. When I took organic chemistry, the professor said you'll almost never need any of this knowledge outside of a lab, but what the skills you learn from this course will be beneficial - critical thinking, problem solving, how to tackle multifaceted problems in different ways. Learning C is kinda like that, you're learning skills that most programmers never bothered to learn, skills which are highly desirable to managers if they know them.\n\nSo my advice is keep learning C and keep progressing. If you wanna get a job, maybe learn Rust or Golang because those are hot new languages that are getting a lot of buzz from employers. And if you wanna learn a high level language then go with Java or C#",

Python is second to SAS in this regard, though it shouldn't be. If you want a true comparable language, it would be Python or Fortran. Python would rely on modules. Fortran is an old language, but it's latest standard was ratified in 2023. It's nowhere near dead, it's typically the first language of choice for use on supercomputers. It's not clumsy and archaic - it focuses on computation, and it's very restrictive to force you to code to the machine. For example, functions cannot alias parameters, so the compiler can optimize more aggressively.\n\nBut then write your functions in Fortran and export them as an R module.",

This is why keeping track of things and being mindful is very important.\n\nWhen I was starting out, I didn't understand a lot of things, both about coding in a general sense, but also the nuances of what I was working on, the problems I was facing, and how to best resolve them. There was problems I couldn't solve, ideas I couldn't put into reality. Now, I am able to do them, even if I need to refer to documentation or the occasional reference of similar code to get an idea of how to resolve my problem.\n\nThis is true with other skills too. 10 years ago, I could never model and animate for video games. Now? I do it as a hobby, I'm not the best, but I do decent enough that people enjoy my work. It was hours and hours of having fun, creating art, studying other games and their animations, learning some foundations & theory.\n\nThere wasn't any single magical moment. I had to be mindful, step back, and realize how easy and fast it was, and that even if a project was difficult, I understood enough to begin working on it.\n\nIt is okay if you find you have gaps in your knowledge, those are areas to improve in.

After my ComSci bachelor, I worked for 3 years and after getting an admin job at a university, I went to get my masters since it was free. The work experience is infinity more valuable practically and on your resume. Imo, I’d keep trying to find a job and decide if you want a masters later. Try not to be picky but don’t sell your soul. Look for postings in local government, federal government offices, or other universities. I can’t guarantee they have the best tech practices, in fact I know many that don’t, but they’re always looking for positions and a good start to build a resume.",

Being able to turn an idea into something working without depending on others gives you a lot of speed and clarity early on.\n\nRegarding Rails vs full-stack JavaScript, it really comes down to focus. Rails is great for learning how a product is put together on the backend and lets you ship quickly because it’s very structured and opinionated. JavaScript can feel messier at first, but using the same language for both frontend and backend is powerful if your goal is to build products on your own and understand the whole stack.\n\nIn practice, the language matters less than finishing projects. While building theORQL, what helped the most wasn’t choosing the “perfect” stack, but learning how to build, break things, debug, and iterate quickly. Those skills transfer no matter what you use.",

Other times, you get into a rabbit hole because of a structural error, and, on those cases, it is worth to be patient and learn the reasons, as well as the other ways around to do what you wanted to do. Many times, there are many ways to do that, so it's valuable to understand them, their pros and cons, and choose one.\n\nLast, it's nice, if possible, to not code too much before trying to see the program or algorithm in action, even if not complete. This can help to keep the motivation. And it's nicer when you are coding something you actually want to.",

So you just need more practice. Maybe try some of the simpler problems on Hackerrank or such sites and see if you can figure them out by yourself. \n\n\"Optimizing\" an algorithm is basically trying to recognize a pattern, so you can do a LOT LESS WORK than you think you need to at first.

Or for some other wrong reason?\n\nDid somebody use Excel as a step in a workflow to move service addresses to a new software package a few years back?

In some ways, they are similar, so the choice comes down to your preference.  Which do you find more interesting,\n   * Data exchange and communication between computers, or\n   * Shared processing between computers?\n\nIf it's the communications, then \"Advanced Computer Networks\" wins.

I'm designing and building some DIY solar garden lights where the LEDs do interesting animations. I haven't found any commercial lights like what I want. To finish the project, I will have to code my first embedded microcontroller, design the electronics, learn to design circuit boards and have them manufactured, design and 3d print the housing.\n\nThis may seem overwhelming, but I've been taking it one little step at a time. It's not linear, though, not steps in a straight line. Sometimes, working on the software gives you bright ideas for changing the hardware to make the software smaller/better, and vice versa.\n\nThis project pretty much illustrates why experienced developers encourage you to pick a project that interests you as a tool for guiding your learning. It gives you something concrete but with unknowns to work on.",

It's best read as more of a historic classic; someone wanting to actually learn C in-depth in 2025 should look for a more modern resource, with modern C standards, modern library expectations, modern expectations for compiler flags (like ASAN, or [the openSSF recommendations](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html)) etc.\n\nA lot has happened in the world of C in the four decades-ish since the release of K&R.",

It wouldn’t make sense to read the whole documentation from front to back before you open your text editor. Similarly, you wouldn’t want to implement a brand new project each time you completed a new section of their docs; that’d be too many projects.\n\nYour best bet is to have a loose idea as for you want to build, and then implement the things you learn as you go. And ofc you will learn stuff you don’t need, but you can try those things out and then leave them behind.\n\n*disclaimer*: if you are fairly comfortable with the material you’re trying to learn (if you are already familiar with it or similar tech) then you may actually just read their documentation and not need to implement to practice.",

Our boss the director of operations, asked us to make a brand new ERP to replace our use of Microsoft dynamics.  This never happens in a reasonable world.  He asked us what language we wanted to write it in.  My guess is that that almost never happens.  We both said Java, without any pre communication on the subject.  He asked us if we already knew that.  We both said no.  He said ok do it.\n\nWe learned Java while making this, while being paid.  So yea learn while you build.  Doing is far more educational than education.",

Our team have seen much better results and project velocity in training engineers up in software development than we have in trying to teach software developers about the AEC space. All your current experience plus a reasonable amount of software development knowledge should open up some exciting doors.\n\nMy second observation that you are more than welcome to ignore is that, based on your comment at least, you might be at risk of spreading yourself quite thin. Python alone is going to open up hundreds of rabbit holes you can dive into, web development is fantastic to have an understanding of especially if you want to hook your python scripts up to services or APIs but again is a bit of a behemoth, and ethical hacking is of course a huge field in itself.\n\nI'm not trying to dissuade you from any of it, it sounds like you find loads of it interesting which is fantastic, but focusing on one at a time to a reasonable depth and making sure to cover your fundamentals would be my advice. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is a great course / website / book if you want to start seeing some results early on. LLMs can be great personal tutors too if you're happy to be patient with them when they lose the plot, but they're pretty double edged in that they will also rob you of learning opportunities if you lean on them too heavily.\n\nHope some of that helps!",

Because I used to have the same questions when starting out years ago.\n\nDicts and classes are different, but both can be made to do similar things (ie composing objects from scalar types).\n\nThe difference is that, in most languages, classes provide neat abstraction features, like inheritance and methods, and greater control about how you can use it.\n\nClasses can be defined, shaped, and optimized however you like, while dictionaries will just be dictionaries which is optimized for doing 1 thing that is O(1) access time with acceptable storage for the key space.\n\nOn optimizations, let’s say you’re modeling a square rectangles. With class, you can just define it as having 2 fields like this\n\n{ width: int, height: int }\n\nEvery instance of this rectangle object will cost you 2 ints of memory space. If the int is 64 bit, then your rectangle is just 8+8=16 bytes each, and 10 rectangles will cost you 160 bytes.\n\nIf you instead wish to use a hash map/dictionary to represent the rectangle with int width and height, that dictionary is probably using much more space than just 2 ints because how hash maps are implemented. If you have multiple such rectangles, it’ll waste more space pretty quickly due to having to initialize mostly empty map to store 2 values. Every insert incur further work as the program needs to hash and potentially resize the haystack or change hash function to fit more keys.\n\nAnother thing to think about is a dictionary is just a hash map, so its access time is slower than just field access (it has to compute the hash value of the key, whereas with class, the location of the field value within the object is already known).\n\nOh and another thing is with dict/map, you don’t know if you’re gonna have a value at that key unless, you know, you access it. This happens at runtime. With classes, it’s a compile error if you’re accessing the field that does not exist.\n\nLast thing is maintainability and DX - with maps, if you decide to change the “key” you’ve been using pervasively like class fields, you’re gonna have to change all occurrences of those string keys. Whereas with classes, your LSP might support renaming that field with just a press on F2. This is very useful when the codebase is huge.\n\nUse maps to store values when each key is considered sibling or equivalent to each other, e.g. mapping post codes to region names. Think of it like dynamic lists/arrays, but with key access instead of index access.\n\nUse classes to encapsulate more complex objects that you want to extend with methods and your own initialization rules, etc.\n\nI’m sure you’ll get it the more complex your program becomes.",

There are a few tuple syntax options.  There is also a dynamic type which is pretty close to duck typing.  Your basic typed options are struct, class and record.  A record is a class with a lot of sugar and what I'll reach for initially.\n\n> c# the statement is so complex\n\nA code example would be good here.\n\n> I read that classes are faster in execution.\n\nDepends.  Strong types allow for a lot of optimization.  However, in the end, you're running functions against data.\n\n> need for all the explicit type declarations\n\nDepends on where you want to fail.  Using type declaration allow for a lot of issues to be caught at compile time.

Everything is basically just a dictionary essentially (every object you can just ref properties by saying obj[“prop”]). \n\nTo the point that some people want the flexibility of dynamic programming but will actually go to the effort of invoking the Rosslyn code generator to verify property names at compile time to get the benefits of both worlds. Like if you’re consuming a json file in a data dictionary you can use this feature to compile time verify property names and so forth. \n\nPersonally I hate any form of loose typing bc it’s a ticking time bomb if not for you, another developer.

        "body": "So I think you are misinterpreting what a class is; a class is a language-based concept that allows you to create custom data structures that also have behavior (or member functions) attached to it.  This allows you to make ANY data structure that you want that follows the rules of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.  Classes allow a language to be called object oriented, since in object oriented programming, the focus is on creating more and more of these data structures which when declared in code are called objects, hence object oriented programming.\n\nA dictionary is a data structure.  So you can for instance create your own dictionary class implementation, though I’m sure one exists in the C# STL. \n\nSo two completely different things essentially; a class/object is a programmer-implemented data structure with associated behavior(s) attached which follows the 4 laws of Object Oriented Programming, and a dictionary is a data structure that if you really wanted to you could implement that.\n\n\nAs for your second question, explicit type declarations are very important in the programming world because they essentially allow one to know at all times a general idea of how many bytes/chunks of memory a variable is taking up, as well as help with avoiding implicit type conversions which can cause a lot of issues.  You won’t see this come up much as a beginner but the second you start working on anything that’s a bit complex, you will see why this is a big deal.  This was something that I struggled with when I started in JavaScript, as the dynamically interpreted types would lead to really odd behavior at unexpected times. \n\nThis becomes more apparent the further you get towards the hardware; python is built upon a great deal of layers to emulate natural language to its best ability, whereas in C/assembly you are dealing with extremely explicit operations that having a byte offset could cause the entire program/system to crash.  To give even more explicit control for this reason, you will later see C/C++ users will use even more strict types like uint_32 and long long or even stranger looking types to someone who has never used lower level programming languages.  Also, tbh, it just helps with readability, being able to know exactly what each type is defined as.\n\nAs far as running a script, anything dealing with Windows is gonna be a pain in the ass (I’m an arch Linux user if u can’t tell by my windows cynicism) but it’s what u gotta do since C# is .NET.  But essentially all the stuff u did in VS is just for programmer ease of mind, but really thats just an automation tool.  Hell if you want to just open up a terminal and run a script real fast all you gotta do is type \n\ndotnet run [name of program].cs \n\nAnd it will run it.  VS generates a ton of metadata files to help with the building process which is why it’s a pain in the butt to set up but once you do it will make it a little faster.\n\nAnyways do you have any other questions? I hope I explained well, I use a great deal of Java but I’m mostly a C/C++ developer so much different domain but still same concepts",

Why don’t we put everything in 1 file or 1 folder and have automatic access to code written in other files?\n\nTLDR: it’s for organizing large codebase. We can separate different concerns with namespaces.\n\nIf you have organized folders for other computer files/works, why not source code?\n\nYou probably don’t feel the need to modularize your code into modules/namespaces because your program is not yet complex enough.\n\nImagine if we work at Google, with millions of lines of code. And now you want to name something specific to some implementation, maybe you want to implement search result for a TV. There’s a very high chance the name “SearchResult” is probably used somewhere in there. Without namespaces, we must come up with new names every time we want something different, like “SearchResultMobile”, “SearchResultMobileWeb”, “SearchResultTV”, and so on\n\nWith namespaces, each names or symbols are confined to only have meaning in its namespace, so you can have mobile.SearchResult, mobile_web.SearchResult, and tv.SearchResult instead. All code relating to TV implementation will live in the namespace “tv”, not cluttering other namespaces.\n\nNamespaces help separate concerns, and the “import” part is explicit - you have to define wht and where you want to bring symbols outside of our namespace (eg folder, in Go) into scope, to avoid you running/compiling code accidentally (which might be malicious or just bugs).\n\nMy example might not be good, but at least it demonstrates the point.\n\nMy tips: Whenever you are asking why programmers do stuff the way they do, imagine you have to work with big ass codebase (100k LoC++) with incompetent coworkers, and maintain that code for years, then you’ll understand why.",

You should probably start there.\n\nThat being said, about programming itself: I think the first step is to really understand why you want to program. Is it because it fits the idea of a \"better you\"? Do you want it to be your profession? Do you want to impress people? Do you need tools to make your life easier? You need to spend time thinking about that, otherwise you will program for a whole lot of bad reasons. And programming is probably one of the less gratifying crafts for people who do it for bad reasons, because you're inside, on a chair, you encounter a lot of problems, you create a lot of complexity; it can easily make you feel like a fraud, dumb, and make you realize the human brain is very ill-equipped when it comes to computing. In a way, that can be depressing.\n\nOnce you understand your reasons and don't lie to yourself, I really think you should understand your learning profile. Some people like the bottom up approach (like [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), [Build Your Own Lisp](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/), things like that), other like high-level stuff. Some people like to study pure algorithms, others need to build tools. Some like \"boring languages\" (boring can be good) like Python, Go or Gleam, others need more exotic languages like Haskell, Clojure, etc. Some people like to read books linearly, others explore and start 10 projects in parallel. The point is to understand how you learn the best.\n\nOnce you do, please pick preferably one technology (language) that fit your personality and let it be your main mode of expression for a while (probably years if you're serious). Don't rush. See [this page](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html). Understand the language and the ecosystem. Become good at it. Mastery plays a strong role in pleasure and contribute to create that wholesome \"flow\" feeling.\n\nAnd please don't be too hard on yourself, don't seek perfection. Avoid burnout. We all need to have some unstructured fun sometimes. Kanban boards are good, but not very fun, especially if you just sit in front of them. Don't overthink or become fixated on \"protocols\"; just do stuff without producing artefacts - no notes, no plan, no Git repo; avoid paralysis. You can even delete your code afterwards, that's ok. The absence of metrics or artefacts doesn't mean there's no improvement. It's a bit like learning a foreign language: even if the only thing you do is speak with people, you will improve, sometimes way faster than people who use elaborate notes, methods and tools.",

I don't feel that way after almost ten years as a professional dev.\n\n\nI think it's because the imperative nature of most mainstream languages will have you rewriting the same for loops over and over again. Object oriented programming promised that you could reuse code but that never really paid off and so a lot of people are feeling disillusioned with the promises of programming.\n\n\nI think Haskell gives you a much better way of actually reusing code. The way it does it is by using algebra on the type level. I very much enjoy the process of figuring out the types first and then the implementation often comes naturally from that. It's much closer to math or pure logic than imperative programming.\n\n\nI haven't tried too many other functional languages so I can't speak for them. I did try F# and it felt like a bastardized version of C# which I'm already not very fond of after working with it for three years.\n\n\nAll of this is rather subjective but there seems to be a broad agreement when it comes to Haskell that it's very elegant and has a very steep learning curve.\n\n\nIf you have a strong math/logic background and you're looking to enjoy the process of writing code rather then enjoying running the program then I think Haskell is for you.\n\n\nWith that said I'm not sure if modelling physics is the best way to enjoy functional programming.",

If ypu want a good pattern here is a good one KISS. Keep it simple, stupid - it means what you do, do it as straightforward as you can. \n\nA good example is what redux do. In react if you have a state, and need to share it between few components you need to pass it as props through they common parent, but it is a bit hard and really unobvious, so redux was made so you have a common state where you can reach in for the data to a singleton.\n\nThis solution is better because it simplifies something that is used often and that isunobvious to do.",

You need basic ones, and more specialised ones for programming certain things (e.g. writing a networking protocol will require you understand networking), but they diverge very early on into generalist vs specialist. IT generally isn't really a path to (games) programming work per se, it's more a path to help desk, ops, sysadmin, database admin, infra, devOps, etc. If you want to work as a programmer, providing you can already operate a computer to do basic file admin, web browsing, text editing, etc., you should just start programming right away and focus on that. If you need to earn money right away and IT jobs are all you can get right now then it's better than starving... We very much need IT people to keep the software we write up and running.\n\nFor games and multiplayer online games specifically you'll need to have good overall programming skills and pattern awareness to implement the gameplay logic. Plus OS awareness, networking, database design/implementation for the online part. Plus a good understanding of 2D or 3D graphics as applicable for the rendering part. Then there's all the art...\n\nIf you use a modern game engine you can mostly get away with just doing the art and use their abstractions for most of the other stuff.

The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).\n\nIt is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently. As long as I get my tasks done each day, I can pretty safely bring my laptop to the office to study/work on my own projects most of the time.\n\nI will say though, \"building a multiplayer online game\" is a very, very ambitious goal shared by many aspiring game devs who don't know what it actually takes to do something like that. To the point that it's a known red flag/meme if a dev tries to crowdfund an MMO. If you intend to make games by yourself, your scope needs to be reduced \\*drastically,\\* and you'll not only learn more but be more satisfied with the process if you focus on making small, simple games.

It's very, very difficult to \"start a game studio,\" so you want to start by making games for fun and learning to enjoy the process of making them before you \\*ever\\* think about monetizing. Basically don't think about monetizing/turning it into a business until you \\*have business.\\* And if you want to get into programming for an existing studio, be prepared to spend years and years doing contract work to build a reputation, and to navigate a highly competitive field where you could be let go at a drop of a hat.\n\nMake small games. Fail faster. Fall in love with actually making the games, not the idea of making games. And know that game dev, especially solo, is a very multidisciplinary endeavor where each discipline within it can take years and years to master. Pace yourself.\n\nSource: IT person of 6 years who gave up game dev because I found out I don't actually enjoy the process of programming after even more years of trying and going to school for it. What I discovered was that I actually wanted to tell stories, and I didn't need to force myself to be a programmer/artist/designer/writer/composer unicorn to do that.

So if you want to use the term \"functionally retarded\", you've come to the right person.

It's usually used to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number. It's pretty easy, conceptually. Divide two numbers. Discard everything before the decimal point. That's modulo. Like, 9 % 3: That's 9/3, or 3.0. Discard the 3. You're left with 0.0. It's evenly divisible.\n\nNow do the same thing, 9 % 4. I'm pulling out my calculator for this part. That's 2.25.

If you build a game using raylib, you'll need to learn quite a bit. If you encounter difficult maths problems, someone has probably figured out how to do it so you don't have to work from scratch, and there are plenty of good resources online to learn the harder stuff. You'll also naturally develop your math skills as you progress as a programmer.\n\nI will now offer rambling unsolicited advice on learning math based on my own experience. I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).\n\nLearning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.\n\nI found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!\n\nTLDR; Don't worry. You probably aren't bad at math, missing prerequisite knowledge and/or study methods that don't work for you might be falsely giving you that impression.",

        "body": "Math comes into play when the programming problem involves math.  If it's something with physics or game engines, the math can be intense.  Most of the time it's trivial or non existent.\n\n>  Such as using modulo\n\nThis one probably shows up in programming courses more than math courses.  It shouldn't throw you too much.  Write a program to check what's going on?\n\n> I'am functionally retarded when it comes to mathematics.\n\nNope.  Stop that.  Math builds upward upon foundational concepts.  If you miss one of those concepts or don't fully understand it, you're screwed.  The concepts taken slowly aren't that bad.  Don't be afraid of taking a step back and reviewing what you thought already knew.\n\nMath is a lot like programming in this respect.  There's parroting a concept and then there's applying a concept.  Understanding programming ideas and actually writing a program are two very different things.\n\n> Is C a language I should keep trying to learn\n\nSure.  It's fun.  That said, it's one of the more primitive options.  If you feel another language has something more to offer you, that's your call.  However, you're learning both programming and a programming language.  The language is not the hard part.  Once you wrap your head around programming, the language is just an implementation detail.\n\n> or would it be wise to simply use another language that isnt as math intensive?\n\nThere isn't one.  The math you run into in C is to be found in any other language.  Some languages will let you get away with being more sloppy, but I'm not sure if that's better or worse for you.\n\n> I don't have very little foundation with mathematics beyond basic +,-,*,/ problems.\n\nAgain, you generally don't need it.  Also, unlike on a math quiz, you have a computer to check your work.  You might think the formula you wrote will offer a certain result, but the computer will let you know if you're right.\n\n> I'm struggling pretty hard to get through the math related portions.\n\nI'm the programmer who sucks at math, which is why I tend to respond verbosely to things like this.  Programming really doesn't require math.  A mathematician will say it's all math, but that's their problem.  Programming requires a way of thinking and, amusingly, some folks who are very good at math kind of suck at it.  I hate seeing folks with math frustration allow that to gatekeep their possible programming glory.\n\nI got a minor in computer science, where the only higher math course required was calculus 1.  I took it twice, passed the second time.  I also tutored people in programming.  One student, a science major, had her 4.0 in jeopardy because of a basic programming class she thought would be easy.  Another student I helped out was my former calc professor, trying to learn programming.\n\nBeing science or math oriented doesn't equate to programming success.  Some of the worst code I've ever seen comes from engineers; folks who know and use far more math than most mortals.\n\nI mayn't be great at math, but I can program and have done it professionally for decades.  And, so can you.  Good luck.",

You can get quite far, and the mathematics can be implied. You can say fuck the math, you just want a 2-dimension array for your chess board. Indexing that array is `width * row + column`, but all you care about is `board[x][y] = rook;`. There are all sorts of mathy properties about graphs, but you're mostly going to be concerned with canned solutions - data structures and algorithms. We don't write this shit ourselves, there's off-the-shelf solutions in widely popular, proven, and robust libraries.\n\nSo keep learning, and do whatever you're going to do. You CAN learn the math over years, and your solutions can get more sophisticated in that time, but don't sweat it. There are interesting solutions to interesting problems that get mathy, but you're not there right now. Approach that on your own time.",

Low level stuff, like C++ with Allegro or SDL or SFML. Or Java/C# with no engine (this is how minecraft or factorio got made). This will really get your gears turning, but you will have to do everything yourself. You learn a lot, but slow progress.\n2. Unity (or Godot). Faster results, but a lot of complexity gets hidden away and you learn more about the specific engine and less about programming.\n3. Maybe something web based? I hear you can target webassembly with nearly anything nowadays, I'm sure you can make a roadmap from that.",

Now about the tips:\n\n-do not implement stuff until you fully understand the logic behind it. Its really hard to debug a physics engine if you dont know how the state is supposed to look at each step of the process. (If you have to make the calculations by hand for some test cases, then do it, its slow but it helps a lot with debugging)\n\n-get yourself the best way of debugging you can. Something that lets you visualize stuff like the vertices, lines, bodies, variables, etc. Do not debug by guessing whats happening.\n\n-start small, make you engine by breaking it down into its smallest parts and making sure each small part works and connects easily to the rest of the code (like legos). Using assertions helps but im not sure the general opinion on assertions.\n\n-dont be against looking at the industry standard solutions. For example, if you are dealing with colision detection, trying to make your own version instead of just looking up the already existing algorithms (aabb, gjk, sat) is most likely going to take you longer and give you a worst result. The algorithms that already exist where created by really smart people with a lot of math and programming knowledge and, unless your use case is really strange, its probably better than anything most people could come up with.\n\nLastly, seriously, this is a humongous task, you should only make a physics engine if you either\n\n-find it fun\n-want to learn\n-your use case truly cant use any existing engine",

        "body": "IMHO, The injecting and delegating points OP mentioned add complexity to composition. I much prefer patterns that promote simplified calling code. Inheritance promotes this naturally, composition can as well through factory methods if designed well. \n\nSo, assuming the calling code doesn't know or need to know the difference, we can look at the tradeoffs in the interface implementation.\n\nIt is not clear to me how composition supports sharing of common behavior. It seems like it would require complex rules for the \"base\" class to execute or skip common behavior based on instructions from the \"derived\" class. This adds complexity to the delegation mechanism and reduces flexibility.  \n\nIn this simple C++ example, `derived::foo()` has flexibility to add to or completely replace `base::foo()`. It also has access to shared behavior in `base::bar()` at any time. I am not sure how this flexibility can be supported with composition - would love to learn more about that.\n\nFurthermore, this inherent flexibility of inheritance supports unique implementation requirements. I believe with composition that must be designed into the equivalent \"base\" class from the start. It is impossible to think of all the odd requirements clients may have in the future.\n\n    class base\n    {\n    public:\n      virtual void foo();\n    \n    protected:\n      void bar();\n    };\n    \n    class derived : public base\n    {\n    public:\n      virtual void foo() override\n      {\n        // derived::foo() can choose to add to, or entirely replace base::foo()\n        // derived also has access to base::bar() at any time.\n      }\n    };\n\nIn the end, it is best to avoid \"this or that\" thinking. Both composition and inheritance are tools available to be used when they make most sense. I get the idea there are a few problems with inheritance from people using it incorrectly and they look for ways to not use it all, even if it means bending over backwards.",

When to Split into Modules**\n\n* **The Scroll Rule:** If you find yourself scrolling up and down constantly to find a function, split the file.\n* **Cognitive Load:** If a file handles Database logic *and* UI logic, split them. Keep files focused on one \"domain\" (e.g., [`database.py`](http://database.py), `api.py`).\n* **Reusability:** If you need a function in two different scripts, move it to a shared `utils` module.\n\n**3. Patterns to Learn Early**\n\n* **The Entry Guard:** Always wrap your execution logic. This prevents code from running if you import the file elsewhere. Pythonif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \"\\_\\_main\\_\\_\":     main() \n* **Virtual Environments:** Never install libraries globally. Always use `venv` (or `poetry`/`uv`) for every project.\n* **Type Hinting:** Start using standard type hints (e.g., `def greet(name: str) -> str:`). It acts as self-documentation and helps IDEs catch errors.\n\nGood luck!",

Other fellow CS graduates changed careers to blue collar jobs like plumbing, and they never got went back to a tech career. Best of the best CS grads got jobs though. It took until 2006 to feel normal.

Felt normal by 2010.\n\nNow: this is the worst since dot com, jobs have dried up for all levels.\n\nNot going to sugar coat it: this feels much more like dot com bust than 2008. You’ll have to change careers if you need to now. When things recover, they’re going to hire new grads, not older grads who haven’t worked and been sidelined for years. My best advice is to take those super lowball offers from crappy companies, as the experience you’ll get will be much more valuable than the actual salary you’ll earn. Yeah, your career lifetime earnings will be impacted and behind people who graduated in the good times, but it beats leaving the industry altogether.",

I got fired from my first job for poor performance and had a new one lined up a month later. Interviews were a breeze compared to today. A simple phone screening, and a single 2-4 hour in person round. Maybe half the interviews I did involved some light whiteboarding.\n\nIn 2006 I decided I wanted to live a different place and started interviewing for new opportunities. It was so easy to get offers. In March 2006 I had three offers to choose from after interviewing over a span of a couple months. I choose poorly and so in August I started interviewing again. And again, I ended up with three offers to choose from by the end of September.\n\nIn 2008-2010, like 60% of developers at my company were laid off.

        "body": "I dropped out of school in Jan 2000 as I was offered stock options for AutoDesk’s web start up. The first crash happened 2 months later. I’ve worked steadily since then in the industry. \n\nThe **2000** one was wildly different because we didn’t communicate well on a global scale at that point. Prior to the crash, I heard stories of people making it rich in tech, but generally tech wasn’t all that well respected. The average person wasn’t using the internet for a ton. My out of college salary was 38k if I remember correctly. The prediction was the options I got would be worth 350k, which was more money than I’d ever dreamed of. (Spoiler: They were worth 0). \n\nThe crash happened, the company failed, people were laid off. That part was similar to now. Everyone was just waiting for it to be their turn, comparing themselves to their peers. Fearful. \n\nI eventually took a job working for the government for 34k. Getting a job was hard. There was a fear that this internet thing was just a fad and we’d struggle to get pretty mediocre pay. Still, I wasn’t super nervous. I got into it for engineering and if all I did was write C++ Windows apps forever, that was fine at the time. For me, things started returning to normal in \\~2004 when my original company had been sold and asked me to come back for 63k / year. I took the job and worked there until 2012.\n\nBy the **2006** crash I felt more like a mid level engineer. The *economy* felt bad, but in my corner of the world it felt like everyone knew tech was the future. Things were still optimistic for me. There were still layoff fears, but we didn’t really have any and my company was pretty stable. \n\nWhat feels different to me this time? It’s been an employees market for a long time and that’s changing. I know so many people who have made more than your average doctors do. Hell, I do and I’m a college dropout. It feels to me like this could be a huge realignment if it continues. \n\nHow long do I think it will last? My personal, uneducated guess is that companies will shift back to wanting engineers. At some point they’ll realize the tools can multiply their productivity (Not replace it) and at that point they’ll want more people and produce more faster. I think this will come in the next 2-3 years likely? At the same time, I think some damage here has been done. You need a job more than it needs you and I think it could take a long time for that to shift back completely (If it ever does). I don’t actually thing we’ll see the boom at the level of \\~2018. Or at least I won’t. Maybe you will!\n\nIn the early 2000s I saw a ton of people who got into software to “Get rich quickly”. They took an online course and called themselves web developers because they could “Save as HTML” in word. A lot of them shifted real estate agents or other jobs. I think we’ll see the bottom of the industry drop out like that again. \n\nWhat helped me survive? Uh. I’m a hard worker. Probably a bit of a boomer take (I’m Gen X), but I’ve always been very professional. I saw so much shit that I wouldn’t pull during the late 2010 boom era. Don’t get entitled. Don’t be a pain in your bosses butt. \n\nEntitled things: Complaining about a company offering only vegetarian food on certain days of the week. Someone had a hissy fit at my company when they told employees they could no longer take home entire boxes of Snickers after work. New engineers turning their nose up at 200k at FAANG right out of college.",

Same story as with MIT Lincoln except it’s an atomic lab. \n- Hewlett-Packard, working in their printer division. I would have had to relocate to Boise. I turned this down even though I had no better offer since the work and location seemed too boring. \n\nI eventually got a part time job working for the university. This was supposed to convert to full time but the funding fell apart. The project was funded by tech companies who were cutting back. \n\nI ended up going to grad school instead. By the time I finished four years later in 2005 (with no PhD), the job market was somewhat better. It was not hot but more places were hiring. I got an offer to work in big tech on well known but old school software. It was pretty good for what I needed then. Salaries were way lower than now, especially when it came to stocks.

I got raises but eventually jumped to newer, better paying companies.\n\nThe Great Recession in 2008 was very different. Tech was hit but it was short lived. Maybe a year?

While they are trying to help people, the company was still run in a way that I didn't find that great as an employee.  They sell candidates on the idea that their work is going to help sick people and how it is a privilege for you do be working there.\n\nIt's such a privilege that you should take 20% - 30% below market to work there.  That money you leave on the table is said to be reinvested back in to the company, but it really just goes in to the CEO's theoretical pockets.\n\nYou would think that you can at latest create great devices for patients to use with rich features and so forth.  The reality is you meet bare minimum FDA standards for a safe product and go no further.  The problem at the companies I worked for is that you were not selling to the end user.\n\nYou are making money from insurance companies on things like disposable components that you change each treatment. A dialysis machine is expensive and the vast majority of people on dialysis are paying for it with insurance and not out of pocket.  That means investing on making a really nice UX is not any priority.\n\nAt the companies I worked at they don't make extra money investing a lot of time and effort on a well thought out UX, weather that is the UI or the physical device. From what I saw you give them the bare minimum and call it done.  All the time and money is really in the patient safety aspects of the device.\n\nAs long as you don't kill people having them need to click some extra buttons to start their treatment or wait a little longer for treatments to complete is ok, because when you have kidney failure the choices are using the device or die while you wait for a kidney transplant.\n\nThis could just be the companies I have worked at and not what other companies do.  And the old idea that shitty companies won't make money and go out of business wasn't my experience.  These companies have been around since the early 80's and making money hand over first.\n\nAll of the devices were designed in a way to require constant payments from insurance companies through components that needed to be replaced periodically, if not after each treatment.  Oh and who makes these components with custom connections that only fit our devices?  Oh we do, so buy them from us!\n\nYes after 20 years or something like that when the patent experiences it is a free for everybody to use, but at that point the company has already released other medical devices, with new patents, and different special connections.  So it's just a constant cycle of making money.\n\nSo are these companies evil?  No, no directly.  Though I don't think they are making the best product they can for the end user either.",

AI is certainly a powerful tool for software that won't go away, but if the bubble pops know one knows how that will affect the field. We might see a hiring boost, since companies will finally realize they won't be automating engineers away, or we could see even more money drain out of the ecosystem.\n\nIdk, \"no one knows the future\" is sort of the fun thing about this field.

At 4 YOE I got into FAANG by just doing a DSA study guide. I didnt even spend hours on leetcode i just did a few questions a day. Barely could get past a medium without struggling. At 7 YOE i got into a big tech company with the same study guide. \n\nWhat sucks is google has removed that study guide, but it linked many videos of Cracking the coding interview author who explaind each DSA in a pretty simple way. \n\nJob interviews, they dont care if you get the question right they only care about how your mind works when you get stuck.

This includes making it easier for authorizing officials to approve the use of AI in high-consequence development. Things move more slowly in the defense space, and with good reason: there's a lot of well-warranted concerns about agentic AI, for instance. That being said, the major AI firms are working closely with government partners to secure FedRAMP approval and the like. In the meantime, I know people who are concerned about not getting exposure to new tech in their job, and you're not alone in that.\n\nAnyway, I'll tell you what my manager told me, which is that your career development is ultimately your responsibility. It's very easy to feel like you're stagnating if you're not intentional about professional development. That's true no matter where you work and no matter what stage you're at in your career. \n\nIf I were you, I would have an earnest conversation with your manager to identify opportunities for you to develop your skills further. And by skills, I mean that very holistically; it's not just about learning specific technologies, but also soft skills like leadership and other complementary talents. For example, I'm looking into taking a statistics course since that's something that comes up often in my work. I also have set a performance goal to read at least two articles on relevant topics each week. Regardless of whether you plan to change careers, you can be cultivating a transferrable skill set; if you don't, these anxieties are likely to follow you wherever you go.",

I did this myself once and it was enlightening. Even one audience member, because I have no idea who they are, triggers entry into somewhat of a performer mode. You know you're being perceived, so you become self conscious, much like in a real interview.\n\nThough I note it won't be pleasant for the first few trials, I suspect it would cause adaptation to this problem, and work like gangbusters. Like you'd specifically intend to work through verbalizing algorithm complexity analysis in front of an audience on Twitch to practice working thru the issue in a similar state. You can modify the idea but the core is to be live streaming solutions, in front of an audience of at least one person (max ten maybe), who you know or don't know. \n\nAs a separate point, I suggest that there's multiple ways to approach becoming more comfortable, less nervous\\*, and cognitively smooth during  interviews. Could even work to just approach some programmers you know IRL and ask them, \"hey can I spend forty minutes explaining complexity analysis to you with examples over coffee? I'll pay for it.\" And then focus on being calm and collected throughout.",

I’m not sure what “full stack direction” means, but it seems like you’re primarily a frontend dev, which typically doesn’t pay as well. The vast majority of companies will not be using a JS framework for a backend because the language is not robust enough for large scale backend development. It’d be really valuable to learn a statically typed backend language like java and c# along with some SQL. Companies really want those kind of things",

My general approach, was to focus first on my own skills (the masters), then focus on the job skills (becoming tech lead), then finally optimize for hiring skills (LC + Systems Design + Behavioral). If you just focus on the interview skills, it's going to be difficult to really come across as an experienced engineer without the projects and wins on the job to back it up.\n\nHere's how I did it:  \n1. Take jobs at increasingly larger or better paying companies. You might not go \"small\" -> \"big tech\" in one jump, but push your limits and apply to scale-up companies with solid VC funding and lots of ex-big-tech employees.  \n2. Take every leadership opportunity you can, especially those unpaid \"tech lead\" or \"team lead\" spots. You're paycheck doesn't reflect the extra responsibility, but you're experience will be considerably better, and that should come across in interviews.  \n3. If you don't have a CS degree, go get your masters. This will accelerate how fast you grow as a junior/mid level engineer, and get you the technical profeciency to be a senior much faster. Plus, for a self-taught guy like me, it removes any sort of education difference.  \n4. Continue learning. Read books, work on projects, do whatever, just keep learning.",

He is killing team morale, and if his behavior continues to go unaddressed the good people on your team are going to start heading for the exits.\n\nTaking the management position puts you more in the line of fire, and TBH this is kind of the most un-fun situation you can walk into as a new manager, but it also gives you more control over how this goes down and *potentially* gives you an opportunity to get some great peer feedback from the other team members at performance review time if you effectively clean up this messy situation.\n\nIt's up to you, and how much initiative you want to take. Taking the manager position under these conditions is definitely the higher risk, higher reward path. I think I would have a very honest discussion with your boss and tell them you might take the position, but you need to know the full context of what you're walking into before committing to it. That seems like a fair request to me. The comments that concern me most is the current manager saying things like \"this is a really delicate situation right now\". That *could* mean that they are just naturally conflict-avoidant and are (unrealistically) hoping that the kid will knock it off on his own (he won't). *Alternatively* it could mean that the manager knows something about the situation that you don't, and as a new manager walking in to deal with it I would want to know what I'm getting myself into.",

And then are you really sure you want to take those 13 years of experience and basically flush it down the toilet? Because that's effectively what you'd be doing at that point. Basically no going back to tech if you go that route.\n- In regards to starting a business, you really should think long and hard about some of the problems you've encountered at work in the past and see if there are missing tools that you could work on. Doesn't have to be complex or fancy, just has to have no real or good solution currently. I'd put this variant way way higher than career switch if I were you.\n- What's your education? If you are some other engineering degree (electrical, mechanical, etc) you could probably look into more hardware focused companies and get more luck there. The job search for SWEs is different in those industries in some ways.\n- Sounds to me like you really need to do a deep postmortem analysis on your last failed interview and either grind LC much harder or get some help figuring out behavioral/system design questions...\n- From my recent experience with small companies, they aren't as rigorous with their interview process, so if you really do want a job sooner rather than later you might want to expand the search to those companies as well. Check yc for some of those companies, plenty posting jobs on LinkedIn as well. They come with some downsides obviously but beggars can't be choosers.",

A long vacation may be what you need to at least stave off burnout for a little while longer while you do it.\n\nBut burnout, contrary to popular belief, comes from a sense of a lack of control over one’s situation, not simply just the overwhelming workload you’re tasked with. In other words, a vacation will not save you on its own, no matter how awesome it is.\n\nMy advice would be to get 1:1s with the senior engineers on your team (NOT anyone on the management track.. yet). They should be on your side. Explain the challenges you’re facing and whether they have any advice for you. Best case is they identify that you’re being overworked and will help you manage upward. If you’re a high performer with a boss that won’t look out for you, it’s common that they will just assign more and more work for you without taking into account your workload.

But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. \n\nAs an example of a better arrangement, in my team's department we matrix developers onto various other projects across the organization. At best, only small subsets our department work on the same project at the same time, and there can be a lot of siloing.\n\nOn the other hand, we do our best to cultivate a robust team culture of our own. We frequently share insights with one another (including at regular, roundtable department meetings),  do all sorts of bonding activities, try to ensure our bench is at least 2-deep on any topic, and we have a manager who thinks strategically about how we develop our staff and which projects we engage with. Even when our junior staff are going off on their own, we ensure they're never truly alone.\n\nAnyway, I would encourage you to speak with your manager about your concerns and what you can do to ensure you are learning/growing/thriving, not getting burnt out, and so on. You need to be managing up, helping your manager better serve you. Meanwhile, as others have said, you should have earnest conversations with the senior engineers on your team.",

It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). \n\nThink about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. \n\nHowever, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.\n\nYou can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on. But the bubble will only pop when investors lose faith in a major way, and there’s not really any telling when that will happen. There are some signs it might be soon, but it won’t happen until it does.",

It did everything they wanted, using every tool they requested. I included a demo of it running, install instructions and a README section covering possible improvements.\n\nIn the end I got rejected for not including tests. When I brought up that tests were not mentioned anywhere in the requirements, the recruiter admitted they weren't fully aware of the challenge description. The actual things that were requested and took several hours were barely mentioned - for example, pydantic schemas got ignored, but the fact that I had methods with >20 lines was a big issue. Keep in mind, this was about 4 workdays of free labor.",

For what it's worth, I'm in the broader bigtech space, but not one of the tier-1 or literal FAANG companies.  \n\nWhen I made the jump I was pretty much done with being a manager here, and had been doing it about 3 1/2 years. Have been back as an IC a little more than 2 years, out of about 8 at this company.  Management is a lot less fun in an era of shrinking budgets and doing more with less, and at our particular company, all of the process stuff got much heavier at the same time.\n\nThat said, making the jump with an eye to moving back to management in the not-so-distant future seems like a poor move.  If you want to manage in a different space, look for internal mobility opportunities as a manager.  If you want to be an IC, commit to it for a couple of years.\n\nFWIW, I'm 50.

But you shouldn't constrain yourself to what you're being taught in school. It is a very specific discipline which requires a lot of self-initiative, curiosity, and ability to learn on your own. The upside of this is that you don't need to spend hours in library or school.

Sometimes, this is because the teacher does not clarify ambiguities because to them things are obvious.  As a simple example, let's take variable assignments:\n\n    x = 1\n    y = 3\n    y = x\n    print x\n    print y\n\nWhat would the output of this block of pseudo code be?  Among students new to computer programming, a variety of answers are common:\n\nSome, intuit overwrite semantics and answer:  \n1  \n1\n\nSome, intuit swap semantics and answer:  \n3  \n1\n\nSome, intuit move semantics and answer:  \n0  \n1\n\nA good teacher will have a series of test questions designed to ferret out these mismatched mental models, and correct them.  Once students have good mental models of how languages behave they can finally start learning.\n\nSo I doubt that you are cooked.  You probably just need a bit of guidance.  If you're struggling with a particular concept, go talk to your teacher.  Write out the different possible code snippets you're considering to achieve a particular task, and have him explain why they do or don't work.\n\nHave you tried sitting down, and just writing some simple code to see if you understand things.  I would suggest using a language that offers a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) so that you can try things out interactively without getting bogged down.  A google collab notebook, or a Jupyter notebook can be great for this.\n\nI got started writing software when I was in 4th grade on my Commodore 64.  Started out just faffing around with loops to repeatedly print things like \"I am the greatest!\" on the screen.  I played around with sorting algorithms.  I created a program to display the Mandelbrot set (it took about 12 hours to calculate on the C64 when written in BASIC). I even learned to use raster-interrupts and bank-switching to create a double-resolution interlaced display (albeit at an eye-watering 30Hz).",

That keeps your portfolio useful..\n\nFor certs, don’t rush or overspend. Start with free or low-cost learning, then one entry cert if needed.

You can't wait 5 years for a job. Just get a job first and then learn tangential skills on the job.\n\n>I have a portfolio\n\nNo one will look at or care about your portfolio. It's not work experience. AI/ML work requires at least 5 years of on the job experience or an MS in it. You should still be coding to keep yourself sharp but no need to share the code or polish it.\n\nCan teach yourself tech stacks to apply for more entry level jobs. 1 of AWS, Azure or GCP is good to learn. On rare occasions, I do see one of their entry level certs as a plus. The relevant AWS one is Associate Developer. Not bs Cloud Practitioner or anything else.\n\n>I’m thinking DevSecOps or other software security roles.\n\nApply for both. I've done middleware and backend development myself.

I ended taking a job for a cloud db provider after I graduated, and for 2 years studied up on database implementation (red book), and operation systems (OSTEP) through a reading group.\n\nWhen I was hired for big tech 2 years ago, I ended up on a SWE team using AI for cost savings efforts (automate jobs, lol). The AI stuff is a good fit for me, but if the hype train ends for me I'll gladly go back to systems software.\n\nOverall, I think OMSCS was a big help, and even though I study on my own, the hours aren't close to OMSCS. If you can get through OMSCS + SWE day job, once the program is over you're in a good spot to really pour that time investment towards SWE skills and start to focus on leadership.",

For one, very surprised to not see Chip Huyen's Designing ML systems book on the preparation side. I would strongly recommend that as a must-read. It focuses on the entire ML development lifecycle. I also think a lot of people overlook the fundamentals of stats, linear algebra, etc. These are especially important for measuring model performance. It's great if you can talk about system design, but I always expect candidates to be able to talk about if a model makes sense for a use case in the design round before we get into whiteboarding.\n\nAlso, outside of MAANG I actually see a lot more system design and knowledge questions than actually coding questions outside of maybe a leetcode easy for basic competency, so depending on the role you are targeting I would de-prioritize coding in favor of system design and model fundamentals. \n\nBest of luck finding and landing an MLE role",

Generic advice like \"learn a new tech stack\", or \"biuld apps\" don't easily map to real business problems or existing teams.\n\nThat said, I'd recommend doing the following:  \n1. Focus on one of those areas (iOS, dbs, cyber).  \n2. Do projects that directly replicate an existing job function. Not a cool app, but stuff that maps directly to job skills.  \n3. Write them up like professional work.\n\nYou're not too late, but the market isn't going to meet you halfway, you have to make yourself legible as someone who can do the work. That's going to be challening, but the first task is to figure out what exactly the work even is.

If you're the oncall engineer, you may need to wake up and fix things if shit hits the fan, but it's supposed to be a rare occurrence.

My 2 cents:\n\n\nThe startup will make you better at building things quickly, give you access to way more interesting problems, and also allow you to have more responsibility than you ever would at big tech. \n\n\nThe tradeoff is that it’s the wild west. Coding best practices, well-scoped projects, clear roadmaps, internal tooling, may be minimal or nonexistent. That’s not inherently bad, and it can make shipping much easier, but there is less support in ensuring you’re writing good code, so it can very much be a sink-or-swim environment. \n\n\nI have learned much more in less time at my startup than I had at my previous big tech job, but my big tech job was very important in teaching me what large-scale corporate software development looks like: what guardrails are important, what good docs and code look like, how to navigate corporate politics, etc. I also think unfortunately brand name does matter and it was helpful to get my foot in the door when I started looking for jobs, but that can be overshadowed by building cool stuff.\n\n\nSo my main advice is to do your best to learn best practices in software development, and actively look for someone who is experienced and can mentor you.",

I recommend if you are aligned for Certification then IIT/IISc/IIIT brand are ok. I am not very keep on certification because in interviews your practical learning experience matters. I was in LogicMojo out of these for learning. Other I am not sure much. Whichever you take make sure to develop project which you should complete follow including design.

Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)?\n\nIt's a broad area. Anything related to infra supporting developing and running ML models is counted as ML infra. It's not all about MLOps. E.g., supporting models to run on a new type of accelerator (think about TPU, ASIC, ...), is also ML infra; code-designing software + hardware for faster network for ML workloads, ... \n\n\\> Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too.\n\nE.g., the compiler is supposed to take a model and compile it to hardware-specific code that should be able to run on a specific type of accelerator. But the model keeps crashing in the runtime --> the compiler didn't handle an edge case properly (this needs lots of efforts to repro) --> submit PR to patch the compiler --> re-compile and deploy the model.\n\n\\> a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality.\n\nNot necessarily. But you need lots of self-learning while you work. It's unlikely a school program can cover what you need.\n\n\\> On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here?\n\nIt's not very entry-level friendly. Lots of folks worked on adjacent areas (maybe non-ML) like databases, networks, compilers, before joining.\n\n\\> What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year... It's admittedly quite \"late\" in my college career since I took a while trying to figure out what I wanted to do. These are recommendations that ChatGPT recommended to me but am seeking some further details from real experts and professionals.\n\nHighly dependent on what type of ML infra engineer you want to be. \n\nBut generally fundamental courses like OS, compiler, database, DSA, can be very useful to help you self-learn more stuff along the way.\n\nAI can help you progress faster -- but you need to have the basics to understand what it is talking about as things can get abstract at first place.",

I would still require a visa to live in the US, but I've had multiple points in my life where I could have chosen to move to the US permanently. I chose to move to the UK.\n\nDublin, Paris, and Berlin don't, imo, have a better tech scene. You get a lot more jobs and variety in London. The pay also doesn't compare and you usually have much more growth opportunities in London. I speak about Dublin from experience, I moved from there to London. The other two I've mostly seen from a distance and talking to friends. Berlin is probably the one that gets closest, but the truth is that FAANGs all have large tech offices in London, they don't all have one in Berlin. Add that to the language issue (I don't speak German) and it doesn't make much sense to move there.\n\nThe US tech jobs are a much more interesting problem. The Bay Area and Seattle have objectively better tech scenes, higher salaries, and more variety in jobs. My problem with both of them (but especially the Bay) is that I do not enjoy or want to live in either of those places. I enjoy living in a city where I can walk places, where there's public transport, where there's a museum, culture, and arts scene, where it's easy to travel to other countries, and where not everything is tech.\n\nNYC would be a good option, and while the salaries aren't as good as the Bay, they're still likely better than London. I think it provides a good mix, and if I were to ever move to the US I would go there. I do still not like living in the US generally though. As I said, there's certain aspects of how European cities work that I enjoy, and to add to it, I enjoy getting plenty of days off to enjoy my free time and I feel like I have more breathing room while still finding interesting things to work for good pay. Between that and the fact that I've now established myself here and I have a friend group that I'm happy with and a flat I own, I'm unlikely to want to move.\n\nEdit: another issue with the US I forgot to mention, the immigration precarity has always been an issue for me with the country and to a degree still is. In the time I've moved to the UK, got permanent residency and citizenship, many of my friends in the US haven't been able to get permanent residency status. In that period I've not really had any prolonged periods where I can't visit family or leave the country for holidays, whereas I've had friends who weren't able to leave for **2 whole years**. Most visas you can get to move to the US can put you in that situation if you ever want to turn your status into a long-term one, and you're treated throughout a lot of the process as if you're somehow doing something wrong. It's not a situation I want to put myself in",

Besides those what is there? Dublin, Paris and Berlin are downgrades from London in terms of volume of opportunities. There’s no single city in Europe, Canada or Australia actually that I think has more opportunity than London. Lots of other places are better to live in imo for quality of life btw, but if we’re talking strictly about volume of job opportunities there aren’t as many. Dubai and Singapore also have less opportunities and then India/China aren’t going to work for vast majority because of low salaries and cultural differences. I’m of Indian origin and just got back from a trip to India, it’s a fine place to live if you have an online business making an income to sustain your life there, especially if you like sunshine, but to work there, it’s not going to work for people born and raised in the west and for those wages your lifestyle would be very poor.\n\nThe reality right now is tech jobs are in a precarious position all around. Outside the US, London’s probably the best, but that’s not saying much with the changing landscape with AI and lack of VC investment in anything other than AI. It’s the most stressful time to be in tech imo with respect to knowing what’s happening I’ve ever seen in my 20 year career.",

I'm targetting full stack or backend roles for intermediate or junior/entry depending on the company as my current company is a service based not product. \n\nId love to break into a big tech company - not FAANG but anything adjacent or similar that will open future doors. Please provide any feedback - appreciate it and happy holidays!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/MMH8AAM](https://imgur.com/a/MMH8AAM)",
