If nothing broke you would still be doing work but it shifts to boring preventative stuff. Data contracts. Upstream alignment. Cost control. Schema evolution. Access rules. Quality checks before anyone screams. \n\nThat work is harder to explain to managers so it gets undervalued. Mature teams stop celebrating hero fixes and start measuring how quiet things are. Some teams make that visible with domo dashboards. Others track it through snowflake usage or monte carlo alerts. Same idea. Prevention not firefighting.",

        "body": "I choose for Data Engineering pretty early in my career and I'm very happy I did so.\n\nWhen you're a Data Scientist, one of your key goals is to extract meaning from data. You run models and try to get insights. It is very often the case though that the data either doesn't show what you would like, or it kind of does, but with pretty low certainty. Even more often the data is so bad that you couldn't really draw any conclusions from it.\n\nThis puts you in a bind. You have to go explain your conclusions to the sales guys and they can't work with 'it sort of shows X, but also kind of Y'. They need to sell a product and they will. So they'll massage your conclusions in ways that you might even not agree with. Or you'll be pressured to massage the data, which I've been asked to do. I always covered my ass with emails although I luckily never needed them.\n\nAs a Data Engineer on the other hand, there is no discussion. Either the data is in the required spot in the required form or it isn't. At the end of the day, your product is finished and whether or not someone can actually do anything with it downstream is not your concern. It's a very liberating feeling and it means I have barely any stress related to work.\n\nI'm not the only person I've encountered who feels similarly and I've even met a few Data Scientists who made a similar switch later in their career for similar reasons.\n\nAnother saving grace is that Data Scientists are a dime in a dozen nowadays. With the AI boom everyone and their cat tried to get some certification somewhere and the quality varies wildly. Data engineering isn't as sexy and there's much fewer people in the field I have the impression. I started before the AI boom, so having seniority at this point in time is very helpful as well.",

I naturally gravitated towards technical specifications and engineering solutions.  I was interested in maths, but having done some statistics courses, it wasn’t a mountain I wanted to climb.\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t over think it.  People swap between DS and DE all the time.  A large company will probably help you transition, pay for training etc because they know there is a great deal of synergy between these teams.  ie.  DE’s will productionise DS models so knowing both sides isn’t a waste of time.\n\nWhere I currently work, DS is seen as a ‘luxury’.  They will increase headcount when times are good, and conversely, DS’s are the first people out the door when times are bad.  This is because they generally work on ‘optimisations’, I guess just like how you would pause remodelling your house if you lost your job and didn’t have income coming in.  DE on the other hand is much more stable.  They need people to keep existing pipelines running, even if new things aren’t being built.  It was how I ended up in DE, I was made redundant as a DS but told I could stay on if I switched teams.  I thought I’d do this while I searched for a new DS position, but I found my proclivities more suited to DE, so never left and never thought about switching back.\n\nGenerally the people who make the best DE’s have done Computer Science or Engineering degrees that involve data transfers like Telecoms.  The people who make the best DS’s have done Science or Mathematics degrees.  Maybe start out in the field where your degree gives you the best foundations?  Otherwise it will be an uphill struggle to get timely promotions.  Make a start and see how you go.",

Experimentation is important in data science.\n\n- Less focus on infrastructure as a data scientist. ML ops or data ops takes care of it most times.\n\n- Accuracy is important in data engineering.

I’m assuming by mid-level you mean a title like senior data engineer in my response.\n\nThis is the arguably the hardest point in your career to progress. As many point out you can go IC or PL route. PL route tends to make a higher bonus but you can still make very good money as IC so both are viable paths. I know many engineers who have stayed at the level you are at their entire career. Only a few percent move up from here. This is because a new set of skills are required. You are no longer just coding 8 hours per day. This looks different depending on the company size but these roles are responsible for architecting solutions and leading others in the solution implementation. I do both in my role on a smaller team but often these are split into a Principal Architect and a Manager role.\n\nSo to move into these roles you need to demonstrate you can architect solutions and lead others via your work experience. Unfortunately almost no one will tell you that simply doing great work in your role doesn’t make you eligible for a promotion to the next one. Unless you demonstrate the skills required for the next level you will not even be viewed as a viable candidate by others. In practice this usually looks like partnering with business stakeholders to define a problem or need, designing a solution that addresses that problem or need, and organizing a team of engineers to deliver this solution. As a manager I could complete all the work which I delegate myself but instead I focus on turning business requirements into tasks, delegating those tasks to our engineers, and filling knowledge gaps so the engineers can complete the work.\n\nI could keep going here but I think I’ve made the main point. You must proactively make the choice to stop spending 100% of your time implementing and spend some of it addressing these other requirements. Then you will get noticed for promotions or for external job openings.",

I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.\n\nThe major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. \n\nOn the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.\n\nIf neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:\n1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering\n2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering\n3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst\n4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist\n6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, product\n\nI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. \n\nThis can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.\n\nSo my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.\n\nYou mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.\n\nYour tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a  good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",

Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\n\nThis is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.\n\nObviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. \n\nAll of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum. Most people are going to end up de facto specialists in little sub niches over the course of a career, even if they are relative generalists in data tech.",

We have a business-oriented manager now.  For a little while we had a data architect.

I like the variety of experience and work that can come from being a generalist.  I think I am just that way inclined, though, jack-of-all-trades kind of thing.

If it generates enough business value that you'd carry on (perhaps putting in place a migration plan) - then it's probably fine as a choice. If you're so cost sensitive that a small rise in costs would cause problems, then it's probably not the right choice.\n\nGenerally being heavily invested into Snowflake doesn't concern me too much. Most of the transformation logic is SQL. Unlike say python, or a lot of proprietary solutions SQL code written today will still be good in 20 years time. There aren't any libraries to end up unmaintained. If you *really* need to you can port to another database technology and most of your transformations will port over perfectly. You might need to spin up a solution for tasks, and change your ingestion methodology, but all that business logic will be fine still.\n\nUnless you go completely open source, and want to take on board the substantial overhead with doing that, I'd say it's pretty good value. Vendor lock in mainly comes from the fact that it's really good, rather than vendor lock in from being proprietary. Very little of it is highly proprietary unlike a lot of other ETL methodologies.\n\nWhy aren't you at least using internal stages? There's far less overhead in using COPY INTO vs INSERT unless you're inserting a trivial amount of data. External stages and pipes even less overhead and cost.",

The first thing I prototype is the semantic model with a few top level KPIs and whatever is the minimum that allows them to engage with that. Usually connecting the semantic model to Excel does the trick, otherwise a bare-bones dashboard that displays just an auditable view of the KPI.\n\n\nIt's tempting to skip the data work and go straight to the dashboarding because it feels more agile to get the bells and whistles delivered, but ultimately it costs more in rework and burned credibility and clarity that it saves. It might feel heavy and unrealistic to do the modelling early, but that's because you're caught in the sugar rush of delivering good-looking, quick, but ultimately poor solutions.",

        "body": "SCD2 is built into the table schema, the code base is based on Merge or UpSert + delete tracking.\n\nI suggest you look at \"Timestamp\" column type if available on your platform, or look into MD5() function which is quite universal, to do \"hashing\" of data, and use a staging layer.\n\nWhen you design properly a SCD2 table in a bronze layer, and have a staging layer in a \"raw\" layer (you should always have a staging layer!) - then a SQL view with the hashed values (the PK columns, the entire data row) then SCD2 becomes a breeze to do. Breeze because you compare two tables, you have one PK column and one HashDIFF column (or TimeStamp from a source DB) that tells you easily what to do.\n\nOften it is deletion tracking the most difficult - because if you get differential data, how do you know what no longer exists in source? In such cases you need an extra pipeline logic just for delete tracking. Mentioning as this is often overlooked and it comes back to bite you at the end.\n\nFor example, you load new data (from a full source or differential source) truncate/load into a staging table. Make a view to create all the extra columns you need, like using MD5() in the view. Use the staging view to do the UpSerts or Merge based on your bronze layer SCD2 historical table and the staging. \n\nFor delete tracking sometimes you need a new pipeline to get a full from source but only the PK column(s), not all the columns, so the file is smaller and the process is quicker. I use a different staging table, a different pipeline, just for this. Or if you are lucky, you can get CDC from source DB and then you have 100% of all changes. If only we had this all the time.\n\nSo basically you read the same data twice, the first time the data are usually files in a datalake or a file share, but it could also be a remote database that you ODBC / OleDB into to run a query. This is usually for on-prem, but I have used ODBC + MySQL remote DBs to gather info, it works really well, and no ELT/ETL tool required - it's all SQL in a stored proc.\n\nSome people create in the staging table all the extra fields to manage for SCD2 and the tool they use to consume the raw data into staging, adds the values to the extra fields, row-by-row. I do NOT like this method, as it puts intelligence inside the ELT/ETL tool making it difficult to manage. An ELT/ETL tool should be simple, just do mapping, Lift & Shift, ideally never fail - just get the data to staging table(s) and let the next level deal with issues. CSV is hell on earth, I use the BLOB technique on foreign CSV files and parse with SQL.\n\nFWIW, this topic (SCD2, 3, 4, hybrid...) is taught in actual classes world wide, maybe look into taking some basic ETL/ELT & BI courses, at least Udemy. My first SCD2 table I did back in 1998 - just to give you an idea on how old this logic is, the actual invention I don't know who - but probably Kimball in the 90's. I had a great database teacher that was ahead of  his time.",

I am fairly new as well (been reading/learning for what seems like years, but work doesn’t want to go down this route).\n\nBasically, the idea is you bring each referenced source table in to the model you’re working on as their own cte.  By doing this pattern you have a clear reference to every parent model you are using at the top of your model.\n\nYou then perform the transformation steps, including the joining of those referenced tables as the next cte (or several ctes depending on complexity).\n\nThen you read directly out of your last cte - preferably with little transformation in the final step.\n\nAll of this is to make things as readable and organised as possible.\n\nIf you were to start transforming each source in the initial cte, you wouldnt be reading a simple, single line bringing it in to the current model, but reading more complex transformations that you would need to spend more time figuring out what that piece was doing and where it began and ended.\n\nEdit to add: this way you can tell at a glance at the top of your model all the referenced sources.  Each of them as a single line cte with no complexity thrown in.  After you have brought in each source as its own cte, then you start a new one with a name indicating the source and transformation step, etc.\n\nBy bringing in your sources, transforming each, joining, performing joined transformations, aggregating, etc, each in a little code block cte, you are mimicking how programmers would use methods in code to logically break code into chunks.\n\nIf you also read up about layering data models (medallion architecture), you’ll see how dbt likes to break it down further into separate models.  This allows you to perform the simple single-model transformations, such as renaming, casting, etc at a ”silver” stage, and more complex transformations such as joining or calculating the values in two tables, aggregating, etc in a later, “gold” model.  This takes the organising and simplifying of models from within a single model/step, to a process.\n\n——-\n\n   /*\n      Model header and configuration \n    */\n\n    // bring in referenced models and sources\n\n    WITH orders AS \n    (\n         SELECT * FROM source_orders \n    ),\n    customers AS\n    (\n        SELECT * FROM source_customers\n    )\n\n    // transform table\n\n    transform_orders AS \n    (\n        SELECT \n            col1 AS col1_rename,\n            col2 AS cast(col2 AS string),\n            .....\n        FROM src_orders\n    ),\n    transform_customers AS\n    (\n        SELECT customer_id\n                      ,UPPER(customer_name) AS customer_name\n        FROM src_customers\n    ),\n\n    cust_orders AS\n    (\n        SELECT *\n         FROM. transform_customers AS c\n             LEFT JOIN transform_orders AS o\n                 ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n\n    )\n\n    // select result\n    SELECT * FROM cust_orders",

Algorithms are useful, but mostly at a practical level like understanding tradeoffs in joins, streaming, and partitioning rather than textbook proofs.\n\nIf I had to bias extra effort outside class, it would be SQL beyond basics, data modeling, distributed systems concepts, and hands on work with pipelines. Things like building an end to end ETL, handling bad data, and thinking about reliability and cost teach more than most lectures. DE interviews and jobs care less about ML theory and more about whether you can move and transform data safely at scale.",

And the retrieval side. Spark or SQL have no built in functions to do anything with the image data directly, so it will always be a two step process to do something with the images after retrieving with an sql or spark statement. For example ocr the content of an image. You retrieve the image data from iceberg and then need some eg Python code to load it into an image object and then use libraries to ocr the image. Same process if you would store the URL to the image in the db, step 1 retrieve the url step 2 load the image and ocr with Python.\n\nI would think the performance and infrastructure compute would be more favorable with images in blob storage. You just need a much smaller spark cluster to process the iceberg files and faster retrieval of the URL and image due to much less data volumes to process.",

What is the domain of your company? Sales?\n\n2. Are you in the decision making committee? Do you have leadership buy in to push more Power BI?\n\n3. How is your current data culture? Is it more of just give me the numbers, don't expect me to use a tool and find my own data.\n\n4. If you had an unlimited budget, how many users in your company will use Power BI? \n\n5. Currently, how many reports do the users want to download to excel? \n\n6.  Do you know why they want to download to excel? What's next?\n\n7. Have you considered to download the report to a SharePoint folder and share the link instead? This way you are not abusing the network, storage and have one file which is referred to by most.\n\nDo not go searching for a bespoke solution and end up costing the company a lot more to maintain two different solutions. The last thing you want is for the users to lose trust in data.",

But from there what I had to do was have the SDK attached to the API and both the API & SDK just share the same DB instance and pass the code instance around. But if I couldn't do this, one thing I could do is create an http wrapper to allow for outside requests to hit the DB (sort of like a lightweight API around the DB server) with all the same auth and stuff of course. But... this gets impractical sometimes. Again this only works for one instance though, it's not practical for multiple instances. So beyond that it may be worth exploring other options as others have mentioned. But just my thoughts though.",

That and whatever they can come up with on their spreadsheets and side/shadow controls. I have no way to say I'd this is a minor issue or a huge risk, it may well be that the BI Eng who was laid off got enough working that the core operation is covered, and you'd only miss some opportunities. There are so many ways that BI can generate value, and so many ways it can be useless that it's impossible to say what your case is.\n\nYou do have the right gut feeling, but there's little hope of fixing the issue(s) without proper ownership and knowledge. From what you described, it looks like you don't even have someone who knows how to get BI requirements right. For example, if someone comes asking for a report on how many cars and how much spaghetti, you don't throw it as a ticket into the backlog - you ask about the decisions they're making, how the relationships between these things work, what's the desired outcome, how they'll use the information, along with frequency, level of detail, quality and possibly what other questions (at least what data domains) we're talking about. After that, you have to determine where this data is (and it might not be anywhere), how to source it, how to structure it for the specific kind(s) of analysis and decision they want to make, and then you have to figure out how that relates to the rest of the data model you already have. And then you may be able to build something.\n\nEven skipping half of what I described, you can't escape some of it, and you need to know what you're doing. You also need ownership from the business, because this will need to be operated and maintained, and that comes with a cost. If there's no ownership, maybe on one wants that cost.\n\nBasically, start by finding someone who can explain why this matters, and then see if they can put enough value on it to justify the DE position. Just remember that, if you start asking questions, people may assume you're taking ownership. If you think that's a career move or a problem, I also don't know for sure.",

        "body": "After doing this for literally decades I have to say I'm a complete convert to doing as much of this work upfront via Data Contracts as possible:\n\n   * Data Contracts can define required vs optional columns, their types, their formats (ex: phone numbers with dashes), their min/max values, their min/max string lengths, their enumerated values, and their NULL rules.  That contract can be stored in a JSON structure and shared with your upstream source - and then be the basis for their testing and yours.  Nothing else will provide as much DQ guarantees as this.  And it can be a simple library call to hand over a row/file/table to a utility for checking.\n   * Anomaly-detection is also valuable to do prior to transformation:  does your input always have 10 million rows and suddenly you only have 65?  Regardless of whether the rows are formatted correctly, you probably have a partial file.  Or how about if one of those columns is historically NULL 1% of the time, and that's ok, but now it's NULL 100% of the time.  Something has changed...\n\nI like doing the above because each of these can typically work with raw data, can catch a ton of problems pre-transform, and isn't much work.  Then once you get into the transforms you'll need to do more of the above, but in that case it'll be for items you couldn't check with raw data - like joins that fail because there's suddenly no matching rows, etc.",

If the data is \"invalid\" by your criteria, can you drop it on the floor? If so, maybe you can validate it at parse time. But typically you try not to do that.\n\nSchema drift can be tough to solve without a lot of other metadata you need to either derive by profiling the data, OR having users or your system declare it in absolute terms. Both are tough and have complexity in it that may not be obvious to the users of that data. \n\nA pattern I've seen that did okay was to take anything that didn't fit into our target schema, we just threw it into an additional column called `invalid`. From there we can at least write some additional SQL that looks for any records that contain something within `invalid`.\n\nAt the very least this would provide you (or whoever is using your ingested data) the knowledge that _something has changed_, without knowing exactly what. Which in our case, is usually more than enough info to address what schema drift has taken place.",

I'm assuming when you say pipeline, that you are talking about a data ingestion that gets incorporated into your larger existing analytical system. That matches my experience with the schema + CSV issues you are describing.\n\nEverything looking fine on the surface but more subtle, complex assumptions about the data being broken post pipeline deployment is something I've run into often. I've had varying degrees of success in trying to proactively identify issues like this. There are a few things that worked for me, particularly when the data source is an external partner. My experience is also in smaller companies where end to end analytics is entirely my responsibility and there is limited support from other colleagues. With that in mind, this kind of validation is imo a balance between getting the pipeline into production quickly and making issue identification and maintenance as easy as possible.\n\n**Before building anything / requirements and assumption refinement:**\n\n* Get all info about the data source you can\n * Ask for data dictionaries and/or entity relationship diagrams -> only commonly seen these available in finance but solves 99% of these problems before they happen\n * Figure out all your critical assumptions and ask about them explicitly (primary keys, important relationships, etc.)\n* Identify key internal stakeholder(s) that have the business context to clarify expectations\n * Who can be your point of contact for escalating + investigating issues down the line\n * Identify what aspects of the data being ingested are critical to *your own* business' processes\n     * Primary keys and most likely a subset of columns/fields rather than everything\n         * That a field exists, is an enum of X possible options, etc.\n     * Things that if your assumption about the data become wrong or broken, then the data becomes unusable or detrimental to the business\n\n**While building:**\n\n* Codify your critical assumptions\n * If these are broken pipeline FAILS -> clear alert that mentions you as pipeline owner and your internal stakeholder with a clear business-centric message\n * Subset of critical fields that must have some characteristics\n* Quarantine/identify your non-critical assumptions\n * Should NOT fail the pipeline so that business critical data can still flow\n * More of a nice to have\n * If a non-necessary or unused field starts breaking assumptions -> alert that mentions only you as pipeline owner with clear technical context, allows you to create a backlog task which can be prioritized appropriately \n\nThere's plenty you could do to abstract and reuse a lot of this functionality in whatever your ingestion/orchestration tool you are using but personally I have been unsuccessful in advocating for this internally.\n\nI am making plenty of assumptions about the latency requirements, criticality of the data to your business, and that you have some kind of semi-mature ingestion framework with alerting capabilities. This also assumes your destination tables are pre-defined with the pipeline and you aren't using some kind of lakehouse pattern which I have less experience with. There are definitely tons of options for approaches to this so I'm curious what others have to say.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss more specific tools here but tried to keep it relatively high level and already wrote an essay. Hope this helps!",

That said, I'd like to keep things modular enough that swapping tools out is possible down the line, and offering tool choices during setup could make sense too.",

Move data through them with ETL (or ELT).\n\n-I had to model my data using the Kimble method for my curated version (dimensions and facts). It definitely helps with Power BI reporting. There are lots of resources for this online.\n\n- Consider how your API works. When you call it, what does it give you back? Is it a full data set, or do you pass it a date and it just gives you back a smaller set of data? Which columns in that API call do you need and which are definitely not useful to your business (don't get rid of them in raw in case the business wants them in future, but think about if they are needed in cleansed). I was able to use watermarks to record when the pipeline last ran. I can pass that watermark to my API so it only gives me the data that has been inserted or updated  since then. That's handy because you process a much smaller data set.\n\n-Think about what happens if your pipeline fails at each stage. Draw it out on paper if you have to, think about why parts could fail and how you would fix them or deal with the next pipeline run.\n\n- Spend some time thinking how your pipeline will handle deleted data. If someone deleted a record from November in your CRM, how does it need to be handled in your reporting? Does the business still expect to see it in the reporting or are they happy it should be removed. I use MERGE to handle these in SparkSQL.\n\n- How often does the business want your pipeline to run, and at what time?",

As you mentioned schema changes are common, but relatively easy to detect. Most often I experienced renaming of columns, which manifests as a missing column in your expected schema and a new column at the same time. The pipeline cannot resolve this issue and will most likely fail if the missing column is used in transformations. You can detect schema changes with DBT-tests with dbt-expectations package or you can use great expectations package or dlt (data load tool) when using Python. Those tools also allow for detecting other type of problems, e.g. for categorical fields additional values that are not expected. You can also define simple tests or expectations that a column shouldn’t have NULL values, or fields need to be of a specific types and and and …\n\nAnything you can envision will happen eventually. And most often it requires human intervention to be fixed because most likely you need to talk to other people to either fix it at the source or you need to adjust the data pipeline to handle the new case. Your time is best spend in investing in detection and observability so you can spot the reason for the failure quickly.\n\nOne way to minimize your disruption (and this is used in more mature organisations) is to create data contracts with your source system owners. In this document you describe what tables are you pulling, schema information, frequency, expected values, date time boundaries …. Then you can create a test data set that you can use to test your data pipeline when you make changes.",

Downstream of all of this, of course, when processing the load of cleansed data to production systems, the many pitfalls you might run in to there and need to report alongside the original raw picture of data to clients and internally. My favorite is a client we have who has a massive hierarchy for their enterprise that is sent to us via web services so that we can marry it up to our hierarchy for them in our system, all sent as this massive multi megabyte json beast. Most of the issues with them are mapping them to the right corresponding place within the hierarchy, and it’s a lot of reporting what isn’t set up by our enterprise so we can successfully consume the data at a later date. After corrections, we automatically reprocess raw data for these clients for just the failures.\n\nI often run in to structural or data quality issues that I need to gracefully handle.",

Or are they referring to optimising data transformation queries written by Data Engineers that is done prior to model build etc.\n\n It would really help to define  the boundary of the Data Engineer and the tasks and technologies used to accomplish the tasks in that boundary prior to model creation and training.\n\nThank you again for the reply.",

Partition by Day should be good. It would be roughly \\~25mb or so per hour.  Iceberg  can use hidden partitions so you can literally pass the timestamps or hourly based timestamps in your query. In short users don't have to know the partition column well in advance and you can modify it. Maybe have another column which has timestamp it is getting written to silver ( the timestamp of the micro batch.

Once you write to your silver you ask your client what is the latest timestamp it has and see if you silver has anything new and if yes send >= that timestamp from client ( rough idea). \n\nKeep in mind about backfills.

If you are receiving full snapshots you do conditional inserts on hashdiff by key so that you don't write the same data twice. That combined with compressible formats means you only keep actual changed data, which means it isn't sized much larger than SCD2.\n\n> Also, using always the timestamps doesn't force you to run an analytical function over the partition sorted by date to obtain the latest record ?\n\nIf you used only the raw vault to query then it would, yes. But part of the BV batch is running logic like those window functions to find the latest version(s) by key to create derived tables.\n\nOn each batch you can take your fresh raw vault data and determine how it would splice into your current SCD2 history, and update that table. The SCD2 table could materialise all the data, or it could be just the keys pointing back to a specific row in the raw vault. Just the keys can work if you need to save space, as doing an inner join still allows predicate pushdown into the raw vault data unlike with filters on window function ordering.",

Then you need machinery to feed all these tables unnecessarily, and pay for all that compute work. It is just not a framework that is optimized for the cloud native tech. It is pointless in that sense. Also, lots of data engineers you hire will ask to leave the project after 6 months for the amount of endless work that the framework demands. All that under the escuse of it being very robust and adaptable to business logic. Well lots argue that is rather preferable having work maintaining simple models that need to be adapted a bit here and there once in a while than having work on a weekly basis for creating tables all in the same way. It is robotic work that nobody likes to do. Data Vaults advantages can be achieved with much easier to maintain frameworks.",

The salary I'm on at the moment is good, I get that but I'm mid 30s, I probably have 30 years left in work, it makes sense to consider what my future look like. When I think about progression there's a lot of stress and long hours that come for positions of more seniority as a DBA. Depending on the company, as a Head of/ Manager you can almost always be on call if that makes sense and I'm not sure the value is really there for me.\n\nI should clarify there are no plans to immediately transition, I'm on a good salary, it's remote and there's low demand, but when I think of 30+ years of working, I need to consider my options. I realise if I looked to move tomorrow I'd need to take a pay cut. I was thinking I'd be looking somewhere between £50-£65k though I think with my role changing I should be able to do a bit more of a hybrid role for a couple of years.",

As a DE, depending on industry itnis much more common to get a pipeline failure alert and deal with itnfirst thing in the morning. Fixing a production pipeline is alsonalmost always easier than something like an emergency server migration / DR rebuild. \n\nThe actual easiest way to make the switch is find a hybrid role as a DBA. Find a role whwre you have to do both jobs. Half 6our day is spent doing the normal DBA tasks. Other half is sepnt writing pipelines, architecting solutions, database design, ci/cd, etc. Then look for a role that is almost exclusively DE work. \n\nThat said you will still be used and leveraged as a DBA in a pinch because very few pure DE's have enough SQL / server knowledge to help out at the same level you can.",

In my current role I still wear both hats fairly regurlarly. In fact I was hired more for my DBA skills than my DE skills.\n\nThat said I found all the following skills very helpful in making the switch. \n\n1. Expert level Powershell knowledge. This comes in handy both on prem and in thr cloud if you regurlarly work with Microsoft stacks. If not Bash would be more useful. \n\n2. Intermediate Python skills. I learned python after powershell and the knowledge transfers easily between them. Somethings when you know both get hard just from do pythonism or powershellism in the other language. In Python focus on learning the common DE packages like pandas, polars, SqlAlchemy, pyodbc, requests these will get used constantly when writing pipelines for rest api endpoints. Dont worry too much about getting into the weeds with oop as most pipelines are not written that way. \n\n3. If you want to go one step further learn Pyspark which is hugely useful in cloud pipelines  and datalakes. Azure data factory, Databricks, etc is just spark underneath the sheets. \n\n4. As a DBA for 10 years before making the switch. I was very familiar with On Prem / runnung SQL on VMs. A big switch for me was learning PaaS offerings like snowflake, databricks, Azure SQL, Azure data factory. So spending time learning the basics on these helped. I got lucky and was dealing with vendors / clients using these services so got paid to learn on thr job as it were. \n\n5. Many older DBAs still have yet to embrace source control. If you are in this boat learn source control, ci/cd, and managing databases as code. If you get these under you belt it will make life better as a DBA and a DE. \n\n6. Communication skills. I have to communicate with non technical and business staff more frequently as a DE than as a pure DBA. As a DBA we are kept locked up and kept away from business / non technical / dats analyst types. We are a bit like wizards who only send ravens when you have really fucked up. Being a DE is more meetings and requirement gathering.",

I have played arround with the tools available in Snowflake, seen marketing materials, and spoken to several vendors in this space.\n\nMy assessment of the current state of the art is I would trust it (more or less) on anything where a semantic layer was present. Similar to how Snowflake and the other major vendors in this space work currently.\n\nBut I don't know how valuable this is, because at least for us if something is in our semantic layer it means that we have it in a dashboard or a report.  These items tend to be our easiest most basic questions and things no one asks about anymore, because of how easy we have already made it for folks to find the answers.\n\nI mean most time our analysts spend on questions is spent trying to figure out what the heck our users are asking for. If the users knew the words for how to ask for what they were looking for chances are they would have known how to find the report or dashboard that answers their question.\n\nBut I do think the current vendors can provide reasonably reliable text to sql on well modeled data with a complete semantic layer.  And that is how plan to approach this problem when some executive decides we need text to SQL. Other engineers at my company have played arround with an MCP server based approach to provide limited data access an LLM and have gotten reasonable results that way as well, but for general text to sql I would stick to the semantic layer approach.\n\nThen this stuff is moving pretty quickly so it would not surprise me if this take is out of date in a few months.\n\nEdit as for security, I also lead our company's FGA solution and we have high security requirements.  And this doesn't bother me too much.  We would not give this type of llm access to our sensitive data only access to meta data and semantic models. Any queries would be run in the context of the user asking the question.",

I'm not saying I let errors go by or wrote unoptimized code, but rather I wrote a lot of code in a lot of different ways.\n\nI got what I wanted from that blindness - it was cool to be able to read and write any language I was interested in, and I hopped around a lot on college writing basic programs in dozens of languages just to see how they work and if I could learn it quickly with my style. Unfortunately this is a useless skill once you have been in the work force for a few years. There are niches where it's useful, but the professional world wants your code to look like it's been written by one person. You also want the code repository to adhere to consistent styles and patterns and whatnot decided by the team.\n\nI'm bad at code reviews because it's harder for me to find fault in working code. I'm getting a little better at it thanks to ai tools being forced on us so I'm reading a lot more.",

But even then, after you have your prototype running, you should build a relational database based on your MongoDB database.\n\nI was led astray. I was one of those naive newbies. I chose MongoDB for my project. At first, I liked it: when I needed to add a field to an object, I add it in my code and it just worked. It felt like magic at first.\n\nBut after a while, I found out any query more complex than a basic join is a nightmare. Unreadable mess. Absolute degeneracy. My code was full of 100+ lines long unreadable queries decorated with comments like \n\n    // no way in hell this is the correct way to write this, but it works so DON'T TOUCH IT\n\nI thought \"surely I am missing something. Surely there's a way to write the queries more nicely. Surely with more practice, it will get more readable\". But after a while, I realized this was not happening.\n\nAnd the indexing. If you don't have properly set up indexes, the costs skyrocket. And you don't get any sort of warning that the database is manually searching through the millions of entries, checking them one by one for a match, multiple times per query. And even if you have indexes that by all means should have been used, sometimes they just don't get used, without any apparent reason. Optimizing queries is hell.\n\nAt one point, I had to bite the bullet. I knew I could not keep it at this state much longer. It took me 2 months of tedious work, rewriting everything to Postgres, migrating all the data that accumulated over time. It sucked. But the relief of finally deleting the wasteland that my MongoDB has become was like getting that really bad tooth that has been decaying for 5 years finally pulled. It was awesome.\n\nJust use Postgres. If you are working with data of undefined structure, just use JSONB.\n\nAnd to show you a concrete example, here's a query from my codebase back when it used MongoDB (yes, all this is a single query). Don't try to understand it. Just marvel at it. \n\n    // sorry.

Somebody else controls it. Example is a web scraper - you’re not in charge of the website you are scraping. Schema-less is a big thing here because it lets you store “anything” in the DB. Also, NoSQL is much more beginner-friendly, which is why you see it so much in courses and tutorials.\nOf course, it has some great horizontal scalability features and a lot of other stuff, but that's not important for beginners in this field (at least, not yet).\n\n2. If I have complete control over my object model, I would always use a relationship database since I’m already familiar with SQL. Also, if I have a lot of data to process (like GBs or TBs), I’ll avoid MongoDB or any NoSQL database.\n\n3. It's usually a great choice. It lets you shift your focus to the app and its logic, spending less time on data structures, schemas, etc. In real life, at some point, you'll need to learn SQL because it’s much more common than NoSQL, but for personal projects and learning Mongo, it's a great start. \nMongoDB and Atlas created one of the best developer experiences I have seen",

        "body": "I've written a major application with Mongo as a backend, and I'm sort of regretting it. I will say that it scales very well; a cluster of Mongo instances is very malleable, instances can be added, removed and scaled at will without any downtime. Also, since it's schemaless, there's hardly ever any downtime for anything like schema migrations or the like.\n\nThis comes at quite a cost though. You need to _really_ understand its eventually-consistent model to write code that may be prone to race conditions, where you'd just use locks and/or transactions in other databases. You'll also need to understand its failure modes in edge cases; for example how _exactly_ the retry behaviour of the driver is in case a server instance happens to disappear mid-transaction, and when the application needs to catch that and retry itself.\n\nEven if it's schemaless, for most regular applications, you still need a schema. If the database doesn't enforce it, your app layer needs to enforce it. If you don't, you'll end up with _a lot_ of uncertain code all over the place and a lot of `if..else` trying to compensate for vague schemas. Ask me how I know, it's hardly maintainable after a while.\n\nFor most regular apps which need a relational data store, I would not recommend Mongo. At least not as the primary database. It can be useful for storing a large pool of unrelated, fairly unstructured data which is mostly accessed individually instead of serving aggregate queries. Spontaneously I could imagine YouTube storing data about its videos in Mongo; they're mostly accessed individually, each document can sprout various metadata, most documents are accessed fairly infrequently, and there's _loads_ of them.",

But this doesn't mean the projects themselves are the differentiator.  I have never seen a project unique enough to make up for anything significant in thousands of resumes.  With AI I think this muddies the waters even more.

I can teach a toddler to write letters, doesn't mean the toddler can write words. And it doesn't mean the toddler can write a syntactically right and meaningful sentence.\n\nWriting is easy. You just put letters one after another. Learning the words is harder, you have to know the words. Making a meaningful sentence is very hard.\n\nIt requires you to have an idea to express, then choose the right words, in the right orders, with the right nuances to get your listener to understand you.\n\nThis is all about code here. Learning \"for\", \"if\", \"while\", \"switch\", \"function\", \"null\"... All those keywords that have a specific meaning. You know most of them.\n\nI guess that if I asked you to write a loop over an array you could achieve it. The issue comes with complexity.\n\nYou don't know what to express and even if you know what to express, you aren't experienced enough to know how to express it if the complexity rises.\n\nFrom my point of view, if my take makes sense to you, you'll have to work through that. It took me 2 years to get that mindset. It takes more or less time for different people depending on where they start and how efficient their learning process is. You need more time, more practice.\n\nMake projects, complex ones. Do some more DSA. Work the problems in your brain, try your solution on the computer, get the result, fix and restart the process. Look on the internet for information and solutions, but don't copy directly, understand and inject the solution in your code, try it, see it, feel it, deeply.\n\nOn another note: feeling dumber than you thought. \n\nI don't think you are stupid, but I don't know you. It's relative to what you think and expect here. I think you just had a revelation on the Dunning Kruger effect. Feels like science, not sure it is, but the intuition is pretty on point IMO. \n\nThe less experienced in something, the more confident you are in it. \n\nYou hit the reality check. And you placed yourself on \"the mountain of stupidity\". But it doesn't mean you are stupid, it's just a biased view. Something we all do. Don't blame yourself. Being aware of that make you smarter than a lot of people. Use this to understand where you stand more than trying to blame yourself.",

        "body": "1. In C/C++, arguments passed into functions **get copied** into the function. They get copied because we may not want to modify the original argument, so it saves us a line of copying, separates areas of concern, and it's a bit faster.\n\n2. We **can** pass large values (complex structs, arrays, etc...) as function arguments. But they will be copied. That can be a lot of copying, especially if we can't anticipate the size of arguments `my_func(int arg[12])` vs `my_func(int arg[9999])`. \n\n3. Since function arguments get copied, and large copies are expensive, it's cheaper and faster to pass the address (pointer) of the data as a function argument.\n\n1. Very low level programming can involve jumping forward and backward to memory addresses. We can do math on the pointer itself to get to different addresses. You may never do this yourself, but pointers gives us access to this capability.\n\nWhy are you experiencing this in C++ when C++ is supposed to be modern? Because C++ was designed to be compatible with C and the preexisting C libraries. C was designed like this because it was one of the first successful abstractions above assembly and written in an era when compute, storage, and memory was very expensive (cost and compute cycles).\n\nEdit: I mostly mentioned functions + pointers and not pointers in general, but my goal is to justify the utility of pointers and mentioning their benefits with functions is good enough.",

If you need to load a picture into memory, you don't know where in memory that picture is going to end up, so it isn't given an address until it is made.  The pointer stores where that memory is after it is allocated.\n\nThe next question as to why this is a thing where it isn't in other languages is because C++ is code that is running much closer to the processor than in other languages.  Other languages abstract away this issue for you, but in environments where C++ is commonly used, such as 3D engines, operating system kernels, or embedded devices like arduino, we can't trust any other tooling to handle this efficiently enough for us, we need direct control.  And using pointers to manage memory allocation and passing around information is how it all works under the hood.\n\nBeyond that, pointers are also the mechanism that your program uses to point to functions in other programs such as system API's, etc.",

One of the best pieces of advice I got from my first manager was something along the lines of “I don’t care about dev. We have it for a reason and no one depends on that data. Go break it. That’s how you find out how it’s working and how you find issues. We can always redeploy dev “. And that changed my learning perspective. Instead of feeling like I need to understand the docs cover to cover, I now feel empowered to take a look at the architecture and app dependencies and then just go fuck with it. \n\nFor example, the past 3 years I’ve worked almost exclusively with serverless architecture in AWS using python. But I just joined a new team and we are shifting the application to EKS using a Java library. No fucking clue but I spend the last 2 days reviewing architecture, in the console, and googling/gpt every step of the way when I run into something I don’t know.

Small companies, especially non-tech companies, pick a very mainstream language and then hire programmers who already know that language.

These companies almost never pick obscure languages, they're more likely to be using an aging language like PHP.\n\n2. The most cutting-edge tech companies don't care what language you know now.

I'm by no means an expert in the field and job markets are different everywhere but I don't think I could have made it without my degree. I got my job through one of my University's work experience programs as well as the small network I made from participating in extra curricular activities. I was hired part time before I finished my degree. It really is just a piece of paper at the end of the day but I feel that the experience of going to uni and the network I built made it worth while. Not to mention the feeling of accomplishment when I graduated. It was a hard 4 years but I enjoyed it and really felt I earned it. \nBest of luck and good work on the sobriety, my friend. If you want it, you can get it.",

Also with how the job market looks now, it’s possible that an online degree from a school recruiters haven’t heard of could be a disadvantage.

My personal view is that the market will improve. But anyone’s take on that will be speculative.\n\nDon’t target QA. IMO the writing is on the wall that companies can outsource the job to less developed countries for a quarter of the cost. Aim for highest skill position possible for most safety.",

At this point I consider it to be absolutely stupid to introduce CS to students with IDE's.   To much basic material gets glossed over that often results in  students not understanding what is happening underneath.\n2. Frankly this applies to trying to write any software as a GUI application, there is too much to learn to be distracted by GUI's.\n3. So what we need to do is to get back to basics.\n4. This means building software with command line tools and maybe a simple GUI text editor.   \n5. I'd suggest following a CS program that uses C++.   You already supposedly have some CS under your belt but I'm really wondering if you learned anything.   But the point here is that as each point is explored in class you just write code that leverages that technique in as many ways as possible.   The usual first program is to write your name to the screen, often followed by simple looping.  Explore looping for hours then continue with every other concept discussed in the program.   the idea is to totally understand the ins and outs of every concept and be able to use with muscle memory.   \n6. Then start writing simple command line programs that solve things you understand well.   Try to tie in these programs with hobby's or other thigns you know well.   The point is you understand the the technology so you know what is right and you know the end result you want to see.   An example would be writing a program that takes resistor band colors and returns the actually resistance value.    Another example would be to display your favorite Chili receipt on screen.   The idea is to start out dirt simple and grow from there.\n7. Once you fell comfortable building command line programs from abstract requirements then start building  GUI apps.   At this point you will  likely want to shift away from C++ to a common platform programming language.   For example on Apples systems that would be Swift.   In some ways you will be starting over as Hello World is a common first GUI program.   You will also need to become familiar with more advanced data structures and methods.\n8. Once you get past the introductory step you need to start crafting your own apps while you follow a platform specific program.   Again the idea here is to take something you understand well, a hobby or something other and create programs that solve a problem within that domain.    You can even start over with a receipt program but this time one that stores multiple receipts and allows more interaction.   The idea is to get more and more complex.   As you learn more and more you will realize just how bad the first receipt program was and can refactor it as much as possible.   You really should have several programs under various states of construction.",

And when you finish the freecodecamp build mini projects on your own.

Performance suffers when developers clog the Main Thread with heavy tasks (like parsing JSON) instead of offloading them to Background Threads, causing UI stutters. Finally, optimized apps use Local Caching to show content instantly, whereas laggy apps force the UI to wait for the network and re-render everything from scratch, draining both battery and data. I usually see a big difference between a native application and a Cross-platform, and even more so I see how poorly WebView works.",

The answer is to build projects and start small. \n\nLook, there's no way to just leap from tutorials to building complex software in one bound. \n\nSo, start small. First, choose a project with a tight scope, like a Todo app with user accounts. \n\nThen, get a Trello account and start writing out individual tasks. You want to make these tasks super simple at first. One might be \"create a webpage with Ultimate Todo List as the title.\" Your next task might be \"Create a CSS Page and make sure it's linked to the webpage.\" Then do the same with JavaScript.\n\nIf you run into something you don't know how to do, make a card for learning how to do it. You do not need or want to fully master new technologies at this stage. You want to learn the bare minimum to incorporate it into your project.\n\nIf you get stuck, try to look up the specific thing you want to do. For example, if you're trying to make a checkbox the user can click, look up that specific thing. If you're unsure how to store your list of items, look that up, but not until you're working on that task.\n\nAnd then you just keep going. Try to complete one or two cards per day. This is almost exactly how professional software is built, btw. Only we break the cards into batches we can complete in two weeks and call it a sprint. \n\nRemember, the cards aren't complete features, they are small tasks. \n\nIf you know Git (and you should) make a repo for your project and get in the habit of making a branch for each card. Once you complete a card, merge your branch into main and start the process again. Your Main branch should always be a working app with whatever features you've added so far. \n\nStart small, complete one or two small tasks every day, rinse, repeat.\n\nIt's not just a way, it's the only way. Software is built one small step at a time.",

You will feel slower at first, but the constraints are the lesson. If your goal is to build better mental models, that pain is useful.\n\nThe main downside is cognitive load, you can end up spending a lot of time fighting the borrow checker before you have a feel for what \"good\" looks like. Some people get more mileage by doing a short pass in C first to see the sharp edges directly, then Rust feels like a structured way to avoid them. Others prefer Go for fundamentals around concurrency and simplicity, but it will not push you as hard on memory and invariants.\n\nScope wise, I would pick tiny programs with one learning objective each and a hard ceiling on features. Stuff like a simple log parser with a strict state machine, a tiny key value store in memory, a CLI that does one thing well, or a toy HTTP server. If you catch yourself designing frameworks, stop and write tests for behavior instead. That is usually the point where \"learning\" quietly turns into \"architecture as procrastination.\"",

Small, constrained programs are exactly where those concepts stop being abstract.\n\nRust is good for this, but only if you treat the friction as the lesson and not something to fight. Ownership, borrowing, and error handling will slow you down, and that’s the point. It forces you to think about state, lifetimes, and failure modes up front instead of papering over them. That maps well to how real systems break.\n\nThat said, Rust is not the only way to get there. If you ever feel like you’re spending more time appeasing the compiler than reasoning about the problem, stepping sideways into something like Go or even plain C for a bit can help. Different languages surface the same fundamentals from different angles. There’s value in contrast.\n\nThe biggest trap to avoid is “exploration creep.” Pick problems that are almost boring. A tiny file indexer. A toy key value store. A CLI that parses input, mutates state, and fails in predictable ways. Stop the moment it works. Do not add features. The learning comes from finishing and reflecting, not from polishing.\n\nYou’re already thinking about this the right way. If you keep the scope tight and finish things, the language choice matters far less than the discipline you’re building.",

One thing I do think people don’t talk about much is how well such creative pursuits complement each other. I tried to learn do comp sci when I was 19 or so and got in my head telling myself I wasn’t cut out for it, not good at math, disciplined enough, etc. A decade or so later having spent years working on my writing I have the experience to know those voices are false.

Three things helped me quite a bit: \n\nFirst : I attempted to learn a few times, but didn’t make great progress until I got really consistent about learning.  At one point I had a pretty long commute on the bus, so I got a laptop and started working every day.  That’s when my skills went from “I sort of understand” to “I can actually make things that are helpful”.\n\nSecond : There are lots of different options for learning: books, coding websites, YouTube, paid tutorials.  They all have their pros and cons, but ultimately none of them will teach you.. you have to teach yourself.  I wouldn’t worry about finding the perfect resources.  The goal should be to learn enough to take the training wheels off and start building things on your own.\n\nThird :  It sounds like you have tried a bunch of things already.  Different languages, web, etc.. I started out in a similar way.  I just wanted to “learn programming”..  I was making progres, but it was a bit scattered.  I eventually started creating some workflow helper tools in Maya for a particular project. They ended up being used by the whole team, and I started spending a lot of my time adding features and improvements. This focus on one language (python) and one purpose made a big difference.\n\nI’m sure there are lots of ways to do it, this is just what helped me.  Good luck!",

It’s a coding challenge in December where the creator releases one puzzle a day like an advent calendar, although this year he only did 12 days. \n\nEach day you’re given a Christmas themed puzzle to solve and some input data and you have to write a code to solve it in a language of your choice. The puzzles get progressively harder as you go. The first few days are usually fairly simple list comprehension style but as you get further you have to use DFS, regexes, Dijkstras, interpreting JSONs etc. So it’s a fun way to practice DSA with a bit more of a story than Leetcode. \n\nAs an example one of the puzzles from 2024 you’re given input data which is a large grid of #’s and .s plus one ^ . The ^ is the start postion of a guard. The guard walks in the direction she’s pointing until she hits an # when she turns right. You have to work out how many unique cells the guard visits before leaving the room.\n\nThe challenge goes back to 2015 and you can play all of the old puzzles for free so I find it a really fun way to practice. Once I’ve solved a puzzle I look at how other people have solved it in other languages and find ways I can improve my code.",

The other was a 20 year tenured dinosaur using the same slides he'd been using since the 2000s, mumbling his way along while we were left to decode the remains.\n\nIn both cases, algorithms were only touched on to a theoretical capacity in lecture - only word problems appeared in ungraded work which nobody did because the graded stuff took priority. In neither case was the learning experience long lasting. In both cases it was the same procedure: Survive the semester and try to prep for the next batch of courses.\n\nBeyond those courses, our projects rarely required algorithm work. The closest I've ever come was implementing A\\* pathfinding for a turn-based tactics game I made for a game programming course. Best course in my 4 years here. Besides that it's largely been 4 years of half-assedly displaying a false-understanding of concepts, rather than actually using them.\n\nThis is why side projects are important for CS students.",

I can follow it at my own pace and on the website https://lacerba.io . The platform initially covers a lot of theory, starting with networking basics (TCP/IP, DNS, routers, what the web is and what the Internet is, protocols, etc.), before delving deeper into the practical side. It will help me become a well-rounded web developer, understanding front-end and back-end development, which is a great addition to my resume, complete with certification. Duration: 112 hours\nIf you'd like, there are free individual basic courses, as well as masterclasses on a topic you'd like to explore in depth.",

But academics depend on existing curricula because it is very hard to develop new lessons and lab projects, so MIPS examples will continue for many years to come.\n\nARM is quite popular with processors available from many different vendors. Upcoming is RISC-V and 64bit ARM (also available from Microchip). Old 8bit standbys are PIC and AtmelAVR that can be important depending on your notion of \"embedded\" (not every toaster and microwave is running Linux-ARMs yet),. There are also 16bit processors that are optimized for motor controllers if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nOnce you get the hang of any one of those then the others follow pretty easily so look at the market you hope to enter. Anything with wifi or ethernet will probably want ARM or newer. Motors will be the 16bit DSP engines or specialized ARM devices (often slightly more than the typical assembly instruction set). Light bulbs and toasters and hand-held appliances will probably continue with 8bit which is easily mastered.\n\nThe important point is having something to practice on until you are comfortable with how it works. There are a number of [Curiosity Nano boards from Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/evaluation-boards/curiosity-nano) that can give a flavor of most of these for not a lot of $$ so its reasonable to have different versions.",

It is a good career and exposes you to a lot of variables with respect to electronics.   However you will not do a lot of custom electronics, it is largely programming of controllers, panel design and the like.   So it is sort of high level embedded programming.\n\nThat said Assembly Language skills and understanding can be a big pay off for most programmers.   Obviously for embedded this is daily use while for other programmers it helps them understand how software works.  Back in my day the first exposure to assembly language in the class room was via a VAX emulator running on a SUN platform.   Learning VAX assembly would be useless these days.   Instead I'd take a two prong approach, learn PIC and ARM assembly.    Embedded ARM is a big player these days and PIC is still extremely useful in small embedded devices.   More importantly they are drastically different architectures.",

        "body": "“Assembly language” isn’t a generic thing. It’s a way to write machine code with mnemonics rather than just heaps of hex or octal numbers. The mnemonics and their meanings are entirely dependent on the machine instruction sets of the target processor. So, if you know PDP-11 assembler language, you don’t really know ARM-64 or x86 or MIPS or whatever. \n\nIf you find an embedded job, you’ll be using the processor your employer chose. If you start a company to make an embedded project, you’ll choose the processor. So your core skill will be getting your coding process up and running quickly on whatever instruction set.\n\nIf your time is worth anything, you’ll hammer out most of the embedded code in C. Both GCC and LLVM have really good facilities for turning C code into astonishingly well optimized machine code for your processor of choice. It can prolly generate smaller and faster code than 99.9% of programmers ever will be able to. I’ve worked with a couple of the 0.1%, those folks are amazing. But they still use a lot of C.\n\nAssembly comes into its own for small chunks of an application that are time- or power- critical. And often the assembly code is embedded in some sort of pragma directive inside .c source code files.\n\nThere’s still a lot to learn by programming machine instructions directly. Learning how registers, stack pointers, program counters, and other machine concepts work is helpful. You may as well do it for whatever machine you have readily at hand. \n\nC compilers generally have options that make them generate “listings” with the generated machine instructions displayed. That, combined with the instruction architecture document for your processor, will teach you a lot. \n\nEspecially, compare the generated code with optimization turned off (-g) and on (-O).",

As you get further along you learn things to help you organize your code not necessarily build new things. So like another person said if you know functions, loops and conditionals you can build most things. You might need to add some stuff to do graphics or learn some html/css if you want to do web things but you don't need a tutorial for that you can just jump in and start googling. When you get to that freeze point where its hard to start try to get the first part of the program onto the screen. It doesn't matter if it does nothing having something on the screen gives you something to build the next thing onto.",

        "body": "You just finished your first semester. I'd say that for now look into different courses/paths your university is going to introduce you into. We can throw at you all kinds of tech stacks but what if you pick DevOps over web application development? Or you pick mobile app development over IoT/embedded programming? Perhaps you go for telecom technologies instead?\n\nYou having finished your first semester is a bit early to make you pick a path and target one or another company. Unless you clearly know what you want to do.\n\nAlso, your break is going to be what, 1 month or less? It will not be enough to go over all the different paths one might recommend to you.\n\nI'd say that if you haven't done yet, then learn to use Git. It will be used regardless in which field you'll be working at. Learn to make pull/merge requests, learn to make feature branches, etc. That knowledge will be needed also in your coming semesters. Try it out with some hobby project (whichever medium: mobile app, a script outputting to a terminal, a website, etc.)\n\nThen, you do can map the different technologies that are used by companies in your area. Search by \"junior developer\" or \"junior engineer\" or \"junior software developer\" or such. Yes, you are targeting internship but you'll be working with some tech stack. Even when it comes to very simple tasks they give to interns. You can make a list for mobile app development, a list for web application development, a list for IoT/embedded/hardware programming, etc. Might be that some of the technologies you will learn during your courses. But definitely can be that you might have to learn something on your own or they will teach you during the internship.\n\nAnother thing that you can do is mapping down all the different companies that are taking interns in first place. You can learn all the different programming languages, but when you have no company to apply to then perhaps you are picking a technology that has no internships in your area. For example you might be learning Python or Java but if companies in your area are taking only interns to embedded programming then you'll need C and C++ instead. So, make a solid plan first before you start picking programming languages, frameworks, etc.\n\nYou can also look into companies that are hosting open door days, hosting tech talks, etc. Yes, these are not internship events but if you are social enough, you might find internship via connections you make in these events.\n\nMore realistic approach (instead of looking for internship via tech talk events) is looking if your university has a programming/robotics club. And then join that. These clubs will introduce you into different interesting projects, into different club organized events (but also company visits), and you'll get connections.\n\nThis is what you realistically can do during your break. You'll have much clearer idea of your options when you start actually applying for internships. Whereas your course mates will be in your current shoes, looking aimlessly for internship offers, not knowing what to do.\n\nSure, it helps if you have a hobby project and you have it in Github and perhaps even hosted somewhere or running on some device (depending of its nature). Then a company will see that you can actually work on a project.\n\nBesides an ability to work on a project you also should improve your group work skills / soft skills. This is why I suggested to join some programming related extracurricular activity club in your university. Software development is a group work, usually. Yeah, there is freelancing but you are not targeting it as an intern. An intern must be able to work in a team. I have had different bad experiences with new hires who just do not function in a team. Sure, you can have all kinds of technical skills but if you do not function in a team then it will harm your own progress, it will make you a blocker when it comes to handling tasks, etc. A good intern is somebody who is proactive, shows an interest towards learning, is willing to work in a team, is a good listener, etc.",

Hell, I didn't even start a votech until 25.\n\nOne thing I can suggest to you is to take a step back from programing, and use something like [draw.io](http://draw.io) to map everything out. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you can get a good idea of what's where. Then the implementation is going to be easier, and you can see right off the bat what you can trim. \n\nIt's also a good exercise in mapping out your edge cases. When you are building something that moves and interacts with the world your primary focus is on not missing a single edge case because people can be hurt and property can be destroyed. Ya dig? Your project isn't likely there yet.\n\nI keep several things. A note book, my phone, a couple docs. Then when I'm going through stuff, I make sure I didn't miss these edge cases I noted down everywhere. I generally deal with industrial systems, particularly utilities like ammonia refrigeration, steam boilers, large electrical power systems, large pump systems, etc. So it's not as important for you.\n\nOnce you have a solid map and the data laid out, what you can/can't do will make more sense I'm sure. Just the fact that you say \"I'm not sure if I'm good enough to do that\" is the first step - you are making sure you are working within your limits, but not afraid to push them. That's wise.

Mapping is only used to \"validate\" areas of the map that doesn't match what they already \"knew\" about the area. They do NOT do autonomous mapping. In a new city, they have safety drivers go down each block to do the initial mapping. They also have GPS as backup, and for Google, Streetview as another backup for 3D AR mapping. \n\nYour little bot does NOT have any of these secondary / tertiary locator means in the school interior. So you can be inspired by Google / Waymo, but you cannot copy their approach because you don't have their hardware nor their secondary / tertiary nav data.

        "body": "You have to understand some programming history to understand why C and C++ exist.\n\nLets roll back the clock to 1990 or so.  Personal computers are just starting to become practical.  For $3000 in todays money you can get a home desktop computer about as powerful as a super Nintendo is (286 or 386 PC running windows 3.1)  At the time this is considered cutting edge, way faster than those atari and apple 2 computers people are using before.  You can get real work done with these!\n\nYour options for programming languages really boil down to something like assembler, BASIC, or C / C++.  Lets compare each.\n\n\\- Anyone programming in 1980 to 1990 or so to do real work was likely using assembler.  This is as close as you can get to actual processor instructions.  Read value from memory address one into register 1, read value into memory address 2, compare the values with binary math, if they are equal then JMP to subroutine that outputs string from memory address 3, etc.  This is literal processor instructions - it doesn't get any more raw and fast than that.\n\n\\- You could learn BASIC, but BASIC is an interpreted language.  Rather than the code being compiled into processor instructions BASIC is a program itself that reads the program you are running and figures out what it should be doing in real time.  This makes it about 10 times slower.  But good god, is it easier to write a program in BASIC than Assembler - you can just define an array, you can just write a function, you can just define subroutines that take actual arguments - its so much more clean.  If you can write your program in BASIC it will be much easier to maintain and simpler to comprehend - but its going to run soooo much slower.  In a world where making a FPS like wolfenstein 3D work stretches the limit of what is possible on the hardware, a 10x speed loss is just too much when your program relies on speed.\n\n\\- Then comes C and C++.  The idea behind these languages is that you can write your code kind of like interpreted languages instead of assembler - defining functions, data structures, complicated mathematical algorithms - but instead of the computer interpreting the program in real time, it can convert it all to bytecode - basically the same thing as assembler - and run it almost as fast as an assembler program as a result.  C/C++ is written like a processor actually acts.  But as nice as this is, there are still significant shortcomings.  Dynamic memory allocation which is something that just happens like magic in an interpreted language, is not automatic in C++ - stuff like creating an array, creating a variable length string, or defining a variable, or converting one variable type to another - this is not actually provided in C, you have to manage it on your own.  Which you most defiantly can - and doing so is easier than doing so in assembler.  So now you have all the advantages of assembler and the complexity is significantly reduced.\n\nBut its not 1990 anymore, its 35 years later.  Computers are hundreds if not thousands of times faster, have multiple cores, usually have 32,000 MB of RAM instead of like, 4 MB, etc.  There is enough extra speed in a computer that you don't really need that extreme optimization anymore.  And the way computers operate with all this extra resources have also changed - with multi core systems you can have some of the cores or the GPU handling the graphics pipeline in your program, which is like 95% of the processing time - and this is all handled outside of the program you are actually writing.\n\nThere are also many, many more languages that more elegantly handle the problem of ease of development balanced against speed.  Most modern languages, like javascript or python, act like interpreted languages in that they are flexible and just run, but under the hood they still compile to bytecode for speed - the performance loss of using them vs C++ is not as much as it used to be.  Modern Javascript in particular is \\*\\*king FAST, thanks to google throwing millions and millions of dollars into optimizing chrome. The way the async cycle in javascript works is far more flexible than what C/C++ offers, and in general all the features in C/C++ are now available in newer languages, and usually they do it better.\n\nFinally, you should consider that your programs don't need the extra speed and complexity that comes with C++ because all the heavy lifting in your program will not actually be done by the program you are writing.  The graphics are done by the GPU.  If you want a video or mp3 encoder or something, you bring in someone else's tool into your program as a library (probably written in C++) and invoke it and get the results.  Programming in 2025 is more about gluing premade tools together and orchestrating them, and your code is the orchestration layer.  It is much more beneficial for this layer to be simpler and easier to comprehend and manage and leaving the dirty details to other tools.  You will always be on hardware that is hundreds of times faster than you need for this purpose.",

Rails is great for learning how a product is put together on the backend and lets you ship quickly because it’s very structured and opinionated. JavaScript can feel messier at first, but using the same language for both frontend and backend is powerful if your goal is to build products on your own and understand the whole stack.\n\nIn practice, the language matters less than finishing projects. While building theORQL, what helped the most wasn’t choosing the “perfect” stack, but learning how to build, break things, debug, and iterate quickly. Those skills transfer no matter what you use.",

It's how you talk about it that makes it float.  So here `scores` is a pointer when it gets to the function. We've told our program the type referenced by that pointer is float.  To be clear, it could be a single float at the memory location or thousands.  Once you pass that pointer, the actual size gets lost.  As, hopefully, seen in that trace above.",

Example with address annotations in parens:\n\n    float a(0x01) = 0.1f; // addr 0x01 (alias a) contains value 0.1f.\n    float *b(0x05) = &a = 0x01; // addr 0x05 (alias b) contains value 0x01 (a's addr).\n\nName/symbol, address, storage, type, and value, are distinct things. Names mean we don't have to write addresses (though you can, and do in embedded). Storage for a single object (not in the OOP sense, object = datum here) can of course be larger than a single address. Value is what is in that region of memory when read at a given time. Books can be written here (E.g. *Modern C*, Gustedt), this isn't supposed to be exhaustive.\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. It's the address of the first byte of the first element in the array.\n2. Those are expressions that yield results of pointer type. Dereference and addressof operators can be thought of as inverses, yes. The reason you can write a function that takes a pointer and then pass an array is because of the language semantics, no doubt influenced by what is happening on the hardware. When passing by value in C++, the values of the arguments are copied into the target function's stack frame (usually, compilers are clever and will elide things). How do we efficiently copy an array here? We don't. We say that arrays \"decay\" to pointers in this scenario, and we copy a smaller fixed-size pointer value instead (fits in a register, nice!). Referencing the above, we've copied the (base) address of the storage of the array into the storage for the function parameter. We have a pointer value that we can dereference and/or do pointer arithmetic on. **Whereas the original name/symbol (arr) aliased the address of the first element directly, the parameter stores that same address as a value. In this situation, the language doesn't force us to explicitly take the address using an expression and then pass it, it effectively does it for us.**\n\nHopefully that makes sense. I do recommend both K&R C and Modern C if you want to go beyond this summary. I simplified and left things out.",

        "body": "We have to go back to C for an understanding. K&R developed C on a PDP-6, which typically had ~144 KiB of memory. They thought arrays were too large to be passing around by value, like you could any other value type:\n\n    void fn(int pass_by_value);\n\n    int main() {\n      int value_gets_copied_on_the_stack;\n\n      fn(value_gets_copied_on_the_stack);\n\nSo they decided that they would 1) pass by reference as a language feature to be more efficient, and 2) hide the reality from you:\n\n    void fn(int array[123]);\n\n    int main() {\n      int gets_passed_by_reference[123]);\n\n      fn(gets_passed_by_reference);\n\nIn C parlance - a pointer references a value. What you DON'T see is how the parameter type decays:\n\n    void fn(int *this_is_the_reality);\n\nThe array itself doesn't decay - instead, it implicitly converts. You will not be informed, you will not be told, you will not be warned, and there's nothing you can to to prevent this. Again: LANGUAGE FEATURE. Notice the compiler completely strips out the array size.\n\nThanks, K&R, for whatever the fuck this is about...\n\nThe array is of type `int[123]`. The parameter is of type `int *`. The type system does recognize the array as a distinct type - where the size is a part of the type signature. We can even capture that in C:\n\n    typedef int[123] int_123;\n    typedef int* int_ptr;\n\n    void fn(int_ptr pointer_to_int);\n\n    int main() {\n      int_123 array;\n\n      fn(array);\n\nSo what exactly is going on with pointers? The term is: Type Erasure. We are intentionally losing information about what the pointer points to. This can be powerful. Are we pointing to a single element or the first of an array? One past the end of the array? Heap or stack? Local, global, or member? Cast?\n\nWe don't know SHIT about what that pointer is pointing at, other than that address right there \"is an int\". As far as the code and compiler is concerned, that's all we got. If you're willing to make some assumptions, you can write some abstract code that can do some interesting things. You can access, you can iterate, you can delimit, you can reinterpret...\n\nBut unlike any other type in C, this means that when I pass an `int` by value, I'm working on a copy that exists on the stack, but if I pass an array by value, I'm reading and writing the original array in place. And remember that C didn't even GET `const` until C99...\n\nType erasure is useful for writing all manner of abstractions. You can look at how `bsearch` is written and used, for an example. If you had to know what kind of thing you were pointing at, you'd have to have a local `int` pointer, a member `int` pointer, an array `int` pointer... It becomes an alias of limited value - often we want to operate upon a type without wanting to know too much detail.\n\nOh, there are more specific pointer types...\n\n    struct s {\n      int i, j, k;\n    };\n\n    int main() {\n      s instance;\n\n      int struct s::* ptr_to_member_int_of_s = &instance.i;\n\nFeel free to get more specific if it serves a utility. Such things are used less often.\n\n---\n\nSo we've lost type information. Is there a way we can preserve it? Yes.\n\n    void fn(int (*array)[123]);\n\nThe extra parenthesis are necessary. This is still C; `array` here is a pointer, which means it can be null. C++ gives us references:\n\n    void fn(int (&array)[123]);\n\nI hate the syntax. Luckily, this is what type aliases are for - since pointers are a distinct type:\n\n    // C++ using alias...\n    using int[123] = int_123;\n    using int_123* = int_123_ptr;\n    using int_123& = int_123_ref;\n\n    void fn1(int_123 &pass_by_ref);\n    void fn2(int_123_ref also_pass_by_ref);\n\n    void fn3(int_123 decay_to_ptr);\n\nDon't get fooled by aliases. They don't make types, they only name them. You won't get value semantics for array parameters just because you've aliased it.\n\nThis makes your code safer. Type information is preserved, you are referencing a more specific type. It also means the compiler can optimize more aggressively. But the size is a part of the type, so `fn1` and `fn2` won't work with ANY other type. `int[234]`? Go fuck yourself.\n\nContinued...",

Your work should be tracked somewhere (Jira for instance). There should be a record of what your code needs to accomplish and the acceptance criteria for it before any work starts.\n2. Your organization/team should have code standards that all code is held to. This should include testing requirements.\n3. Code should be in source control and require review before merging. The review should include verifying #1 and #2.\n4. Merges should require all tests to pass.\n\nThis is the most bare bones description of a basic SDLC. If all 4 of the above are verified your code is ready to ship. Improvements are accomplished through iteration of this process.",

        "body": ">I have never felt so dumb and overwhelmed. I can't even solve basic array problems. I've been trying to study the patterns like sliding window and two pointer and can usually identify when to use them.\n\nFor this kind of stuff, then for me it's essential to have a well-illustrated example, in order to really understand. For example, you used the term \"sliding window\", which gave my brain a vague inkling of what you're talking about, but not yet enough to have a \"picture\" in my mind of what you're really trying to solve.\n\nThen I used Google and found this Answer which is illustrated beautifully: [What is Sliding Window Algorithm? Examples? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples)\n\nAnyway, as the Answerer points out, calling it a \"sliding window algorithm\" is really a misnomer; it is a useful technique, though.\n\nSo, how does one get better at using this technique? Well, you've got to practice it, of course. The example shown in that Q&A is a pretty good starter problem (find the maximum sum of n consecutive numbers); you can adapt that to almost anything (e.g. find the lowest average of n consecutive numbers, find a particular small sequence within a large stream of numbers, etc.).\n\nFor this example, I'd see the \"sliding window\" approach as an optimization of the brute force approach. That is, solve it first with the \"brute force\" approach (which will still be 'efficient' in computational terms, but will be a factor of n slower than necessary), and then solve it again with a sliding window approach.\n\nSolving a problem twice may sound lame or may sound like unneeded extra work, but in a situation like this will be satisfying because first, you'll be able to measure exactly how much faster the better approach is, and second, you'll have a \"testing client\" against which you can test your 'better' approach. For something like this, it's usually easier to make  a mistake in the implementation of the more clever approach, so a handy testing method is to make a testing driver that solves your problems using both approaches.\n\n(I.e. the test driver tests some sample testing inputs against the 'dumb' solution way, as well as against the 'clever' solution way) and then stops if two clients give different results (which indicates that ONE of the approaches must be wrong for that particular input). Usually you'll end up with a bug or two in the 'clever' way, but by systematically comparing with the 'dumb' way, you can normally lay such bugs to rest in a fairly straightforward way (debugging will still be work to do it, of course, but it will never feel like you're totally stuck, because you'll have the alternate version to compare against).\n\n>I've seen many people say they took courses or they learned it in college, but I just cannot afford an expensive course let alone going to college. Does anyone have some advice?\n\nRobert Sedgewick et al's course on Algorithms is available free of charge on Coursera, the last time I checked (for auditing it); it's a pretty good course. You'll need the textbook to do the course properly, but I suppose you can find a low-cost edition, use a library, etc. if you cannot afford to buy that book.",

College certainly helps, and honestly it’s going to be quite hard getting your first software engineering job without a CS-related degree. If all that doesn’t deter you then keep at it, you likely just need to find resources that jive with your learning style better. Have you tried CS50?",

Despite having experience building web apps, I found myself unprepared for the algorithms course the first time I attempted, so I went back and worked through Princeton’s/Sedgwick’s intro computer science course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java). Like the algorithms course, it’s a two-part course on coursera. After completing those two parts, I was well-prepared for the slog through the algorithms course. \n\nGood luck on your learning journey!",

Remember that progress is often gradual, and we get used to where we are at the moment, we're not wired to see very gradual changes. This is why keeping track of things and being mindful is very important.\n\nWhen I was starting out, I didn't understand a lot of things, both about coding in a general sense, but also the nuances of what I was working on, the problems I was facing, and how to best resolve them. There was problems I couldn't solve, ideas I couldn't put into reality. Now, I am able to do them, even if I need to refer to documentation or the occasional reference of similar code to get an idea of how to resolve my problem.\n\nThis is true with other skills too. 10 years ago, I could never model and animate for video games. Now? I do it as a hobby, I'm not the best, but I do decent enough that people enjoy my work. It was hours and hours of having fun, creating art, studying other games and their animations, learning some foundations & theory.\n\nThere wasn't any single magical moment. I had to be mindful, step back, and realize how easy and fast it was, and that even if a project was difficult, I understood enough to begin working on it.\n\nIt is okay if you find you have gaps in your knowledge, those are areas to improve in. I'm poor in Data Structures & Algorithms and other foundational stuff, because I'm self-taught making Godot games and modding old games like Quake, Turok and Half-Life.

You probably don’t need a project for every sub-section of the topic you’re learning.\n\nBut you also shouldn’t wait until you’ve finish the entire topic to start implementing.\n\nAs an example, if you were learning how to configure an nginx server, you would want to read their documentation and edit your nginx config *at the same time*. It wouldn’t make sense to read the whole documentation from front to back before you open your text editor. Similarly, you wouldn’t want to implement a brand new project each time you completed a new section of their docs; that’d be too many projects.\n\nYour best bet is to have a loose idea as for you want to build, and then implement the things you learn as you go. And ofc you will learn stuff you don’t need, but you can try those things out and then leave them behind.\n\n*disclaimer*: if you are fairly comfortable with the material you’re trying to learn (if you are already familiar with it or similar tech) then you may actually just read their documentation and not need to implement to practice.",

Each team can ship the services they own independently of other teams, which allows them to iterate faster and respond more quickly to issues.\n2. Security isolation. Isolating functionality reduces the blast radius if a component is compromised. If a monolith is compromised, then the attackers potentially have full access to everything.\n3. Reliability isolation. Similar to security isolation, reliability isolation means there is a smaller blast radius when a component fails. Following from #1, devops will also be easier when your teams only need to understand the components they own and deploy instead of needing to understand the whole monolith during on-call incidents.\n4. Scaling mismatches. Monoliths that contain multiple functional paradigms (for example both async batch processes and synchronous requests) can be very difficult to scale, performance tune, and cost tune. It is easier to scale and performance/cost tune systems when functional paradigms are isolated into separate services.\n5. Licensing/distribution issues. This one is probably the rarest in this list, but sometimes you need to isolate components due to billing/licensing/other business agreement purposes. Especially for per-cpu licenses, which kind of overlaps with #4.\n\nIf you don't need anything in 1-5, then a monolith is probably fine.",

For example, you should have progressively more complicated \"guided\" exercises (from simple to complicated, worked out step by step with solutions), and then you should have a series of \"solve it yourself\" exercises with no solutions provided, for which you must solve yourself.\n\nThe above organization is how most textbooks are organized. Unfortunately, I've seen diminishingly few video lecture series that are organized in this way (i.e. none). Sometimes, video lectures on platforms like Coursera have a limited amount of this kind of organization, e.g. \"pause the video and try to work out the solution\" type of stuff, but usually the problems presented in that kind of video situation are very simple \"fill in the blank\" or \"answer a conceptual question\" variety.\n\nTLDR: Get a textbook.",

You can't tackle any larger project, can't work together with others, etc. without understanding how a small part of a problem solved with code contributes towards solving a larger problem.\n\nIn practical terms when you get a DSA exercises if I were you I'd just invest a little more time into planning, before doing the actual coding.\n\n- If it's more of a linear problem (you can tell if the problem reads like a sequential recipe) you can add markers or paragraph breaks where you think sub-problems start and end\n\n- if the problem description is more \"wild\" and all over the place instead of just trying to pull the problem apart through line breaks it's probably better if you create a list which on level 1 contains milestones and on level 2 contains the actual sub-tasks.

BUt if you are stuck, just look for hints. Idk where you solve them. try leetcoe , it has hints.",

It's easy to fall into that trap, but what helped me was setting a timer for focused effort before I even look at a solution. The time pressure helps simulate what happens during interviews, anyway. During that time, I try everything - different approaches, simplifying the problem, drawing diagrams, sometimes even using pen and paper so the solution isn't an easy click for me. Even if I don't solve it, I write down my gaps/mistakes so I know what to improve on in terms of the problem-solving process.\n\nDSA exercises on LeetCode help, but I also found it effective to supplement my resources for more diversified learning. Look into textbooks, guides, and even entire platforms like Interview Query, as you get a breakdown of sample problems in a way that's applicable to interview settings - clear and concise. It really comes down to knowing your weak spots then making sure you're learning in a progressive way through structured resources.",

If ypu want a good pattern here is a good one KISS. Keep it simple, stupid - it means what you do, do it as straightforward as you can. \n\nA good example is what redux do. In react if you have a state, and need to share it between few components you need to pass it as props through they common parent, but it is a bit hard and really unobvious, so redux was made so you have a common state where you can reach in for the data to a singleton.\n\nThis solution is better because it simplifies something that is used often and that isunobvious to do.",

Always be ready and willing to do the work that your experience tells you needs to be done.\n\n\nTake just one item from the list above, like reviews. A person who just \"knows a language\" often thinks, \"Hey, the code works. Why do I need anyone to review it? Why can't I just commit it and move on to the next thing?\" A good developer can explain *in detail* why reviews are needed, could teach a half-hour seminar on how to conduct an effective code review, and supply painful memories of times when poor or nonexistent reviews led to costly mistakes and recrimination.",

We just get a little better at it.\n\n\n\nWhen I start dreaming up a new project, I start with a \"sell sheet\". I write open-source code and make it public, so my \"sell sheet\" is the \"readme\" file for a github repository. (If you're not yet familiar with github repositories, it's worth your trouble to spend some time doing that. [Read this](https://github.com/trending).\n\nMy sell sheet tells the reader:\n\n1. What is this project?\n1. Who is it for?\n1. What does it do for those people it's for?\n1. Why should they use it?\n1. How do they get it?\n1. How do they get started using it?\n1. How do they find out more?\n\nI write this stuff down, super rough, for myself, as I dream up the project. \n\nI'm writing it as if the project is finished.  Writing the sell sheet that way takes some imagination about the completed project.  \n\nBy the way, contracts for megabucks for software development look something like this sell sheet. \n\nI suggest you try writing a sell sheet for your project. It's a structured way to guide your imagination into figuring it out.\n\nOnce you know pretty clearly what you want to do, figuring out how to do it becomes much much easier.\n\nYou got this. Do good work!",

They sell candidates on the idea that their work is going to help sick people and how it is a privilege for you do be working there.\n\nIt's such a privilege that you should take 20% - 30% below market to work there.  That money you leave on the table is said to be reinvested back in to the company, but it really just goes in to the CEO's theoretical pockets.\n\nYou would think that you can at latest create great devices for patients to use with rich features and so forth.  The reality is you meet bare minimum FDA standards for a safe product and go no further.  The problem at the companies I worked for is that you were not selling to the end user.\n\nYou are making money from insurance companies on things like disposable components that you change each treatment. A dialysis machine is expensive and the vast majority of people on dialysis are paying for it with insurance and not out of pocket.  That means investing on making a really nice UX is not any priority.\n\nAt the companies I worked at they don't make extra money investing a lot of time and effort on a well thought out UX, weather that is the UI or the physical device. From what I saw you give them the bare minimum and call it done.  All the time and money is really in the patient safety aspects of the device.\n\nAs long as you don't kill people having them need to click some extra buttons to start their treatment or wait a little longer for treatments to complete is ok, because when you have kidney failure the choices are using the device or die while you wait for a kidney transplant.\n\nThis could just be the companies I have worked at and not what other companies do.  And the old idea that shitty companies won't make money and go out of business wasn't my experience.  These companies have been around since the early 80's and making money hand over first.\n\nAll of the devices were designed in a way to require constant payments from insurance companies through components that needed to be replaced periodically, if not after each treatment.  Oh and who makes these components with custom connections that only fit our devices?  Oh we do, so buy them from us!\n\nYes after 20 years or something like that when the patent experiences it is a free for everybody to use, but at that point the company has already released other medical devices, with new patents, and different special connections.  So it's just a constant cycle of making money.\n\nSo are these companies evil?  No, no directly.  Though I don't think they are making the best product they can for the end user either.",

        "body": "This is going to be a copy paste of a reply that I gave to a similar question. It’s my honest experience. No at least where I am, it’s not just a small companies thing. Here it goes:\n\nI can offer my perspective as a junior. Got a job a year before graduation.\n\nTLDR: It’s still possible to make it, but you need a degree *with* internships. If you want to guarantee yourself a job, it’s going to be *hard* work, unless you’re a genius. I’m not a genius. Caveat that I’m Canadian, the market might be better or worse where you are.\n\nMore details to give you an idea: \nI left my previous stem degree in 2022 when I realized that it wasn’t likely to yield a stable job. I started the CS degree in 2022. I’d programmed a bit before, always liked math and it seemed like a field with a bright future. I jumped in. \n\nThings turned sour for my cohort very quickly. By late 2022, many internships were rescinded, postings on universities’ coop programs dropped dramatically, the layoffs *started*. I was pretty dismayed by this to be honest, I’d left a degree that I loved in large part for improved job prospects and now there was a very real chance that it had been a poor decision. \n\nMy family and I are really not rich (lower middle class at best) so I didn’t have much a choice, I wasn’t sure what else I could do either so I decided to work *hard*. I got perfect grades, I worked on eyebrow raising side projects, I TAed a math heavy class (thanks to my previous background in my other degree), I prepped for interviews. Got my first internship in my first year of the CS degree. Had to move to a different city temporarily for it. I didn’t quite like the particular field that it was in but it was really important for my CV, I finished it and got a good review. Didn’t want to stay in the city I moved to, so I decided to find another internship. \n\nKept doing all of the above mentioned extracurriculars and still kept my grades very high. Meanwhile, things kept deteriorating for most of my cohort, the “best” students got internships, the majority did not. Keep in mind that I’m in coop so internships are *mandatory*.\n\nPrepped harder for interviews. Got a bigger company for the second one. If my first internship taught me anything it’s that if you want to be kept on after in this job market, you better be really good. I hit the ground running at this one, lost track of the hours I put into upskilling for it. I also took classes to not put off my graduation date. By the end of the 4 months, I was shipping year end deliverables. They were pretty happy and kept me on. Salary is about 80-90k TC. Quite good for a new grad in Canada. It’s been a huge relief and I’m immensely grateful for it.\n\nEnd all be all, success story in adverse job market conditions, but I want to be honest with you. I haven’t had a life for the past 2 and a half years or so. It’s literally all been school and working on side projects and interview prep and TAing. Now it’s working and still going to school. My relationship blew up and I haven’t been able to date because I just don’t have time, I don’t see my friends often. My own family that I live with doesn’t even talk to me often because I’m always in my room working one way or the other, they’re understanding and supportive though.\n\nI don’t want to complain at all because this is a thousand times preferable to being poor, but I want to highlight that this is what it takes to *guarantee* yourself a job now. You have to be the best of the best, whatever best means to the job market. Most of my cohort has not gotten internships and quite a few universities are working out deals with students: decreasing the number of internships, loosening the requirements of what classes to take when, actively involving themselves in our search. The situation has continued to devolve, at the entry level, things are not improving but actively getting worse.",

These are the \"experienced\" people looking for junior roles you read about (when I say experienced this means 90% of them make websites with react)\n\nI know plenty of juniors getting a job, but most of them are *good*.   \n  \nMid level I feel like is in a great spot as long as you aren't daydreaming about your salary - I know a lot of people saying they can't get mid level jobs requesting salaries that are simply unrealistic compared to the value they provide.\n\nBoth mid and senior are heavily dependent on their stack and location for the initial interview - after which obviously you have to actually pass the technical *AND* not be completely socially inept. \n\nAll this said, there's a *lot* of people wanting to get their foot in the door, so it's a bit of a mess",

Lacking focus in the sense that \"SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science\" are all \\*very\\* different types of roles. SWE alone is an enormously broad field, and employers want people who can progressively become subject matter experts in some narrow-ish complex area, not someone who's just superficially mehhh about everything.

Software took over the world \\*because\\* it integrates deeply with just about every industry you can think of, and all of the ones you can't. This ties back to the comment about broadness, there's a lot of software in a lot of places that you wouldn't think to look.

I’ve worked as an EE, SWE, ME, and optical designer. The common part of all of them is understanding how to solve problems and work with teams to solve incredibly complex ones. The only difference is the tools in your toolbox. Engineering majors do a much better job teaching this than CS.\n\n- you’re better prepared for data/noise analysis. P99 metrics, understanding distributions or finding a root cause for skew etc are all covered in EE, and I notice people with pure CS struggle with it\n\n- harder to self teach: my labs had $100k+ worth of equipment to learn on, whereas I was able to self teach software development using online resources. \n\nRE harder for AI to disrupt: I don’t agree with that as we’ve already seen LLMs used for spice simulation, verilog, etc. you can represent a schematic as text just like a program.",

        "body": "I started at a no name start up 10 years ago after dropping out of a PhD in bioinformatics, and am a Senior Eng at big tech today. My general approach, was to focus first on my own skills (the masters), then focus on the job skills (becoming tech lead), then finally optimize for hiring skills (LC + Systems Design + Behavioral). If you just focus on the interview skills, it's going to be difficult to really come across as an experienced engineer without the projects and wins on the job to back it up.\n\nHere's how I did it:  \n1. Take jobs at increasingly larger or better paying companies. You might not go \"small\" -> \"big tech\" in one jump, but push your limits and apply to scale-up companies with solid VC funding and lots of ex-big-tech employees.  \n2. Take every leadership opportunity you can, especially those unpaid \"tech lead\" or \"team lead\" spots. You're paycheck doesn't reflect the extra responsibility, but you're experience will be considerably better, and that should come across in interviews.  \n3. If you don't have a CS degree, go get your masters. This will accelerate how fast you grow as a junior/mid level engineer, and get you the technical profeciency to be a senior much faster. Plus, for a self-taught guy like me, it removes any sort of education difference.  \n4. Continue learning. Read books, work on projects, do whatever, just keep learning.",

Internal referrals, recruiters on LinkedIn, and timing your applications around hiring cycles matter more than having a flashy first role.

Being full stack is ideal and will allow you to maximize opportunities. Two best languages to learn for backend development are still java or c#, but you’d likely need some professional experience using them for it to be worth putting on a resume. I’m not sure what “full stack direction” means, but it seems like you’re primarily a frontend dev, which typically doesn’t pay as well. The vast majority of companies will not be using a JS framework for a backend because the language is not robust enough for large scale backend development. It’d be really valuable to learn a statically typed backend language like java and c# along with some SQL. Companies really want those kind of things",

The way my last employer pushed AI tools was exhausting and I suspect my lack of use was a reason I didn't make the cut. It's hard not to see the long-term future as bleak. LLMs are a constant advancing threat to our jobs, and if that's not what ends up taking my next one, it'll just end up in India. If I do somehow find security, it will be in a job that I don't find nearly as fun anymore in a post-LLM world. And this isn't even getting into the headache that they have introduced into the job hunting process itself. I can't decide which future feels scarier, the one where the AI data center bubble pops or the one where it doesn't. I know LLMs aren't the silver bullet they're being marketed as but I don't think that matters much until the bloodythirsty C-suite ghouls stop drinking the kool-aid. To me it feels like the better outcome is for the bubble to pop but that could mean half a decade of a job market that will make 2025 feel like 2021. It all has me giving serious thought to a complete career pivot into a field with a stronger human element that provides better protection from LLMs.\n\nIn summary, yeah, this environment is completely overwhelming",

Either you know what the impact is, or you don't. It is ok to ballpark and \"saved X dev hours\" is a type of claim I've seen many times.\n\nFor some things, we call them \"zero-to-one\" initiatives, where the impact of completion/rollout of the feature is self-explanatory (e.g. \"there was no two factor auth, now there is\")\n\nThe real catch is that metrics solely for STAR format's sake won't necessarily look good, and it's a backwards way of thinking about things. E.g. \"saved dev hours\" sure, but to what end? Do they actually deliver more features or does the time end up being spent on other ancillary tasks w/ same overall velocity anyways?\n\nMetrics are supposed to provide finality to an overarching story that has actual metrics, so that the narrative sounds coherent rather than an aimless rambling. Just tacking on whatever metric to the end of a project doesn't necessarily make for a compelling STAR format story, just like adding sprinkles to the top of a poop cake doesn't make it a nice cake.",

They ballpark a number based on what they know and slap it in there expecting nobody to dig in too far.\n\nI think having actual real metrics comes easier working at some companies vs others.  If you are at a company where the SW team comes up with their own work then part of that is justifying why it's important to do.  More times than not metrics are likely to fall out of that.  \n\nAll of my 15 YOE has been at R&D companies working on greenfield medical device projects, think dialysis machines.  It was very top down management style where you do as you are told at the product level. SWEs have control of code level design, but not really the direction of the product\n\nSo asking me to justify why did I implement X major feature over 1 year is on the level of asking why did you put as gas and break pedal in a car or why is there an infotainment system in the car.  It's there because it's expected to be there if you want people to use your product.\n\nSo asking me to put in metrics on my resume is pretty hard since we are implementing things on the project for the first tome and not iterating and improving something.  Why did we need some feature comes down to the product owner saying this is what is needed based on conversations with X/Y/Z important person at the end of the day.\n\nThere is obviously all shades of grey between the two extremes I gave as examples.  Frankly I have no actual metrics on my resume.  My bullets are along the lines of:  I accomplished \\[X\\], that provides \\[Y\\] value, by doing \\[Z\\].  It works ok enough to get some visibility, but I don't have companies banging down my door to get me to interview or anything like that.",

Please invest the time to do this properly before you become desperate and show up at the last minute hoping strangers will solve this problem for you.

Usually it's called \"real time programming\" or High performance computing (HPC). It involves supercomputer or regular computer to solves problem or process immense amount of data. Or it could be low latency code. Anything that is not web based usually will be subject to a tighter ressources allocation and thus performance being more important. Think of something mass produced, throwing 50$ more for better ram because you produced shit code and the price of the product is around 50$... It's just not acceptable.\n\n\nA real life example:\nSicentific computing is usually very computing heavy for things like simulations or lots of dimensional processing (think RGBs processing but on 280++ channels instead of just 3). These sometimes have tight performance requirements such as processing before another data package is generated. \n\n\nMy job is essentially that. I take bleeding edge reasearch code in python made by physicist and optimize the shit out of it so it takes little to no time to process. Initially the processing time was 18h ++ per dataset and now it's down to sub 2h making it so that we process faster than we acquire. This means it's processed in real time and you can have the results immediately which is neat for aviation decision, threat detection and all stuff highly critical.\n\n\nUsually it will require you to work with people of other domain which is very fun I think. You become good at physics, geospatial and other math heavy domain which makes leetcode feels even more stupid (because the time/space complexity is not all you look for in performance computing and usually one of the easiest thing to optimize). \n\n\nOverall, it's a very rewarding field as you may be recruted for satellites, geospatial, lots of physics project that are bleeding edge, quantum computing, etc. ",

And why are there \"common\" urgent issues?\n\n>there is little to no documentation for some of the most critical implementations\n\nHave you written any documentation yourself? Perhaps...documenting what happens in these four hour meetings, for people to reference later?\n\n>we often have to rely on someone else to jump in and provide guidance\n\nWhy is this knowledge siloed? Why are people not learning from one \"urgent issue\" to the next?\n\nTo beat on the \"there's no documentation\" drum a little longer, I'll distill my response down to this: are you doing anything to address this lack of documentation, or just complaining about it? Because if you've identified a weak spot in the team/organization and you're not working to address it, you're contributing to a toxic element yourself.",

I know how to do this in theory, but I've never done it in practice.\n\nWhat I'm doing is building a production ready app in my spare time. Not a random to-do list, or CRUD dashboard, but something more complex that might showcase that I can actually build a whole system from scratch. While getting users would be ideal for revenue and to showcase scalability, I think the important part is that you can show and explain the whole app and code to prospective employers, and the experience you had building it.",

You should relax!\").  **If you're ambitious, never listen to anyone who tells you to relax.**  Take that as their own personality or goals being incongruent with yours and shed their advice like dust off your shoulder.\n\n\\- Then took a few grad school IT (\"MIS\") and Statistics courses\n\n\\- Moved to SF Bay.  The combo of Digital Marketing, SQL & R / Statistics knowledge from grad school classes helped me land a data integration job in a marketing company\n\n\\- Was tough to break into 100% Software Engineering w/o some real programming projects and a portfolio, so I created a prototype full stack app.  **(I lived in a tent** while working at cafes/libraries; **on a rural ranch** while doing **landscaping part time for rent**; and **later, in mexico after camping on a California beach became too tough** due to people waking me up for trespassing)-- my Dad's advice of \"How much do you want it?\" echoing in my mind when I'd need to encourage myself.  As well as motivational music, and motivational speeches, regularly playing in my headphones while building the app for about 6 months-- 2-3 months of that involved just learning, 3-4 months was knowledgeably building or trial/error building)\n\n\\- Two weeks later, landed remote job doing full stack clojure (programming language)\n\n\\- 2 months later, hired as a digital marketing / data engineering consultant\n\nAfter that last job, it was all down hill-- had recruiters regularly contacting me.  Applied to jobs and landed interviews decently easily.  Worked a variety of contract & salaried full stack jobs.  Even got into a DevOps job by continuing to learn new skills at work and in free time.\n\nThen the industry took a big shit in 2022-2023 due to a confluence of: AI, H1B, Tax law changes, Covid money running out.\n\nI got laid off.

Web dev was miserable back then by these standards. \n\n\nI got started with C++ in 2006, C++11 completely changed the game. Smart pointers alone overnight solved an entire category of headache. CMake is so much better and vcpkg is a thing now. IDEs (especially Visual Studio) kick ass nowadays. C++20 concepts make SFINAE a distant hazy nightmare which is amazing.\n\n\nI'd argue containerization and CI/CD tooling revolutionized tech even more than AI has up to this point (remains to be seen if that will stay true long though). Early career we had entire teams of ops folk doing full time work that more or less takes a single engineer a half day every now and then.\n\n\nIt's a fun trip down memory lane. 2006 was a way different time.",

But at the same time, it’s a clear incremental improvement over classic Vim from 20 years ago.\n\nModern debuggers are similarly old. I was showing a class of CS majors who hadn’t seen one how to use ‘em back when I was in school. I am consistently shocked by how many very experienced devs have never once used a debugger. \n\nI mean, even IntelliJ predates me by a bit. Of course, it wasn’t the hands-down best Java IDE for a bit, but now I wouldn’t work without it. \n\nVSCode is maybe the single most overrated thing in our space today. Yes, I have used it. No, I don’t like it very much. There are better text editors out there that don’t consume gobs of memory. \n\nThat said, I do wish that `jq` had been around to be included in any version of the Single Unix Specification.\n\nETA: I just realized that Git came out after I started.

If you think about it, it’s actually amazing that all this stuff works almost all the time without issues and 99% of customers don’t ever encounter the issues.\n\nIf you’re on the outside, software is simple. It’s a text box, everyone has a text box. It’s a button, everyone has a button. It just works, most stuff just works. Then our industries most popular “influencers” are all the “I showed up to work at 10a, had breakfast, worked an hour, had lunch, moved a button, went home it’s 12:30p” crowd. They were also told we were going to convert 65 year old coal miners into coders in 3 months.\n\nSo when external people think about software they think this is easy. If you think this is easy, why wouldn’t AI be able to take our jobs? AI passes the sniff test and looks like it’s doing the real thing, especially when you don’t know how to do the real thing.",

It sounds to me like you are thinking in terms of android apps that are front-ends (effectively, websites). Thus, your logical conclusion is that to gain 'more depth' and employability, you should develop expertise in all parts of the application (i.e., backend).\n\nI want to challenge that point of view, and emphasize a few job-niches where smartphone apps really leverage the local computing power of a Snapdragon-level processor. In these cases, the app is not only a *part* of the project, it is *integral*. The android expertise you have is incredibly valuable for this use case.\n\nTake [ATAK-Civ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ) for example. It is a micro-ecosystem of apps and plugins that are used as tools for first-responding and security. Companies develop ATAK plugins using standard android tools, to do things like build software controllers for drones within ATAK, or stream health data from smartwatches of field operatives.\n\nAlternatively, Android (the operating system) is used by some companies for their own non-smartphone products. I recently interviewed with a company that builds treadmills. The treadmills use stock android for their OS and applications to serve standard functionality to their users and control hardware.\n\nThese are small companies, sure. There are hurdles to finding these, especially since you're not in the US. You will have to do research to find such companies. And they may pay less than a large company like the one you're at, because the scale of the revenue they generate is going to be intrinsically smaller (the other side of that coin is that the revenue is shared with fewer individuals, so you may actually get paid pretty well anyway). But they are working on *cool shit,* and they want experts in the tools to help them do so.\n\nSource: I am one of those guys working on cool shit",

For one, very surprised to not see Chip Huyen's Designing ML systems book on the preparation side. I would strongly recommend that as a must-read. It focuses on the entire ML development lifecycle. I also think a lot of people overlook the fundamentals of stats, linear algebra, etc. These are especially important for measuring model performance. It's great if you can talk about system design, but I always expect candidates to be able to talk about if a model makes sense for a use case in the design round before we get into whiteboarding.\n\nAlso, outside of MAANG I actually see a lot more system design and knowledge questions than actually coding questions outside of maybe a leetcode easy for basic competency, so depending on the role you are targeting I would de-prioritize coding in favor of system design and model fundamentals. \n\nBest of luck finding and landing an MLE role",

The company had fortnightly 1 on 1 with me and my team leader so I could have regular private conversations and ask about my performance. \n\nFor “stepping up” for that getting ahead in your own time management is good, if I was running short on work and would have nothing to do soon, I would shoot an email to my team leader giving him an update on my progress, that I should be finished soon and ask if there’s anything specific that he wants me to work on next. \n\nAnother good thing to do is shared knowledge. This isn’t something everyone can do in the first year. In my job we recently started trying out a new tool to help speed up debugging part of the software we use, because I had less work I had more time to allocate to learning the specifics and how to set up quickly and link it up. Because of this when senior team members had the time to sit down and go over it, I was able to “train” them on the new tool and pass on everything I learned to speed up their onboarding on the tool. \n\nJust because a team member is senior to you does not mean you can’t help them. Also they won’t know everything. If a senior is asking questions about what will and won’t work, sometimes it’s good to jump in and ask/offer to test the question for them. “I don’t know but I can try and find out for you” has been a great response to many situations at my job.",

That only matters if you're talking to an actual engineer, or engineering manager, who knows the difference between \"wrote HelloWorld in Rust\" and \"on the Rust board of directors\". Most HRBPs/recruiters don't know the difference, and speak \"years of accredited education\" and \"years of professional experience\" exclusively, and those are the people deciding whether your application/resume ever lands in the inbox of a manager with an open [req](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453).\n\nBe sure to emphasize the internship and accredited education in your resume first and foremost. The portfolio, or interesting GitHub personal projects, can and should be a footnote below things recruiters/HRBPs are specifically looking for. I'll also add that tinkering alone, by yourself, on a project is not nearly as useful as collaborating with a team on a project. Because in the real world, most engineers work as a part of a team or teams to get stuff done. Consider contributing to well-known open source projects. Understand that step 0 of contributing meaningfully to most open source projects is: You understand what the project is, and who its end users are, on a deep level. That can take anywhere from days/weeks/years depending on the complexity of the project. And \"I was part of SIG release for Kuberenetes 1.31\" is easier for a recruiter/HRBP to grok than \"look at this chatbot I made, isn't it neat\". It's especially easier to grok if that recruiter/HRBP is staring at a req with the word \"Kubernetes\" in 5 different places.\n\nFor extra emphasis; Fix your resume first before you spend time chasing shiny open source projects. Also, the job market just extra sucks right now -- sorry about that. Not much to be done about organizations shy around adding headcount.",

So on the face of it, I do not think the PhD granting department being math vs CS is a big deal.\n\nHowever, yeah, some of your red flags are red flags. The repayment thing is brutal, attrition in PhD programs is very high and you don't want that hanging over your head. Why isn't it funded with TA or RA positions like a typical STEM PhD? You don't have to pay back your tuition waiver from those. Internships not being allowed is horrible if you're pursuing an industry role.\n\nRegarding your potential PI being new, do they have tenure yet? The last thing you need is your advisor going up for tenure and not getting it, and at least if you're in the US, that's a very real risk these days. I have a few friends from grad school who went the academic route and will be up for tenure soon, and despite playing their cards well, they're all very worried about this.\n\nSo math vs CS, no real worries, but imo you are right to have reservations.",

Internships, connections, and ML conference papers are how people get jobs at those labs. Without putting in extra work, and potentially a lot of extra work, you won't have any of those three. \n\nPersonally, I'd do it only if I were at peace with the full range of potential post-PhD outcomes. That includes not just the best case where you end up at an industry lab, but also worse cases including rejoining industry at basically the same level you are now (albeit with a PhD, or after mastering out) or being a postdoc. \n\nIf what you'd work on during your PhD isn't so compelling to you to the extent that it doesn't matter where you end up after you're done, I wouldn't do it. I did my PhD at Stanford and I saw so many bright and talented people strike out on the industry research job market only to settle for \"worse\" jobs, including as data scientists or postdocs. \n\nThat said, you don't have to view the next application cycle as your last chance, as I've seen many people start a PhD in their 30s or 40s or even later. But it is hard to justify applying again if you're not bringing something new to the table in your new application.",

I guess the main problem is the claim the it's even ready to be integrated, if it's not actually tested thoroughly. It's fine that it's not tested thoroughly, but that means that the next step is to test it, not make other things depend on it and then wonder why the combination isn't working. And, frankly, some well-intentioned, code that \"looks\" like it will work isn't a very useful starting point for anyone, in many ways it would be easier to start with a blank sheet than a pile of half-working code without the tests to figure out which half works\n\nThen you just build in the testing part to your estimates, assuming that anything he gives you hasn't been \"thoroughly\" tested.\n\n>I can assure you there are many, many ways to track versioning. I have no magical abilities/access to secret information in that regard, I just look at the ticket, look at the PR, look at what version is running, copy & paste the line from last week's status email, look at the history in source control, etc... basically, there are a plethora of ways to do it, but his way is... to ask me, every time :(\n\nSeems like it can be short circuited with some automation. In our organization, once a commit becomes part of a new build, a comment on the ticket is generated with that new version. So you just have to look at the version that is running compared to what is in the ticket.",

You should probably ask yourself how do you actually learn skills.\n\nFor most people, some combination of spaced repetition and recalling things from memory is usually how they retain information. So, transposing to coding, you may need to build the \"muscle memory\" in layers, e.g. first memorize syntax, then memorize specific API signatures, then eventually memorize semantics of the APIs.\n\nSyntax can be learned by just coding a lot and running the code to validate that the syntax is correct. API signatures can be memorized via exercises called Katas (basically do the same thing from memory multiple times) or just using them frequently enough. Semantics start to become easier to memorize once the \"lower\" layers become more second nature.",

Since I'm a student and see many internships that actually list work experience as preferred I thought it would be a good way to break into a company where I can be more of an engineer rather than just someone tinkering with a couple of strings in the backend.",

I have my own projects on the side but I did not have to deal with problems of scale, availability or other aspects of enterprise development that a mid-level would need to be able to handle. \n\nI've seen a few internships that are specifically only for undergraduates but largely they've been open to both undergrad and grad students, which I am, and prefer prior project/work experience, which I have. A transition out of this role into a different one where there is less red tape and more hands on dev work seems more plausible the internship route, where the expectation of delivery is less.",

Btw, front-end devs dont do UI/UX design. Someone else does that and the FE devs just implement the design given to them.\n\nOnce you feel comfortable using whatever language and library you choose, the next steps are to at least have some basic level of understanding of containerization (docker and kubernetes), cloud engineering (AWS or Azure usually), and CI/CD pipelines (github actions). If you can build a full front-end app, containerize it with docker, and deploy the kubernetes pod to a azure/aws instance using github actions, you should be a really really strong candidate in your interviews.

        "body": "From what I have observed there three kinds of CS students:\n\n1. Most students arrive knowing little to nothing about programming. Maybe they've heard of Python or seen some code, but they've never written a program. This is the *normal* baseline, and intro CS courses are designed for exactly these students.\n2. Some come in with casual exposure. They have built a small website in HTML, played with Scratch, or took a high school programming elective. This gives them maybe a slight head start in the first few weeks, but it evens out quickly.\n3. A small percentage are already hobbyist programmers who've been coding for years. Yes, they exist, but they're the minority. And here's the thing: their presence doesn't hurt you. You aren't competing against them, and professors design coursework knowing students have varied backgrounds.\n\nThe people who struggle in CS usually aren't the ones who came in with zero knowledge...they're the ones who discovered they don't actually enjoy problem-solving, debugging, or the iterative nature of programming. And that's totally valid! Some people switch to Business, Data Science, Engineering, Finance, etc. So just because you begin knowing nothing (which is expected, you are there to *learn* after all), does NOT mean you are guaranteed to fail.\n\n**My advice:** Don't ask \"will I be behind?\" or \"should I be scared?\" But rather ask \"do I enjoy figuring out how things work?\" and \"am I curious about building things with code?\" If yes, you belong there just as much as anyone.\n\nHere's a secret advantage (well, not really secret): CS is one of the few fields where you can preview it before committing. Spend a few weeks with free resources (CS50, Python tutorials, codecademy, etc) and see if it clicks. Build a small todo list in Python or a small static website. If you enjoy it, great! If not, you've learned something valuable before investing years.\n\nGood Luck :)",

Stopping the worry really helped me find my joy again. I only code a couple projects per year and don’t stress if I don’t have something I actually want to work on. \n\nThe job market sucks, but you’re only a freshman. If you don’t land an internship this summer, there’s so many other jobs that would be more fun than an internship. I was a rafting guide between my junior and senior year of college, and I wouldn’t trade that for a software engineer position instead of my salesforce admin role. I still wish I was a software engineer, but you can’t always force your will on the world. \n\nHope this helps and try to stay positive.",

        "body": "Are you doing well in your classes? That's one data point for your progress. You're in a very strange time for the field. The job market is ass (the bad kind), and AI has made the industry very skewed. I worked at digital agencies for a long time. We had some very big name clients, but the type of work was more marketing skewed than tech skewed. The company got a new CEO after being acquired, and it started doing horribly, so a lot of people left for other companies. A few of those executives used to be very vocal about AI on LinkedIn. It was interesting because that company almost completely missed out on cloud. They've started getting quieter about AI. But non-technical people at other companies I spent time at left to form their own small AI-focused companies. I've also been seeing a lot of non-technical types get promoted to head of AI positions. I think all of us just need to get through this period of time where everyone thinks AI will need to be in every bit of our lives. A few years ago, I heard a show on the radio mention this had echoes of the dotcom boom and bust. Back then, everyone was adding \".com\" to their names, and their valuations would skyrocket. Similarly, everyone is in AI or has an AI product. It makes sense that the mindset has trickled down into schools. Either the bubble will eventually burst, or it will go full steam ahead, but I'm in the camp that it will burst eventually. There will be cases AI is useful, but people will become somewhat critical again.\n\nMaybe all you need is a bit of a break or spend some time working on a passion project. Someone else said that you're probably pretty early to be looking for internships. Although there's nothing wrong with that, there's no reason to beat yourself up. Internships are harder because there are fewer of them.\n\nAlso, take all advice (including mine) with a grain of salt. A lot of people have lost perspective. I saw a YouTube video last night of someone who had been laid off for the first time in their career, and a lot of the stuff in their video are things I disagreed with. They spent time lamenting all the time they spent working rather than with family, as if this is the only career that can happen. People sometimes tend to be self-centered and project... like maybe I'm doing right now.\n\nAnyway, don't be so hard on yourself. Something else to consider is that taking a short break may give you some perspective or inspiration. So many people are obsessed working for high-end big tech companies. Of course the money is amazing, but you can make a very successful life for yourself working at smaller companies. You may also be making more impact and building stronger relationships. \"May\" being the operative word. \n\nCircling back to you OP, I thought you were going to say you were doing poorly in your classes. At some schools, intro level classes are meant to weed people out. It makes some sense to be discouraged these days. People are focusing on very impersonal projects, and there's a lot of parroting happening. Don't let that discourage you too much. It's just noise.",
