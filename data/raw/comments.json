Often I would concede to a different design, and after some time the team would arrive at what dimensional modelling advises. E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said \"well Kimball advises against this because its trouble\" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.\n\nIt is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data. Now we have the cloud and storage is less limited. Our mental capacity still is limited, so it is easier to reason about facts and dimensions in separation, rather than a 100-column big table.\n\n...and what about many to many?",

Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.\n\nI would probably add some testing too.\n\n---\n\n# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist\n\n## 1. Requirements First\n- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed\n- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?\n- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?\n\n## 2. Architecture\n\n**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.\n\n**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.\n\n**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.\n\n## 3. Reliability\n\n**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.\n\n**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid \"cron spaghetti.\"\n\n\n## 4. Observability\n\n**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:\n- Row counts/volume checks\n- Freshness checks\n- Schema drift alerts\n- Job duration tracking\n\n\n## 5. Performance\n\n**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.\n\n**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.\n\n\n## 6. Simplicity Rule\n\n**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks\n\n**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.**\n\n**Use distributed systems when**:\n\n- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)\n- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)\n- Complex streaming aggregations\n- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",

The \"streaming only when it pays rent\" line is perfect.\n\nMy guardrails are similar:\n\n**When I don't need Kafka/streaming:**\n\n* Data freshness SLA is > 5 minutes\n* No multiple consumers needing to replay the same events\n* Backfills are the common case, not real-time reactions\n\n**When I actually reach for it:**\n\n* Multiple independent systems need to react to the same event\n* I need replay (reprocess from a specific point in time)\n* Upstream is bursty and I need to buffer/decouple from the DB\n\nEven then, Kafka is usually overkill. Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.\n\nOn the storage side - totally agree on \"one source of truth, columnar, object storage.\" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend. No distributed cluster to babysit, SQL interface, handles GB-to-TB scale without the Spark tax.\n\nThe line I use: if I can run the query on a single node in acceptable time, I don't need a distributed system.

For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. \n\nBut that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait.

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof. Then go build your application to that architecture. Things will fall into place, and you’ll have a documented trail of why you made decisions. And for streaming itself, just use Spark structured streaming. And if you need to do a backfill have a classic Spark job set up for it. But put these things into a design doc before you even write one line of code, and you can review that design doc with your leadership or other engineers",

Often the MVP is the P, and you’ll have to live with whatever architecture was originally built. \n\nSpreadsheet for a POC? Maybe… but MVP? Often a bad idea. \n\nFor a website just displaying some data… probably a fine solution I grant you. But for anything more complex, no. How are you handling pushing the data? Do you have a Dev/PPE/Prod spreadsheet? Do you run tests to validate the data before it gets pushed live? How are you managing the schema of the spreadsheet against your application layer? What if you need to roll back? \n\nIf your client can’t handle using git or some other workflow to update the data, I’d want some substantial guard rails in place if I am letting them edit production data. At least some type of defined deployment flow with validation and integration testing. \n\nA cloud hosted DB has pretty minimal costs. Databases have tons of advantages, but the one of the most important is they are robust and conform to a design standard with means that the next guy who comes along wont be stuck unpicking a bespoke spreadsheet solution.\n\nAlso, DBs are not the only solution.

One place emails us a spreadsheet and so we wrote an airflow dag that checks the box, grabs the attachment and copies the data into big query. \nSome of the execs put their stuff in sheets and have information that goes out to our decisioning systems so we grab data from there too. It's so much better than something like monday.com. \nThey use an interface they know, we don't have to write a new interface, and as long as they don't change the fields we've agreed on everything works fine.\n\nIn the example you posted I wouldn't use sheets as the final DB, but it works fine until you get the funding or whatever and move to something else.",

How is it not for so many people?  What the hell do your employers demand of you?  If I do \"overtime\" (lol fool me, I'm on a salary, but I can swing it as take a few hours off another day) it's because I have some weird compulsion to do so: something playing on my mind, something I want to progress or finish off; or some training/learning/research.

Or the goal.  Basically help the owners/shareholders/whatevers make more money?  Cool, man... very fulfilling.\n\n\n\nOP, are you more entrepreneurial , do you want to work for yourself more than some company?  I don't have first-hand context of that, but I can't imagine it would be easy, or even highly compensating - at first, at least.  It's not me, but if that's you, more power to you!\n\n\n\nIs it the DE angle you've lost interest in specifically?  And because the lag in landing a job, your interest simply waned?  What is it you actually enjoy?  Creating, problem solving, fixing or improving something? If you don't go out to work for yourself right away, is it realistic to keep looking for something else that fits better?\n\n\n\nEdit:  Unless there's some radical shift in society and economy, we work because we need the money.

The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:\n\n- \"this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it\"\n- \"this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find\"\n- \"this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching\"\n- \"we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.\"\n\nBut let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.\n\nAre you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?\n\nWhat will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.\n\nRemember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you. If that happens it's very good news for analytics engineering, but _terrible_ news for you as a founder. Typical outcome: nothing happens. The incumbent has no motivation to improve, and would-be founders have no ability to realise the gains for themselves, so do nothing to change this.",

        "body": "I'm doing a similar role, although at a very small firm - similarly no data culture to speak of, messy and fragmented processes and systems etc. I wouldn't have chosen it necessarily but some life circumstances have led me to it as a necessity at least in the short term. I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.\n\nThe major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. \n\nOn the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.\n\nIf neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:\n1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering\n2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering\n3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst\n4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist\n6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, product\n\nI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. \n\nThis can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.\n\nSo my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.\n\nYou mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.\n\nYour tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a  good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",

I'd say that's true of pretty much any role that's not the 'prototypical' FAANG data engineering role. It sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job given the situation. \n\n> Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\n\nThis is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.\n\nObviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. \n\nAll of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum. Most people are going to end up de facto specialists in little sub niches over the course of a career, even if they are relative generalists in data tech.",

It's going to be better than just having Postgres, but it's still limiting. It doesn't really make it a \"warehouse\".\n\nOn adoption, if you take just this sub, you'd think everyone in the world is using duckdb.

In fact there's very few features in say snowflake that you can't find in the general purpose databases.\n\nA few considerations:\n\n   * It all depends on your total data volume, the data volume your queries will be scanning, the number of queries, etc, etc, etc.\n   * But a 10-20 TB data warehouse using Postgres can work absolutely fine.\n   * Partitioning is critical\n   * Summary/aggregate tables may be critical if you want really fast queries for dashboards, etc.  I like to monitor my use of these like one would monitor buffer space / caches for transactional databases - and try to get 95+% of my queries to hit them.\n   * Certain queries will benefit from the use of indexes.  This can provide a significant edge to performance.\n   * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume.\n   * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here!  You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables.\n   * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers.  But you may need to have postgres dba skills.\n   * All the above assumes vanilla postgres.  Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.\n\nFYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money.  IIRC it was about $20k/month saved AND my queries were much faster.  So, while I would not propose that a single node Postgres instance will always outperform a distributed database, there are absolutely scenarios in which it will.",

Good code paired with good engineers that understand the code and know how to locate issues, fix them, support customers and add features on what they have without disturbing what they did before is not.\n\nI've seen lots of junior engineers using AI tools as fit for all tools which result in many of them being clueless of what's going on. That's a tremendous risk for a company. When something goes wrong things goes wrong in a big way. Tools have no accountability or responsibility but engineers do. Tip for engineers out there: AI tools are a game changer but NEVER deploy code you don't understand.\n\n> Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthless\n\nMaybe if you miss what's the purpose of unit tests. I see lots of engineers using unit tests to give them coverage or just as a way to look responsible but mostly the tests are so tied to the components that are not testing anything specific. If there are edge cases on potencial user inputs that should be tested to guarantee that no one removes the actual piece of code that does the validation or fallback on the inputs. So I would say: bad tests are detrimental, good tests are amazing guard rails.\n\n> Dependencies has to be explicit\n\nSounds like a no-brainer but it's actually hard to enforce that because many teams/engineers lack the discipline to do so and only value that once the s* hits the fan (somehow similar to skipping the tests)\n\n> nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for review\n\nBad engineering culture drives that. Mostly people are valued by the litres of code they add or the features they add (even if unbaked). Code reviews are good for aligning, learning and guaranteeing some standards. Running pipelines costs time and money so it's not the case they are free. So maybe code reviews investment might be something people should lean on.\n\n> REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineers\n\nNot that linear. You need good leadership that knows what's implemented, running and what your customers want. You need to make sure that everyone understand what's going on and why the things are the way they are, that's essential part of leadership. When it comes to ambiguity and a decision needs to be made you need someone that is a good leader and has a strong sponsor (CTO, VP, Director...).\n\nIf there is no leadership, sense of direction and accountability/responsibility is something exoteric even the best engineer will not be able to do the change and in that case maybe the 5 cheaper engineers might ship out more (despite risking shipping the wrong things at the wrong time with arguable quality).\n\nSo, in other words, your 5 cheap engineers are not an alternative to the \"good\" engineer but rather a combination of both.",

I am fairly new as well (been reading/learning for what seems like years, but work doesn’t want to go down this route).\n\nBasically, the idea is you bring each referenced source table in to the model you’re working on as their own cte.  By doing this pattern you have a clear reference to every parent model you are using at the top of your model.\n\nYou then perform the transformation steps, including the joining of those referenced tables as the next cte (or several ctes depending on complexity).\n\nThen you read directly out of your last cte - preferably with little transformation in the final step.\n\nAll of this is to make things as readable and organised as possible.\n\nIf you were to start transforming each source in the initial cte, you wouldnt be reading a simple, single line bringing it in to the current model, but reading more complex transformations that you would need to spend more time figuring out what that piece was doing and where it began and ended.\n\nEdit to add: this way you can tell at a glance at the top of your model all the referenced sources.  Each of them as a single line cte with no complexity thrown in.  After you have brought in each source as its own cte, then you start a new one with a name indicating the source and transformation step, etc.\n\nBy bringing in your sources, transforming each, joining, performing joined transformations, aggregating, etc, each in a little code block cte, you are mimicking how programmers would use methods in code to logically break code into chunks.\n\nIf you also read up about layering data models (medallion architecture), you’ll see how dbt likes to break it down further into separate models.  This allows you to perform the simple single-model transformations, such as renaming, casting, etc at a ”silver” stage, and more complex transformations such as joining or calculating the values in two tables, aggregating, etc in a later, “gold” model.  This takes the organising and simplifying of models from within a single model/step, to a process.\n\n——-\n\n   /*\n      Model header and configuration \n    */\n\n    // bring in referenced models and sources\n\n    WITH orders AS \n    (\n         SELECT * FROM source_orders \n    ),\n    customers AS\n    (\n        SELECT * FROM source_customers\n    )\n\n    // transform table\n\n    transform_orders AS \n    (\n        SELECT \n            col1 AS col1_rename,\n            col2 AS cast(col2 AS string),\n            .....\n        FROM src_orders\n    ),\n    transform_customers AS\n    (\n        SELECT customer_id\n                      ,UPPER(customer_name) AS customer_name\n        FROM src_customers\n    ),\n\n    cust_orders AS\n    (\n        SELECT *\n         FROM. transform_customers AS c\n             LEFT JOIN transform_orders AS o\n                 ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n\n    )\n\n    // select result\n    SELECT * FROM cust_orders",

As a Data Engineering manager, I value somebody with direct experience as a data engineer over a consultant who sets it up, and doesn’t have to deal with the ramifications of when it breaks.  Your ability to be a good junior engineer isn’t pinned on a specific technology, so I wouldn’t worry too much about that.  A company focused on Snowflake today could switch to Fabric or Databricks tomorrow. Now as you get more senior, you’re going to want to specialize in something which does narrow your focus but it’s way too early to worry about that now.  \n\nSo net/net…I would go with your internal role and learn everything you can.  Focus on your skills being transferable and you will open quite a few doors in a couple years.",

Now I would consider myself one, even if a modest one.\n\nMy opinion is none of the tech stuff matters for this question. Do what is going to be best for your quality of life. There are plenty of rich learning opportunities with Fabric. Yes, it has paper cuts. Yes, sometimes picking the right tool feels like deciding whether to eat your meal with a grapefruit spoon, a butter knife, or a plastic spork. But I am learning and growing, no regrets at all in that regard. I'm writing PySpark every week (with lots of help from ChatGPT Plus 😅) and learning more about delta tables than I ever wanted to.\n\nAnd if I wasn't a massive, massive Microsoft shill, I'm confident that after this project is done I could hard pivot my career to Databricks if I wanted to. Snowflake slightly less so. So, I can't give you a neutral opinion, but I'm happy to answer any questions.",

What is real DE? Fabric is as popular as a fart in a spacesuit in this sub, but it is data engineering. The technologies you mention, Python, SQL, pipelines etc are all transferable to other \"real\" platforms. There are a lot of opportunities just now with people migrating from Power BI and Synapse to Fabric, so it could also be a good career move financially.\n\nAnd with AI, the ability to write pipelines and code in Databricks or Fabric (or anything else) isn't going to matter so much. I'd concentrate on really getting to understand your data and building relationships with your user base, translating requirements into actual deliverables. That's what's going to add value to your career rather than being able to use tool X, Y or Z.\n\nEdit: typos",

It is a no code solution for data manipulation more than anything. It doesnt really provide more utility than excel or just raw python scripting will. It will leave your stakeholders dependent on an expensive per seat solution. And it is really not hardened for production etl.\n\nAll I am here to say is it is not worth committing to the sales pitch let alone actual adoption of the product.\n\nOne simple thing to do is excel, power query, and python in excel. You can do (limited) python in excel cells now. So if you can get data to a point that power query can consume it into a workbook, you can process it in excel and generate your output as a new sheet. It is something I have done as the endpoint when a stakeholder absolutely had to have data refresh ready in excel. I find this the best approach to produce. Power query can easily attach to most common data sources, I created a rest api to serve flattened pre processed data specifically for consumption by one of these as an example, but you can do local csv,website/api, SharePoint, s3, various dbs, Salesforce as examples. Once that data is loaded you can reference the sheet in your python cell, do transformations, and output a df as a table to fill your consumption layer sheet. On data refresh it will rerun your python.",

The exact DQ checks you need to implement depends on your use case, but the ones that you’re listed - will be already a huge step forward if you have none now. For the love of God don’t event try to build your own DQ framework, so many teams make this mistake. Instead use some of the already available open-source solutions, some of them are very very good. \n\nTesting is also very important part of pipelines, which are unfortunately neglected by most of the DE teams. It will make sure that your commit editing “pipeline A”, won’t alter the logic of “pipeline B”. \nEnd-to-end Testing is the best thing you can do for your Data Architecture. Create a small sample input dataset, dozen of rows usually is enough. Create expected output dataset. Run pipeline on using sample input as source and compare your actual output with expected output. Do it on every merge to main branch. Very simple, straightforward but gives you a lot of confidence in you data pipelines. It requires some simple CI/CD pipeline and probably separate env to run the tests but data quality always comes with a price, like all good things in this life :)",

We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first..  the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. \n2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.\n3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path. \n\nIf you tried doing this in prod: how are you handling this tradeoff? Do you allow wide read access and rely on RLS/RBAC + logging, or do you gate it behind a semantic model / query planner / allowlists?",

What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers. It's still in the data warehouse environment but the agents can only access those curated views. What I found with this though was that I couldn't answer questions on the level of what you are describing very well, which is why I think if it's ever gonna work a much more flexible approach is needed.",

Now that all Snowpipe/Snowpipe streaming is a fixed price (0.0037 Credits per GB), it should be easier to see what your costs will be regardless of the number of files. Generally Snowpipe will be cheaper, but your time is worth something too. As you mention, Snowpipe can support schema evolution with ENABLE\\_SCHEMA\\_EVOLUTION = TRUE. But if you need more granular control, I could see scenarios where you might want to do it your way. Bottom line, get an understanding of GB/hour for data coming in so you'll be able to answer the cost differential between the two approaches.

The salary I'm on at the moment is good, I get that but I'm mid 30s, I probably have 30 years left in work, it makes sense to consider what my future look like. When I think about progression there's a lot of stress and long hours that come for positions of more seniority as a DBA. Depending on the company, as a Head of/ Manager you can almost always be on call if that makes sense and I'm not sure the value is really there for me.\n\nI should clarify there are no plans to immediately transition, I'm on a good salary, it's remote and there's low demand, but when I think of 30+ years of working, I need to consider my options. I realise if I looked to move tomorrow I'd need to take a pay cut. I was thinking I'd be looking somewhere between £50-£65k though I think with my role changing I should be able to do a bit more of a hybrid role for a couple of years.",

As a DE, depending on industry itnis much more common to get a pipeline failure alert and deal with itnfirst thing in the morning. Fixing a production pipeline is alsonalmost always easier than something like an emergency server migration / DR rebuild. \n\nThe actual easiest way to make the switch is find a hybrid role as a DBA. Find a role whwre you have to do both jobs. Half 6our day is spent doing the normal DBA tasks. Other half is sepnt writing pipelines, architecting solutions, database design, ci/cd, etc. Then look for a role that is almost exclusively DE work. \n\nThat said you will still be used and leveraged as a DBA in a pinch because very few pure DE's have enough SQL / server knowledge to help out at the same level you can.",

In my current role I still wear both hats fairly regurlarly. In fact I was hired more for my DBA skills than my DE skills.\n\nThat said I found all the following skills very helpful in making the switch. \n\n1. Expert level Powershell knowledge. This comes in handy both on prem and in thr cloud if you regurlarly work with Microsoft stacks. If not Bash would be more useful. \n\n2. Intermediate Python skills. I learned python after powershell and the knowledge transfers easily between them. Somethings when you know both get hard just from do pythonism or powershellism in the other language. In Python focus on learning the common DE packages like pandas, polars, SqlAlchemy, pyodbc, requests these will get used constantly when writing pipelines for rest api endpoints. Dont worry too much about getting into the weeds with oop as most pipelines are not written that way. \n\n3. If you want to go one step further learn Pyspark which is hugely useful in cloud pipelines  and datalakes. Azure data factory, Databricks, etc is just spark underneath the sheets. \n\n4. As a DBA for 10 years before making the switch. I was very familiar with On Prem / runnung SQL on VMs. A big switch for me was learning PaaS offerings like snowflake, databricks, Azure SQL, Azure data factory. So spending time learning the basics on these helped. I got lucky and was dealing with vendors / clients using these services so got paid to learn on thr job as it were. \n\n5. Many older DBAs still have yet to embrace source control. If you are in this boat learn source control, ci/cd, and managing databases as code. If you get these under you belt it will make life better as a DBA and a DE. \n\n6. Communication skills. I have to communicate with non technical and business staff more frequently as a DE than as a pure DBA. As a DBA we are kept locked up and kept away from business / non technical / dats analyst types. We are a bit like wizards who only send ravens when you have really fucked up.

No one expects you to know everything on day one.\n\n2. Is DP-700 a good certification to start with?\n\nDP-700 is a solid certification, but it’s slightly more valuable if you already understand the basics of:\n\n* Data modeling\n* Spark\n* Azure Data Factory\n* Synapse\n* Delta Lake\n\nFor a complete beginner, it can feel heavy.  \nIt helps, but it won’t magically land a job unless you pair it with hands-on practice.\n\n3. What should you actually start with?\n\nHere’s the order I recommend (I use this path for mentees transitioning from non-tech backgrounds):\n\n1. SQL basics → intermediate → analytical SQL\n2. Python for data tasks (Pandas, scripting, file handling)\n3. Cloud fundamentals (Azure AZ-900 is a good starter)\n4. Data engineering concepts (batch vs streaming, data lakes, warehousing)\n5. Spark (Databricks or Azure Synapse)\n6. Then consider DP-700.\n\nBy the time you reach DP-700, you will understand why you are learning each topic instead of memorizing answers.\n\n4. Other certifications worth considering\n\n* AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals): great starting point\n* DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals): perfect for beginners\n* Later: DP-203 : this is the most recognized DE certification on Azure\n\nYour background isn’t a limitation. Your willingness to learn is your biggest advantage.\n\nIf you take it step by step instead of trying to \"jump to the end\", the transition becomes not just possible, but achievable.\n\nYou have already taken the most important step: asking the right questions!",

As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries  \n\n\nDepends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?\n\nBy design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)\n\nIf the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.\n\nBtw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",

If that is the case, using delta lake tables and whatnot seems like crazy overkill. Why not just a postgres instance? Or you could even keep SQL server if it's sufficient for your needs.

I’d honestly go with a direct message from the pipeline itself. Email, slack, whatever service makes sense. Delaying the message means more time for more data submissions to cause breakages.

Then build additional steps that extract the data from BigQuery and do more complex transformations on it.\n\nIf you don't care about access to the raw data, just do all your transformation steps between the json ingestion and Bigquery.\n\nAlso, if you just want to cache your json, you don't necessarily have to convert it into a BQ table. You can just store the json in an unstructured data format in something like an AWS S3 Bucket or GCS before you begin processing the JSON into a dataframe for BQ.\n\nAlso, if you're already working with pandas, I would recommend looking into polars. It's like pandas, but newer and faster (built on rust) and it comes with some features that make validation and type casting a bit more intuitive.\n\nLast thing, depending on your usecase, casting everything to a string has pros and cons. You might end up losing data as a result. For example, if you have a datetime column that you cast into a string and back, you lose any non-represented data like timezone that you can't get back anymore. I personally like maintaining the typing as close to the data source as possible.",

Keep the Pro C transformations intact initially by containerizing or running them in a controlled environment, then focus on validating inputs and outputs aggressively. Once you have parity and confidence in the data, you can start peeling off pieces of the transformation logic incrementally instead of all at once.\n\nModernizing is valuable, but preserving correctness first usually buys you time and reduces risk, especially when the business depends on this pipeline behaving exactly the same way it has for years.",

        "body": "All excellent questions.\n\n1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).\n\n2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. \n\n3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. \n\n4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. \n\nOne issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",

We even help write test cases for them in some cases. We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.\n\nThis has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.\n\nFor the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. \n\nWays we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etc\n\nThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.\n\nDefinitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. \n\nStarting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.\n\nHaving had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.\n\nHaving typed structure really has been the biggest help. Working with developers, have a well defined data type not only helps data products but also helps developers to work with. This means everyone is all largely speaking the same “language” and centralizes the source of truth like what a data vcs brings",

They get copied because we may not want to modify the original argument, so it saves us a line of copying, separates areas of concern, and it's a bit faster.\n\n2. We **can** pass large values (complex structs, arrays, etc...) as function arguments. But they will be copied. That can be a lot of copying, especially if we can't anticipate the size of arguments `my_func(int arg[12])` vs `my_func(int arg[9999])`. \n\n3. Since function arguments get copied, and large copies are expensive, it's cheaper and faster to pass the address (pointer) of the data as a function argument.\n\n1. Very low level programming can involve jumping forward and backward to memory addresses. We can do math on the pointer itself to get to different addresses. You may never do this yourself, but pointers gives us access to this capability.\n\nWhy are you experiencing this in C++ when C++ is supposed to be modern? Because C++ was designed to be compatible with C and the preexisting C libraries. C was designed like this because it was one of the first successful abstractions above assembly and written in an era when compute, storage, and memory was very expensive (cost and compute cycles).\n\nEdit: I mostly mentioned functions + pointers and not pointers in general, but my goal is to justify the utility of pointers and mentioning their benefits with functions is good enough.",

If you need to load a picture into memory, you don't know where in memory that picture is going to end up, so it isn't given an address until it is made.

Other languages abstract away this issue for you, but in environments where C++ is commonly used, such as 3D engines, operating system kernels, or embedded devices like arduino, we can't trust any other tooling to handle this efficiently enough for us, we need direct control.  And using pointers to manage memory allocation and passing around information is how it all works under the hood.\n\nBeyond that, pointers are also the mechanism that your program uses to point to functions in other programs such as system API's, etc.",

For example \"ZOO-123: Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" This ties that commit with Jira ticket ZOO-123 that either is about changes to RabbitMQ messaging or about fixing an issue with said messaging.\n\nAlso, some companies use conventional commits. It is just a way of formatting your commit message so that automated tools can process commits in an easier way. Read about it from [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) An example would be \"fix(ZOO-123): Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" There the fix() keyword shows that the commit was for fixing something. A feat() keyword can be for adding a new feature or for working with some new functionality. For example \"feat(SCHOOL-23): Add Japanese language.\"\n\nThe commit message itself is often in imperative present tense. For example \"Fix to\" instead of \"Fixed\". The commit should give a summary of the change. What was done. Keep it concise and clear. Do not add a whole essay. But also do not just write \"Added more changes.\" Which changes? Why? Read about it from [https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3](https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3) \n\nAvoid frustration and all kind of nonsense in the commits. Yes, when the stuff does not work and your earlier commit did not fix it then writing \"Get working already!!!!!\" or \"wgo8g7tfwo82w37fdto238gd\" is not a rational way how to deal with the issue. It is unprofessional. In the previous company I worked at, we had one guy who raged in his commit messages.\n\nAvoid adding too many details. Instead of writing \"Fix to UserNotificationIntegrationTest, BillingIntegrationTest, BaseIntegrationTest, RabbitMQPublisherIntegrationTest\" better pick \"Fix to integration tests\". Which tests, that can be seen from the git commit itself. Neither go with \"Added an email support to UserNotificationService by introducing emailSender() method that uses angus-mail library\" just write \"Add support to send user notifications via email\" Some good and bad examples are in [https://chris.beams.io/git-commit](https://chris.beams.io/git-commit) \n\nAlso, it does not really help when you finish your whole project and then add it via a single commit that has a commit message of \"Initial commit\".",

Mindlessly asking AI to generate code for you teaches you nothing. But using AI to explain documentation, recommend improvements, provide examples, and break down code can be immensely valuable. There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.\n\nWhat I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: \"I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?\" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: \"Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?\" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills. While I'm doing all this I'm also checking documentation and taking notes. \n\nAI is like a tool box but you shouldn't drop the toolbox off at the job site and trust it to build everything itself. Learn to use the tools and apply them properly.",

On the other hand, I know a guy who is a mediocre employee in general, never really put any effort into their work, and he got a senior role much faster than others, as he kept apply frequently until he got one, and he did land one eventually.\n\nProbably the people I know who advanced to high roles fast were the ones that were very persistent in some sense, looking for opportunities every moment until they got a desirable offer, and being in dynamic environments. (Dynamic could mean a growing company)\n\n\n(Doesn't apply to the US where if you are exceptional, you can be a founding engineer at 23 but that comes rather from \"fame\", if they look at your resume and don't know you or any of the tools you built, you will still be evaluated more based on YoE.)",

A lot of experienced programmers actually bounce off game-like tutorials once they are past the basics. What tends to work well is a small project with constraints, like recreating a simple game, automating something he already cares about, or modding an existing system he uses. That gives him feedback loops, problem solving, and room to explore a language deeply. If you want to support it as a gift, hardware, books with real projects, or even just time and encouragement to build something slightly ambitious often go further than any dedicated learning game.",

A Rasberry Pi!\n\nIf he is into hardware programming, [https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), maybe he would want a Rasberry Pi. It's a small micro-computer he can use for personal projects. May take a bit to deliver.. It could cost a 'bit' depending on which micro-computer you get.\n\n3. Games & Software\n\nRealistically, there aren't many that could serve as a Christmas gift... Most of those types of resources are already available for free online! If there is a Coursera or Udemy course that's paid, or if he would like a subscription to a learning platform like [https://www.boot.dev/dashboard](https://www.boot.dev/dashboard), that could fit your question, but maybe that wouldn't work as a Christmas gift. These types of softwares are often subscription-based, so it might run up your bill...\n\nYou could get him one of these softwares if he asks, but maybe that's something for another time!\n\n\\---\n\nMe, personally, I would get him a nice book. You could use one of my suggestions, or something else. A raspberry pi is also a nice option. \n\nMake a nice gift basket, get him some nice books, put in some plushies if you want. Place in some gift cards to his favorite mobile / console games. Maybe some new clothes. Books + fun stuff, it would make a perfect gift. :) Merry Christmas, thanks for helping your son's learning.",

These are all skills that make you a more competent developer across fields.\n\nBut you also need to learn a lot by yourself to be competent. In fact this is one of the most important parts of being a developer,  tech is constantly moving and changing and you will need to adapt. College can't teach you every \"practical skill\" because no one knows what libraries, languages, frameworks will actually be relevent 5 or 10 years from now. That doesn't mean college is pointless, that's where your supposed to learn how to learn after all.",

You really just pick one thing and stick to it. You mentioned you've \"technically\" done DSA, so doing Leetcode seems like a pretty obvious next move. From there, you can literally start with any problem. If you want, start from 1 and move your way up. It really doesn't matter.  For a more directed interview prep, go to the \"Study Plan\" in the left side menu and pick \"Top Interview 150,\" or any other plan under \"**Cracking Coding Interview.\"** There really couldn't be any clearer signs to guide you. There's nothing scary about it, my dude/dudette, just spend some time familiarizing yourself with your resources, that's all there is to it.\n\n>Right now, I genuinely need guidance. I know I need to do hackathons and internships, but I don’t know how to get there or what steps I should take. Someone please tell me how.\n\nYou need to stop looking for hand-held guidance like this. Hackathons and Internships are both things you do through your university (usually, as in, they can provide guidance). You get there by asking your university staff. Schedule a 15 or 30-minute session with an advisor or career counselor, and they'll give you a place to start, but the rest is all you. Ultimately, you'll need to start finding your own way around being an adult, though.",

But best approach from my perspective would be, as beginner freecodecamp is good start and you will build mini projects there as you move forward through curriculum. \n\nSo focus on finishing freecodecamp because two approaches are apllied there, the projects and theory. And when you finish the freecodecamp build mini projects on your own. There are mini projects on github how to build with JS and its frameworks. \n\nAnd then build a good CV or update if you have one. Also linkedin. \n\nAnd when you finish or land a job upskill all the time. I recommend hyperskill or TheOdinProject. I am currently going with TheOdinProject. It is the best open source and free course for JS imho.",

From there you can do that again with something else. Soon you will be able to come up with your own ideas and you will know where to start. You just keep doing the same thing and all of that stuff will come.

The answer is to build projects and start small. \n\nLook, there's no way to just leap from tutorials to building complex software in one bound. \n\nSo, start small. First, choose a project with a tight scope, like a Todo app with user accounts. \n\nThen, get a Trello account and start writing out individual tasks. You want to make these tasks super simple at first. One might be \"create a webpage with Ultimate Todo List as the title.\" Your next task might be \"Create a CSS Page and make sure it's linked to the webpage.\" Then do the same with JavaScript.\n\nIf you run into something you don't know how to do, make a card for learning how to do it. You do not need or want to fully master new technologies at this stage. You want to learn the bare minimum to incorporate it into your project.\n\nIf you get stuck, try to look up the specific thing you want to do. For example, if you're trying to make a checkbox the user can click, look up that specific thing. If you're unsure how to store your list of items, look that up, but not until you're working on that task.\n\nAnd then you just keep going. Try to complete one or two cards per day. This is almost exactly how professional software is built, btw. Only we break the cards into batches we can complete in two weeks and call it a sprint. \n\nRemember, the cards aren't complete features, they are small tasks. \n\nIf you know Git (and you should) make a repo for your project and get in the habit of making a branch for each card. Once you complete a card, merge your branch into main and start the process again. Your Main branch should always be a working app with whatever features you've added so far. \n\nStart small, complete one or two small tasks every day, rinse, repeat.\n\nIt's not just a way, it's the only way. Software is built one small step at a time.",

Some people have learned the \"single return\" style and stick with that.\n\nOthers prefer the \"return early to handle error conditions\" style, which has its advantages.\n\nMost people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two \"not nice\" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.\n\nIn your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an \"error case\", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the \"if\" branch and the other within the \"else\" branch) would make the \\*intent\\* slightly clearer.\n\nNow, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of \"error condition\" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so \"idiomatically\" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.\n\nOnce the \"error returns\" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is \"correct\" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",

What happens if an email address doesn't match the \"`isValidEmailAddress`\" check?\n\nIt's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this:\n\n    // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred\n    String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) {\n      if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) {\n        return \"Alex\";\n      }\n      if (username == \"\") {\n        return \"Sam\";\n      }\n      if (username.contains(\".\")) {\n        return username.split(\".\")[0];\n      }\n      if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) {\n        return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0];\n      }\n      return username;\n    }\n\nIn the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting \"weird\" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",

E.g.:\n\n    def fizzbuzz(number: int) -> str:  \n        result = \"\"  \n        if number % 3 == 0:  \n            result += \"Fizz\"  \n        if number % 5 == 0:  \n            result += \"Buzz\"  \n        if result == \"\":  \n            result = str(number)  \n      \n        return result   \n\nIn this example you could return the final value both in the second and third if-statement, but if you change the function and a third condition like \n\n```\nif number % 7 == 0:\n    result += \"Razz\"\n```\n\nthen you would have to also change the statement in the Buzz-branch even though your change had nothing to do with the Buzz part of the logic.",

        "body": "the era of 3-6 month bootcamps to a job is over.  Bootcamps simply cannot work in a job market with more supply than demand...and I've never seen an industry where the number of entry level job seekers was so much greater than the number of jobs.\n\nEvery time a post goes by here without this mentioned we do a huge disservice to the person asking.  \n\nThe problem is that it wasn't too long ago that bootcamps were a reasonable way to break into the industry for many.  This is no longer the case.  Bootcamps have been going out of business en masse.  Their job placements rates are in the toilet.  Go and ask every single bootcamp you were interested in their placement data for their \"graduates\" landing jobs SINCE 2022.  You will see them contort painfully to avoid the question. Any bootcamp that is not happy to share placement data by year with you - STAY AWAY.  It doesn't matter their excuses, the context of the data, etc.  The truth is the majority of bootcamp grads since then have not been able to land employment.  \n\n(Note: this is assuming you are in the USA, Canada or an anglophone country.  Things might be quite different in like spain or something).  ",

        "body": "I was in the same position a few years ago and was looking at General Assembly, but I wasn't willing to go into debt. I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.\n\nI did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs.  \n  \nI ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.\n\nIf you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.\n\nAnother tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do. Just make sure you're doing your own personal project after every tutorial project.\n\nHope this is helpful. Good luck!",

I can make it so that they do not need to spend time looking around, exploring, reasoning, guessing, and backtracking.

If you're building a calendar or scheduling app where the primary goal of the app was to schedule things, then rolling your own might be worth it to deliver an amazing experience and have full control over it. If it's just one tiny feature, it probably makes more sense to use a good existing library.\n\nSecond, what are the costs of using an external component? Let's say I need a matrix multiply function. Adding a dependency on a huge linear algebra package like BLAS or numpy might increase the size of the build, add a new license to check, and just overall add a lot of complexity to the project. If the only thing I need it for is to multiply some small matrices and performance doesn't matter, I might implement it myself and use another library to verify that my implementation is correct.\n\nLast, is this something that needs to change/update frequently or is it stable? If it's parsing a data file that's internal to my project and not user-generated, then that code might not ever need to change. Writing some custom code to parse it might be fine because it's not likely to break. On the other hand if it's parsing user-generated PDFs, a third-party library probably keeps getting new bug fixes and improvements over time, so it's probably way better to use a library.",

Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.\n\nSome cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way. Some cells needed to reformat data in a certain way - for example, if we got a timestamp, did we need to show just the date, just the time, seconds since time, etc. One manager always wanted us to separate date and time as two separate columns for Excel reasons. Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).\n\nWrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. \n\nEventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did \"the same thing but better\". My answer, after looking at the library, was that I wrote mine 4 or so years before the npm library was created according to its github history. It also didn't support all of the features, or at least not in some of the specific use cases we had. So it *wasn't* something that existed when I needed it, and it also still didn't technically do everything we needed it to do.\n\nSimilarly, I'll also \"engineer\" extremely simple things from scratch if I feel like it would take me longer to find a library to do the thing than it would to write. This case was we had a dashboard for a monitoring tool that just needed to show groups of \"top 10s\", so 10 rows, each containing a bar, another bar (with a definable color) inside of it with width based on a percentage, and a text value (that could also be a link). Easy enough: div wrapping a div and p or a, a dozen lines of CSS, and a function to manage it, took 5 minutes to write, 100% localized code I don't have to rely on a library for.",

I didn’t want to spend days or weeks building a chart renderer, so I used Apache Echarts. \n\nFor a more recent example, I was messing around with Simplex and Perlin noise to generate procedural earth-like maps. Didn’t look great, so eventually I found an online map generator that happened to have the source open to anyone. I made an API to call its C functions that generated a height map I could use in C++.\n\nIf you can legally use it in your source code, then use it. Unless of course you want to learn how to make it yourself. Usually it’s a function of timeliness.",

Best options i have found in no particular order were: Odin Project, Freecode camp, CS50, Udemy. \n\nAll of these routes are valid options and many self taught programmers were made from them.\n\nI found Udemy better fit for me because it explains the theory in videos with examples and then puts you into test with an exercise or a project (at least in the courses I had).\n\nLike others said, In programming you are going to need to read in order learn something on the go more often than not. Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there. \n\nFor now it looks like cs50 or a Udemy course would be a better fit for you. But in the end it doesn't matter much. After the tutorials is where the hard part begins and there are no videos there. \n\nHope that helps ✌️",

        "body": "Just a bit of advice and perspective:\n\nFirst, you can access the videos from Free Code Camp's Concepts [here](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecampconcepts/videos) They have said they may be removed at any point in time, so look into a YT Downloader or some such. Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.\n\nThere is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.\n\nSecond, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.\n\nI'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.\n\nOdin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.\n\nAt that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.\n\nI'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.\n\nI'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such. Best of luck.",

        "body": "You have to understand some programming history to understand why C and C++ exist.\n\nLets roll back the clock to 1990 or so.  Personal computers are just starting to become practical.  For $3000 in todays money you can get a home desktop computer about as powerful as a super Nintendo is (286 or 386 PC running windows 3.1)  At the time this is considered cutting edge, way faster than those atari and apple 2 computers people are using before.  You can get real work done with these!\n\nYour options for programming languages really boil down to something like assembler, BASIC, or C / C++.  Lets compare each.\n\n\\- Anyone programming in 1980 to 1990 or so to do real work was likely using assembler.  This is as close as you can get to actual processor instructions.  Read value from memory address one into register 1, read value into memory address 2, compare the values with binary math, if they are equal then JMP to subroutine that outputs string from memory address 3, etc.  This is literal processor instructions - it doesn't get any more raw and fast than that.\n\n\\- You could learn BASIC, but BASIC is an interpreted language.  Rather than the code being compiled into processor instructions BASIC is a program itself that reads the program you are running and figures out what it should be doing in real time.  This makes it about 10 times slower.  But good god, is it easier to write a program in BASIC than Assembler - you can just define an array, you can just write a function, you can just define subroutines that take actual arguments - its so much more clean.  If you can write your program in BASIC it will be much easier to maintain and simpler to comprehend - but its going to run soooo much slower.  In a world where making a FPS like wolfenstein 3D work stretches the limit of what is possible on the hardware, a 10x speed loss is just too much when your program relies on speed.\n\n\\- Then comes C and C++.  The idea behind these languages is that you can write your code kind of like interpreted languages instead of assembler - defining functions, data structures, complicated mathematical algorithms - but instead of the computer interpreting the program in real time, it can convert it all to bytecode - basically the same thing as assembler - and run it almost as fast as an assembler program as a result.  C/C++ is written like a processor actually acts.  But as nice as this is, there are still significant shortcomings.  Dynamic memory allocation which is something that just happens like magic in an interpreted language, is not automatic in C++ - stuff like creating an array, creating a variable length string, or defining a variable, or converting one variable type to another - this is not actually provided in C, you have to manage it on your own.  Which you most defiantly can - and doing so is easier than doing so in assembler.  So now you have all the advantages of assembler and the complexity is significantly reduced.\n\nBut its not 1990 anymore, its 35 years later.  Computers are hundreds if not thousands of times faster, have multiple cores, usually have 32,000 MB of RAM instead of like, 4 MB, etc.  There is enough extra speed in a computer that you don't really need that extreme optimization anymore.  And the way computers operate with all this extra resources have also changed - with multi core systems you can have some of the cores or the GPU handling the graphics pipeline in your program, which is like 95% of the processing time - and this is all handled outside of the program you are actually writing.\n\nThere are also many, many more languages that more elegantly handle the problem of ease of development balanced against speed.  Most modern languages, like javascript or python, act like interpreted languages in that they are flexible and just run, but under the hood they still compile to bytecode for speed - the performance loss of using them vs C++ is not as much as it used to be.  Modern Javascript in particular is \\*\\*king FAST, thanks to google throwing millions and millions of dollars into optimizing chrome. The way the async cycle in javascript works is far more flexible than what C/C++ offers, and in general all the features in C/C++ are now available in newer languages, and usually they do it better.\n\nFinally, you should consider that your programs don't need the extra speed and complexity that comes with C++ because all the heavy lifting in your program will not actually be done by the program you are writing.  The graphics are done by the GPU.  If you want a video or mp3 encoder or something, you bring in someone else's tool into your program as a library (probably written in C++) and invoke it and get the results.  Programming in 2025 is more about gluing premade tools together and orchestrating them, and your code is the orchestration layer.  It is much more beneficial for this layer to be simpler and easier to comprehend and manage and leaving the dirty details to other tools.  You will always be on hardware that is hundreds of times faster than you need for this purpose.",

The best books are often out of date in some ways, and although they are a great resource for \"How\" and \"Why\", you will also need an up-to-date source of information. I have been using w3schools, and although they may or may not be the best that can be found, my hope is that it will bridge the gap between the great books on the subject and the recent changes to the language. I know and use HTML and CSS pretty well, and I am to the point where I can look up the raw features of it to figure out how to do what I want (when it is something I have not done often or at all); I am sure there will come a point where I can get to where I do not need the book (or lessons) to figure out how to do something with the language. So...short answer, it is just part of learning. Do not feel fake or inferior. And, definitely, you learn by doing. Watching videos can be interesting, but they do not help me really learn. Whatever the language you are learning, get a compiler/IDE. Type the code you are learning and experiment with IT. In other words, make the code you think you are learning work in an environment separate from the one that is teaching you. And don't copy and paste. Type it out.  I use Code::Blocks and highly recommend it (it is free). Slight\\_Scarcity321 gives some good advice a little ways down this page.",

But I'm years ahead of you.  \nI have b-degree in business administration, never worked in related role.  \n2 years ago I was 27, applied for a second university, 2 years course which teaches programming (qualification at the end). I already had bachelors degree, I didn't need 2nd one.  \nBefore the school I learned some coding already, so the course wasn't that hard and I had a bit of experience already. I only had experience with frontend, today I can build full-stack applications. (junior lvl) I got scholarship for being the best in class so that helped financially.\n\n2 years later. I'm still looking for job since June. Yes, I'm a bit picky of which role I want. I don't want to work  as administrator in a bank and answer old grandmas calls. I want to do something programming related cause I know I have a knowledge and experience more than some juniors today. And I will be hard working and learn as fast as I can. But I had mby like 4 interviews in 6 months for the roles that I was not really happy about so let that sink in.\n\nWhat I think:  \nBootcamps in todays job market sucks. 5 years ago they were worth it, cause you could learn fundamentals in 4-5 months and company was happy to hire you and they would teach you on the job without any experience or knowledge. Because to be real, nobody can learn advanced things in 6 months. You will only learn some simple things. You won't learn to build advanced full stack applications with best practices and high security.  \nAnd today company expects you to know all of that, which takes 8 hours a day for 5+ years of doing real job.\n\nI will be completely honest. If you are not a genius (so that goverment can hire you) or you don't have a relative or a very good friend who can hire you. You won't get a job. There are already 1k devs with so much more experience, knowledge and skills applying for the same role you want. AI doesn't help ether, seniors can do 3 jobs now, generate things fast, they wont need juniors to fix buttons for them anymore. (You already know it, based on your generated post)  \nWhile there are more developers than jobs available it will stay like this and I think it will only be worse.  \nMy hope is that AI will become so expensive without improving that it will be more rentable to hire juniors instead. Or companies realize that they need juniors to learn and become seniors one day.",

        "body": "The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.\n\nOn first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.\n\nThis idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. \n\nIn the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.\n\nHowever, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using \"Composition\" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. \n\nFor Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing \"ISpeaker` and there may be \"BipedRunner\" and \"QuadrupedRunner\" implementing \"IRunner\" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:\n\n```py\ncat =   Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())\ndog =   Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())\nhorse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())\n\ncat.speak()   # \"meow!\"\ndog.speak()   # \"wruff!\"\nhorse.speak() # \"neigh!\"\n\n```\n\nThis is what \"Composition over Inheritance\" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).\n\nA big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ). \n\nMaybe that helps a bit.",

Perhaps you can skip all kind of menu automation and send direct POST or PUT requests to its API, instead. Sure, menu automation and such has its place, in frontend testing and such, but first try to get it done by using the API endpoints of Beatstars. Because any and all menu clicks and dropdown selections in the end send some HTTP request to Beatstars server. Or SOAP requests or websockets or something. Open the developer tools of your browser and see which requests with which information are being sent to the server. And then reverse engineer it from there.

By the end of your 3rd or 4th year (however the study program is for you) you'll have some preferences in terms of where you are planning to specialize in.\n\nYou can't niche down early when you do not know your options. Sure, you can decide \"I will become mobile app developer\" which is a valid path. But are you certain that this path is for you? Perhaps you'll do better in programming IoT devices? Just go by the curriculum, for now.\n\nLearn to learn. Right now you are doing your college/university studies. It is not any more high school where teachers would remind you to do your assignments and such. Now you have to learn how to live an independent life and make your own decisions. When I was doing my Bachelor studies then some of my course mates dropped out within the first two semesters. Some partied too much. Some had no self-discipline. Some found out that they picked a wrong field. etc. \n\nAbout skills more, then become proactive. Do not rely just on your courses. Participate in hackathons. Join a programming/robotics club. Work on hobby projects. Because by the time you graduate you'll have to compete with everybody else. And then you have to stand out somehow, to be hired.\n\nAnd, do not rely on an AI. Can happen that your client prohibits any and all AI usage where the data goes through third party cloud services. What will you do then? Oh, and do not try to hack your university's/college's systems. Some of my course mates got into problems when trying out stuff.\n\nIn terms of tech stacks then learn these things that are actually in demand in your area. Sure, the curriculum should already support that but if it does not do that then it is up to you to check different job offers and see what is required from developers, there. And that applies to any path you are picking. May it be an AI, a mobile app development, an IoT development, a web application development, a data science, or something else.",

From my experience and talking to professionals  degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.\n\nAs for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.\n\nRegarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.\n\nThe truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.\n\nPS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.\n\n\n\nNow specifically regarding some stuff you asked: \n\nYou should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot. Also, even if you end up going into like embedded, building a website will still make you a better and more well rounded programmer.",

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now?

I've been trying to study the patterns like sliding window and two pointer and can usually identify when to use them.\n\nFor this kind of stuff, then for me it's essential to have a well-illustrated example, in order to really understand. For example, you used the term \"sliding window\", which gave my brain a vague inkling of what you're talking about, but not yet enough to have a \"picture\" in my mind of what you're really trying to solve.\n\nThen I used Google and found this Answer which is illustrated beautifully: [What is Sliding Window Algorithm? Examples? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples)\n\nAnyway, as the Answerer points out, calling it a \"sliding window algorithm\" is really a misnomer; it is a useful technique, though.\n\nSo, how does one get better at using this technique? Well, you've got to practice it, of course. The example shown in that Q&A is a pretty good starter problem (find the maximum sum of n consecutive numbers); you can adapt that to almost anything (e.g. find the lowest average of n consecutive numbers, find a particular small sequence within a large stream of numbers, etc.).\n\nFor this example, I'd see the \"sliding window\" approach as an optimization of the brute force approach. That is, solve it first with the \"brute force\" approach (which will still be 'efficient' in computational terms, but will be a factor of n slower than necessary), and then solve it again with a sliding window approach.\n\nSolving a problem twice may sound lame or may sound like unneeded extra work, but in a situation like this will be satisfying because first, you'll be able to measure exactly how much faster the better approach is, and second, you'll have a \"testing client\" against which you can test your 'better' approach. For something like this, it's usually easier to make  a mistake in the implementation of the more clever approach, so a handy testing method is to make a testing driver that solves your problems using both approaches.\n\n(I.e. the test driver tests some sample testing inputs against the 'dumb' solution way, as well as against the 'clever' solution way) and then stops if two clients give different results (which indicates that ONE of the approaches must be wrong for that particular input). Usually you'll end up with a bug or two in the 'clever' way, but by systematically comparing with the 'dumb' way, you can normally lay such bugs to rest in a fairly straightforward way (debugging will still be work to do it, of course, but it will never feel like you're totally stuck, because you'll have the alternate version to compare against).\n\n>I've seen many people say they took courses or they learned it in college, but I just cannot afford an expensive course let alone going to college. Does anyone have some advice?\n\nRobert Sedgewick et al's course on Algorithms is available free of charge on Coursera, the last time I checked (for auditing it); it's a pretty good course. You'll need the textbook to do the course properly, but I suppose you can find a low-cost edition, use a library, etc. if you cannot afford to buy that book.",

        "body": "Other people have explained the difference between an operating system and a distribution pretty well (and the distinction typically only applies to Linux - with MacOS and Windows, there is really no distinction between the concept of the operating system and the distribution).\n\nIf you really want to learn about what operating systems do and how operating systems work, there is really no better way than to use Linux: with Linux, it's much easier to have access to the way that the operating system actually works and how the pieces come together, and the code of the Linux kernel is open source, so you can actually look at it if you want to. I would recommend making a USB drive with a Linux installation you can boot to if you don't already have Linux installed (Puppy Linux, MX Linux, and Slax are all good choices for this - a Linux distribution you can use from a keydrive and save your changes and files), or have a virtual system with Linux installed on it, or if you're really determined, install Linux on a partition, which can be a bit difficult to do. Another option could be to buy a Raspberry Pi, which is Linux-based, and play with that for many of your tasks.\n\nYou can get books on Linux that will teach you plenty about how the operating system functions:\n\n\"The Linux Programming Interface\" by Kichael Kerrisk is viewed by many as a definitive encyclopedia for understanding how Linux works. You'll learn about making system calls, OS library functions, and the relationship between applications and the kernel in detail. You'll come away from that book with a whole new appreciation as to how OSes work.\n\n\"How Linux Works\" by Brian Ward. It really covers the glue that holds the OS together, covering the boot process, how the kernel manages hardware, and how networking and devices actually function under the hood.\n\n\"Modern Operating Systems\" by Andrew Tanenbaum is also a great book. It's not exclusively about Linux, but it will teach you the fundamental theory of OSes, such as process management, memory, and file systems that Linux is built on.\n\nKeep in mind that you don't **need** to really understand your operating system before you can start learning a programming language. Most programming languages these days run on all operating systems (with a few exceptions). Pick the language you want to learn, and there's a very good chance it will run on whatever operating system you already have installed on your computer, and will abstract away the differences between operating systems, which is one of the main functions of a programming language: that way, programs are portable, and can be run on any operating system.",

But other than that, the thing is stable and \"it just works\". Whereas the newest thing can have multiple open issues.\n\nIs the newest thing actually maintained? Recently I had to make a technical analysis for a new microservice and had to come up with an architecture proposal for it. I considered different alternatives. There was a library A and a library B. Library A had been around for many years. Sure, it had a lot of bloat and stuff, but it worked. Library B also seemed to work. Less bloat. Promising. BUT the maintainer/developer/owner of that library had abandoned that project. For 2 years there had been no commits. Github issues were abandoned. Yes, that B was newer than A but it was abandoned. Whereas A was older, did have more bloat, but was in active maintenance. Recent commits to update versions. Recent commits to fix vulnerabilities. etc.\n\nIs the newest thing that you should consider in the current geopolitical world? Let's say you are a developer in the US. Will you use a library made in China, in Russia, or in Iran? By itself the library can be newer and perhaps also better. BUT the decision makers can start making decisions where they tell the developers to make the library close sourced and you won't have any overview of the changes. Decision makers can introduce kill switches or backdoors. Or, the developers will collect data and send it to their data brokers. And then that data will be used in a competitive manner. One of the many reasons why one should think twice if he should use Deepseek AI, for example. Technically very promising LLM model. Also, it introduced many changes to other LLMs in the world. But, it follows the political agenda of China. It is not neutral.\n\nDoes the newest thing have enough documentation? Older stuff can have massive documentation compiled by many developers over years. A new thing can have close to no documentation and you have to be one of the pioneers creating that documentation on the go.\n\nHow is the new thing fitting in the existing infrastructure? Perhaps it does not even work? Yes, stuff often is meant to be backwards compatible, but not always it is the case. For example Spring Boot 2.x vs Spring Boot 3.x and different libraries. Some newer libraries expect you to use also newer Spring Boot version. Also newer Java version. You can't just throw the newest library in the code and hope that stuff works.\n\nDo you have resources (time, budget) to make upgrades to support the newest tools and the newest versions?\n\nHow will you balance constant upgrades with adding new functionality and maintaining the project as a whole? A new library version can come out every month, for example. Will you concentrate on version upgrades over working what the client actually cares about? It is difficult to \"sell\" version upgrades to a client. You have to prove that it is needed. Yes, Dependabot is a thing but some time will still go into reviewing its MRs and doing smoke testing to ensure that untestable stuff (for whichever reason) works.\n\nWith you updating stuff, will you break something that external service providers are using? You can't expect them to update their stuff because you are doing constant upgrades.",

Use proper variable names, var0 tells me nothing. Same with folder1. \n\n\n2. Use less comments. \n\n\n3. Split your code into functions, this together with proper variable names makes your code easier to understand and will lessen the need for commenting everything. Make sure to use the local keyword on variables to limit the the scope of your variables to that function. \n\n\n4. Use \"#!/usr/bin/env bash\" instead of \"#! /bin/bash\" as this is considered best practice as it makes fewer assumptions about the underlying system. \n\n\n5. I'd prefer you created the Bookmarked and Originals folder after the colour definition, but this is just my preference as I'd expect definitions to come before commands. \n\n\n\n\n6. Implement error handling and have the script clean up after itself if something fails. \n\n\n7. Avoid shadowing your variables by naming a variable the same in nested code, see file. \n\n\n8. Less nesting, use function calls. \n\n\nAnd that's all I've time for. ",

If/Else statements are very powerful, but once you start chaining tons of them, it is always a good place to stop and ask if you can do it in a better way, whether that be with a match / switch case (some languages call them switch), or using a design pattern like a state machine.\n\nGood example of that would be a video game character with multiple states like crouching or jumping. Someone could string a dozen if/else statements, and check nested if/else statements inside those blocks... Or they could use a state machine.\n\nOn that note, I hope this [website](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) all about design patterns can be of use to you.\n\nHappy I could help, all the best and happy holidays!",

Developers in the west in general are obsessed with code quality to the point where it clashes with business outcomes. As long as the functionality works as expected and performance/stability is decent that’s all anyone on the business side of things and the customers care about. Code quality only matters to devs really. Let me reiterate functional testing is important to everyone, but code quality only matters to devs. A lot devs in India (and other off shore locations) aren’t paid enough to care about code quality but they do as a matter of pride care about the functional output being correct - the part their management and customers will see. Ironically this matches exactly with what the business and customers want. Why deal with a bunch of “overpaid” people complain about the need to refactor and take care of tech debt all the time perceived to be moving slowly and being difficult to manage when you can get others who will accept less pay and just do what you want them to do.",

This may mean being creative and taking a job that is loosely tech related, or maybe not even tech related, if you really need the money. This will eventually pass, but it may take a few years. Try to keep your skills up on the side. Even if you are not in a tech field you may see a need that is missing. Make it a side project, if nothing else it will keep your skills up. I know it is hard to be motivated to code to just code, so look for these missing needs.",

Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being \"correct\".\n\nIn the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.\n\nWhat makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.\n\nLike if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company. But you wont be a senior at a company where scale matters and vice versa.\n\nYou could be a senior level expert at CUDA programming and then be junior at cloud stuff. Thats why again id put senority to yoe/overall exposer and it changes depending on the scope.",

Harden your alerts, metrics, and your tests and you will *reduce* the chances of an outage. In my experience I've categorized outages as unforced errors and just being unlucky.\n\nWas the system down because of an unforced error? Lead a technical review on it. Why did it get to that point? How? How can you prevent it from happening again and how can you apply this to OTHER cases in the future? Reduce unforced errors to 0.\n\nUnfortunately. there will be times that you will need to put out fires. That's part of the job. For example, [Log4Shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) was a week ruiner for many. AWS, Azure, etc. outages have caused fires at work.\n\nAlso fwiw if you're not really needed in these meetings, you can really just go to the concert and attend chats through your phone if you want.",

        "body": "First, this requires planning beforehand. It's no good if you're figuring out what the after-hours on-call process is while the roof is on fire. As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. \"Hey, what happens if...?\"\n\nSecond, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.\n\nHowever, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, \"How can I help?\" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.\n\nFinally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer. Recognizing this and knowing it is very important as you navigate office politics in the future.",

So what I decided to do is turn that boring work into something exciting. Even if im not getting paid more for spending extra efforts on it, I felt pleasure in the work from praises by upper management. Just getting your name recognized at the top can be a motivational aspect that turns something boring into something exciting like: \"how can i surpass myself even more next time?\"\n\nFor example, I worked a few years ago on a feature to create some key vault. So its a process feature, literally no programming, you could get it done in 1 hour by click click click > done. But I decided to present it on a review meeting and instead of the typical boring power point slides that engineers talk through to present their work, I decided to make it dramatic. Kinda like a thriller. I looked up articles on what happens if Secrets arent stored in a key vault. And I got a couple news articles about Uber for example or some other companies in which their credentials like API keys weren't securely stored and thus a breach happened. \n\nSo basically I took these examples, added ominous bgm, and started narrating it like its a thriller movie lol. The meeting turned from boring to everyone quickly locked in. Their reactions were priceless. In the end i got all the engineers to store their credentials in the key vault. \n\nThis is just one example of how you could turn something boring into something thrilling and exciting. Upper  management started inviting other managers whenever they saw my name on the presenters list. They became like my fanbase \"I wonder what he has for us this time!\" Lol Personally that became my passion for a while! That has bolstered my mental outlook even if it wasnt a monetary incentive involved. Money isn't everything sometimes (in terms of satisfaction/happiness), and in a way, it actually unlocked a skill in me: story telling. Thats a skill of product managers, so it opens up more career options!",

If it's generic or looks like AI slop that's an anti-signal.\n\n- Does the resume indicate a clear understanding of WHY the info they list is important or worth mentioning? I do not want a laundry list of every task a candidate has ever done, I want the highlights that indicate skillsets and ability.\n\n- Have they articulated previously done work that's similar to what we're looking for, or are they just regurgitating a tech stack? For strong candidates I don't care if they have exact tech stack matches, but sometimes more junior or otherwise weaker-signal candidates will get to a screen for having rare tech stack matches.\n\n- Do I recognize their university, prior companies, or anything else on their resume (e.g. notable open source contributions, math or programming competitions, publications at relevant venues)?\n\nAnd frankly at the end of the day I am wildly overloaded and am one person making a quick judgement. I also put significantly more weight on candidates that have been referred to me somehow or who have a shared connection.

At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \\~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \\~5 which we would invite to interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.\n\nIf you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.\n\nDo you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words \"for your kind consideration\"? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?\n\nWhy on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?\n\nFor what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.\n\nBut I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.\n\nAnd your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.\n\nAnd if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.\n\nAnd then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.\n\nBelieve me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",

The existing customer base, code base, management structure, name recognition, R&D work, documentation, etc of an established company is worth a lot and allows them to pay new hires six figures out of the gates, versus a startup that will take months to get its first customer and years to become profitable.",

There's a good chance you won't be able to make a full living off of it, but a few hundred extra bucks a month along the way isn't a bad outcome.\n\nI'll also mention as an old-timer in this industry (and Reddit community) that there was a lot of advice to do \"personal projects\" like 6-8 years ago, and that's fallen *way* out of favor. Too many people couldn't come up with things to do and got frustrated (and still do), and too many of the people who did make cool personal projects didn't feel like it mattered because their resume GitHub link didn't stand out from all the people who just copy/pasted repositories they saw from YouTube and put up GitHub links on theirs.",

It produced a ton of products used in homes, and even had a massive research wing. Getting a job there was seen as being set for life. You had a job for life and a nice pension for retirement.\n\nIn 1981 a new CEO came in. He cut any non profit part of the company. Every department was expect to fire the bottom 15%, no matter how they did compared to others. I think he removed the pensions, but not sure on this one. GE’s stock price soared.\n\nJack Welsh’s tenure at GE was the catalyst that set corporations to become what they are today. Also a CEO’s job is to increase share price. They can be removed and fine (woe is them /s).\n\nIf you want stability and to be appreciated for the work, and you’re in the US, go govie. Maybe not right this second, because the current admin is anti-government worker. However, you won’t make big tech money, but you can still get over 100k a year pretty easily. More if you go contractor, but you get more replaceable (being good at your job or having a clearance will still play a big role).",

For example, looking at latency of virus scanning for images. However, the cutoff is much more \"is this too slow at the scale we expect to matter\" instead of \"is this the absolute best option\". Also, we don't have free reign to choose whatever stack we want. There are languages that our developers are familiar with, ones for which we have tooling (e.g. Terraform modules), and for which we can easily collect metrics. I got in a bit of trouble for using Python for a cloud function script because it wasn't an \"approved language\". IMO, you can absolutely build something that would scale to 100m daily users in Python or Ruby (not that I would want to), as the language matters much less than the architecture and actual implementation. I think there is this idea that you need to use C or Rust to get the \"absolute best performance\", and that is probably true on a micro scale, but on a macro scale, you can just use a native extension and get the same performance boost without actually writing low-level code.",

I know life at that company suck and people will ghost you, but there are many people who WILL bend over backwards to help you figure these things out given you’ve done some digging yourself and can ask informed questions.\n\nIn my experience pretty much all feature work at all levels is going to have to consider business logic and deployments to a service that runs on compute, extend or create DAOs that write to databases, add routing rules for new APIs to an LB, and update front ends — the foundation for an application; lambdas and queues and ddb streams are all very common patterns too. That alone is a really good place to start researching trade offs, which is something you can do very intentionally while building, or even by looking through low severity system issues during oncalls. If you’re on the hook for LLDs, there’s even more room to dig into trade offs and alternatives.",

Jobs are very competitive. \n\nFirst I would just start interview prep and start applying. Don’t shy away from boring companies like banks, insurance, etc… \n\nSecondly I would immediately start working on a project to put on my resume. Find an interesting open source project, or join a startup that pays nothing. Idk just start working again to show employers you are interested and have skills.\n\nThirdly I’d look into my old workmates, they are senior level now. Contact them and see if they can help out.\n\nFourth you’ll need to build a good story about why you left and why you are back. Do not make it sound negative as if you are unreliable.\n\n\nLastly you may have to consider getting into and online masters like OSMCS. This is what I would do after maybe 6-9months of actively applying with no luck.",

Create a portfolio or GitHub profile showcasing these projects, so potential employers can see your abilities despite the career gap. Networking is crucial; reconnect with former colleagues, attend meetups, or join online communities to hear about opportunities and get referrals. A master’s or certificate can help if you want formal validation or want to pivot to a specialized field, but it’s not strictly necessary if you can prove your skills through projects and experience. Focus on a combination of skill refresh, visible work, and networking to make a strong case for getting back into software engineering.",

That's a little tongue in cheek, but it's worth having some perspective: people that work mining coal a mile underground don't do it for fun, don't study coal mining as a hobby, and don't participate in miner meetups. We all need to keep some perspective on how lucky we are that there's even a question there.\n\nIn that vein:\n\n> I enjoyed going to the office, using my split keyboard, having triple monitor setup, cool desk decorations\n\nI don't mean this to be discouraging at all: but you need to get more out of things than that. Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying better tools and environment - but careers are long and tweaking your setup isn't going to keep you motivated beyond the next few months, let alone decades.\n\nBut all that said - you aren't entirely wrong. This is both a job and a career, and if you're not learning stuff or getting growth opportunities then that isn't good. You won't always have interesting things to build, but if you never get that then you're going to stagnate and that's where people run into trouble finding new jobs.\n\nYou should be able to work with your manager to identify some growth areas and find some tickets where you can learn something. That's a perfectly reasonable expectation. But the key is to focus on what you can learn and what new skills you can build: it being \"exciting\" doesn't really enter into it.",

That work needs to run somewhere, so that's an excuse for building a home lab.  Having a home lab also opens up other wishes, like a Plex media server or backup solution for the family's computers, etc.\n\nIf I'm building a home lab and building/running all these services, it only makes sense to build it all with IaC and keep track of everything with Git, just like I'd do in a professional setting.  Maybe I won't PR myself and yolo it all right into main, but otherwise I'm building things out for my home with the same tools, tech, and patterns I use professionally.\n\nBecause of this I'm very often doing \"POC\" work for my job on my own home lab first.  *That's* where I built my skills first for example, in building and running k8s clusters and all the downstream details that brings for how I structure my code to run on k8s, how do I handle CI/CD cleanly to deploy, etc.\n\nWhen it comes to actual software, I'm coding a lot of family management apps to help track kid chores, keep our finances in order, etc.  I'm also coding on robotics and drone projects, including some with/for my kids to run their Lego robot creations.

The trick is to find platform teams that are hiring SWEs where you can build tools that take the pain of infrastructure off of the product teams.\n\nThere are a lot of DevOps/SRE roles that intersect this space and are 90% config-writing (infrastructure as code), but if you can get into writing custom Terraform modules and Kubernetes controllers you'll be highly sought after. I had a recruiter recently tell me that they pay their platform SWEs more than their backend or frontend SWEs because they're more specialized and harder to find. \n\nIt's not for everyone, but give it a solid try, you won't be boxing yourself in (at least this early in your career). I have specialized in this role for 10 years so I show up in searches for senior positions. Recruiters that find me for product teams will usually end up having the hiring manager reject my resume because I haven't worked on product for a decade. But I'm not pursuing those types of roles at this point anymore. I think you've got a ways before you're in that position.

Using react or just plain javascript or nextjs, SQL vs NoSQL, lambdas vs EC2, ECS vs Kubernetes, client side rendering vs server side rendering (ie maybe you dont want server side rendering with immediately important information like financial data or medical data, but otherwise you'd want it especially publicly facing applications).",

They're both the same. I went to college in Virginia and every recruiter came to the state's #1 Engineering + CS school (Virginia Tech) and almost every recruiter went to #2 (University of Virginia). I'm talking over 200 companies at alleged #35 Virgina Tech's [expo](https://www.sec.vt.edu/expo.html) where I got internship offers. We interviewed on campus in rented rooms.\n\nWhat matters is #1 work experience in the form of internship or co-op. #2 is university prestige so rankings but, again T30 vs T50 is fake. #1 or #2 in your state is fine. Like University of Wyoming has garbage rankings but companies in Wyoming will recruit there. After first job at graduation, university prestige matters much less, if at all.",

I can guarantee they won't hire a senior or CTO until they get funding. \n\nAlso, good engineering practices cost money: licenses, infrastructure, etc.--not a lot of money, but they seem kind of short on money, which would be another good question to ask: if they can't even afford laptops, how will they afford AWS, etc.\n\nGood luck. I just want to make sure you approach this with hard realism: it's something to put on your resume, maybe you'll learn a few things. Anything else is like winning the lottery.

Then after that is really the beginning of the more \"cool\" stuff like operating systems, cryptography, robotics, databases, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, computer graphics, compilers, algorithms, etc.\n\n>If programming makes sense, which language suits a math student who’s learning for understanding, not employability?\n\nPython (due to amount of resources online)\n\n>I want to keep learning mathematics \n\nIf you have never taken Number Theory, I recommend the Intro to Number Theory book by Mathew Crawford from AoPS. I did that when I was in elementary school and it's a phenomenal book. And like all AoPS books, challenging.\n\nFor Discrete Math, it's Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, Kenneth Rosen.\n\nThose are the more \"CS\" sided part of math. Math majors of course would be: Calculus 1, 2, 3 -> Linear Algebra + Diff Eq -> Real Analysis 1/2 + Modern Algebra 1/2 -> Topology/etc",

I worked professionally for six years. \n\nI started learning C# early on in life because I loved video games and wanted to make them, there were two primary languages you could accomplish that with back then (this was about 20 years ago) C# with the XNA framework, or C++ with a library like SDL. XNA transitioned to monogame, and SDL is now SDL2. I believe Unity was around but it wasn't popular yet, unreal engine existed but the commercial license was expensive. I went with learning C# because I wanted to make games for the Xbox 360 and monogame was free to use, which I did, I launched two games before finding work in the industry doing web development. \n\nThat was my path and it worked well for me.\n\nIn your case, because you have a heavy math background and you're only interested in learning id try LISP or maybe Python. Those are less marketable languages but have heavier focuses on Math.\n\nAny mainstream language to start is a good one though. Game programming is fairly math intensive which you might enjoy but it's very labor intensive and requires a knack for art , if you don't mind trying to make your own graphics and aren't all that concerned about design philosophy then id still recommend C# and monogame. Maybe you could start by building pong and then transitioning to a game like tetris. \n\nGood luck!",

That only matters if you're talking to an actual engineer, or engineering manager, who knows the difference between \"wrote HelloWorld in Rust\" and \"on the Rust board of directors\". Most HRBPs/recruiters don't know the difference, and speak \"years of accredited education\" and \"years of professional experience\" exclusively, and those are the people deciding whether your application/resume ever lands in the inbox of a manager with an open [req](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453).\n\nBe sure to emphasize the internship and accredited education in your resume first and foremost. The portfolio, or interesting GitHub personal projects, can and should be a footnote below things recruiters/HRBPs are specifically looking for. I'll also add that tinkering alone, by yourself, on a project is not nearly as useful as collaborating with a team on a project. Because in the real world, most engineers work as a part of a team or teams to get stuff done. Consider contributing to well-known open source projects. Understand that step 0 of contributing meaningfully to most open source projects is: You understand what the project is, and who its end users are, on a deep level. That can take anywhere from days/weeks/years depending on the complexity of the project. And \"I was part of SIG release for Kuberenetes 1.31\" is easier for a recruiter/HRBP to grok than \"look at this chatbot I made, isn't it neat\". It's especially easier to grok if that recruiter/HRBP is staring at a req with the word \"Kubernetes\" in 5 different places.\n\nFor extra emphasis; Fix your resume first before you spend time chasing shiny open source projects. Also, the job market just extra sucks right now -- sorry about that. Not much to be done about organizations shy around adding headcount.",

What are the circumstances where you would imagine that happening? \n\nFor whatever it might be worth, I took recruiter calls frequently at my last job over the course of 2 years. I spoke with at least a 8-12 of them in this time and while most were one time conversations, some of them I went further with multiple communications. Never once was it a problem, and it eventually led to me finding a position that was a monumentally better fit for me and I made the move. \n\nI, personally, wouldn’t sweat having a conversation here and there. It’s good for you, I don’t think your concerns of your current job finding out are realistic (but maybe I’m wrong about that), and if you end up not liking what the recruiter is selling you then you just move on, no big deal. Best case scenario is you find something you’re excited about. You never know.",

Fake check scam: https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_fake_check\n\n> The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.\n> \n> Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.\n> \n> When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html\n> \n> If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.",

Internships, connections, and ML conference papers are how people get jobs at those labs. Without putting in extra work, and potentially a lot of extra work, you won't have any of those three. \n\nPersonally, I'd do it only if I were at peace with the full range of potential post-PhD outcomes. That includes not just the best case where you end up at an industry lab, but also worse cases including rejoining industry at basically the same level you are now (albeit with a PhD, or after mastering out) or being a postdoc. \n\nIf what you'd work on during your PhD isn't so compelling to you to the extent that it doesn't matter where you end up after you're done, I wouldn't do it. I did my PhD at Stanford and I saw so many bright and talented people strike out on the industry research job market only to settle for \"worse\" jobs, including as data scientists or postdocs. \n\nThat said, you don't have to view the next application cycle as your last chance, as I've seen many people start a PhD in their 30s or 40s or even later.

So on the face of it, I do not think the PhD granting department being math vs CS is a big deal.\n\nHowever, yeah, some of your red flags are red flags. The repayment thing is brutal, attrition in PhD programs is very high and you don't want that hanging over your head. Why isn't it funded with TA or RA positions like a typical STEM PhD? You don't have to pay back your tuition waiver from those. Internships not being allowed is horrible if you're pursuing an industry role.\n\nRegarding your potential PI being new, do they have tenure yet? The last thing you need is your advisor going up for tenure and not getting it, and at least if you're in the US, that's a very real risk these days. I have a few friends from grad school who went the academic route and will be up for tenure soon, and despite playing their cards well, they're all very worried about this.\n\nSo math vs CS, no real worries, but imo you are right to have reservations.",

If you have any friends from college, or friends of a friend, who work in big tech, there's usually a way they can endorse or refer you. That should get you fast-tracked. \n\nGood luck. Like I said, the industry is rough right now. Recruiters got hit pretty hard in the last round of lay-offs and the ones who are left don't have many positions to fill.",
