Before AI was being used widely it was ghost interviewers and people whispering answers or at least typing answers in a screen the interviewee could read. I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it.  There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. \n\nJust last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. \n\nWe had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand the question\". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. \n\nI think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions. Not to \"trick\" the AI, or to somehow catch them in a lie, but to help us understand if they have the basic knowledge we're looking for.",

Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. \n\nWhats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.\n\nSecond Answer:\n\nUse polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.\n\nJust 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.\n\nThe main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

Once you have an initial chunk of code that does what you want, parameterise it and stick it in a function. Then write some tests for it, ideally. A parameterised notebook is not all that different from a very lengthy function. You just want to separate the code in your notebook into functions so that each function is doing a single thing and returning/producing a single thing.\n\nIt will be slower at first because you're rewiring your brain to use a new process and interface, but you'll get faster and the benefits can be great if you're doing anything that's a deliverable and you want some quality assurance.

If someone gave you a process model, can you translate that into technological implementation? Can you translate a process model into a data model?\n\nIf you wanna get better at python, do leetcode exercises and learn data structures and algorithms. By accident, you will learn how to program in general— in any language. The real value is in learn how to think abstractly and creating an algorithm that will solve the business need efficiently and correctly. The brand of language or server is a political opinion or strategic decision (eg: python has the best tooling for DS).\n\nIf you want to learn system design, build a python app from zero, no framework. It'll teach you how to organize code, how to build mental models around your code, separation of concerns, IO, dataflow, system orchestration, deployments, etc. Learn what tools exist within your ecosystem of choice.

Most companies have only a few tools for data engineering, orchestration layer and logic layer. Airflow and databricks for example. Pick a cloud provider, orchestration tool, data lakehouse/warehouse platform and start doing little projects. Like airflow orchestrates databricks notebook that pulls a dataset from azure datalake storage and then run a databricks notebook to convert the file to a delta table. Or durable function pulls API data and writes to bronze layer of databricks. \n\nYou can pick whatever tech you decide I just mentioned those because it’s the route I decided to go down but I also incorporated snowflake just for a more overarching reach. \n\nPython can be learned along the way but it seems a little aimless to just sit down and “learn Python” for something that is as specific as data.engineering",

And more and more SaaS vendors will export data directly to your warehouse, so that you don't really have to build those either. AI will be able to do a lot in terms of glueing that together. \n\nWhere I think data engineers will spend much more of their time in the future is on something much more valuable, actually building data products (internal and external) that derive value from the data. Every org I've worked at wants to be data driven, but the people in the business domains have really weak \"data reasoning skills\". I don't think AI fixes that because it won't help you if you don't know the right questions to ask. So my bet is that you'll have data engineers/scientists/analysts converging more and more into a role where they need to bridge that gap to make all this data we've collected valuable.",

I had skills of a Data Analyst with some DE and DS skills but couldn’t land any job. Eventually through networking and showcasing my projects I now work as Tech Finance Analyst where I am overqualified. But the over qualification matters because I do more work than I should be doing and the over qualification is what’s needed to balance out heavier workload",

The main python asset imports those helpers and then executes the actual logic of batch processing the extraction and loading to our datalake (hive configured).\n\nFor transformations, we have mostly moved away from python to sql since we can directly query external tables created from our hive datalake. But we still sometimes use python for the first layer where the data is weird file formats (like grib, netcdf, etc.) that require special processing - in such cases we read the files, convert to a dataframe, and then materialize it in our dwh. Our data platform's own built-in python materialization automatically handles incremental strategies and variable injections.\n\nThere are also very rare cases where data needs to be processed in a way thats not possible with sql - for example decoding airport weather reports like metar/taf, which require special python libraries to decode.\n\nTo answer your question about frameworks - we write functional code with very minimal object-oriented programming. For my team the rule of thumb is that a single python file/asset should contain all the logic tied to a single data entity/table/model. We never use notebooks (unless for quick local testing and adhoc stuff). In some cases, we extract different data from a single API endpoint, so for those cases we create a separate agent/helper to connect to the API and configure the parameters - this is the only case where we use a bit more oop.",

ClickHouse is a much more efficient engine than BQ query-for-query, but how you optimise your capacity on k8s is veeery different to how you'll have optimised cost on BQ. \n\nE.g. if you're using BQ with on-demand pricing and query infrequently, the cost-per-query would be higher on BQ than CH, but that might still work out cheaper overall than running your own infra 24/7. But if you're running lots of queries consistently throughout the day, that might flip the other way, where the infra overhead is worth it. You need to look at your usage pattern and work that out.",

Don’t go too deep because there’s a lot of technical stuff once you get deep in the docs, but understanding at a basic level the different functionalities is useful. For example, when just writing to a database and you KNOW you’re using a PostgreSQL database, it might be better to use psycopg2 directly instead of calling SQLAlchemy so you have more direct access instead of going through an intermediary. You might also consider adding in some basic orchestration to this project just to demonstrate you’re able and to understand how orchestration is handled. I would also look into how you would want to transform the data. I always recommend Polars over Pandas if you’re going with Python. The new Pandas update to 3.0 provides solid benefits, but the syntax is still very unpythonic and painful for beginners.",

For example if you order by ID, but then query by let’s say first name, performance hit would be be significant.\n\nI would say it’s a very good and cost effective engine, but even the cloud version, there are several “quirks” that you might stumble upon, compared to like snowflake which I would say works out of the box. You’ll extrapolate from this info what that means if you do self hosted.\n\nIt’s a great, cost effective engine (i can go along way with TB of data with a single 16gb instance), but the skill bar is higher in terms of management.",

For actual looping use either (1) do the loop in a driver notebook or (2) keep ADF as the orchestrator and just trigger Databricks jobs. So no, you don’t have to write everything in notebooks, but the foreach part is usually code or external orchestration.\n\nIf you redesign, the main win is fewer tiny jobs and fewer cluster spin-ups. One job run that reads the control table and processes a batch is usually cheaper and faster than 200 little runs. Also, if you are ingesting lots of files, people often go auto loader or DLT to cut orchestration overhead.\n\nAlso lol at being told six hours ago, classic.",

I should build a utility so it can be used for other implementations as well.\n\nEach notebook does a notebook.exit on success or failure and returns a json with relevant pieces of information for audit and easier debugging.\n\nFrom a cost perspective, the batch approach (which I am using right now) should be cheaper than DLT or Autoloader, right ? I am right now going through the DLT and autoloader documentation to see how these can be used to ease up migration.\n\nAgain, really appreciate taking time out to share your experience.",

From there you also need to export each referenced job, crawler, and trigger using `GetJob`, `GetCrawler`, and `GetTrigger`. In the target account, you recreate the workflow with `CreateWorkflow`, then recreate jobs, crawlers, and triggers so the DAG lines back up. This works well for a one-time move, but you still have to fix account specific things like IAM role ARNs, KMS keys, S3 bucket names, connections, and any hard coded account IDs in job arguments.\n\nThe cleaner long-term approach is to turn the workflow into infrastructure as code. Glue workflows and triggers are supported in both CloudFormation and Terraform. Once modeled, you can deploy the same definition to another account with only variable changes for account specific resources. This avoids ever doing a manual rebuild again and is what most teams settle on after the first migration.\n\nIn practice, if this is a one-off accident recovery, scripting against the Glue APIs is usually fastest. If you expect multiple environments or future moves, converting the workflow to CloudFormation or Terraform is the better investment.",

By doing algorithms, not only are they testing your CS knowledge, but also the depth of your thinking and planning, if you only think in terms of solving a problem, but not about efficiency of the solution - that's a problem.\n\nAlgorithms mainly test your understanding of cache, which is low level programming. Data packing, paddings, cache line size, they make you think in how much work does a CPU have to do, in order to solve a real world problem, instead of just - I follow tutorial X to make Y therefore I know how to code. \n\nThere's a lot of code monkeys around who know 15 different frameworks and libs and believe they're great engineers but they don't have a senior understanding of how computer actually works. \n\nI don't even think that you should care about the code editor, or even write the correct synthax, that doesn't show you're a good programmer. You could open a notepad and start coding in an arbitrary language, nobody gives a damn about a language, you and me could write a new programming language tommorow, languages and frameworks change over time, to me personally it doesn't matter. But what matters is what does a candidate **think** about, when solving a problem, what **concerns** do they have. Because that will tell me more about themselves than any learned framework or library or programming language they know. Any programmer can answer almost any **how**, because there's a billion resources out there, but very few can answer **why**",

That is, in a client-server environment where the client runs on a machine controlled by somebody other than you, you must always assume that the client can be compromised.\n\nThat means the client can do whatever they want with everything in your static files and everything that's returned from every API endpoint. If there are particular kinds of data that only specific users should be able to read/write, then that **must** be carefully enforced on the backend.\n\nWhen you write any kind of frontend code, you're essentially sending it to users and asking them nicely to run it as-is. Ordinary users will do so (or rather, their browsers will). Attackers will ignore it and do whatever they want.\n\n(Corollary: if the user themselves is not malicious, but their client machine has been compromised by somebody else or by malware, then there isn't much you can do to protect them. The best you can do is protect yourself and other users from their attack.)",

For all of you who are learning, if you're ever using a service and that service gives you an api key, token, or other secret to use in calling it... it's time to learn proper practices in using secrets.\n\nHere is the OWASP cheat sheet for secrets management [Secrets Management - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html) It might not be totally comprehensive, but it's a good start!\n\nGive it a read, if you're still confused about anything come back to this subreddit and ask a question.\n\nIf you're the type to be writing tutorials or guides on how to use services that have api keys, please add warnings for your users. It's so easy for a new developer to be tempted to rip insecure code out and put it into production.

Almost every interview now requires very deep knowledge across many technologies, some ask for “LeetCode” stats and want to see code for projects you’ve been working on, or they’ll make you code on the spot, and unless you’ve been doing this for years, you’re going to get absolutely dunked on. I’m still hanging on by a thread where I currently work, but they’ve cut down our department by at least 70% and we no longer hire juniors for any position (not something I agree with, but just the reality, at least where I work).\n\nFurthermore, since there have been so many layoffs that means competition for positions is incredibly high, so you’re going to compete against people like me who are industry vets, as well as younger people with advanced degrees, etc.\n\nIt might be worth diving into if it’s something you’re truly interested in, and hell, maybe it will end up working out for you, but I’d definitely have a backup plan.\n\nI wish you luck no matter what you choose,",

If you have an idea to extend it, *append* it to the document, but do not yet even think about implementing it. Get the basic functionality working first. All that you append is \"optional\".\n\nThe key to everything is the FDS. The more time and consideration you spend on it, the better you plan, the easier it will become to implement.\n\nVague specifications help nobody and lead only to the block you describe.\n\n> someone suggested tools that help you plan before coding. tried verdent and a few others.\n\nDedicated tools are not necessary. A simple text editor, or a proper text processor (like Word, Libre/OpenOffice Write, Google Documents) are all you need to get started. Don't overthink the tooling here. The more specialized a tool is, the more time you have to spend *learning* it, the less you can focus on the actual *content*. Simpler is better in that case.\n\n>  theres so many decisions before you write a single line\n\nAnd this is exactly what is necessary. The better you plan, the better your outcome.\n\n*Code* is the unimportant part of programming. It's only a necessary evil that we need to tell the computer what we want it to do. The *planning*, the *decisions*, the *considerations* are what really count.\n\n*Code* can be implemented by every \"code monkey\", but *planning* is what makes a *software engineer/designer*.\n\nI can give a well prepared FDS to somebody who can write code, but doesn't understand anything about the type of software I want to make and they will be able to program it.\n\nYet, there isn't a detailed FDS, even the best programmer will be completely lost.\n\n-----\n\nWhere you actually start, at the database, at the main functionality, is a different matter and often preference.\n\nI like to start with the database so that I have my fundamental construct.\n\nThen, I work on the main entry point of the program - this is the very first actual *code* that I write - it's sort of the \"ice breaker\".\n\nThe biggest hurdle is always the first line, the first few statements. After that, the flow becomes natural. Yet, of course, this requires experience, and it will get easier with gained experience.\n\n----\n\nAs always with similar posts, some books to consider:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold",

You already made a partial \"list\" in your post. And then implement these one by one. Does not matter if you make a UI first, a database first or a backend/API first. Then it is just however you test that the thing works, it differs. With database you have to use SQL queries. With API you have to use REST calls (unless you use something other besides REST). etc. The order does not matter in your case.\n\nYes, there is a system design and architecture and such in real life projects and some things do have an order, but you are just figuring out how to implement a thing and how a stuff works. Do not consider how the things are done in the real life. Before you haven't made a working app.\n\nAnd yes, there are many decisions before you write a single line. The same way there are many decisions before you lay the first brick when building a house. You can't just lay bricks anywhere you want or however you want. Software development has a planning phase. But this is where the splitting it all into pieces and putting into a list comes in. Why I mentioned it in my first paragraph. Create a list of achievable micro-goals and start implementing these one by one. \n\nYour app is an \"app\" (e.g. a mobile app)? Cool. Pick some totally random tutorial for getting the most barebones mobile app up and running. If it is not an \"app\" as a mobile app but a web application then pick a simple \"Hello world\" web application tutorial, to get it to return \"Hello world\" when run. If your application has a graphical side then get whichever \"canvas\" type working first. And then just add features on that canvas.",

Others have suggested specific design document formats but I think the most important thing is to have something you can use to guide your programming. It should be detailed and specific enough that you could hand it to an experienced programmer and they’d have enough information to start implementing.\n\nI’d also suggest having a concept of an “MVP”, or “minimum viable product”. What’s the absolute minimum set of features that constitute a version of the idea that you’d be happy with? Start with that, add the rest of your ideas afterwards.\n\nI personally find that it’s easiest to start with something that I can actually see working, so for example in your budgeting app you can start with a page that displays your budget overview. Where does the budget information come from? Don’t worry about that yet, just add some hard-coded numbers. Once you’ve done that pick a number that you want to be “real” and build that, hooking it up to the UI. Now you have one real field and a bunch of fake ones. Pick another field to actually implement.

I had to swap to a different library and luckily (this time!) my code did not contain many assumptions about how the graphics work, so the swap was relatively pain free. \n\n**Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate:** \n\nE.g.: \n\n* The app tells me how much money I have left. \n* I enter something I have bought.\n* I enter something I wish to buy.\n* What I have bought has a name and a price.\n\nYou can think of these as questions you need to answer. If you were the budget planner for a large organisation, there would be questions people would continuously ask you. If you wrote those down and for every question you wrote down how come you know the answers, you would have the beginnings of a system.\n\nReal processes used by real people can tell you a lot about what your app must be able to handle. If you start with \"I would like a steak cooked by a Michelin level chef\" you are probably going to get there slower than if you start with \"what goes into a really good steak and who can tell me this?\"\n\n**Identify then build the core functionality first:**\n\nIf you want to start a website that can handle a billion requests per second, start with the code the takes then dispatches the requests (load balancers). For a much quieter website you would probably tackle other tasks first.\n\nIf you want to make a game in which you fly a space ship, fight pirates and trade goods, make sure the ship handles well (i.e. the interface in which the user spends 95% of their time). \n\nFiguring out what the core functionality is though can be the real brainteaser.\n\nIf there are parts of your app that are a known quantity (i.e. others have already solved this bit and documented their solutions) and parts that are not, the latter might be a good candidate. What is your USP, what makes your app stand out from the others?\n\nExample: [how the video game Lemmings was designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5-lH3lZqrg) (YT, 4 mins).",

I've been assured by every exec ever that anyone can build apps with LLMs now... /s\n\nAssuming we're talking web applications, after I've got the spec/requirements down I've always liked to start with the data. So I will usually design database schemas to 3NF and write the DDL. I can then use this to bring up a database instance. Then I write a quick DML seeding script. Then I put together a server application in whatever language I've chosen. I've been around a while so I've written a good few auth/perm systems so I have code for that in JS/PHP which is usually what I'm using. Then I work on the back end API, adding things I need as I go (e.g. job queues, caching, etc.) Finally, I put the client together (personally my least favourite part, maybe why I do it last if it's me doing it). \n\nThere's usually no reason you need to do back/front in any particular order and it's common to do them in parallel too (different teams etc.). I do think that starting with the data, which flows through the entire app, adds a certain clarity and certainty to things, but really anything goes if you don't mind lots of going back to revise.\n\nMy \"plan\" is usually my thinking beforehand and any diagrams I've doodled, as we don't create formal design docs as part of our process. We gather requirements, write software, document the result. I will put effort into writing a technical design doc if I'm handing it off entirely though. I basically short-circuit the written spec part if I'm also the implementer.\n\nFor a personal project, I think the answer is to just think, and make whatever notes/doodles you feel are necessary. How do you want to distribute/deliver it to users? What data is needed at what point? What interactions? How do you want interactions to go? How do you want it to look? Do you need common things that a framework would be able to provide? Etc.\n\nThings that you haven't considered will usually present themselves. Things you have considered will change. If you understand how everything works it all comes together as you work on it more, so my main advice is to be clear enough about what you want that you can start work, and then start writing code.",

Scripting languages tend to be more forgiving of certain issues, but can hide bugs that should have been caught sooner. It's quite easy to write python code that will blow up at runtime and your IDE won't tell you. It's also possible to do this in Java, but between the compiler and IDE tooling, it's harder to have this happen, and you likely have IDE warnings about it.",

I spent so long doing boring tutorials and then quitting because I had no interest and the combo of boring work + difficult work made getting into the flow very difficult. So what I did was start a new project (it's a console-based resource-grinding game with some light story set in The Elder Scrolls universe) and starting very small with just some dialogue and choices. I set up a Trello board and broke all my tasks into \"main quests\" and \"side quests\" (things I'd like to do but are on the backburner) and broke them down into SUPER small pieces. That has given me nice dopamine hits when I get to check off those tasks as complete. It's also way more interesting to me because I love games, and this is something I actually look forward to playing myself when I get it into a more complete or at least MVP state.\n\nAlso, (this may be controversial) using AI to talk through the issue or design I'm thinking off. Not ***ever*** using it to solve the problem or make me code, but rather \"I want to do X in my project, give me a word or two I can google to start my search\" so I have something specific to look up on Stack Overflow or the Ruby docs. That way when I get stuck I'm not just banging my head against the wall because I'm not even sure what to search, I have some breadcrumbs that get me started but I'm never actually relying on the AI to code for me or even give me the full answer.\n\nI work at a large tech company and those are the tips that a programmer friend gave me and I've been finding so much more success in the last few weeks than ever before :)",

You spend years slowly spiralling your knowledge and understanding of a topic over years, probably for 12 or 13 years at the minimum. As such, when you are introduced to a 'new topic', it's 98% old knowledge. It is built on structures where a lot of the new thinking is given to you and slowly removed bit by bit until you are doing it yourself. This teaches you are taught that learning isn't really too hard, and you should be succeeding almost immediately before moving to the next topic. \n\nWhen you learn something novel it's not a slow progression over years, it's probably a logistics function of logistic functions for each topic. That is, the initial concept is pretty easy, then it becomes hard as fuff where you feel like an idiot for ages, but you eventually learn the concept and it gets easy. But, because you are constantly learning, at no point do you ever feel like a master, or even competent. \n\nI firmly believe that 'good' programmers are people who accept that they will always struggle stuff that they are just learning and can realise exactly how much they've learned. \n\nSo, what's the lesson for you?\n\n- Accept that you might need to take smaller steps, and that's okay. \n- After you learn something, make your own version of the questions/problems, and solve them as well. If you can't do that, go back to their questions and just change one small thing (like a variable) and write down what you think will change when you run it and then run it. Document if it runs the way you thought, and if it doesn't, keep playing until you get it. Then move to two things, then as many things as you can. \n- Think back to other things you've learned and ask yourself if you can incorporate those things as well, if so (and you probably can), make your own versions of those problems. \n\nYou'll likely find that giving yourself that space to learn how to solve those problems will mean that the next step will be easier.",

The level of complexity in restaurant POS systems (in terms of the full suite of features they offer and the level of customization that is possible) is pretty wild. If we ever do try to build our own POS, we would need to scale up our team significantly.\n\nMaybe you can find success if you identify some niche, are very opinionated with exactly which features should exist and how things should be done, and then successfully convince restaurants that your approach is worth it. But to go head to head with the big players in the space, there’s so much scope you are going to need to handle just to get to the point where your POS is sniffing anywhere close to feature parity… I just don’t see one or two people pulling it off.",

And once you have gone through the basics, anything more advanced you want to know will be applicable to your specific project, and you can always find either articles or videos, or most of the time, just look at example projects.\n\nWhat I think is the hardest part of learning React is not writing all the syntax, or memorizing all the different hooks, but simply getting an idea of WHY you create variables with useState rather than plain variables, WHY you use props or contexts, WHY you need routes, etc. And Codecademy, Freecodecamp and all the rest suck at explaining the WHYs, even when they are excellent at demonstrating the HOWs.\n\nSo I wouldn't have expected much better than your experience, but thank you for sharing anyways, as it might encourage others to skip those kind of courses!",

The best way is to do both Jonas course and Odin project side by side else you'll get stuck in tutorial hell.\n\nIf you think your teacher is using old way(it is always going to happen) just start building with latest way and navigate through errors. For eg- In react course Jonas intentionally uses \"create-react-app\" which is deprecated now but at that point if you've gone through js+odin you should be comfortable enough in this world to look up and use vite.",

Took 1 year to find first IT job, 2 years to find first dev job. I was in similar shoes and my advice is what i've done.\n\n>I started posting on Twitter and committing to GitHub, but obviously nobody is watching. I don’t know if I’m supposed to keep doing this until someone magically finds me or if I’m doing it wrong.\n\nIs networking just talking to people online? Is it internships? Is it Discord servers? LinkedIn? Meetups? Or is it just something people say for the sake of saying? Networking is getting out and talking to people, not shooting messages into the avoid and hoping someone looks at your social media and goes \"this kids a genius\", thats not networking.\n\nYou need to find meetup groups in your area and start attending, meetup.com. This is a good way to get out there but with networking, you get out what you put in.\n\nIf you just go, attend, and don't talk to anyone, no ones going to know who you are / what you are doing tech wise and what you're looking for. So if you aren't socially outgoing, start working on that.\n\n>I kind of feel like I wasted most of college procrastinating. Now I’m doing DSA and web dev, but its late-very late and I know it. Also I’m from a tier 3 college and people keep saying if you’re from a tier 3 college you basically HAVE to network or no one will even know you exist, so no one will give you a chance.\n\nI had similar experience, didn't do internships, didn't really hit my stride until my senior year of college when things started clicking for me and i felt like i was finally getting it. So the issue is jobs currently want experience / proof that you have some semblance that you know what you are doing. You're not going to like this but my suggestion to you is to work for free for a while.\n\nYou can either keep shooting resume's into the void for months / a year plus on end hoping for the best or you can get the experience you need to set you apart from your peers at similar points in your career.\n\nSure, you'll find the rare hiring manager that says \"i dont care about experience, i just want them to be curious\", in reality a lot of hiring managers are kind of dumb, don't know what they want, and just pray they don't hire an idiot and the best way to do that is to find someone that has proven experience.\n\nAssuming you can build / deploy an app (i tutored college students online and you'd be surprised at the number of students who could barely build something in their senior year much less know how to deploy it), I would start with chamber of commerce website for cities near you that you'd be willing to drive to if necessary. So call it a 25-50 mile radius.\n\nFrom there, look for non-profits and call up their volunteer coordinator and see if they have any needs / opportunities to build software / automate something that they don't have the money/expense to spend on. Off the shelf software / monthly subscription based software isn't as expensive as it was when i graduated these days so maybe they are more inclined to pay for services these days, but you'd be surprised the shoe string budgets some of these nonprofits operate on.\n\nOften times they are taking paper applications and manually retyping it back into a computer which wastes time. They setup temporary shelters and take intake on paper where if they had a laptop there, they'd cut that part out.\n\nLook at rec leagues in your area and see if any of these rec leagues have a need for software to manage teams/schedules/rosters. Some leagues barely have enough money to run the league itself much less any extras so they manage the league in spreadsheets. \n\n1/2",

The problem is that design has been so maligned that few people even study it anymore, and after you study it you need to gain skill in it by doing a few projects, and projects that actually involve designing as any step (before or after) are so few and far between that you get \"shooting from the hip\" designs that are often inconsistent and difficult to use, if you get them at all.\n\nAPIs are supposed to be the most stable portions of integration.

Therefore, if I can stick the whole game in 1 file, then that's all it will take, and I organize the classes and methods based on what gets called first in the render method. I remove all need for fancy features, such as special effects, game-ending scripts, and features that don't add to the product's goal, such as cosmetics, unless they unlock the exact feature or mechanic I am trying to highlight. Hope this makes sense. So I will end up with a game that just plays, and that's all. No fancy features, lol. No finishing the game yet, either. Just a fully featured game without any effects, or a game that just plays your core-gameplay loop. Amen and selah.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck with all your endeavors. Peace and love.",

        "body": "I learned C from books because I am old. ;) But more seriously: check the library for an intro to C textbook. Every one I've ever seen was at least a good intro.\n\nI wouldn't be too worried about being embarrassed in labs about beginner mistakes; that's what class is for. If you already knew C, the class wouldn't be helpful.\n\nRelative to other languages, it helps to understand C's memory model, because it's a lot closer to what actually happens under the hood in the computer and getting confused about it is the source of a lot of errors. \n\nSo, in C, you have two places data is stored in memory: the stack and the heap. The stack is where any variables in your functions live. If you say `int number = 5;`, that puts a `5` on the stack (hey folks who actually know C: yes, I know about registers, keeping it simple to start with, yeah?). Generally, stuff on the stack lives there until the function returns, then *everything* on the stack for that function goes away. That's all the variables you declared in your function and everything passed into the function (all the stuff passed into a function, the function gets a copy of).\n\nThe heap is where longer-lived stuff goes. You get a chunk of heap by going `int* pointer_to_number = malloc(sizeof(int));`. That gives you some int-sized chunk of memory somewhere, and what `malloc` actually returns is a *pointer* to that memory. Now, `pointer_to_number` is a variable (on the stack) that holds an address of something in the heap. You can treat the pointer like a number (if you try to print it and tell print \"it's a number,\" for example, it'll just be the memory address where the data is stored). If you want to modify the data on the heap, you can go `*pointer_to_number = 13;`. The star there means \"I want to mess with the stuff pointed to, not the pointer itself.\" If you wanted to change what the pointer points to, you could go `pointer_to_number = pointer_to_some_other_number;`. Note the lack of a star.\n\nNow here's the place where people get messed up most often: C has no way to know when you're done with the memory `malloc` gave you. It needs *you* to tell it that. So when you're all done with the memory you got handed, you call `free(pointer_to_number);`. That will say to the memory manager \"Hey, that pointer you malloc'd me awhile back? All done with it; something else can use that memory.\" If you forget to do that, when your function returns and the variables holding the pointer go away, the pointed-to memory can't be found anymore and you \"leaked\" it; that memory is stuck with a 'used' flag on it and nobody else can use it.\n\nThe other thing about C is that it's a language with few 'guardrails' and makes it very easy to screw up the memory model or machine state. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you probably just break the memory manager and it'll do screwy stuff in your program from that point forward (modern operating systems give every program its own copy of `malloc` itself so you can't break the *whole computer's* state that way; worst-case-scenario, you can always quit the program and when it terminates all the memory it was using is properly given back to the operating system, including anything `malloc`'d). If you `malloc` a small amount of memory and then try to cram something big in there, C will cheerfully write the big thing past the end of the memory you reserved and clobber whatever's in the next chunk of memory. If you take a pointer to something on the stack (using the `&` operator) and then try to hold onto that pointer and then return from the function where that stack-thing lives, it'll get freed but your pointer will still be around and now it's pointing to the wrong thing. And probably the biggest foot-gun in the language: strings are just pointers to the first character of the string, so if you `malloc` some memory to hold a string and then forget now much you malloc'd and write a longer string than will fit in that memory, you will rip right into some other data in memory squirting random characters into it and you'll have a bad time.\n\nIn a lot of ways, C is *way* simpler than other languages. That simplicity puts a lot of complexity on you, the user.",

That way, we didn't have to deal with re-pointing nameservers, changing billing, or other nonsense (usually, biggest issue was stuck caches).\n\nThe clients that didn't have an existing host service I would recommend use the host I had been using who - at the time - had good rates, solid customer service team. I...don't think I'd recommend them as enthusiastically today.\n\nHow they want to pay is up to them; usually yearly got a discount, 3 years even further, 5 years a crazy discount. They set up the payments, I didn't want to get involved with that.\n\nWhen working on sites my contract broke the project estimate into a series of phases. Work on each phase wouldn't begin until a down payment was received, and I wouldn't start on a subsequent phase until the previous phase had been paid in full. That always seemed to be the safest - breaking a site into, say, 3 phases, with incremental payments. Better than working for 2 months on a $15k job only to find out the client never intended to pay me.",

If programming just feels like doing homework or meaningless exercises (like Path C sometimes can), I think sometimes people lose motivation before they've really gotten into it.\n\nI would say, be cautious about Unity or Godot since those are generally more 'intermediate' than beginner level. Your intuition to start with something like Ren'Py is a good idea. I'd also recommend Game Maker since it's even easier to get started with something fun/playable (though it uses a slightly weird programming language that's not useful anywhere else). Pygame and Love2D are also popular although maybe a little outdated at this point.",

If you were learning to program as an undergrad CS student, there'd almost certainly be a course in your second or third year that would involve writing a simple HTTP server in C (hint: implement HTTP 1.0, not 1.1, it's way easier).\n\nThere's something really cool about having something you're already familiar with, like your web browser, having a real, successful conversation with an app that you wrote from scratch, and displaying some cool result.\n\nThe exact mechanics of how to implement will wildly vary by language, but really understanding what ports and sockets and addresses and listening and such mean is very helpful, and the concepts will transfer as you move between languages.\n\nThere are lots of famous textbooks in this space. The Tanenbaum is probably the most famous, that's \"Computer Networks\" by Andrew Tanenbaum.\n\nThere are also many great college courses covering computer networking with all of their lectures and assignments posted online. Simply going through one at your own pace may be a great way to get an expensive education for free (excepting the benefits of being able to ask questions). Good example: [https://sp26.cs168.io/](https://sp26.cs168.io/)\n\nOne thing to be aware of: writing HTTP servers quickly starts to involve parallelization and running multiple threads, and then it becomes partly about memory sharing and memory management, and then you're learning about mutexes, and pretty soon you'll find that learning networking quickly begins to overlap with learning systems programming and operating systems. This is a good thing, but it can be somewhat confusing how books on operating systems will often seem to be about web serving, and vice versa.",

Maybe the problem is that you try to \"translate\" your code. It's probably better to not just translate it line by line but to think about what objects there will be and how they communicate. Calling a method is how that works in OOP. And they can have side effects. \n\nThere are books. Some of them are bad many are outdated. The problem is mostly that they spend a lot of time on inheritance of state because it's so problematic. That chapter has to be in the book, but it should just be about what you prevent as much as possible. And beginners think because there's so much about it in the book it  must be important. \n\nYou probably need a type for each expression in your syntax tree. You could use an abstract class as a base that has a field for the token(s) from the tokenizer. But you really don't need this. Just design each class as a final class and it's a lot simpler.  Use \"record\" instead of \"class\" for immutable types. \"permits\" on your types when you know the subtypes.",

Then whenever you want to add, you pass the integer in the array to the function pointed to in the array. *This is called a field and a method*.\n\nThis is an oversimplification.

Since you already like Python, do something like Flask + SQLite + plain HTML forms. No Bootstrap, no APIs, no frontend frameworks, no auth, no deployment. Just one page to list items, one to add, one to edit, one to delete. That’s enough to learn routing, templates, forms, validation, and a simple database loop.\n\nAlso, flip the ratio back to mostly coding. You only need enough reading to unblock the next tiny step. Web dev only starts to feel sane once you’ve built the same basic flow a couple times and the jargon attaches to something real.",

Now before this I was fine learning Python\n\nSorry, but you haven't really started *learning*. 2 months is nothing in terms of learning programming (in fact, in learning anything).\n\nYou will need to have way more patience and stop jumping subjects.\n\nWith 2 months in, you barely scratched the surface of Python and moved on to web dev already. Way too fast. You suffer \"shiny object syndrome\" - jump from one thing to the next without actually learning anything *in depth*. With this approach you will get nowhere.\n\nYes, there is a lot to learn and the learning never ends in programming, no matter what domain you take.\n\nThe way to go is to not look at the vast amount that is there, but to look at what is next, just like when climbing a mountain, you don't look at the summit but at the next step, at the path ahead.\n\nTake a *solid course*, not random youtube videos.\n\nFor web dev:\n\n+ [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org)\n+ [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)\n\nand later [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)\n\nFor Python, we commonly recommend the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.\n\n> The barrier to entry level is very high for a beginner like me. \n\nNo, it actually isn't. *You* made it high because of jumping around.  As I've said already: stick to one thing and learn it in depth.\n\nLearning anything is not a sprint. It is a marathon where slow and steady wins the race. You cannot speedrun learning.\n\nFor Python alone it takes upward of 6 months to become somewhat proficient yet far from competent, experienced, and good.\n\nFor web dev, you can learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS in about one or two months and then it takes another good 6 months with JavaScript and to puzzle everything together. Give 2 years and you become somewhat competent.\n\n> I've spent 80% of my time basically studying on paper everything, and 20% actually coding anything\n\nThat's the reverse ratio to what you should be doing: 70 to 80% practice, 20 to 30% theory.\n\nYou can only learn through active practice, not through reading.",

In those days we wrote out the entire program on paper, ran through it (still on paper) assigning numbers to variables, etc, to do the best we could to simulate its operation.  Why?  Because the program had to be typed onto punch cards and fed into a card reader, then run usually overnight.  You'd get a printout with a mass of compiler errors the next day, look at the various other reports, mark up the printout, and repeat until it ran correctly. \n\nThe point of telling you this is that it took such a long time to get computer output that we did everything we could to ensure that our logic and syntax were succinct and correct before submitting a job.  So we used flow charts, pseudo code,  walk-through discussions, and anything else we could think of.  This mental exercise made writing code in different languages relatively easy.  As you know, that's mostly syntax and punctuation.\n\nSo I would recommend that you try programming without a computer.  Say, with a book of algorithms (Maybe Cormen? I haven't read it.), or [a book on threaded interpretive language](https://archive.org/details/R.G.LoeligerThreadedInterpretiveLanguagesTheirDesignAndImplementationByteBooks1981)s -- build yourself a FORTH-like compiler -- or join a number of folks from the 80's and build a C compiler.  If that sounds interesting, you might want to read this: [Has anyone read \"Writing a C Compiler\" by Nora Sandler?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1lu9sjd/has_anyone_read_writing_a_c_compiler_by_nora/)\n\nHope this helps.",

Linux without a display server is still capable of drawing on a screen. Just try installing raspberry pi os lite and then plugging it into a monitor, you will still get output.\n\n- So I want to learn how to make linux system calls and learn C by working through two advanced books, culminating in a project where I make a simple game that only uses direct system calls and writes directly to the screens frame buffer, pixel by pixel, for output.",

That said, I still stand by my comment that if you think you are \"up for it\", then \"go for it\".\n\nThis is more of a \"being on the same page\" when we are talking about system calls.\n\nBack in the day, when I did assembler programming on MS-DOS systems, system calls was pretty much the only option available. I also had to do this on some proprietary operating systems such as TMX (which was an NCR proprietary OS running on M68K CPUs).\n\nIt was a PIA. Back then, in MS-DOS, the interface was pretty straightforward, but tedious.\n\nSystem calls are pretty basic as you are directly invoking functions that the underlying operating system supports - for example, openning, reading, writing and other file operations. Or, forking the current process and replacing the image with a new image (fork and execute). Terminate this process and other \"basic\" operations.\n\nIn DOS, you setup the parameters in various CPU registers and invoked a software interrupt (INT 0x21 if memory serves).\n\nLinux is very similar.\n\nIf running on Intel hardware, there is a special instruction `syscall` (added in Pentium class CPUs I believe) that is used in place of the INT 0x21, but you still have to set up the CPU registers.\n\nPerhaps have a look at this: https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/linux-constants/syscalls/#x86_64-64-bit\n\nThe CPU registers that need to be set are listed at the head of the table,\n\nNote that there are no \"graphics\" system calls - I don't know how this would work, I imagine it is some sort of IPC between your process and a kernel driver which manages the display hardware. IPC could include any combination of:\n\n* Shared memory (shmget, shmat ...).\n* Semaphores (semget, semop, semctl),\n* Message Queues (msgget, msgsnd, msgrcv...).\n* Pipes (pipe, mkfifo, open, read, write...)\n* Signals which operate like interrupts (kill, signal, sigaction...)\n\nand possibly others. But the same thing would apply, there would be some mechanism (defined by the driver) that defines how parameters are supplied and functions invoked.\n\nIf you want to learn system calls (and the above is what you are talking about), you might try doing some basic File I/O using the system calls, perhaps some IPC between two processes that you create (and thus know the protocol being used for them talk to each other) - perhaps a simple command interpreter that can accept commands, fork and exec a sub process.",

Once i is no longer < 8, it stops looping. Worth noting that it's starting at 1 because we already set max equal to [0] so there's no reason to check numbers[0].\n\n>if (numbers[i] > max) //so, if 'numbers' is greater than 'numbers'? How does the [i] factor in here? What exactly is happening when we add the square brackets containing an 'i' to a variable?\n\nUsing the [] brackets is checking at a specific spot in the array. [0] is the first one, [1] is the second, etc. If you had a string array named \"numbers\", it'd look like this:\n[0] = n, [1] = u, [2] = m, etc\n\nSo we're adding a check to see if the part of the \"numbers\" array is currently bigger than the initial number (we first set max at the top to the first element) and in further iterations, it will replace it with wherever we currently are in the loop. E.g. if numbers[1] is bigger than numbers[0], max will be set to numbers[1]. If numbers[2] is not bigger, it skips the \"max = numbers[i]\" line. It keep repeating this until we're done looking through the \"numbers\" array.\n\n> return max;\n\nAt the end of the loop, it returns \"max\" with whatever the largest value should have been set to during all of the loop iterations and exits the function \"findMaxNumbers\".\n\n\nOverall CSS and HTML are not really comparable to actual programming languages so it's likely you just haven't ever actually learned fundamentals.

Devs are more concerned with how manageable, scalable, and flexible the code is.\n\nFor example, if you were to add a new feature later down the road (which is not uncommon), how easy would you be able to implement it without having to rewrite everything? There is where things like SOLID principles come in, such that applying those principles in your code design would generally make your code more robust.\n\nFor example, suppose you wanted to implement abilities.\n\nYou can certainly create every skill as its own class for example. An AttackSkill, a GuardSkill, a FireballSkill, and so on, such that when you execute a skill, your code can handle them uniformly and if certain skills have some unique properties, you could just override some parent logic and it probably just works.\n\nOr perhaps you might decide you only need a Skill class which takes an ID that references a table that describes the properties of the skill itself (eg: damage formula, animation, use conditions, etc).\n\nBoth approaches are valid, and certainly allow you to add new skills to your game without too much extra work.\n\nIf your game has complex skill interactions, it may be necessary to implement every skill defined by its own subclass because you have special logic for all of them. Perhaps you might come up with a custom \"skill effect\" syntax where you write them out in a text file and the game simply interprets it as you go.\n\nThere is no particular right answer. Try different approaches and compare the pros and cons of each of them. Maybe you'll get some insight that you can use for future code design.",

In most regions you don't get many roles that use these frameworks for backend work though as Python isn't commonly used for this type of work. That's not to say that you won't find places that use them, but they are definitely loss common.\n\nJava, C# and Node are much more commonly used for backend work.\n\nMost roles are full-stack to some degree, but if you want to prioritise backend, the best suggestion is to look at the job adverts in your nearby area. Tech stacks are not spread evenly and you might find that there are lot more Java roles in your nearby area, or you might find more C# roles etc etc..",

Now C++ is an excellent language to start that learning process.    You would want to use C++ through the part of a program that leads to understanding and the creation of data structures such as link lists and more advanced features.\n\nThe idea is to understand the underlying concepts from simple things like loops, data types and other beginner ideas.   At this point you are using C++ to investigate the concepts.   Actually learning C++ well and becoming conversant in the language is an entirely different issue and frankly takes years of study and practice.    \n\nAt some point in your Computer Science study you should also be starting in on a second language.    Python is a good option here, but if platform specified programming is in your future, the common language for the platform.   For example Swift for Apple's products.   Don't stop with C++ for now.",

Do \"git pull --rebase\" to apply your colleague's changes over your changes. Solve possible merge conflicts. Ensure that all the tests pass locally. This should ensure that your first commit works and your colleague's commit works. Contact him if the conflict is too difficult, to understand reasoning behind his changes.\n\nIf you did any changes in fixing merge conflict then commit these. Don't push.

On the entity level, you only talk about relations between entities, not how you model that in Java or in the database. This distinction is important precisely because the materialisation may end up completely different than the logical view.\n\nNext, ownership. Ownership is a special case relationship that usually isn't really fully expressed in ER lingo. What we mean is: the owned object must not exist without exactly one owner. The owner controls the lifetime of the owned entity and must delete it or move it to a different owner if the owner is deleted. The reverse relationship may be of a weaker kind. Most many-to-one relationships are just to look something up in the parent, but in many cases you can throw those out by not having the logic on the child element.\n\nFor real teams and tournaments you wouldn't have an ownership here because teams can outlive the tournament. Both would be full business objects that can exist independently.\n\nNow, that's the logical entity view, but you still have to materialise that in Java and the database. And that's where the trouble starts. If you simply give both Tournament and Team a slot of the respective other type, you can not handle them atomically any more. You need to create both and then link them. You need to break up the links before you delete them. This gives you all manner of nasty chicken-and-egg problems when dealing with constraints and temporal integrity of your data, so we usually avoid it where possible. It's even worse in the database, because now you can't but referential constraints on your data any more - again, because it needs to be in an inconsistent state for a very short time.\n\nIt's even worse in languages with a ref-counted garbage collector. There, the GC will simply count how many times an object is referenced by others and so these circular references will leak memory if not broken up manually. Luckily Java's GC is not ref-counted, so that's one problem less.\n\nWhat you usually do for your specific problem is to move logic away from dependent entities. If teams cannot exist independently and you need information of the tournament, then the logic that acts on them should take the tournament and the team and sit outside of your entities as some sort of service actor.\n\nThat of course would mean that any api endpoint working on players would need all three ids, which is stupid. Luckily that's where the separation of entity and database model helps us. Because one-to-many relations are usually stored inverted in the database anyway, in the database each team knows its tournament directly. In the entity view it does not. So instead of calling an accessor in Java to let JPA fetch the relation, you take a tiny detour and ask the database to look up the tournament (likely through a native SQL or similar query method anyway, but the thought counts!). That way your entity model can model ownership unidirectionally while the database can do what it does best.",

        "body": "At the moment, it's hard to give solid recommendations on how to best structure your data. We don't know what operations you want your program to support (what 'verbs' you want). This in turn makes it challenging to figure out the best way of representing your data (what 'nouns' you need).\n\nI think this is a common trap for beginners: you start with nouns, trying to create a 'model' of some real-world scenario you're looking at. But instead, you should start with the 'verbs' you need and work backwards to figure out what you need to build to support those actions.\n\nAnyways, without further context, in this scenario I'd probably set up a SQL database to be the source of truth for your teams/players/etc -- maybe sqlite to start, to keep things simple? I would then run sql queries to perform steps like 'grab a list of all players belonging to team X during tournament Y'. There are two advantages to this:\n\n1. This side-steps your problem, since you can grab data in exactly the shape you need for each distinct operation, instead of being locked into one specific one. (In this case, your `tournament -> {teams, players}` shape)\n2. More generally, it gives us maximal flexibility in cases where my verbs are unknown.\n\nIf you want to stick with your current structure, I would perhaps consider changing Tournament no longer store 'Player' objects and instead have those be stored under 'Teams'. The 'Tournament' class can then implement helper methods that iterate over teams to return an iterator or list of all players.\n\nThough granted, this is not perfect either, since a team could potentially belong to multiple tournaments, and a player could belong to multiple teams over time... To support this in full generality, you would most likely end up creating your own 'querier' abstraction -- basically a database, or something conceptually similar to it. So, we're back at square 1.\n\n> Is avoiding bidirectional relationships between domain entities generally considered best practice in this case?\n\nBidirectional dependencies are usually suspect, yeah. It's not always a problem, but it's usually a sign that some common functionality could be refactored out, or that the 'shape' of the data is not quite clean. Having to keep both directions in sync is a bit cumbersome and potentially error-prone, and it's better to design our code to avoid having to do it if possible.\n\n> Is it more idiomatic to allow Team to hold direct Player references and rely on invariants to maintain consistency, or to keep entities decoupled and move cross-entity logic into a service/manager layer?\n\nIf the data is fully immutable -- never changing after it's first created -- I'd probably be ok with allowing both Team and Tournaments to hold player references. To make this work, you'd want your 'Tournament' object to be a fixed snapshot of a specific point in time instead of the source of truth and handle updates separately.\n\nBut if it's mutable, then I would prefer to avoid having duplicate references to reduce the odds of human error, where you accidentally break some invariant. (After all, the best invariant is no invariant.)\n\nThat said, it's sometimes useful to have duplicate references in cases where it would materially simplify your algorithms or improve performance. But we would need to understand the desired verbs of your program first before exploring this path.",

If a team holds a reference to a tournament, does that mean a team can only play in one tournament? Or does the reference mean the \"current tournament that the team is playing in\"? If so, what does it mean to get player ratings with respect to the current tournament? Is a player's ratings dependent on which tournament the team is currently playing in?\n\nI feel that based on these two observations, there might be an issue with the overall design.",

It might help if you speak in person, reach out to them somehow, or curate quick projects related to them. \n\n\nContinue your learning as you dedicate that time. If you don't want to learn for free, attempt to build things that can generate revenue, freelance, get a contracting gig, make the jump to open source, or offer your services to spruce up small local company sites. Otherwise, get used to building for fun as your skills improve. Carpenters don't get better by simply working for cash. They build a lot of things. You're a builder/maintainer now. \n\n\nTarget skills related to the job type you're looking for. You might want to search for \"essential skills for getting a fullstack job\" and see how you size up. What you suggested as a learning path isn't what I see hiring managers focus on. \n\n\nYour easiest path might be from actual connections, so don't be afraid of tech meetups and stuff.

I see you mention wanting to be proficient in AppSec and AI, then it is important to understand that there is more to this than just the language. Many times, when in comes to the language it is just the tool you use to apply logic and with that said AppSec and AI both rely heavily on the fundamentals of Computer science concepts. Discrete math, Data structures and algorithms, operating systems fundamentals, networking basics, databases, etc. With all that said, the one thing you can look at that credentializes you while teaching you all the relevant concepts is a Comp Sci degree. Especially with your stated goals. If you can't get a degree, then focus on first building the foundation for a self made CS curriculum. Appsec in particular isn't just finding bugs in front end code, it includes threat modeling, devops and other infra principles, tons of code review, database management, etc. AI security is emerging in 2 forms. The first being red/blue team tradecraft oriented security. So hacking the models through prompt injection, data poisoning, first order attacks etc. The second form is securing the models themselves, which is actually more inline with the AI/ML engineer/MLOps skillset, the best way to get into this is to pursue a traditional AI focused CS program. Notice, how everything comes back to CS fundamentals. Not assuming you want to jump into a senior position, but security isn't really a beginner focused field. In order to do security properly, you need the knowledge of an engineer and the knowledge of someone who can actually break the app and recommend remediation. Lofty goals is what keeps us motivated, but I would break down your goals in meaningful steps and a meaningful timeline. \n\nTo answer what you would use to learn programming and CS fundamentals, the only course that ever stuck with me was a \"bootcamp\" I took last year for $150 from exercism. They didn't even use a real language for the first half of the course, yet the fundamentals they taught have still stuck with me today. The biggest benefit from this course however was their discord where mentors were there to help guide you to answers on your own. After that I recognized my own shortcomings when it came to algorithmic thinking. I focused on the math and discrete math fundamentals, before jumping back into doing algorithm problems to improve my thinking. Point being AppSec and AI are long roads, try to set yourself up for that journey.",

That will likely lead to huge gaps in knowledge and dead ends.\n\nSo for example start by making your homepage. Then make it load items from a database. Then add an \"add to cart\" feature. Then add search. Then add a recommendation system but where the recommendation is pregenerated. Then make the recommendation smarter.\n\nAnd so on. Don't bite off too much at a time. Each new feature should only take a day or two.\n\nIf it takes longer, stop and break it down into smaller pieces. If you can't make a shopping cart in a day or two, break it down. First make a shopping cart icon on your app. Then make it so that clicking Add to Cart increments the count. And so on.",

I find having solutions always just an internet search away make this problem much worse - you train your brain to never think too hard about a problem because it always knows you'll find the solution and you won't have to work at it.\n\nOften it seems people think that they should be able to just look at a problem and instantly recall a solution, and if they can't it is too hard - without every putting serious mental work into solving it.\n\nAnyways, if you're in that boat you probably need to focus more on building your attention span and mental endurance first and foremost.

Lots of folks don't realize the sheer human scale of operating a massive platform with years or decades of features built by thousands of engineers.\n\nFor example: adding a single column to a users table is simple in a small shop. But at a large place that column on a critical table like such can likely: break 3 other teams downstream systems, add millions in costs in various places for storage, affect multiple critical APIs from added latency of making the payloads larger through out the stack, lead to bad downstream decisions who mis interpret the column perhaps (it happens a lot), not to mention new scaling concerns for > millions of rps\n\nThat's just a few things off the top of my head but now factor that with how many sub features those big platforms have across multiple systems. There are literally thousands of sub systems at larger places that need coordination at human scale.\n\nThe pool of engineers who can navigate this tends to be limited to a smaller circle, since lots of folks can code a system from scratch but many companies don't have such a scale.

TLDR, I needed to break into the industry when hiring came close to a halt and I needed to have a stable career within 2 years.

Im a Software Engineer and it took me a year to get my first career job, felt like every day stuck working at Walmart was a hit to my hireability. I was terrified of not being able to get my foot in the door and not being able to keep it there. \n\nIf I failed, 4 years of college would have been pointless. Plus, I knew id be taking care of my Ma once Dad retired. After graduating, I only had 2 years to get a high enough salary to support us both.\n\nOnce I got hired, I felt I had to prove myself with failure resulting in a dead career.

Would be told in meetings turn your camera on, \"I can't figure out how, it doesn't work\".  Sent a new laptop where they verified that the camera worked, wouldn't turn it on.  1:1's with the boss, no camera.

This has further effects as well to non-tech companies that also can't borrow money as easily. They'll do RIFs which also means fewer seats for SaaS products which is another way revenue drops.

From what I’ve seen in my own job search and from hearing my husband’s recruiting war stories, companies like that rarely shift their comp philosophy, so waiting around for bigger jumps doesn’t magically pay off later. What a lot of folks in your situation do is treat the current job as the stable base while slowly prepping in the background—updating the portfolio, doing light interview practice, feeling out the market without actually committing to a jump. That way you’re not betting your family’s livelihood on a cold plunge, but you’re also not stuck forever on a raise curve that can’t keep up with inflation",

I got the offer, but I was very concerned about the predatory nature of the business, so I asked to talk with a business-oriented person about my concerns before I could accept.\n\nThey sat me down with a product manager. He corrected some misconceptions that I had and explained that their primary business model was to compete with banks. Banks are also pretty predatory to their low-income customers, but that's a couple steps above things like payday and title loans, and, honestly, I probably would not have had similar concerns about an offer from a bank. The meeting convinced me that the company's business was above my own personal ethical line. I ended up working there almost a decade.\n\nI now work for a fintech that facilitates money movement for the customers of our clients. Most of the payments that we facilitate have very high fees, but our clients are crypto companies and legal gambling. I consider their customers' desire to transfer money into and out of those accounts to be discretionary spending, and the customers of those companies choose to pay the high fees for very quick transfer of funds. So, that also falls above my personal ethical line.",

Then the company started laying people off and moving the work to India. Guess i shoulda seen the writing on the wall when our beloved department head and team lead took jobs elsewhere. The guy that got promoted into their position was know to be a 9-9-6 type of worker who took it upon himself to replace people with as many work visa Indians as possible. Last i heard they shut down whole departments and replaced them with teams in India. Tbh i wasn’t surprised by the layoff since it was going around. I’m haven’t graduated so can’t tell what life will be like after the switch but what i can say is that while i was a coder I really couldn’t see a path that i wanted to take to further my career but as a nurse I do.

If you want to break through it you'll need to take some risks and really push yourself.\n\nIf you can, find a new team in the org to work in. What would be better though, if possible, would be to get a new job entirely.\n\nMost people move jobs for a salary increase, but another big part of it is the ability to sort of \"start over\" from step 1. Obviously if you're coming in as a senior engineer or something they'll expect you to onboard a bit faster, but you'll have that opportunity to start off asking those clarification questions and gaining that deep understanding without feeling like you're desperately behind. I've talked to other engineers about this exact feeling before and while some people boil it down to things like \"imposter syndrome\" the cold hard truth is usually that you actually aren't good enough at the moment. There have been critical mistakes made early on in your career that have stagnated your growth as an engineer and sometimes the best thing to do is simply acknowledge that you're in a position where growth is no longer possible and move on.\n\nAka, you can try and fix the soil or you can just plant your seeds somewhere else. Both options are perfectly valid, but I've found that most people find it easier to improve with a small do-over period. It's a daunting prospect though I won't lie.\n\nKeep in mind this only applies if you want to be one of the giga-nerd seniors who seem to solve every problem and know every code solution. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with just doing your job. Not everyone wants to grind it out and become an SME. \n\nYou can also take your knowledge and look to pivot into management now that you're a senior. Less technical and more people heavy if that's your style. I just think you'd benefit from a new perspective is all.",

Anyone who says the job market is fine is smoking something, but there are still some companies hiring, and I'd wager that new year new budgets new headcount is a thing.\n\nWhere I've seen hiring is in the startup world. Big companies are all up their own ass about AI this and that, but the startup world still needs actual people.\n\nI'd say the same is true for some defense companies because their pockets are typically so deep that they will still hire people to build stuff.\n\nAs for answers to your questions, I don't have any specifics, sorry. As for projects, I've put together some projects that had practical use and would be worth talking about. \n\nOne idea was a file conversion script that could take medical imaging files (from ultrasounds, MRI, CT scans, etc.) and convert them into something actually usable by a normal person like a jpg/png. That took some thinking, but it's a good learning experience. Motivation for this one was personal experience in how godawful most of those systems are and how inconvenient it is for you, the patient, to see your own images.\n\nAnother idea, albeit small, was to implement some of the common file compression algorithms and essentially make my own version of WinZip. There are a few \"easy\" ways to do it, but there are some way fancier methods out there that I found worth exploring.",

Maybe build something that showcases streaming data processing with Pub/Sub and Dataflow - like a real-time analytics dashboard for crypto prices or weather data, something you can demo live during interviews. 8-12 weeks is tight but doable if you split time between leetcode (maybe 30%), system design focused on data pipelines (40%), and building that one solid project (30%).

Doing some tinkering with AWS and getting familiar with their primitives would probably be one of the most impactful things you can do to increase your value in the job market, since it'll naturally open you up to lots more companies/stacks.\n\nSome thoughts inline for your other questions:\n\n> If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?\n\nGet your story straight. Ideally, both your internal story (for yourself, what you wanted out of it, what you ended up getting) as well as your public story.\n\nBut if you can only do one, get the public story *concise* and have the elevator pitch ready to deliver when the inevitable question comes up in the interview. You want 1-2 polished sentences about why you took the time off, what you accomplished, and how you're thinking about your return to full-time work.\n\nPractice telling the story, over and over, until it sounds natural.\n\n> Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE?\n\nRemember that you also need to like the job you end up getting. ;) It's okay to focus, especially initially.\n\nIf you do end up going for general backend/SWE roles, make sure to have different version(s) of your resume for those roles.\n\n> What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?\n\nOne underrated tool is mock interviews. Hire paid, experienced mock interviewers that actually have work and interview experience at the kinds of companies you want to join.\n\nSchedule at least one mock interview every couple weeks. That way, you're getting *real* feedback every couple weeks with specific guidance on what to work on.\n\nFor me, right before my real interview, I also then loaded up one last wave of mock interviews to get in a bunch more practice.\n\nIt gets expensive, but you should be able to make back everything (and more) with your signing bonus.\n\n> What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?\n\nOops... my advice is from experience in the US. Adjust accordingly. :)\n\n> Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?\n\nPaying for a training or a course certificate *from an actual credible source* can be a nice bullet point. It shows you're willing to invest in yourself, literally, and it shows you can learn on your own.\n\nGood luck! And don't beat yourself up about taking a break. It's *very* common. Professional athletes prioritize their rest days and rest weeks. It's totally okay for you to take care of yourself and prioritize rest in the same way.",

And all my friends who stayed put, were turning into degenerates, getting hit hard by the opiate crisis, drinking, partying, etc. All the friends I respected moved to cool cities, were enjoying their life. I made a bad choice.\n\nI remember being alone in my apartment after college missing the chaos of my roommates and crying because I was so bored and lonely and nothing felt right. The girl I loved was still in school and she cheated one me, I had a lot of decision paralysis on what I could even do on my free time. Nothing felt good.\n\nSo I researched \"Best cities to live in your 20s\" (this was 2015 mind you) and Denver popped up. I love outdoor activites, and wanted a city center where I could make friends. I wanted a fresh start. Most importantly, I did have an uncle who lived in a suburb there, and 1 single friend I could hangout with. It wasn't much, but it was enough of a safety net for me to take the leap.\n\nI changed my linkedin and resume address to say Denver.\n\nI got picked up by a recruiter, and they flew me out to a job in Denver for an interview. The culture was warm and chill, in a cool place, laid back, not overly corporate.  It had plenty of other fresh grads, I could hangout with them.  Beers in the fridge. End at 3:30 on friday and have some beers with my coworkers on other teams. I took a pay hit. Man I miss those days of pre-covid.\n\nOffice cultures vary dramatically from office to office. Sounds like you have a shitty one.\n\nAnd it was so chill I'm still there today, even though I did switch teams. I also found my wife in this city.\n\nEveryone has different needs. Hopefully my story helps.\n\nSadly it's a lot harder to land new jobs than it was in 2015. I'm currently shocked by this. But maybe you can investigate a similar approach that I took.\n\nEDITED a bit to add more context",

You have too many bullet points per role (standard is 3 to 5 maximum but since its one company around 5 is okay, maybe 6 if it’s really really worth it), and more importantly, they lack substance. When you write something like “Diagnosed systemic product-line defects, implemented robust fixes,” you’re not telling recruiters anything useful. What defect did you find? What made your fix robust? What changed as a result? Right now you’re describing tasks instead of demonstrating impact.\n\nEvery bullet point should follow a simple structure: what you achieved, how you did it, and ideally with numbers to back it up. Instead of listing what you did, show what happened because you did it. Compare “Implemented automated testing” to “Cut deployment time from 6 hours to 45 minutes by building an automated testing suite in Jenkins that caught 80% of bugs before production.” One is forgettable, the other proves you deliver results.\n\nYour summary section needs to go entirely. It takes up valuable space without adding value, and it creates a wall of text that makes recruiters skip to the next resume. Remember, most people spend under 10 seconds scanning your resume initially. Every line needs to earn its place.\n\nWith that space freed up, add more projects. Keep a rotating collection you can swap based on the role you’re applying for. Tailor them to highlight relevant skills for each position. Your current project description is far too vague and you’re missing an opportunity. If university teams are actually using what you built, name them specifically. That transforms a generic claim into proof of real-world impact.\n\nIf you want to preserve some of the context your summary provided, move your skills section to the top. This immediately tells recruiters what you bring to the table and helps them understand everything else they read through that lens.\n\nYour formatting also has problems. Company name, job title, and dates should all be on one line for ATS compatibility. Include months with your dates, not just years. Separating projects from education will also improve scannability and make both sections easier to parse quickly\n\nHope I don’t come off as too harsh. Good luck!",

Monolithic architecture comes with trade offs, as does micro-services, if you want to make the case for a monolith be prepared to defend it. You need to avoid the \"X is the best choice because it's what I know\" pitfall, which it sounds like you're already doing.  I would expect a senior engineer to be able to work with whatever technology/pattern is best for the task at hand and make decisions based on real technical trade offs, not pigeon holding themselves to a \"one size fits all\" pattern because its what they know. As for the interview specific purpose, the problem with a monolith is you can draw a single box and say it does everything you need, so it won't highlight your ability to break down complex domains, create reusable functionality, or address scaling concerns. If the use case justifies a monolithic architecture, I would focus on the inner modules and the boundaries/interactions between them. ",

Due to multiple factors, by that time I had no motivation and was burned out, and I didn't feel like getting a new job just yet (this was right near the end of the tech hiring boom).\n\n> For how long were you away from work? \n\nIt ended up being over a year - late-2021 to the end of 2022.\n\nGoing into that hiatus I had no idea how long I'd stay jobless, and really it was more luck and timing that brought me back to the field more than anything else.\n\n> And how did you spend that time?\n\nSome of the bigger stuff...\n\n* Getting much more into cooking - I stopped dining out as much (somewhat for financial reasons, but also health reasons), and started focusing a lot more on actually cooking most of my food, and learning how to make a lot of different things\n* Started running - The pandemic and transition to WFH really did a number on me, health-wise. During my year off I ran nearly every day - I ran about 2000 miles in 2022. This is one of the lifestyle changes that really stuck with me even after returning to work.\n* Some trips - went camping, went on a few domestic and international trips\n* Seriously learn Japanese - I had been learning Japanese off and on for years, but toward the end of my hiatus I lived a few months in Tokyo and attended a Japanese language school. Massively improved my skills.\n* A lot of reading - normal literature, not tech/business books.\n* Getting _more_ cats - Through an unexpected confluence of events, I adopted a third cat.\n\nI basically did not touch a computer for the entire time I was off. I did do some light coding on some open source projects, and built a tiny service for a friend's workplace, but I'd say ~95% of the hiatus my computer stayed closed.\n\n> Did the time off change your definition of success, or your relationship with work?\n\nNot really. It instead changed my relationship with my finances.\n\n> Would you say it was worth it?\n\nIn hindsight, yes. I really enjoyed my time off, though the biggest things I had to face were...\n\n* Actually needing to dip into money rather than have an income - My entire year-plus was funded by savings and dipping into investments. For reference, I'm married and at the time I left my job, I made 25x what my wife made (she was launching a business). I had no plan for any of this, the mental hump was huge after an entire career of never having to touch savings or investments.\n\n* Health insurance is fucking expensive - I live in a decent state when it comes to healthcare and insurance, and I had to buy marketplace insurance for the entire time I was unemployed. $1200/month for two people, for a medium-level plan. This, after spending years of paying $0 to a pittance for top-tier insurance from any employer I had.\n\n* Having a lot of unstructured time - the first couple weeks were almost surreal, waking up and having literally nothing to do.\n\n* Getting back into a \"I should probably work again\" mindset - I could have gone on for longer, though by the 12-month mark I was like \"yeahhh, I think my tech ennui has passed.\"\n\nBut in terms of just having all that time to myself and thinking about how it got me to where I am today, yeah, worth it.",

It is less common these days to find someone who is both a graphic designer and a developer. That, combined with the really low pay, make me think it’s probably a pretty small company that kind of doesn’t know any better. They’re probably going for someone early career who is passionate and knows their stuff. If that person were smart, they wouldn’t stay long. \n\nA single person could do the work, but their pace would be slow from being stretched so thinly. \n\nI’m skeptical of the environment given some of the assumptions, but it could be a decent early job from a resume-building perspective. It lists as part-time and internship among the job types. This job sounds a lot like a couple part-time jobs I had while in school. My hunch is their expectations will be lower than what you’re expecting from the job description. Could be a small business or a university. \n\nIf you hit the top-end of what they’re offering, that’s over $60k a year. That’s on the low-end for a dev, but given some of the posts you see in this sub, some of those people would kill for this job. \n\nNot every job is part of an enterprise software team, and it can be an opportunity for someone to start. ",

I might've had a task like \"make bulk purchase orders from sales orders\" or something like that, and before I could even *begin* to think about creating a button to automate that, I'd be thinking \"what was a purchase order again? Who receives that and who gives that? Does that go from vendor to company? Or company to customer? What's the significance of this in the business process?\"\n\nThe loops, conditional statements, SQL and variable fields were the easier parts of the job. But understanding why I'm doing what I'm doing was hard, and it made completing a task a much more monumental task than for the average business-knowledgeable person. And part of the job was scoping business requirements of clients, and providing advice for how to improve how they do things to have better utilization of the software product. 💀 So you can imagine how tough that was, when I have a surface-level \"i just Googled this term\" knowledge base. \n\nI remember my manager training me on how to set up a customer portal or a web form and in my head I'm thinking \"what are these? What is the point of these?\" My manager wouldn't cover that preliminary background knowledge, but would be covering how to implement it. I'd be too afraid to ask \"why?\" directly because I didn't want my manager to think negatively of me. I'd try to broach the topic by dancing around it with tangential questions, but I think my manager picked up on it and gave me feedback that I was asking too many common sense questions. 😢\n\n>I've been an engineer for over 10 years from minimum wage at start-ups to $400k at big tech. I don't know what those things are either.\n\n  \nOh wow, so I guess it isn't necessary as a software engineer? My mom has been telling me to avoid client-facing jobs and do software jobs that are just me talking with people *within* the company. Maybe that's the move for me... but maybe one day I'd like to try being in a client-facing technical role (like Solutions Engineer) one day. Out of curiosity have you worked for a company that was in a business-related industry? Like Stripe, Paypal, Shopify, Salesforce etc? Does it hold you back there? I thought you'd need to know more about the business concepts to create new features or product changes for those kinds of companies.",

I was getting ready to switch careers a few years ago and then decided not to after the market turned for the worst. I still lurk this sub sometimes in case things change.\n\nRight now my teaching career is actually peak. I’m so experienced that nothing phases me anymore. I know my curriculum like the back of my hand. I don’t even need to plan anymore and can just walk into the classroom with nothing but a topic I’m supposed to teach and I can instantly deliver an engaging lecture on it. I have a huge arsenal of assignments that I can use to match my lessons. Most of the assignments are auto graded and my workflow allows me to not take any grading home at all. The kids are good, never give me any trouble, and generally speak highly of my class. I make 115k doing roughly 1300 hours a year and will get a fat pension when I’m done so I don’t have to really save for retirement at all.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nThe first 7 years were absolutely brutal. That’s the period of every teacher’s career regardless of how smart or talented you are that you just have to grind out 9-10 hour work days 6 days a week during the school year just to keep your head above water. There’s no way to avoid it. Nobody tells you what to do, which is a good thing until it isn’t. Your main motivator to actually work this hard is that if you don’t actually deliver a good lesson, your classroom management goes to shit. No matter how good the kids are, if you start disengaging them or showing up unprepared, kids will eat you alive. They lose respect for you very quickly so you’re putting in the hellish hours just to make sure that you’ve timed everything out to perfection and that every moment is interesting (don’t forget your competing with TikTok brains these days).\n\nOh and you likely won’t be able to teach all AP CS or whatever you’re interested in. You’ll likely have to teach 2 or 3 separate courses over the 5 classes you’re given, which means you double/triple the amount of planning you need to do for no extra pay.\n\nIt’s an absolutely exhausting job that turns into a still exhausting but easy job after you’ve put in the first few years of hell.",

I can count up to 10 projects that I would begin and then never have the motivation to want to finish them. I struggled immensely with backend development. It was so hard to pick up and start that when it came time to work on any backend stuff (after finishing the frontend) for my projects, I would just cave in and give up. I recently picked back up on application that I sort of gave up on around a year ago and have been implementing new pretty lengthy features in terms of getting endpoints implemented and a SQLite database because of what I have learned at work. \n\nThis isn't the same for everyone, but I have definitely started to enjoy working on projects more at home. Hopefully when you start your new position, you can use the knowledge you learn and apply it to your personal projects. That is what has helped me gain motivation to want to create and develop personal projects on my free time.",

To get to that you should plan out the project and not just code without a plan. Planning includes design, functionality, technical requirements, etc. Feel free to use AI as well, but don’t get in the trap of using it for everything. Side projects should be treated like goals. To be successful with goals, you need to have both short term and long term goals. Long term goals without short term goals will lead to failure unless you’re a rare individual that can push through without feeling small wins/progress frequently.",

Have you looked at the most recent Pull Request / commits from your coworker (what are *they* working on)?\n\nIf I was in your situation - I would be hunting for bugs on that API - looking for wild edge case scenarios where the API breaks somehow. I would essentially attempt to become a white hat hacker and do everything I could to break that API, then figure out a fix for it. Document the bug with Unit Tests / instrumental tests. Fix problems before they arrive\n\nI typically learn how things work after I test them thoroughly - giving me a great foothold to move forward and learn the product",

I bartended previously, and tripled my income when I accepted my first job. fwiw I graduated in 2022 when the job market was more favorable - it still wasn't easy back then, and it is *much* more competitive now and it is actually very hard to enter the industry.\n\nThat said, there is opportunity in this field, but you should know that it is extremely competitive and difficult to enter, and the work can be very demanding. When job hunting for my first role, being a mid-life career changer played to my advantage because I was up against 22 year olds with no attention span and no adult workforce experience, so I was an easy choice against them. Being in school was actually fun, I made great relationships with my professors. \n\nBut the job itself? Not at all what I expected it to be. I love computers and I love building things, I like writing code and I like problem solving, I taught myself PHP when I was in high school and I got a 4.0 when I got my CS degree. The reality? This job is mostly meetings and paperwork and politics and all of that corporate doldrum, paired with high expectations for intellectual output from deep task work that you are expected to somehow find time for between all those meetings (or do at home after hours). You know that feeling when you were in school and it was exam day and your brain felt like jelly at the end? I arrive home every day feeling like that. \n\nThis is only my experience, and I am only 4 years in at this point and this is anecdotal, but honestly I am actually considering switching careers again. Others surely have had better experiences. But for me- the job is insanely stressful, the constant pressure to meet a perpetually raising bar and always learn new things, the horrendous demoralizing job search process, the on-call expectations and non-existent work life balance boundaries, the corporate politics hunger games, the cognitive dissonance of contributing to immoral corporations, the inability to escape AI, the constant anxiety of pip or layoff and the stack-ranking... the list goes on. My financial life has improved considerably, but my health in literally every other way has gotten considerably worse. I would love to take a more relaxed lower-paying job, but can't find one. I know that people love to say that engineers don't know how good they have it unless they've done manual labor or been in other industries, and I do think that is true in many ways. The money is insane if you can land a job at big tech and can be life changing, and it is true that many engineers seem to have no clue that they are rich and that this salary is not normal. But also, I was a service industry worker for over a decade, so I have perspective on being at a low income person and, well, I actually think I was healthier and happier and had it better back then. This is not sustainable but I feel like I cant leave because I don't think I'll have opportunity to make this kind of money again. I look around and most people at the office don't seem happy, they all seem stressed out.",

Remote work also means you're competing with the entire country or world.\n\nPeople who are only in it for the money, or very average, are going to have a hard time finding work even if they have experience or a CS degree.\n\nIf you really enjoy technology, have a knack for computers, and like building things, then it might still be worth a shot.

So if you're working in a space largely related to web/backend for example, then things like a raytracer or an emulator aren't gonna be relevant, whereas some sort of web app probably would.\n\nRecruiters in general can't tell how relevant something like three.js is or isn't to e.g. CI/CD pipelines. For them, you need to hit the right keywords for the target role. For the hiring manager round, we'll want to ask probing questions to see whereabouts you are in terms of your engineering competencies and hopefully get some indication that you would be able to ramp up on the target role. So ideally, build whatever you want to build with an eye towards having that be a prequel to whatever type of role you're targeting",

I've talked to another founder that had been in business for two years with 32% churn, but they also had a free trial AND they're dying now so IDK lol.\n\nMost churners give price or lack of features as the reason. My pricing is pretty standard compared to the closest popular equivalent services and may even be a little low (multiple MBAs have suggested charging more) so I'm guessing the best play is just to hammer out more features.\n\nI feel great about the numbers but at the same time there's a lot of signals that would traditionally be red flags, but may not necessarily be for this endeavor specifically.

People told me it was too late months before that and would humble brag about their offers.\n\nAlso, make sure you get your sleep (easier said than done I know). You won't be able to perform during interviews without sleep though. Also your resume looks good, I'd include a bit more metrics in your work experience and maybe add another point there as well.",

The anxiety is real but you need to shift from panicing to systematically fixing what's broken. If volume is part of your strategy (and at this point it kind of has to be), SimpleApply keeps coming up when people talk about this exact problem.\n\nIt automates the application grind and tailors your materials for each role, so you can hit way more positions without burning out on the repetitive form-filling. Worth checking out since you're already in spam mode anyway but need better targeting and customization. Beyond tools tho, get someone to review your resume.\n\nNo-name school doesn't matter as much as you think if your projects are solid and your resume isn't getting filtered out by ATS for dumb formatting reasons. Also look at smaller companies and startups, not just the big names that get 10k applicants per role",

        "body": "I'm gonna be real with you when I say that you're going to have to mentally prepare yourself for the possibility you're going to have to spend several years of, or even the entirety of, your 20s with your parents, in a low-pay non-tech job, or in grad school as a last-ditch effort to avoid a resume gap. Sorry.\n\nIt's nowhere near optimal. But it's the unfortunate reality for practically anyone young nowadays who's anything less than absolutely perfect. Those who came of age before you genuinely had it easier, and it's only going to get harder for each generation that follows. You could afford to slack off more in learning and practice, and still manage to eke out an acceptable existence. Not so nowadays. Survival of the fittest. Full-blown Matthew effect: rich get richer, and poor get poorer. No mercy to the unfit.\n\nEven Malcolm Gladwell's strategy of geographic arbitrage (echoing the traditional Chinese proverb of \"better to be the head of a chicken than the tail of a dragon\") is failing miserably. Like, I've applied to jobs all around America, even freaking remote outposts in the middle of nowhere in Iowa. I'm sure you've done the same. Yet still no bites.\n\nAgain, I don't necessarily agree with this, especially considering this is currently shafting me, and I have one more semester to set things straight or else I can look forward to a grim future of me putting fries in the bag with even less upward mobility than I'd have had during undergrad.\n\nPeople sit around wondering why nobody's having children or why the TFRs of their countries or their favorite countries is plummeting, and acting totally surprised. Well, now you know why. You ever wonder how expensive it is to raise children in almost any country? This isn't even just \"boo hoo I grew up in a McMansion now I have to live in a condo!!\" by the way; like, if you're making a burger-flipper or shelf-stocker salary, you're going to run into actual trouble putting food on the table, and your kids are going to starve. This isn't even a US only thing or a cheap \"America bad\" argument, it's worldwide.\n\nHonestly, I believe COVID as the lead-up impetus and generative AI as the main impetus is bringing about the beginning of the end of \"striverism.\" I'm talking about the whole grind to get into top schools and work for top companies, and the process of accruing years of effort getting involved in the best achievable extracurriculars or attaining the best achievable awards - oftentimes owing more to the sake of achievement than genuine enthusiasm. It's often been associated with Asians stereotypically, but nowadays arguably race- or ethnicity-agnostic. You might've heard of a stereotypical phrase about how Asian parents think \"A is average and B is bad\", with the general underlying message that Asian parenting (aka \"striverism\") holds the next generation to unreasonable standards. Yet now of course that playbook is what everyone's got to follow. Otherwise? You're cooked, and you can look forward to an eternity of burger flipping.\n\nYou can either accept this, or you can keep chasing utopian fantasies and then cry uncle the second things fail. When I was a high schooler in early 2020 and some mystery virus was screwing things up in Wuhan, China, my parents were more concerned than the average parents in my town. I weeped when they cancelled my Chinese school's Chinese New Year gala, only to be told gravely by my parents that this would soon be the least of my worries. And I just sneered at them. And when more cases started flaring up, and especially when what the district announced as a 2-week temporary shutdown for the sake of precaution took hold, I sneered again. My father told me school was most likely going to have to remain shut for the rest of the year. I hated him. I resented him. His words were bitter.\n\nBut maybe I should've considered the possibility that reality does not always reflect what you most desire. After all, if it did, we'd all be billionaires. (And then we'd rejoice over our presumed ability to afford luxury property, only to suffer severe hyperinflation, but that might be a topic for a different day.)\n\nWhat did you want to do before CS, if anything? Many don't start with wanting to do CS. I wanted to be an English or liberal arts major funnily enough, which is even more stupid because English was always my least favorite and worst-performance subject. But it was stupid because shortly before the COVID shutdowns I had a phase where I'd compose all these short stories and poetry, thinking I'd one day be the next Robert Frost or Charles Dickens or something (I didn't even compare myself to more modern authors like Stephen King!), and upon rereading them, JFC, they were so bad. I had the same idea with music composition, and nowadays I still go around telling people I'm a musician or composer despite not having composed anything of note or touched a piano in eons. I regret not just becoming a normie and joining the Fed Club at my school with all the other finance bros.",
