Some candidates tried inviting an AI \"note taker\" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \\*asked\\* if they could do so).\n\nWe then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.\n\nBut every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate \"You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?\"\n\nEvery single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.\n\nI can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",

All the cdc pipelines work great, and I haven't had any issues.\n\nI have to ask, how come you can't use mirroring for your on-prem sql? Or at least spark if not mirroring.\n\nFor the front end, I just approached it via segmentation of capacity. So, each business domain only throttles themselves. But that doesn't happen much since nobody uses paginated reports, and the data models are pretty clean.\n\nHonestly, I'd still rather use Databricks, but my problem is I can't justify it to my organization since I made the Fabric site work too well on its own...",

Even if they advertise exactly-once, the CAP theorem is just a basic fact of mathematics: you are trading consistency over availability. Not to mention how hard it is to tune the various timeouts and parameters both server and client side and when transactions get stuck, it's an absolute hell to debug. Every single actor and library involved has to be aware of this transactional mode or else you will see duplicates. It's not worth it.\n\nAnd even in at-least-once, you need to discuss beforehand the need for timeouts, heartbeat adjustments, the need for an idempotency/deduplication ID and event_time parameter... Applications tend to just be set up with default parameters without discussing any of that which is a recipe for headaches. Hell, I've seen deployments without as much as a group ID set up saying \"hey it worked without it\". And specially the thundering herd (?) problem in case of rebalancing is quite tricky to explain to people, it seems. Your apps and pipelines need to be able to handle these, and that's an architectural decision, it's not just plug and play.\n\nAnd that's me mostly just using it client side as a developer/engineer, having to help Ops debug server side issues occasionally. You need a lot of observability over Linux data syscalls and disks, and it seems to me that the default dashboards only have CPU, memory, at most disk usage.\n\n~~But I would be even warier of building custom stuff on NAS storage, but hey, that's why I don't work at Ops~~ EDIT: sorry, misread it as NAS storage for some reason. BTW, just to make sure, you weren't trying to use them as persistence for Kafka, were you? I've had to discourage people from doing it, very few databases would handle being persisted to network storage well",

Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. \n\nMy current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. \n\nWhen we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. \n\nThere's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times. ",

Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. \n\nData modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.\n\nNow this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. \n\nSo how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!\n\nIf anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source. ",

It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit.  I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may  like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions.  A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.\n\nI am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon.  I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now.  Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem).  A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers.  \n\nThe way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to).  So in the end it can only answer simple questions like \"tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months\".  Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy?  Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",

A GCP or AWS cert is useful, not because you will be an expert in every service, but because it expands your mental map of what tools exist and what they are good at. You can always go deep and learn them properly when you actually need them.",

You're lacking that mercantalist attitude and, without realising that the market is pretty solid right now letting organisations pay you a junior level salary (yes, a junior salary for companies with a strong tech culture) with 4 YOE.\n\nThis isn't always a hard skills problem. This is also a softskills problem. Sorry to break it to you but markets do not operate on merit alone. It's also who you know, who you get to know, and timing. I was working a junior salary for the longest time (40k a year junior dev) and then I went right up to 170k/year as of today. I was lucky to have the Elixir slack group back in the day sit me down and have this talk with me and make me realise I'm letting myself get hustled (or fleeced if you're a northerner like me :) ) because I lack the self confidence to apply for positions that pay a respectable income, in the UK, above what a copywriter makes. \n\nI think you need to work more towards becoming a software enigneer and less of a tooling engineer. But even with your experience I'd estimate you should be able to pull at least 30k more in more of a devops role. There are a LOT of companies with broken data pipelines.

About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.\n\nIts not always about \"saving\" time for me but rather its about doing things the \"better\" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the future\n\nI know what I've said above is not related to \"AI on top of broken data stack\", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.\n\nBy fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to \"slap AI on top of our data\" as in:\n\n\\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\\_xyz contain data from source\\_abc? how often does table\\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\n\n\\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like \"what was our prediction accuracy last week?\" \"how did model A perform vs model B last year?\"\n\nI think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the \"self-service\" utopia we've always dreamt about.",

It caters to both OLTP and OLAP, bringing together the best-in class OSS databases for each (Postgres and ClickHouse) and offering them in the most integrated way. We’ve seen many thousands of companies use Postgres and ClickHouse to build their data stacks, and the adoption is growing very fast. The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)\n\nWith regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads. We plan to invest heavily in this area to make application migration as seamless as possible.\n\nApart from all of this, the Postgres we are offering is NVMe-backed, which is very fast and comes enterprise-grade guarantees. We are building this in partnership with a world-class Postgres team at Ubicloud who were ex-Citus, Heroku, Microsoft Postgres.\n\nThis launch was a primer, stay tuned for a more very soon! :)",

Funny, right?\n\nYou can be a senior after 2y in a company, but not yet outside of that company. Be careful with titles.\n\n![gif](giphy|tGED68BogsXXcocK8l)",

But more important than arsenal of long list of tech stack is your structured problem-solving skills.\n\nLast but not least, communication skill.

None of these are particularly insurmountable, just costs you should be happy to take on in exchange for the experience you like. \n\n\n\nOne thing you might do to hedge is store data at rest in Iceberg on GCS and self host a catalog like \\[Lakekeeper\\](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/).

It is not a super complicated stack but it *is* work and creates an additional point of failure, especially with the networking and security side of it imo.   \n  \nMy recommendation is keep it as is if you love it since Motherduck appears to be a very affordable service, if you end up having to migrate later on it should not be a very heavy lift.

        "body": "Some advices for the start: start small (one or few data sources / pipelines), dont overengineer (dont try to cover every possible edge case), build stuff that it is easy to tear down, build LOOSELY coupled pieces (this way you avoid one small thing breaking upstream and blocking everything downstream), spend a good time sketching diagrams and noting down pros and cons for every architectural decision (important: there's not one perfect choice. Best-practice in terms of this kind of thing is to know the trade-offs), implement observability from day 1 (that can be writing logs and checking them daily in cloudwatch at the start).\n\nNote that MANY of your trade-offs and architectural decisions will depend on what kind of requirements are required downstream. In fact, the very first thing you need to map is who are the data consumers and what are their needs - mind you that more often than not the end-users have very vague requirements (it is often a big part of the job to translate vague business requirements into technical choices - also, often what they want is different than what they need). If applicable to your case: also talk to upstream stakeholders (feks, in my company, the data is generated by services written by developers, so I have to sync with them to understand what is doable or not in terms of data serving/latency)\n\nEDIT: also, if you are not super familiar with AWS, dont underestimate how much time you'll spend implementing things there :D\n\n(I'm in a similar position, where I wear the architect, tech lead and engineer hat at the same time - and oh, Iam also brazilian ;) )",

The concepts transfer really well. S3 vs ADLS, Glue vs ADF, Redshift vs Synapse are different names, same ideas. Picking up AWS on top of Azure is way easier than starting from zero.\n\n\nFor getting your foot in the door, I’d stick with Azure as your “primary” stack, but get just enough AWS exposure to be conversational and not blocked in interviews. You don’t need to master both.\n\n\nAlso, product companies preferring AWS isn’t a hard rule, it’s just more common historically. Plenty of good teams care more about how you think than which cloud you used last.\n\n\nSo no, you don’t need to panic learn everything.

        "body": "I'm in a similar position tbh. \n\nHonestly I think a lot of people are actually over skilled for the jobs they're doing. Management say 'I want real time' and a data engineer hears 'use Kafka' - but what management actually mean is 'i check this every morning and want it to be up to date' so you could probably get away with orchestrating a batch update every morning.\n\nI've also seen people use pyspark for data that is easily small enough to handle without spark. They just think 'but this is what everyone else is using so I should use it'.\n\nThe annoying thing is, if you have good judgement and figure out the most appropriate tech to use, that can get in the way of upskilling if you settle on a simple, cheap but more mundane alternative.\n\nIf you want to learn some of the things you listed:\n- if you're using snowflake, why not just start using dbt + git to manage your SQL?\n- how is data getting into snowflake in the first place? If that looks quite manual at the moment, maybe try setting up airflow to schedule data extraction / load\n\nI think you could probably find opportunities to do things you want to - obviously not all of it but maybe have a think about what's possible",

Once you have that understood the next big thing is fixing stuff which is broken / diagnosing issues / defensive coding in advance before it breaks - here you learn patterns, what can go wrong, why backing loads off and re-running isn't magic.  From there you should be able to design decent overall data models, talk with people in detail about what approach should be taken and point out issues in advance before anything has been coded, at this point you're working as much on people skills as hard technical skills.\n\nIt's tempting, because of the flood of shitty job ads, to think you need tool X or intricate knowledge of language Z, but the reality in terms of being capable has nothing to do with those, unless you're a typical recruiter.",

You’re spot on about batch jobs quietly being the best fit for so many “real time” requests.\n\nOn upskilling, experimenting with dbt + git is a great move even if it’s not in prod at your current job. Same with Airflow—just automating even one small pipeline can help you understand DAGs and scheduling. And if you want to broaden a bit into API stuff but aren’t getting those projects at work, there are plenty of open datasets out there you could ETL into Snowflake as a side project. Sometimes the best way to get experience is just faking a “business need” for yourself.\n\nUltimately, don’t sweat the trend-hopping; being able to design and maintain stable, clear data products is way rarer (and more valuable) than knowing every tool under the sun.",

It’s never happening, don’t try.\n\nMy advice: be practical and treat the old stuff like it’s cancer that needs to be cut out.\n\nDon’t try to document the mess you have. Instead build or fix things one piece at a time and document that as you go. Build in parallel, dual run against the old things, and when you know the old tables and batches are redundant, take them out back and shoot them in the head.\n\nAlso, forget AI. It knows when I’ve forgotten to close a print statement in my shitty code, but it doesn’t know architecture or systems design.\n\nIf you want to automate this, try the missing index reports.\n\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-missing-index-groups-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17\n\nBe wary, this reflects what queries are written and run (probably by the same useless engineers that made this mess) rather than the actual logic and definitions that matters. So a badly written query moving data no one needs will be boosted in the output ranking.

It's great.\n\nWhere I work I use the MySQL v8 ODBC in a Windows server running MSSQL in prod, and push tables across the network truncate/load in a remote staging tables of a MySQL server (that the Wan IP addresses & ports are fixed and whitelisted for security). Once the load is completed, a stored proc is called remotely to signal the MySQL to process those staging tables.\n\nIt's an annoying process though, I would rather create flat files, push them somewhere, and an event triggered at the remote end (like a datalake container/folder) processes them. I could then make JSON data and send that, also based on events.\n\nIOW, JDBC/ODBC between servers is a \"work-around\" solution, and it's slow. Like 45 mins to send 2 gigs of data.\n\nHTH",

Also from a leadership standpoint, if you leave the company, they would need to replace you with someone with enough Python capability to take over ownership of the pipeline - which is a more expensive resource than just a pure analytics/sql person.\n\nAll of this is more strategic considerations vs purely technical ones, so may not be relevant, but just wanted to explain how I would think about it from a leadership perspective.",

You should treat your SQL server as the Control Plane and a dedicated file store (like S3, Azure Blob, or a MinIO instance) as the Data Plane. Your Python script functions as a gateway that pulls data from your various sources and subjects it to a strict validation suite before it ever reaches the ML team. Instead of raw CSVs or SQL dumps, have your script convert the data into Parquet files; this format is compressed, schema-enforced, and significantly faster for ML frameworks to load than standard text files. Once the script validates and saves the file to your central storage, it should write a record to a \"Manifest\" table in your SQL server. This record includes the file path, a unique version ID, a checksum to prevent corruption, and the results of your quality tests. The ML team then simply queries this SQL table to find the URI of the latest \"Verified\" dataset, eliminating the need for email threads and manual downloads.\nThis setup transforms your manual 70GB bottleneck into a robust, versioned data pipeline that maintains the SWE standards of your core application.",

Glue jobs with bootstrapping logic (or even AWS SDK/CLI scripts) can generate and update the tables as needed, while the Terraform state stays clean and manageable. It does add an extra step to your deploys, but it’s more transparent and less prone to silent breakage than bending Terraform out of shape.\n\nFor versioning, a lot of folks lean on dbt’s schema versions and migration patterns, even if it means treating Glue like more of a catalog pointer than a true source of state.\n\nCurious to see if anyone’s found a less clunky solution that keeps everything declarative—but so far, the split-responsibility model seems the most maintainable.",

Chunking with pandas is a solid approach for memory management, but you do have to be careful: some operations just don’t make sense chunk-by-chunk.\n\nChunking is great for row-wise, stateless preprocessing (cleanup, type conversion, basic feature engineering). But for anything that needs a full view of the data—global normalization, deduplication, calculating rare category frequencies, finding global min/max—you’ll either need multiple passes or a clever accumulation/aggregation step.\n\nA typical workflow for your scenario:\n- First pass: Scan over chunks to gather global stats (means, stds, value counts, rare category thresholds).\n- Second pass: Use those stats to transform the data in chunks. Outlier detection, normalization, etc. can be done chunked, but with knowledge of global parameters.\n- Save intermediate files as Parquet if possible, for speed and compression.\n- Tools: Dask and Polars both handle these kinds of workflows better than vanilla pandas, especially Polars for very fast I/O and multi-threading.\n- For Colab: keep an eye on disk (mount Google Drive if needed), and be ready to restart if you hit session limits.\n\nIf you ever need to empower less technical folks to safely interact with this data (without risking direct DB access), there are platforms nowadays that let you build internal apps over your datasets via drag-and-drop, or even AI chat interfaces. Could help with democratizing those big data insights beyond just the Python crowd.\n\nBut for now: chunking + multi-pass over Parquet files + Dask/Polars is the combo I’ve seen work well in similar RAM-constrained settings.

Sorting 32 million rows lazily before streaming isn't stable or either crashes in colab.

At 30M rows, this almost always triggers an OOM (Out of Memory) crash in environments like Colab.\n​Serialization Overhead: Converting DuckDB’s internal format to Pandas and then to a model-ready format creates unnecessary CPU work and memory duplication.\n​Moving to Polars solved this because it feels like it was built for the 'Model' part of 'Data Science.' Since it uses the Apache Arrow memory format, it integrates seamlessly with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Scikit-Learn with zero-copy potential meaning the model can often read the data directly without doubling the RAM usage.\n​The Lazy API and Streaming mode let me handle the full 30M-row feature engineering pipeline with way more stability. I can build complex transformations (scaling, encoding, joins) and only 'collect' the data when the model is ready for it. It's definitely the move if you're looking to build a scalable, production-ready ML pipeline!",

        "body": "Biggest lesson from teams that’ve shipped this: text to SQL isn’t the hard part, trust is. A few design things that usually matter more than model choicee would be like always ground generation on the actual schema + metrics layer, not just table names. Most failures come from the model guessing joins or columns, Add a validation step before execution (dry run, limits, blocked queries). Don’t let raw generated SQL hit prod blindly. Start narrow, Constrain what users can ask for (time ranges, metrics, dimensions) before going fully “chatty”. On the knowledge side, most teams I’ve seen keep it simple, Use RAG for business logic, definitions, metric semantics,Treat schema and relationships as structured input, not embeddings.GraphRAG helps when relationships are complex, but it adds a lot of operational overhead.Solr *can* work for retrieval, but it’s usually better as a search layer than a true graph store. If relationships matter a lot, a dedicated graph or just explicit schema metadata often ends up clearer and more reliable. and correctness and guardrails beat clever architecture early. If users don’t trust the numbers, they won’t use it, no matter how good the UX is",

Example: “give me annual revenue for fiscal year 2025” will always fire a query for financial data from Jan 2025 to Dec 2025. What if my company’s fiscal year begins in March and ends on last day of Feb? That’s business knowledge that your solution needs. \n\nFull disclosure: I work at Databricks, and since you mentioned Azure in another comment.. just reminding that Azure Databricks is a first party PaaS offering in Azure. I have helped many customers with this problem and truly believe that what Databricks gives is a high quality text2sql solution with AIBI Genie. You can find lot of information on Databricks Genie and its benchmarking results.\n\nIts a hard problem to solve especially around the biggest requirement which I see from analysts or power users, which is the need for quality and deterministic SQL code. This is where traditional BI does well, whereas LLMs could hallucinate.\n\nBest practices in Genie include using well curated metadata about each dataset, column definitions,  semantic understanding about the data etc. These become non negotiable with agent based solution, since that's the only context for AI.\n\nSomething like Genie being a tool in your arsenal will help your overall agentic solution. And best part is that you don't need data to be in Databricks. Databricks can connect into your database via Lakehouse federation and understand the layout of data.",

You’re reacting to constraints like messy data, changing requirements, cost limits, and systems you didn’t choose. So the thinking becomes things like where this pipeline will actually break, what happens when volume doubles, what can fail safely and what cannot, and what’s expensive to recompute versus cheap to store. If you’re not on a DE project right now, the closest substitute is to simulate real pain. Take a public dataset and design ingestion, transformations, and reporting, then deliberately change assumptions like schema changes, late arriving data, backfills, or higher volume, and force yourself to optimize for cost and reliability instead of elegance. Books and blogs help with vocabulary, but most architectural thinking comes from asking what the simplest thing is that won’t hurt you later, then being wrong a few times. Reading postmortems and migration stories taught me more than polished tutorials ever did. You don’t really learn architecture in a vacuum, but you can train the mindset by constantly reasoning about constraints, failure modes, and long term impact",

        "body": "I came into data in a similar way, coming from finance directly to lead a data team with limited technical knowledge other than decent sql.  I have also been involved with several data warehouse builds in my career.  You are thinking about it in the right way as this stuff is always a series of tradeoffs.  What does feature X do for us, how long will it take and what value does it provide?\n\nIt seems like you are vague on requirements, which is the norm, so I would focus on that as it will inform what you build (i.e. you will be rebuilding and reloading if you miss a bunch of stuff).  Start with what you have today and come up with a list of columns and the concepts they related to as a starting point.  I would also get with whoever does the budget modeling / FP&A work for the company as they know the KPIs and drivers of the business, which you will have to align to.  At the end you should have a list of columns or metrics with a domain and column (e.g. domain is customer and columns for account number, name, address, etc).\n\nThen start with that as you talk to other stakeholders.  A good meeting might involve say someone from marketing who knows the views they  want to see, a data analyst who might know what columns/calculations are involved in producing that view and then you and your DA can bump that off against your model.  It's easier to ask them for what's missing rather than come to them with a blank sheet of paper.  Also get a sign off from the department because they will inevitably come back with 20 more requests on the week you drop the finished product.  The DA should be able to work from that artifact.\n\nThe data model is important because ideally you want one data source that feeds 80% or more of your data requests.  This ensures that data is consistent across all reporting and dashboards as it uses the same core data and calculations.  If there is an error in a calculation, you can change it in one place and it propagates across all the dependencies.  If you build custom data models for each dashboard or request, then you can have inconsistencies where the developer used the wrong formula, or when you need to make a change you have to find it and change it dozens to hundreds of times.\n\nIn terms of important things I would say requirements is first (though you can often do this incrementally), then figuring out your infrastructure.  Like what is your approach to building pipelines and does it provide velocity to develop, is it maintainable, observable, etc.  Does your data platform align well with the likely use cases you know about?  You sort of need this initial planning in place to get going, but afterward you can build incrementally as MVPs or by data subject to show off progress.\n\nYou need to balance delivering value and insight to the business with the necessary things to support a robust platform.  Things like automations should be considered, but it's a question of prioritization.  How much time does the automation save vs time to build right now?  Can we defer it without major consequences?  Which ones are the priority?  Can we produce demoable work each sprint or quarter to show progress, and better if the platform can be partially used to deliver value ahead of being fully fleshed out.\n\n\\-sorry for  the essay.",

That cost should be separated, since it is a different discussion than the rest of the CDC discussion, unless you design a solution that needs to be re-initialized regularly.  Eg. I think Fabric's \"mirroring\" involves re-seeding every time the capacity is stopped and restarted. \n\n\n\nThe \"after that\" part of your answer is probably more interesting to OP.  This is where the underlying CDC magic happens. Most databases implement CDC by feeding the database transaction log to the subscriber.  This can be done asynchronously, at a lower priority than anything else that is happening.  In other words, the normal clients and users of the database can be given priority, and the CDC work can take place whenever there are free resources.  I wouldn't necessarily agree with the \"5-10%\" increase in server usage unless the server was very small.  This overhead would be based on a number of factors.  If you had a TB of data and 32 cores on your DBMS and only 100 CUD operations at the source a day, then the amount of transaction log activity would be neglible and the CDC workload would be virtually zero.  All things being equal the CDC workload would increase as the transaction log becomes more busy.  And even then the source DBMS wouldn't prioritize CDC activities over regular database usage.",

Since you've been working as a DE for a number of years and you're trying to over-employ (?!) I'll assume somewhere at the mid-level.  I'll note that I've primarily worked at startups so mid-level in my mind may have higher requirements or expectations than mid-level at MNCs.\n\nAt the mid level or senior level, I'd expect a DE to get assigned a few tickets at the beginning of a sprint and, during standup, note that they're looking for a new ticket if they're done with their existing work.  I'd also expect them to keep us abreast of any developments in their work so it doesn't fall behind, etc.\n\nFor ad hoc requests, if there does not exist a triage system (for example: if no one picks this up in 15 minutes, it's fair game for anyone and respond to the request) then I would recommend suggesting one.  If the style is \"whoever sees it first\" (like my job right now) then either the DEs must adapt to that style or communicate with one-another to enforce another style (like triage and sprint protectors or something); to ignore ad hoc requests or to require others to triage is putting extra work on the team --- and it seems like you've already been talked to about it, so it's possible that the team doesn't love that you don't pick up ad hoc stuff.  The big word here is _communication_, and it's extremely important to have team-wide communication open.\n\n\"Oh, but my job is so hard, and it's impossible to do XYZ...!\"  Yes, I know, there are a hundred thousand excuses for why any of us don't like our jobs and why it's impossible and why the workload is intolerable.  The reality of the situation is that you either adapt or fail to thrive.\n\n---\n\nAs I finished this, I saw this comment:\n\n> I had mentioned how things worked with me in the past and I thing it is really simple and clear if engineering lead or manager just informs me if they want to pick any issues up. Im thinking proactive would come eventually but not in a forced manner.\n\nI would never want to work with a mid-to-senior+ level DE who has this mindset.  How do you expect being proactive would come _eventually_ if you aren't practicing it at all and making your lead / manager do all the triage _for you_ (which gives them _more work_ to do)?\n\n\nEDIT: Apologies for being so blunt here: I've had a few coworkers in the last year with this mindset who made my job significantly more frustrating than it needed to be.  I want you to succeed in your company but it looks like you reply with a lot of excuses to well-meaning comments so I'm trying this approach.",

If you want to keep it free, there are open source ones used by actual companies like Apache Airflow. You can use this on the open data sources mentioned. \n\nI’ve been through many DE and DE role adjacent interviews, and SQL almost always comes up. Know some technicals like order of execution in a SQL query, CTE’s, Window functions. I have never been asked any python technicals (have done a few OA’s though that are typical leetcode style, but these were not the norm), aside from Spark concepts.\n\nWhen you scour job postings, you’ll see a company can be entirely on Azure, AWS, Databricks, Snowflake, etc. But I also see a lot of postings that are Airflow, DBT + Snowflake for example. Airflow and DBT are free and you can use a local RDBMS instead of a cloud DW for a project to teach you ETL concepts and data orchestration, warehousing, modeling.\n\nGet good at one stack and apply for jobs that use those. Before your resume gets to a human, an ATS will scan for all the relevant key words in your resume with the JD. I have only worked with Azure & Databricks so I immediately stop reading a JD when it’s asking for AWS or Snowflake. In your resume, emphasize the results per experience (ex. optimized X by Y%) first, responsibilities second. I think you can definitely give your many different roles to chatgpt and ask it to reframe those roles to be more DE-specific.\n\nAs for certs, I have noticed consulting roles seem to value those more than product company roles. If you’re fine with spending money, a Databricks DE associate cert, AWS DE, etc could make you stand out more as an entry level candidate. If you want to work with the cloud, AWS is more commonly used over Azure and GCP. Having worked in consulting before, the certs are how the firm pitches you to clients and gets you staffed (and therefore make money off of you).\n\nLastly, use Linkedin and have all the relevant DE skills and experiences on your profile. It’s a lot easier for recruiters to find you first instead of the other way around. \n\nGood luck and I’m happy to answer any more questions you may have!",

We had this sprawling CRM system that had been customized over the years by like 5 different consultants none of whom seemed to talk to each other. Marketing was using one set of IDs for customers sales had another and finance was just throwing their hands up in the air. Trying to get a single reliable customer view was a nightmare. We spent weeks just trying to map out the different entities and how they related to each other. It felt like unraveling a giant knotted ball of yarn. And then of course once we thought we had it figured out someone would drop a bomb like Oh yeah that table We stopped using that three years ago but nobody told anyone. The worst part was the constant requests for data pulls. Sales would want a list of customers with X Y and Z marketing needed a segment with A B and C and the data team was stuck writing custom SQL queries all day long. It was completely unsustainable and we never got to work on anything strategic. What finally saved us was this virtual data platform we implemented. The thing that impressed us most was its ability to automatically discover all these hidden relationships between entities that would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. The AI engine identified and resolved data quality issues too duplicate entries mismatched data types the whole nine yards. We didnt have to move or duplicate any data either which was a huge plus for security and compliance. Then once the data was unified we started building no-code ETL processes to push cleansed data to the different systems and to our data warehouse. That part really freed up our data team. Instead of constantly fulfilling ad-hoc requests we could focus on building actual data products and analytics. Seriously the reduction in headaches alone was worth the cost. I know it sounds like Im selling you something here and I kinda am. The company that makes the platform has a referral program and yeah Id get a kickback if you ended up using them. But honestly based on what youve described I genuinely think it could solve your problems. Id be happy to make an introduction if you want to explore it further no pressure either way. Just let me know if you think a connection would be helpful.",

Those \"let's just do x for now\" always bite you in the ass. It seems today's strategy is to limp things along until the business is fed up enough to wait for an entire redesign. Then the tech team and manager are replaced and you don't even fix all the tech debt because the people aware of it left! Tech debt NEEDS to be tracked and talked about regularly. Where I'm at they pushed anyone technical out of those discussions and it's only been band and worse. The consulting team they brought in pointed the finger at the data/tech team, promoted mid level managers with no tech background into those leadership positions (now they have to lean on the consultants for EVERYTHING AND EVERY DECISION! So much wasted money and time but theres no one technical to explain anything, even WHY things are as messy as they are. \n\nI saw this happening and tried to get my boss to understand what was happening. Instead he fought her about design differences instead of division of responsibilities. The consultant got 2 years to work with the analysts (who from my outside perspective were much further behind the engineers) while pointing fingers at the engineers/data. He needed to be bringing up all of the things the analysts and the business side need to do to make teams like this successful.",

Consume your DEs' entire docs to get ideas or get shadowing sessions. This is what I did to transition, I just reviewed what I already know from experience. If you can transfer internally, that would be better.\n\nUnderstand your ETL/ELT pipelines like how data moves from point A to B (from source system up to the analytics layer) in your company. Learn how & why certain tools are being used in the system, their trade-offs in terms of scalability, costs, reliability, their impact, etc. Software engineering plus systems analysis & design concepts help a lot like SDLC & Agile methodologies for example.\n\nIf you're proficient with SQL and be able to explain different situations such as knowing when to use subquery vs CTE, view vs materialized view, handling duplicate records, optimizing queries etc. then you're more or less good to go. Knowledge of Python/PySpark helps a lot as well. Understand and differentiate between a data warehouse, data mart, data lake, data lakehouse, dim vs fact tables, normalization vs denormalization, file formats (csv, tsv, parquet, avro), etc. Knowledge of cloud also helps.

From the outside it looks less like “networking is unimportant” and more like Fabric being designed as a very opinionated SaaS first, and an Azure-native platform second. MPEs feel awkward because they’re basically abstracting VNET concepts into something Fabric can control end to end. That gives Microsoft tighter isolation, simpler UX for less technical users, and easier multi-tenant guarantees, but it also means every new resource type needs explicit support. That doesn’t scale well for power users who expect networking to just work like it does in Synapse or Databricks. The slow rollout of MPE types is probably a mix of security review, product prioritization, and yes, commercial incentives. Fabric clearly pushes “bring data into OneLake” patterns first, and anything that bypasses that path feels like a second-class citizen. Whether that’s intentional cost pressure or just product focus, the effect is the same for customers. I don’t think it’s a lack of technical capability so much as Fabric still deciding who it’s really for. Right now it feels optimized for managed ingestion and analytics inside the ecosystem, not for complex private networking scenarios. Until that changes, Fabric is hard to recommend as a full replacement for Synapse/Databricks if deep network control is a requirement. Curious if others have found workarounds or just accepted this as a current limitation",

And presenting it as being ready for use, even when customers can't connect to basic HTTP/REST services.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is when they position it to replace PaaS offerings like Azure Analysis Services, Azure Synapse and HDInsight.  They are choking the life out of those commonly used PaaS platforms and making customers migrate - long before their new platform is mature or stable .  It is frightening that they are so convinced their customers want to abondon PaaS for an expensive and inflexible SaaS.   Or maybe they are just so focused on higher margins, that they don't care what their customers want.  IMO, not being able to connect to a resource is a big red flag to a PaaS user.

That doesn't run a count(1), it's getting it from metadata. So it's O(1) time relative to table size. \n\nObviously a PITA to do this if you had 100s of tables, but since you only have two tables, dead easy. \n\nIn theory you could query the metadata directly to get this programmatically. It's one of the sys views, but I never remember which.\n\nOther than checking table counts, I guess the important question is how is the server migration being performed? If it's a backup of the old DBs being restored onto the new server, then this is a pretty bombproof approach, so long as:\n\n- writes to the DB have been completely stopped first (e.g. put DB into read only mode first)\n- the backup is run with the checksum option\n\nSo in this case, I'd focus more on making sure the process for the migration has been thought out fully - then you don't have a lot of validation to do. Otherwise you're just validating that a widely used quarter-century-old enterprise RDBMS doesn't have a certain type of seriously fundamental bug.\n\nIf the data migration is happening via some bespoke approach then you do need to validate further. But you first need to ask why they're not doing the more obvious simple backup/restore. \n\nFor further validation, you really need to take the hit on slow scan queries and make sure the time needed for that is built into the migration plan.\n\nGathering stats is the right approach but I'd focus on sum() of numerical columns that mean something to the business (currency values, quantities, durations, etc). Just sum the whole table with no group by. It doesn't have to be a useful KPI /metric that way, it's just a number that would be very sensitive to anything going wrong in the migration. And if all those numbers are unchanged, you can be pretty confident that whatever you use the data for will still work.",

You can't 'vibe code' this and be successful. You have the absolute bare minimum outline, and it can work for personal web site scale. Beyond that, you will be cooked. Cloud autoscaling is much better than it used to be, but only at a per-service level, and the deeper into your pipeline you get, things are like dominoes. Schema can also kill you; you absolutely need an experienced engineer to help you get that schema right. There will also be countless integration details and knobs to turn throughout the pipeline to ensure it doesn't crash, and you'll need to know the exact implications of each one. Data has a shape, both horizontal and vertical, and neither one likes sudden changes midstream. How will you handle deploying those changes? What happens if you need to roll back a change? How will you remember what changes you made? Do you understand CI/CD and why it was developed? How many tenants do you expect to onboard to this platform? How will you keep their data separate and secure? Some of these are very basic engineering skills, but we have them for good reason, and they're skills learned over time, and often painfully. Lost data is lost money, and when it's gone, it's usually gone.\n\nI don't mean to discourage you. Something like this is a fantastic learning project, but you really need to learn not just the code behind it, but exactly how the data flows through the system. We don't worry so much about Big O problems in the age of cloud computing, but similar math problems are still there (unless you have an unlimited budget). An SRE can also be helpful.\n\nYou can have this fast, cheap, or reliable. Pick two.",

I understand that probably nobody expects you to memorize entire libraries, but if you do not even know how to make a variable capable of carrying null value, or the difference between a stack and a list or other similar functions that you are not tought outside of programing context, then it will be extremly hard to translate a logical solution into code without rellying greatly on AI or other people to implement it for you.",

I make a lot of POCs, a lot of demos, do a lot to get ready for training sessions. I mostly fill gaps. If a team or the organization needs something and I am asked I fill it.

This of course won't fly for many leet code problems, and some platforms don't even allow one to use many functional languages and set hard time requirements for execution time of the solutions. Parallelism and code cleanliness is given no thought. You can write all shit code with single letter variable names mutating shit everywhere, and it will accept your solution more likely than a very clean functional solution, that is trivially parallelizable and would scale (if ever needed).\n\nLooking at LC mastery mostly selects for people, who have ground that stuff hard and memorized that stuff (which won't be of too much use on the job for actual real world problems) or people, who think that this kind of procedural mutating way of programming and the typically associated languages are the end all be all, and have limited experience with other things.\n\nI much prefer advent of code (AoC) style puzzles, where you can use any language you want, and you just need a number as the solution.\n\nI feel like solving AoC puzzles has improved my ability to solve problems the functional way, even, if they at first seem to not lend themselves well to the functional paradigm. I found some pretty neat functional solutions at times. Like for example using bitboards represented by numbers as an underlying data structure and boosting performance of my previously too slow solution by a factor of more than 1000. I had to sometimes write functional versions of well known procedural algorithms. Things like A-star algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm, depth-first-search, breadth-first search. I've had to interpret how they work and how I can replace data structures they rely on with functional versions, and how I represent a graph or create it in a functional way.",

You didn't learn any of the other things that are normally taught in the first two years like patterns, web development, databases, intro to security, or general theory. Of course, programs can vary. I haven't seen a single one that's like \"C++ 101 and nothing else lmao.\"\n\nSecondly, you had to pass those classes to be going into your third year. So you passed a C++ class. You certainly had to build basic programs. You were able to follow guidelines, design by the prescribed principles, and received a passing grade. You also took an OOP class and passed it. Now you can't make your own basic programs at home. This does not make sense.\n\nThirdly, you're just figuring this out after 2 years. You paid money to be bullied and ridiculed for 2 years. You didn't go to your counselor or program director to ask if this was normal. You just dealt with the abuse, passed your classes, then immediately forgot what you learned.

The work has become more enjoyable over time - not because of obsession, but because I've gotten better at it and avoided stagnation.\n\nThe key has been continuous variation. Initially, I learned the essentials: variables, conditionals, loops, and basic control flow. When BASIC felt too restrictive, I moved to Pascal and C++, which introduced new challenges like pointers and object-oriented programming. After a brief period with Perl (which I didn't enjoy), I transitioned into web development with PHP and JavaScript. JS proved interesting because of its prototype-based inheritance model - a completely different approach from classical OOP.\n\nThe pattern isn't obsession - it's sustained engagement through novelty. Each language shift brought fresh problems to solve and different paradigms to master. I didn't chase the same dopamine hit of early discovery; instead, I built deeper expertise while regularly introducing new complexity. The \"addiction\" you remember might have been beginner's excitement from rapid skill acquisition. That specific feeling doesn't return, but it's replaced by something more durable: the satisfaction of solving increasingly sophisticated problems with accumulated knowledge. You don't need to recapture obsession - you need new challenges that match your current skill level.",

Everyone feels this way at one time or another, even those who doesn't appear so.\n2. Also, instead of giving in, to feelings of being an imposter, actively identify and address the weaknesses you've already identified, and do something about them.\n3. E.g. Note down terms you don't understand and learn/clarify them for yourself.  Ask here. Or research on the internet.  Or start a conversation with Claude or ChatGPT and say \"I am a programmer and I ran across the concept/term of 'dependency injection' \\[for example\\] the other day.  I don't know what this is. Write me a short treatise on this subject including references so I can get up to speed. Include examples and exercises.\" (for example.)\n4. You also observed you do nothing outside of work.  Well, that's a hint/tell: Start doing something outside of work then!  (\"Doctor it hurts when I do \\*this\\*\"  Doctor: \"Well stop doing it then!.\" You get my drift.)\n5. For example, start answering questions on a programming site, or try to.  Sometimes you'd have to do some research in order to answer. From doing this, you will learn.\n6. Try sites like: [exercism.com](http://exercism.com), [codingame.com](http://codingame.com), [codewars.com](http://codewars.com), etc\n7. One final point: AI is no magic bullet.  The presence of AI is going to increase the demand for competent engineers that can also be AI whisperers.  You can get ahead of the curve by incorporating and learning and developing the art and science of making effective use of AI in your current job context.  As time goes on, I expect this skill might be more important that your naked skills, important though they remain too. (You cannot effectively use AI in anger if you cannot properly judge and evaluate an AI's output. So your human intelligence + experience is essential for the effective use of AI.)\n\nThe software industry is wide and deep, give yourself time.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  Read Peter Norvig [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).  I have been in industry for more than 25 years now and not a day goes by that I don't learn something.  Make peace with not knowing everything, that is not where your most important skill lies.",

Some bugs are fairly trivial to detect and fix, others can take months or years.\n\nThe important thing is that this does not fully hinge on a given programmers debugging skills. Bugs only become easy to detect and fix when\n\n* the programmer is somewhat good at debugging and familiar with the codebase,\n* the code has been written in a way that facilitates easy debugging,\n* the infrastructure has been set up in a way that facilitates easy debugging,\n* the programmer has tools available that facilitate debugging.\n\nPeople can have different preferences for how to go about achieving these things, but they're likely to involve stuff like\n\n* [Good error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/index.html#common-message-styles)\n* Observability setups (logging, metrics, tracing)\n* Access to actual debuggers\n* Tests (both unit tests and integration tests)\n* Automated builds and common integration & testing infrastructure (to eliminate the \"it works on my machine\" situations)\n* Linters / rule engines that prevent certain code from being merged\n* Static typing and a [reliable type system](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (there are some people who swear by dynamic typing, but Typescript is gaining ground over Javascript, and it's pretty common now to have type hints and typechecking for Python too, and apparently PHP)\n* Various code architecting styles, though preferences there _really_ vary, but see e.g. \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" and \"parse, don't validate\"\n\nI.e. a lot of the work we do is done to make debugging easier, and avoid bugs reaching production in the first place.\n\nBut depending on situation and the technology involved some bugs can still be pretty hard to figure out. There's [a talk from CppCon 2017 by Louis Brandy, _Curiously recurring C++ bugs at Facebook_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkgszkPnV8g) that has a lot of examples of stuff that can stump professionals.

If you do less than that, you won't have the group project experience and advanced topic fundamentals to hit the ground running. You'll be competing with offshore code monkeys we can staff during US or EU business hours for under $20/hr loaded cost rate (salary, benefits, support staff, equipment, building, everything). And now, you'll be competing with Claude. May as well wait tables at that point. \n\nAt 19 years old, the best advice anyone can give you is to go to university and do an engineering or CS program. You don't have to go to MIT or Cambridge or IIT etc. If you have a four year state technical school whose program is well respected and that has a strong internship placement office, that's fine. Hiring managers nearby probably graduated from that program and will recognize the credential. Especially with AI, your goal is to be solid enough to do the job without AI so you can manage AI as though it were a junior developer. I get customer hires and sometimes staff hires that came out of these six month bootcamps and it's tedious. I'm essentially their TA/professor for what they would have learned in their first big sophomore year project practicum to say nothing of the next two years of courses. And they'll be hamstrung because no one's going to ever make them build a simple database server or webserver or memory allocation method and they'll never really understand how that works.

Never go down the path of \"the user will just have to do it this way to make it work...\".  User friendliness!",

What I really lacked was some sort of project to put all that together and the knowledge to break that down into the necessary steps. After all sorts of tutorials on YouTube and Udemy that didn't really have any good projects to walk through, I found a great tutorial from Tim Corey that built an actual app. It was an app that you would use to track a 3v3 basketball tournament for your office. What clicked the most about his approach was going through the planning phase of what the application needed to do. It needs to register players, register teams, and assign players to teams. It needs to keep track of who paid the $10 entry fee for the current tournament, it needs to track the bracket and match ups for the current tournament, etc. \n\nThe code was done in such a way that it would be platform agnostic, meaning you could build it as a desktop app that saved the data to both a text file and a database or it could run as a web app on your phone and connect to a cloud database or something like that. \n\nThat's the kind of tutorial I needed, and it sounds like you need more hands on learning with the planning part. I knew the syntax for all the loops, how to create functions and call them later, etc., but I never knew how to sit down with a blank project in the text editor and start building something. That tutorial did a great job showing how to go from an idea of what you want to make to breaking that idea up into smaller steps. It also did a good job of identifying what you needed for the MVP (minimally viable product--the bare minimum features to be a functioning app) vs what were \"nice to haves\" that could be added in future phases. \n\nI ended up abandoning the whole C# thing when I got a job as a data analyst several years ago. I've gotten by with just SQL so far, but I'm getting ready to start a peer mentorship with one of the folks on my team to learn python and predictive modeling now that I have a project that would benefit from it. I still use what I learned in terms of planning for my projects now: what are the essentials the customer needs now, and what can wait until phase 2 or phase 3.",

If your compile time hierarchy of encapsulation matches the domain model, you will have a hard time managing all the different interactions and variations. An example for that would be an inheritance hierarchy where each class implements its own behaviour (Vehicle -> Car -> Truck / Bus; Vehicle -> Train -> ...; Vehicle -> Bycicle -> ElektroBike; Vehicle -> ??? -> MotorBike; ...)\n\nInstead, start with separating your data from your logic and keep your data in simple arrays. E.g. a List of Orders, a List of Products, a List of Deliveries, A List of Customer Account. This can be an exact match to how you design your database btw.. Also, have only 1 ID across **all** types of Entities. This will allow you to combine the Components at Runtime easily.\n\nThen write functions (not methods) that operate on those lists. One function may check whether your are going to be out of stock for any product and create a new order for your supplier. Another function may go over the recent orders by your customers and create an aggregated report of what has been ordered and how much. And so on.\n\nThink about your logic as systems or laws of nature. Similar to how gravity affects the trajectory of a ball thrown up, instead of the ball gravitating itself back to earth.\n\nYou will see that a lot of stuff that is challenging right now will become trivial.\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "You have to think of a web application project as an ongoing project. You have to start by breaking down the application's main objective into smaller, realistic goals. As you say, you need to know the fundamentals of programming, but you'll acquire them during development. If you don't start at some point, you'll feel like you're in an endless learning loop: you learn the basics but never apply them to the real world. Obviously, depending on the complexity of the website, you'll need more or less knowledge, and you have to be sure that the resources and skills you possess are sufficient to reach the goal. But this part relies primarily on research and patience.\n\n\nBasically, what I would do if I wanted to prepare to create a project is to create a sketch. It could be a diagram, a text document, or both. I write a brief outline of the idea I have in mind, then a list of the workflow, resources, and basic knowledge I need.\n\n\nOnce I have this, I start working on gathering resources and coding. The first thing I do in a web application is the design. I establish the typography, icons, brand colors, and that sort of thing. Functionality is what I do after I have all of that in place.\n\n\nKeep in mind that you can never know for sure what your project needs at the beginning. You should try to prepare to start as soon as possible; don't waste time or energy trying to have everything under control from the start, because it's pointless. You'll learn to program by programming.\n\n\nEstablish a work plan by setting short- and medium-term goals and adjust them as you go. If something blocks you, move on to something else, and at some point, you'll find what you need to unblock what you were creating.",

Moving the window one step only changes a single data point. To make the list sorted again you only need to move this specific point to the correct place. \n\nGoing a bit further into potential optimizations you can also notice that if the point that's dropping out of the window (`op`) and the point that enters the window (`np`) are both larger or smaller than the current median, the median won't change and you can just replace `op` with `np` without resorting the list. Another observation is that if `op` and `np` are on different sides of the median, you don't actually have to resort everything to rebalance both sides because the balance can be easily restored by moving one element to the correct side:\n\n* `op` < median < `np`: move the smallest element to the right the median to the left of the median; this element is now also the largest element of the left. The new median lies between this element and the new smallest element on the right side.\n\n* `op` > median > `np`: Find the biggest element on the left side and move it to the right; it's now the smallest element on the right.\n\nBy using those observations and moving from fully sorting the window to simply partitioning it you should be able to make updating it much cheaper because you no longer have to shift all elements between `op` and `np` to either the left of the right.",

His code (in java) was very weird at first: lots of methods taking and returning Map<String,Object>. I eventually figured out that as a js developer, he was not familiar with strong typing or even class type definitions. Of course JS6 and TS in particular support those, but JS does a lot with anonymous functions and weakly typed, ad-hoc key value pair objects as a programming norm. Memory management is also completely under the hood and so the whole idea of a pointer or reference type was new as well.\n\nWhere I'm going with this is, the basics translate, but I still maintain that C/C++ is great first language followed by an OO-first language like Java, Python, or C# because it makes you internalize these concepts and gets you ready to write scalable, non-browser code. I don't prefer JS as a first language because it's hard syntactically to keep track of exactly what each construct is and the patterns, while syntactically concise, can easily be confusing on those points.\n\nJS is great; learn something else too. At least get to a point where you understand the difference between a function that's a method, a class template, or an instance of a class, understand variable typing, and understand why you might want strongly typed code and by extension what the typescript project was going for and why it was widely adopted by large js code bases.",

So we need to break that problem down.\n\nWhen the program isn't doing what you expect, put a 'print (whatever\\_variable)' followed by an 'exit' and run the program again.  See what the variable looks like at that point.  If it is what you expect it to be, then move the 'debug' statements down one line and see if the program is doing what you expect on the next line.  At what point the program's output diverges from what you think it should be doing, that is the point that is worth studying closer.\n\nThen just consider that little piece of program code and look up syntax and research what the command does until you understand it, and fix the issue, and move on to the next line.\n\nWork it out like that.  You need to understand how the 'wires' connect together, so to speak, before you get to the real fun part, of connecting bigger components together like graphics and saving files and using networking and such.  Just take it slow and give yourself some patience to look at the small problems.\n\nIt's like math class.  There is a reason that math classes spend awhile on the fundamentals.

It places restrictions on the object which can be used to ensure you don't do things you shouldn't with it, and can be used to refer to automatically allocated objects.\n\nYou can pass a unique_ptr, the implication being that ownership is handed to the callee. Or const unique_ptr, meaning the callee can use and modify the object, but not move ownership to something else.\n\nYou can pass by shared_ptr, ownership is shared and lifetime managed by the pointer. I rarely used these. There are also weak_ptrs but I've not yet had to use them.\n\nSometimes it's perfectly valid to just pass a copy too.\n\nI try to avoid using raw pointers in c++ unless forced to, e.g. using a posix or third party C API, and if given one, I'll try and wrap them in a unique_ptr with custom deleter where and as soon as possible, so I don't forget to clean them up. But you can imply similar semantics with the constness of the raw pointer, you're just relying on other developers more than the compiler.\n\nExperts please feel free to correct me here.",

        "body": "What you are describing is commonly called *tutorial hell*, the frustrating cycle of trying different introductory tutorials but never feeling like you actually learn *how to create your own programs from scratch.*\n\nAt this point, people usually give you two pieces of bad advice: \"Work on your own projects\" and \"Contribute to open source projects\". Well, not *bad* but not without caveats.\n\nWorking on your own project is definitely a good idea, but beginners aren't in a place to know what sized project to take on. Especially because these days beginners might think, \"I want to make an AI\" or \"I want to make my own Instagram\" or \"I want to make Minecraft\" are good projects. If you pick a project that's too large, you'll spend two months on it, not finish, and then be left even more frustrated.\n\nThe solution is to **pick small projects**. You might not know what counts as \"small\", so I wrote [a free book with 81 small Python programs](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/). They all use text for output, including small ASCII art when needed. This may seem old-school, but the benefit is that every language has `print()` so you can use these projects even if you're not using Python, and there's no graphics libraries to install and configure on your computer.\n\nMy definition of \"small\" is roughly \"under a couple hundred lines of code.\"\n\nIf you work on your own projects, make a list of *negative* features: things your project *won't* do. It's too easy to let \"it would be cool if...\" expand your scope into something you'll never finish. (Every programmer who started making a game by first making their own 3D graphics library is guilty of this. It's a great for a learning experience, sure, but my money is that the game will never be released.)\n\nThere's no one moment where everything \"clicks\" but rather a series of small clicks. Finishing a dozen tiny projects is far more fulfilling and keeps you going than one half-finished giant project.\n\n\"Contribute to open source projects\" is not good advice; you do need to have some level of experience making complete software applications to meaningfully contribute, or find someone in the project to mentor you. Open source projects would love to mentor someone who will contribute in the future, but it's hard to trust that the person they invest time into will actually stick around.\n\nI tell people to write their own blog posts or tutorials of what they've learned, because that process spotlights any gaps in your understanding. (Writing programming books certainly does that for me.) Post it somewhere online under a pseudonym where it will have zero readers, but *do* post it: this forces you to finish it. I have a hundred files in my blog drafts folder and they aren't doing s*** for me.\n\nI'm going to get off Reddit and go write up this advice into a blog post now.",

A lot of the “name vibe” you want can come from rules, phoneme patterns, and weighted randomness, and you will learn faster by building a baseline you can compare against.\n\nIf you do want ML, the roadmap I would follow is: get comfortable in Python first, then learn how to prep text data, then try a simple character-level model that generates outputs conditioned on your input root. Start small with a dataset where you have pairs like (root, modern name) and ignore multi-step history at first. Once that works, you can add intermediate forms as extra training examples or as a multi-stage pipeline.\n\nThe hardest part will be the dataset, not the model. Etymology data is messy and sparse, and “multiple steps through history” is basically asking for aligned sequences across languages and time. I would prototype with whatever clean pairs you can get, then iterate. If you can make a dumb version that produces plausible names, you will be 90 percent of the way there.",

There is no other way to stand out.\n\nLike, put yourself into the recruiter/employer/interviewer's shoes. Why should he hire YOU over a guy who has a degree to show? A person with a degree can prove that he has knowledge and experience in things on a certain level. Otherwise he would not pass the tests, would not pass the exams, and would not get his thesis defended. Yes, one can graduate with the lowest passing grades and one can graduate cum laude, and there is a difference between a degree holder and a degree holder, but even these lowest passing grades usually show that the person at least is introduced to a number of topics relevant to the field and has passed these courses.\n\nAlso, during your degree studies you will get connections from your course mates, from your professors, perhaps from the computer club you are joining, etc. Everybody of them can later on help you with finding a job. I got recommended to my first workplace by my course mate. Which connections you'll be using when studying on your own?\n\nYes, universities/colleges differ. I have seen people telling how they learnt nothing really during their studies. I have read how in India the studies are mostly theoretical and people are unable to produce a code that compiles. But where I live, the studies were very practice heavy. We actually learnt stuff relevant for the field. We built thesis projects that were taken into an actual use by people. So, universities differ.\n\nBut, assuming you will get lucky with your university then that is any times better than trying to study on your own. When you are studying on your own your picks on what to study and what not to study, these picks are subjective not objective. You do not know what you do not know. You learn what interests you and you leave what seems boring. Yet in a university professors teach you what you have to know. Even when you think it is irrelevant, too difficult, or boring.\n\nYes, a degree alone will not get you hired. Your knowledge, skills, experience you gained during your studies, your projects you built, that gets you hired. But that is what usually comes when doing degree studies.\n\nGoing back to what I told about hiring then having a degree will make you have much better chances in being called to the interview. Without a degree the HR person can just skip your application. And, from your post it is clear you do not have a clear idea about which projects to build. That does not compete with people who build hobby projects and that using these when it's done.\n\nSo, if possible, go for a degree.",

If you change one of those files (a .css file in your case) and save it, it just gets saved to the drive. \n\nWeb site files get read by browsers, and the browsers do whatever the files say: show some text and images and apply css rules to make them look the way you want.\n\nBut the browser doesn't fetch the web site files you just saved **unless you tell it to.** \n\nAfter you change your .css file, try **holding the shift key and pressing the refresh button** in Edge. It's the little circle at the upper left of the Edge window.  That tells Edge to reload the HTML file it's showing and all the linked images, .css files, .js files, and other objects.\n\nOr **hold the Shift key and press F5**. That does the same thing. It's what I do.\n\nThere are software solutions to make Edge (or other browsers) automatically refresh themselves when a file changes. \n\nBut, with respect I suggest you do not use such a solution until you thoroughly understand how the browser works in this business of needing to re-fetch files you have changed on your drive. It's a fundamental concept of this whole world-wide-web dealio.",

This does sidestep (or at least defer) the problem a little.\n\n> The first multi line script i did upon running, made it difficult to refer to a variable in the top level function.\n\nThis seems unrelated to the order in which you define your functions.

The image is loading  \n2a. The correct image has been loaded  \n2b. The correct image couldn't be loaded  \n3. The image - correct or error - is displaying\n\nI would add boolean useStates for if it is currently loading, if it has completed, and if an error has occured - and then props for both the requested source, and an optional error-image, which the caller doesn't have to supply, if the component should just show a default error image.\n\nAnd I would add a \"loader-animation\" for when the image is currently loading - which might end up in an error, or the right image.\n\nThat way the enclosing component, the SearchResult doesn't have to know anything about the problems loading images, and what happens inside the other component - because as it can't really do anything about it, it shouldn't have to know!",

Here's how I think through projects:\n\n# My Project Planning Process\n\n1. **I figure out who the project is for.** Who's going to use it? Even if it's just me.\n2. **I figure out what the user wants or needs to do.** I write statements like \"As a User, I can do \\_\\_\\_ so that \\_\\_\\_.\" Basically I'm figuring out what the user wants to do and why.\n3. **From there I usually start getting ideas for pages and what will be on the page.** I write them down. I draw some rough sketches. I mean actually write with pen and paper. You don't have to but I find that stepping away from screens for this preliminary planning helps me think better.\n4. **I like to take those sketches and bring them to full mockups.** I don't know that it's necessary, but it helps me to not have to think about styling and layout when I'm writing code. You could also use AI tools to make these mockups.\n5. **Then I get to building the project.** I try to follow TDD (Test Driven Development) and scaffold things out. I try to procrastinate the implementation details as much as possible. That way I can answer those questions about how to structure the project and everything one at a time",

A lot of beginners think you are supposed to plan the whole thing upfront, but most projects get figured out by building a tiny slice first, then iterating.\n\nTry this: write down the one thing your app must do end to end, even if it is ugly. Build that as a “walking skeleton” with hardcoded data and the simplest logic you can. Once it works, replace one hardcoded piece at a time with the real component, like real input, real storage, real validation. For structure, start with folders by feature or by page, not by “future architecture.” Your first goal is something that runs, not something that is perfect.",

You had fast access and slow access memory.\n\nOne example was drum memory. At the most basic, there is a [write][erase][read] head over a spinning magnetic drum track. You had to wait for your data to sweep under the read head to get it - however long that took. This was a destructive process, because then the head passed under a magnet. This data was either written a moment later at the read head, or a write was scheduled to intercede the passive loop.\n\nThey then put a smaller, faster access loop over just a few degrees of the track, and had a larger, slower loop for the rest of the track, and this would take a couple sets of heads to pull off.\n\nBut this tech got faster still, and this is the one you can mimic - they used coils of wire, and sent modulated signals down it. Again with the feedback loop - if you wanted a piece of data, you had to wait for it to come around. If you wanted to persist that data, you had to immediately write it back on the wire. If you wanted to change it, you had to intercede the passive loop. You could add more storage with a longer wire, you could get lower latency with a shorter wire.\n\nSo that's what you can do - send data to an echo server, one on the furthest computer on the opposite, most remote destination to you on Earth or as ambitious as the DSN, and the data is stored ostensibly in the transmission itself. Want some data? You'll have to wait for that data to get back to you. Want to persist it? You'll have to send it back out. Want to change it? You get your chance as it's coming back to you and it's time to send again.\n\nCall it a time sequence data cache.\n\n---\n\nIf that doesn't quite fit the bill, then google \"fountain codes\", and implement your own bit-torrent-like protocol.",

Think about it from their perspective - if an employer can't tell two candidates apart in any other aspects, and the employer happens to use technology X, but only one of the candidates has used it... then there's a good chance they'll pick that candidate, and would be sort of irresponsible not to do what is essentially in the interest of the company.\n\nHowever, it's awkward to go about your life constantly fretting about only ever doing things that completely overlap with what you think employers will care about, at the expense of not realizing how beneficial it can be to just go ahead and work on projects that _you_ care about right now. Sometimes your interest can take you down unforeseen paths that help you grow in ways that have knock-on benefits elsewhere. And sometimes solving different problems, or unique categories of problems, or the same problems but in different ways (e.g. a different language that forces you to do things slightly differently) can help arm you with perspective that becomes useful later at unpredictable times.\n\nStill, you could consider asking yourself if some project will help you in any of the major skill categories that are useful for a programmer.  That could be any general purpose programming (which you could divide into various paradigms or key ideas), scripting, data modeling (e.g. SQL), concurrency, certain platforms/OSes/frameworks, etc. etc. If a potential project has very little overlap with at least something that lets you grow a bit as a programmer, then that could be a sign you might want to consider a different project.",

Changing your career path to something that, for AI to catch up, all someone has to do is train it on it, is not security. \n\nFor me, job security is more about being good at something. If you are worried about AI, vibe code something that you’re good at with Opus 4.5, the gold standard of AI, and it will ease your concerns. I did that and it was endless prompts of just saying it doesn’t work, and to fix it. Anyone that vibe codes is incredibly handicapped. \n\nI removed myself from the Antigravity sub today because all I do is argue with people that can’t code. People that think Antigravity pro doesn’t give them a high enough token limit (it gives them $700 worth of Opus requests for $20). I could never understand their insatiable appetite for AI tokens. I’ve never come close to using all of mine. I’ve now realised they do what I did in the paragraph above, as when I did that, I finally reached my token limit.\n\nWhen I use my own brain, I am far far faster than is possible with vibe coding. I am legitimately faster without AI than with it, and this is what I hear from good senior developers that are working in their area of expertise, all the time. There is no threat for people like us who are faster and better without AI. For now anyway. And I don’t believe AI is improving that fast.",

If you are using arrows or lines or pseudo-syntax (that does not compile), it is up to you. The point of pseudocode is to convey the idea of the process/method. I will give an example:\n\n1) if [boy.name](http://boy.name) starts with Ü -> the boy is most likely from Europe. if [boy.name](http://boy.name) starts with Ф -> the boy is most likely from Greek or Russia.\n\nYou can look at it and instantly understand that you are checking the name of a boy and based on how the letter looks like, you are assuming where he is from. Because different countries use different alphabets and different letters. I can claim that what I wrote are two \"if\" sentences. Perhaps part of a \"switch\" statement. But no way what I wrote compiles or runs in any programming language. It is a pseudocode. Understandable to a human but not runnable by a machine.\n\n2)public static String getFamilyName(some person) {\n\nname = getNameFromDatabase(some person)\n\nfamilyName = splitTheName(name)\n\nreturn familyName\n\n}\n\nIt is more code-looking pseudocode. It even uses a little bit Java syntax. But will it compile? No. Will it work like this? No. Will it tell what happens? Absolutely.\n\nYou can see that a method gets some person as an input. Then you retrieve his name from a database. And then you split the name and return the last part of it. The flow is understandable. How you are accessing the database? Not important. Will it work with names like Alfonso Maria de Borbon y Borbon? No. It assumes the person to have only first and last name. But will it give the idea of the process? Definitely.\n\nBy an idea a pseudocode is something that even a non-IT person can read and understand. Free from language-specific and syntax-specific things.\n\nBut why the first option is answer to the question you asked, that got answered by others.",

Once I realized that, writing recursive functions became easier for me.\n\nThat seems obvious now, but the professor who first taught recursion to me didn't hammer that concept into me, probably because he thought it was already intuitive and obvious.  (It wasn't to me.)\n\nAnd writing the rest of the recursive function (the non-base case part) takes a *leap of faith*:  You have to believe that the recursive function you call from inside your function will return what you want.  Once you decide what you want for it to return, you have to work with that output.  And after that, you will have to make sure the internals of your recursive function returns exactly what you want it to return when you called it.  (Sorry is this is very abstract, but recursion is a very abstract concept.)\n\nAnd you may have noticed that reading already-written code is often more difficult to read and understand than writing new code (even if you're the one who wrote the code in the first place!).  This is especially true with recursive code, so when you're calling the function recursively, add comments to explain that you're doing so, preferably with some explanation as to what the recursive call is doing, in contrast to the current call.",

Very easy.\n\nBut how would you do it recursively?\n\nYou could break down the process into two steps\n\n1. If there's only one number, then we return that number. This is the base case, and where the recursion returns\n2. otherwise, we return the first number plus the sum of the remaining subset of numbers\n\nBased on this definition, we can write each of the following inputs as such\n\n* sum(\\[1,2,3,4,5\\]) = 1 + sum(\\[2,3,4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[2,3,4,5\\]) = 2 + sum(\\[3,4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[3,4,5\\]) = 3 + sum(\\[4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[4,5\\]) = 4 + sum(\\[5\\])\n* sum(\\[5\\]) = 5\n\nNow if you look at sum(\\[4,5\\]) and you sub in the value of sum(\\[5\\]) you will see that it is equal to 4 + 5 = 9\n\nAnd then for sum(\\[3,4,5\\]) you can sub in the value of sum(\\[4,5\\]) with 9, which gives 3 + 9 = 12\n\nThe key to solving recursion is to identify how you can repeat the algorithm on a subset of the input so that when you solve a smaller problem, that solution can be used to solve the larger problem.\n\nThe same applies to node-based structures. Every tree has a root and a bunch of children attached to that root. children also has its own sub-tree with the child as the root, and a bunch of children.\n\nSo you can create a recursive algorithm where you pick a root and recurse on the children, until you reach a leaf node which is a tree with no children.",

It's not made easier by the fact that there are very few examples that are both (a) intuitive and (b) more easily done with recursion than iteration. This means you either get examples you don't understand or examples where you don't see the point of recursion.\n\nLet's think about computing the height of a tree. The height of a tree is the longest distance from the root to a leaf node (we'll assume that a tree with just one node is height 1 and a tree that isn't there at all has height 0).\n\nSuppose you want to compute the height of a tree. Imagine I tell you that the height of the left branch is 7 and the height of the right branch is 4 (how? I'm magic. I just know these things). Can you tell me what the height of the whole tree is? If you think about the definition, the longest path to a leaf node is going to involve going either left or right from the root. If you go left (that's one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf *from that point* is 7 (because I told you). If you go right (also one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf is 4 (again, I told you). So the longest path from the root is `1 + max(7, 4)` which is 8.\n\nThis solution, unfortunately, involves a magic step, where you ask me what the height of the left and right subtrees are and you use those results to determine the height of the overall tree. Wouldn't it be great if you had a function that would tell you the height of a tree so that you could use it to determine the height of another tree?\n\nYou do. It's this function we are talking about. We just change this:\n\n    func height(tree)\n      return 1 + max(ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.left),\n                     ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.right))\n\nto\n\n    func height(tree)\n      return 1 + max(height(tree.left),\n                     height(tree.right))\n\n\nThere is one thing missing from this, which every recursive function needs: a way to stop. There has to be some state (we call it the \"base case\") that you can work out immediately, without doing any other steps. This should be the smallest possible example. How about the empty tree? Not a tree with just one node, but a tree has no nodes at all. We'll say it has height 0.\n\n    func height(tree)\n      if empty(tree) return 0\n      return 1 + max(height(tree.left),\n                     height(tree.right))",

Python Zen somewhat sheds some light though and is far easier to understand too, so worth reading at the start of your journey.\n\nAt your very start (and I'm assuming you are just getting started having looked through your profile a bit), code itself doesn't really matter, you need to grasp core concepts first and develop a proper mindset of how to approach problems. Codestyle is honestly a rather simple matter and you'll be able to adapt to it later *if* you understand fundamentals well enough and the endgoal of coding and programming in general.\n\nHope it helps.\n\nEDIT: wording + some stuff.",

You probably would need to clarify more, as this sounds like it might not be the kinda situation most people here are familiar with. An environment with stricter regulations on changes may explain some of what you're experiencing, but will also make a lot of feedback you'd receive invalid.\n\nBut really, this is much more of a conversation for your manager. Your manager should be connecting you with projects as well as backlog work for when bigger projects are stalled. My experience is that there's usually massive backlogs of work to be done, so the idea of there being nothing to do is pretty wild to me. And I've been the sole remote worker from a team of in-person folks before. Being in a different location does change things a little, but it shouldn't make you a ghost. There should still be tons of interactions with your team, such as by dialing into standups, team Slack, code reviews, etc. But I'm coming from the position of a perhaps more typical office job and this sounds like it's something different.",

I don’t like talking to people outside of work and family, and the amount of bootlicking and fake enthusiasm you’re expected to show just to impress corporate types and land a job feels insane.\n\nMost of the cracked engineers I’ve worked with or know don’t do any of that. They’re loyal at their jobs, keep their heads down, and just want to do deep, meaningful technical work. On the flip side, a lot of the fake people I’ve seen spend more time crafting LinkedIn posts than actually improving their skills or doing real engineering work, and they all seem to have some hidden agenda.\n\nI literally saw a dude interview for big tech just so he could create content and attract more juniors to pay for his coaching side hustle.

My exec has some self awareness, and know what they have built proves a concept but should not go near production.\n\nIgnore most of the advice here: do NOT go to the exec and tell them how bad what they have built is. It is true, but that's not the point. They have to learn this, they cannot be told this. They have contempt for software developers and the craft of software development. Ignore the glazing; if you tell them what they have built is a turd they will show their contempt of you. These guys are in full Dunning Kruger world now, and they have proven to their satisfaction that software development is fast and easy.\n\nThey now trust AI over human experts. This is something you have to go with and accept; but you can influence it. Try to influence them towards getting an LLM to review the system they have built. Help them with some prompts; I'd suggest getting ratings across a whole load of dimensions, with a score out of 10, an exec summary, and then a final overarching recommendation. Stuff like \"You are an expert software architect with 10 years of software architecture experience backed by 10 years as a software developer building large systems. Critically review this application for adherence to best practice architectural and computer science principles....\" blah blah. Assess on SOLID, DRY, coupling, thread safe, self healing, HA, type safety etc. Then do the same for security. Then maintainability. Ask it to describe what what the software does, and how well that aligns with the specification document (which I expect does not exist, or is a couple of sentences). Etc. etc.. Get their beloved AI, which built the system, tell them how diabolical it is. You cannot tell them this. They have to learn it themselves, and they trust what AI tells them.\n\nIf that success, then craft a prompt to get it to agree with what likely you want to get to. For example: You want an output along the lines of \"this application proves a concept; that the functional requirements can be met. But this is not fit for production and is irrecoverable. It needs to be started again, by software engineers, who can guide the AI on tech stack, architecture, security, maintainability etc etc\". Get agreement to build a team which will largely vibe code, but will be composed of experts. Maybe then point them to resources which illustrate how AI is a software developer tool, not a replacement. Like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1oo6dae/claude_is_a_beast_tips_from_6_months_of_hardcore/) (there's loads out there, likely you know many). You want to move them towards the view that the process has to be in the hands of software developers, but that AI will be writing the code.\n\nTLDR: you can't persuade them this is terrible, and you can't move them from AI first development, but you could try to shape it to something workable.\n\nOh, and look out for a new job too anyway. Don't commit to only one path.\n\nHere's a lot of assumptions I have which underpin my thinking:\n\nThe exec does not have career experience of actually building software. There is no CTO / VP of Development with solid Engineering skills, or they are not respected within the exec and have little sway. The exec has a long history of asking why software takes so long to build, makes unreasonable demands, does not provide clear vision and tangible objectives. They have a disdain for software engineers and have long been suspicious of them but have never had the tools to contradict them.",

This may not be the case across all companies, but it was the case in FANG when I worked there.\n\nFrom a performance perspective, “lack of ownership” let’s call it, will lead to the SWE act defensive towards bugs and user feedback. Sure the AC might have not required this or there is scope creep, but ultimately the company pays you to own the end user experience end to end. So the tension between SWE and product manager, even if the SWE is in the right is seen negatively.",

Passion makes the job a lot easier - doing what you love, and all - but professionalism, doing the job you were hired to do well, is what really counts. I will say, though, if you’re dragging yourself into work in the morning, you should really question whether this is the right job for you, and I’d be concerned for you if you were doing this at the expense of your mental health.\n\nMore generally, you’ll find that a lot of people in the industry are like this. They don’t hate their job, find it challenging enough, but it is isn’t their undying passion. In some places you’ll find people who eat, sleep and breathe their domain, but most of the time it’s just something that pays the bills, and people go home to their families and hobbies when they clock out.",

This past October I landed an offer and have been working as a full time SWE.\n\nThe market absolutely sucks and it took me over a year just to find a role but the main thing I did was stay in community to help encourage me when I felt like throwing in the towel. Best of luck on your search!",

I see people telling you tot need to apply to 1000-1500 jobs. That’s not quite accurate. There’s some randomness to it all. The more you apply, the more you have a chance for finding something that aligns with you. But it’s not a guarantee, and some people luck out and find something sooner. \n- People are really bad with perspective. There’s nothing wrong with what you wrote about yourself, but there’s an issue of scale and perspective. How do you compare to all the other people currently looking? There’s no way to answer that, but it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. There will be a lot of people with similar backgrounds, better backgrounds, and worse backgrounds. You can’t control much except making yourself a better candidate and trying to give yourself as many opportunities as possible. \n\nAnyway, you have to just understand that rejection is a part of life, and it’s a part of the job search process. That’s easier said than done. \n\nRegarding false certainty, that’s just part of life. There is just a lot of uncertainty in life. If you’re a sports fan, there’s uncertainty in the outcome of a game. There’s what likely will happen, but no guarantee. Some don’t watch because of anxiety. Others watch and let the result really impact them, and others watch and move on with their lives. You could probably do fine in a lot of roles at a lot of companies. So can a lot of other people.",

Unfortunately those boom days are gone, but it is still not impossible.\n\nMy first recommendation is find a dev sweatshop and see if you can break in this way. You’ll get bent on the hours and make about the minimum wages, but it may open some doors for you.\n\nI also got a friend who is (hopefully) still in process of breaking in last year from working as a dev in startup, also making minimum wage in a vhcol area. His work experience was also horrid with years of wastes, but he made some very interesting projects that I believe impressed the startup folks to giving him a shot.\n\nNo sugarcoating but it is a lot of hard work, grit, and luck. Be willing to do anything and move anywhere, even at a minimum wage.. personally I had gave it all a go with a hard one year deadline of make it or try something else.\n\nGood luck",

        "body": "You’re not “bottom of the barrel,” but a CS degree with such a big gap and not much to show for it is a big red flag because no employer will ignore it.  \n  \nprogramming isn't out of the question, but you have NO chance at entry-level SWE unless you do something exceptional, because you’re no longer competing with new grads but with laid-off engineers who already have years of experience, This means Leetcode, courses, certs do nothing. What you need is visible proof you can ship, like a real app or something, so that website idea could be cool, if you actually do it.  \n  \nI think realistically your best options are SWE-adjacent roles (QA automation, DevOps junior roles, support/production engineering, data analysis with SQL and dashboards), government or university tech jobs, or small freelance or contract work.   \n  \nAs for the gap, don't hide it, just acknowledge it, explain it without drama, and then immediately talk about recent work that proves you can actually be taken seriously and be trusted, not someone literally did nothing for years.  \n  \nI know I'm being kind of mean, but I really do think you got this IF you start today and work seriously for a year. However, if you’re still asking “what should I do?” in six months, then it might be time to do some inner work to figure out this mental block you have.",

It might take months, maybe years, but if this is what you want to do, you have to approach it as something you love and not something you're nervous it will fail. If your financial situation is tight, then you make ends meet with jobs perhaps unrelated to software, but you keep working on a product you have in mind on the side. If coding, programming and software development is what makes you happy, you should do it regardless of income potential.\n\nYou seem confused about one important thing: you meld successful career/income with engineering. I think you should shift your mindset - if development is truly what you enjoy, do it regardless of success and income. Nowadays, those who succeed as engineers are both talented and lucky. So the most important thing to do is to continue developing software while networking, applying for jobs and/or trying a new startup. I know the latter might not seem very appealing to you, but it's the only way to sustain income while continuing to do what you love.",

At first I was panicking thinking \"shit am I supposed to know all these obscure things? I've never seen these nor have any idea what they're used for \".  But then after reading through the lines you were just supposed to rationale how things worked.  Like a type for a variable is blank but you can see the method setting it is returning Foo. And then the last blank was some class that  was the only import not used yet. Some were more challenging. But it seemed more practical like when you're actually walking through code trying to mentally put together how everything works. Idk if this is more common than I'm aware of but in the past I've always had miserable overly complex live coding assements usually with some ass hat who keeps telling me to talk him through what I'm doing when I'm trying to mentally work through it. As though waiting 20 minutes until I've actually finished to talk through my solution is just unfathomable.",

Basically I'm just the best SWE in a sea of mediocre or poor SWEs that would never get a job at an actual tech company.\n\nSo while you can say I have lots of experience and even leading teams of 20 SWEs on projects it's just not the same as somebody who has worked at multiple big tech companies over the years.  I still apply to all those big tech companies hoping to get a chance, but deep down I know I won't get an offer and just do the interviews I get for shits and giggles.\n\nFrankly I would take a new grad role at a big tech company if I could, but they won't down-level you that far.  The recruiters always want me to interview for Senior or Staff level and I'm just not going to be at that level. I'm probably mid-level SWE at a top tech company at best.\n\nI'm just not top tech company smart at the end of the day.  It probably doesn't help that I worked on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for all those years.

My husband's been seeing companies take 3-4 months to fill roles that used to get filled in weeks, and they're being stupidly picky about \"culture fit\" which usually just means they're scared to pull the trigger.\n\nThe interview process has gotten worse too - expect 4-5 rounds minimum now, and leetcode has crept into everything even for backend roles. Companies are doing this thing where they'll give you a take-home that's basically a mini project, then still make you do live coding anyway. It's exhausting.\n\nYour F500 experience is actually solid though, especially the k8s/cloud stuff. Non-tech companies are weirdly respected right now because everyone assumes you know how to work with legacy systems and actual business constraints vs just burning VC money.\n\nFor someone with your background I'd honestly skip the traditional job boards - they're even more of a black hole now. Platforms like Twill or Hired tend to work better for mid-level folks since you're not competing with 500 other applicants on the same posting.\n\nStart grinding leetcode again like now though. Even if the role is 90% backend architecture they're still gonna make you reverse a linked list or whatever. The bar hasn't gotten higher but the process has gotten longer and more annoying.",

We don't want to  pigeon hole you\" followed by sending me a Leetcode style algorithm test which seems like a pretty good benchmark to me that they either didn't listen or our goals are not really as aligned as they think.",

When it comes to Front End work items on our board in DevOps, I am usually the one that gets handed these types of tickets since front end work is pretty much straightforward and self explanatory. \n\n“Self-sufficient, don’t need handholding” — I’ve noticed probably within the past 4 months that for this portion I am starting to be more self sufficient, but occasionally I do need support or guidance getting through the work item. For instance, I had to edit a table (database migration for C#) on one of our database tables for an application that we are in the midst of building and kind of got lost. I had to nudge one of our lead developers for some assistance, but I still occasionally do need help with more difficult problems that I sometimes run into. \n\n“Can own features end-to-end” — for this specific point, this is NOT true with me. If you really do own features end to end I expect these to be more front end feature work items, but not back end stuff. I struggle with back end work items immensely. Correct me if I am wrong please!!!\n\n“Collaborate with other teams on system design and write ADRs” — At my company, we really don’t have “ADRs”. Sure we understand the things we work on, but my company is so small that having things like this does not really benefit us. For bigger companies I could definitely see the benefit of this. My coworker who has been doing Software Engineering for 15 years wrote up the architecture design documents and database schema for a new application we are releasing soon about 6 months ago. He knew EXACTLY how to get it done, how long it would take, and how hard it would be. That’s something I totally expect from someone with that much experience. \n\nIt also depends heavily on the work place you are at. Especially what you work on, how difficult it is, and if you are learning new things. \n\nI would say that from what you said in your post and comparing where I am at, we are probably in a similar spot. Now I don’t know how much you make, but I expect the next job you get (hopefully for me too) you will make substantially more. \n\nWhat I would work on for improving your knowledge is maybe look at more back end specific problems. I am currently working on a full stack application that calls a local database and uses REST to grab information from said database. I had a coworker who moved on to bigger and better things that told me back end development is where the big money is at. If you can understand that more, you will do great!",

Maybe use LLM to help and then make sure you understand what you made. Senior dev probably still modified or rejects solution.\n\n\nDevOps specifically just depends where you work. I found I need to know how CI/CD works and some basic to touching intermediate topics about AWS / K8 for interviews. I have only gotten the opportunity to write unit tests and update yaml files and deploy docker containers, so I can't speak there. I had dedicated DevOps teams at my other jobs.\n\n\nSo my opinion (that may not be that accurate) is learn as you go and get your work done in a timely manner. If you have time afterwards review the work and make sure you get it.\n\n\nWhen you get to interviews though, different ball park. They want you to know (in my experience):\n\n\nthe ability to system design large projects, solve medium LC's in 10-15 mins or a custom coding challenge, random trivia of basic to intermediate topics about your coding languages, varying levels of DevOps questions, SQL questions including asking specific syntax or make a query right now verbally or type in chat, strong behavioral stories that show impact and good team dynamics / easy to work with.. \n\n\nThen I got my job offer finally, and I'm potentially being bait and switched to doing lowcode despite needing to be some on paper super coder to get the job 😂",

I'd like to get back soon though. \n\nThis all depends on your circumstances, if you have friends and family to fall back on, you don't mind selling your home or moving, whether you have a family of your own that depends on you etc. \n\nWhen I was laid off a few years back I went into panic mode and landed plenty of interviews, I knew one manager who could tell I was a bit stressed. He interviewed me and offered me a position with no questions asked. I worked at that job for six months and learned it really wasn't for me and we parted ways. \n\nI took a step back and realized I had plenty of money in savings and also realized I didn't really want to work at that moment. I don't recommend just taking any job out of desperation if you can avoid it. I'm using my time off to relax, reflect, and become an even better developer.\n\nI feel for people with families and quality of life that needs to be maintained, I feel for people who go through this with a mortgage or health issues (I personally had to get on Medicaid when I lost my insurance). In those cases take whatever is on the table until something better comes along. I had interviews lined up within weeks when I was in panic mode. Now that I'm calm I can pick and choose roles that interest me. \n\nJust one thing to mention though about mental health, software development is a rapidly changing, confusing, and mentally taxing field. Going through a layoff in this field takes a toll on everyone, doesn't matter who you are. Try to stay positive and realize it's not your fault, you're just modernizing. You're not useless or undervalued, and you don't lack skill. You will make a comeback in this field. Take the high salary they'll give you in your next position and make sure to save enough for the inevitable rainy day, do this until you're six feet under or computers cease to exist.",

It made him seem like he was the most qualified candidate even though he probably wasn't and he got the job. Now, 2 years later, he's still doing great at the company.

Eventually, you're gonna need to interview, and a lot of the good jobs out there will have this as part of their interview steps. Might as well start learning.   \nIn addition to it preparing you for interviews, I have the maybe unpopular opinion that studying these things can make you a better developer. It builds muscle memory in your language of choice, and forces you to think about solving problems in certain ways.",

The system isn't about working harder. It's about **making the invisible workload visible** so you can manage it without burning out. It turns ambition into a sustainable action plan. I liked the method so much I built a free digital tool to do it visually. If having that kind of visual project manager for your career pivot would help, I'm happy to DM you the link.",

I billed them $500+ USD for this but not before giving them an estimate and plan. \n\nSo OP, it’s criminal that your assessment is not paid. And as others have mentioned, even if you’ve done it, it’s not guaranteed that they will read, test and give feedback. And it will break you mentally after learning and building something so intensively just to get ghosted. \n\nFYI, I did pass mine and got an offer, as well as feedback after the assessment. Which is the best case scenario, paid intense work, feedback + offer. Also for context, this assessment is requested after 3 rounds of interviews.\n\nI do not recommend you taking the assessment because you’re technically not in the interview loop yet, and your worse case scenario is unpaid intense work (and not sure if you’ve done it properly since it’s your first time), no offer + no feedback. You should only do so if you’re prepared to face the worst.",

They're also the ones who can keep your name around for future consideration if you don't get hired, which _you very much want_. Most people I knew at Google failed their first hiring attempt but were contacted again later because their names were on file and passed later rounds.\n\n\nNot all of them are great.

Has this person's actions impeded the project in an objectively measurable way?\n\nIf the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you need to speak to your manager.

You're likely to get probed about it so it's best to be prepared. Technical-wise, focus on LeetCode mediums and understand the time/space complexity like the back of your hand. For implementation rounds, practice writing clean, testable code quickly; it personally helped me to time myelf while coding to sort of simulate what I'd encounter during interviews. I also recommend checking out [company-specific interview guides](https://www.interviewquery.com/companies), since some companies focus more on certain rounds like system design while others are more holistic with how they review your performance.

It feels like 90% of CS people these days do some form of web dev.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn’t do a masters degree at all. Masters degrees cost a lot of money, and I doubt they will increase job prospects.\n\nI think doing a PhD program is a wiser choice. PhD programs pay you to be there, rather than you paying them.\n\nTake myself as an example: I did a CS undergrad and then I did a Neuroscience PhD. Best decision of my life. Doing a neuroscience phd not only allowed me to explore a new field, but I still got to code every single day.\n\nSo pick a field that you want to apply your coding skills to. What interests you? Biomedical engineering? Archaeology? Pick anything - just not “CS”. Then go do a PhD in that field.",

Good startup.  \n  \nUltimately, I doubt anyone cares how you produce code as long as it's in on time. AI definitely bumps those expectations up, it's almost impossible to move at that pace without at least a basic LLM.\n\nI would redefine how you look at AI and what you think you're learning. Writing good code is a premium - whether it's AI-assisted or handwritten. You're still tackling design and best practices, no messy unexplainable code should get greenlit. Code reviews and standards are still a thing, and arguably emphasized more; you'd need to be the kind of engineer who's broader-thinking and knowledgeable.\n\nIf the job is really a \"joke\" (I haven't heard of any job that is), it probably won't last. I'd consider career growth internally or externally and ask that question\n\nVibes-based interview, you said?

A degree can signal depth of knowledge and can sometimes unlock interview doors at larger firms, but it also costs time and money that you could spend building a stronger portfolio, contributing to open‑source projects, or sharpening niche skills that are in high demand for MLE roles (like large‑scale model deployment, MLOps pipelines, or advanced NLP). Since you already have a referral that got you into a big company, leverage that network to get more internal referrals and ask for informational chats at target firms; those conversations often matter more than a piece of paper. Meanwhile, keep your resume tight by highlighting measurable impact (e.g., performance improvements, cost savings, productionized models) and consider short, targeted certifications or workshops if you need a specific skill gap filled. When you start applying, broaden your search beyond the usual big‑tech listings—platforms that aggregate remote and on‑site opportunities can surface roles that match your experience and career goals without the extra overhead of a full program. One such site you might find useful is [Mercor](https://work.mercor.com?referralCode=561d8e89-98bf-43d2-abb9-d4ab0c46b1ba&utm_source=share&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform_referral).

        "body": "Entry-level/junior cyber security is super competitive to get into. Having a CS bachelors degree helps but not having worked in a related field since you graduated 7 years ago massively reduces it's value. THM/HTB are good for building skills but they're not going to add meaningful value to your CV. Same with certs really. Your problem is that you're going to be competing with fresh grads and people with professional tech experience. As someone with a stale degree, and a patchy work history that will raise serious concerns, I think you're going to struggle to break into the field.\n\nEven then, if you do somehow manage to get your foot in the door, is it the right field for you? Cybersecurity can be high stress and a lot of jobs are in consultancy where you'll face those billable hours you dislike so much. If you came across as someone who is super-excited about cybersecurity, I'd be more inclined to say go for it. However, you strike me more as a lost soul struggling to find direction in life who's considering cyber because you're out of ideas. I think you should spend more time reflecting on what you're good at, what sort of work suits your personality and see if you can figure out a field that might be a better fit for you.",
