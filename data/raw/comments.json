There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.\n\n10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.\n\n5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.\n\nIn the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring. Okay, they found plenty of candidates that can code, can interpret data, and have AWS experience, now can we narrow the list down to candidates that have specifically our industry experience? The answer to that is yes, companies can do that now; there's just so many candidates.\n\nIf you've been in the workforce long enough, you'll start to notice trends.

I look at a recent platform cert as a checkbox that verifies “this person can use the interfaces and functionality of this platform.” It absolutely does not say anything to me about the candidates ability to problem solve and deliver…just that they can use the platform. \n\nOther types of certs, like a python/sql/etc cert or a generic data engineering cert, or even a boot camp mean next to nothing. You should have a portfolio or be able to walk through some project details to demonstrate the higher level knowledge that would be covered by those certs. \n\nFor me personally, I would pursue a cert as a means to learn something new and to be able to brag about it online afterwards😝 kinda kidding. \n\nAs an example, I’m using Fabric for the first time and would consider the cert as a way to guide and test my learning. I’d put it on my resume to validate that I can use the platform. But if I’m learning something like data modeling, I will probably try to find a toy project to add to my portfolio instead of a cert. If I saw a candidate with a data modeling cert, they better be able to back it up with some hands on experience otherwise it’s meaningless by itself.",

Before AI was being used widely it was ghost interviewers and people whispering answers or at least typing answers in a screen the interviewee could read. I've had catfishers interview then a different person onboards. It happens, we just need to be better at detecting and stopping it.  There will always be people who lie their way into jobs though. \n\nJust last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. \n\nWe had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand the question\". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. \n\nI think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions. Not to \"trick\" the AI, or to somehow catch them in a lie, but to help us understand if they have the basic knowledge we're looking for.",

Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. \n\nWhats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.\n\nSecond Answer:\n\nUse polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.\n\nJust 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.\n\nThe main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

I've built houses, boxes, fences and doors. I know how to frame, tile roof, and even straighten a car bumper with it. What tool should I learn next? Im eyeing a skilsaw, nail gun, and even power drill.\"\n\nInstead, focus on the meta. That is: engineering for solving business problems. The tool you use to build systems doesnt matter as much as successful execution and bringing value to the business. Can you model processes? If someone gave you a process model, can you translate that into technological implementation? Can you translate a process model into a data model?\n\nIf you wanna get better at python, do leetcode exercises and learn data structures and algorithms. By accident, you will learn how to program in general— in any language. The real value is in learn how to think abstractly and creating an algorithm that will solve the business need efficiently and correctly. The brand of language or server is a political opinion or strategic decision (eg: python has the best tooling for DS).\n\nIf you want to learn system design, build a python app from zero, no framework. It'll teach you how to organize code, how to build mental models around your code, separation of concerns, IO, dataflow, system orchestration, deployments, etc. Learn what tools exist within your ecosystem of choice. This will give you what you need to think abstractly— macro decision making, not micro. Focus on big picture like a tech lead (not like a CEO or CTO, thats too big picture).\n\nYou know how to use a hammer very well already. Time to become an architect, too.",

The last SQL Server was switched off 17 years later. \nMy path away from Microsoft started with an EdX free course on learning Linux. I  learned that Shell scripting could do way more than I had realised. Powershell was in its early years so this increased my interest in Powershell too.\n\nBecause of the deadly duos rabid hatred of Microsoft I had to learn a lot in a short space of time on an alien OS and with a lot of alien tech. One of the system admits taught me some basic Docker skills. This let me build a small set of images for the tech we were migrating to.  As a Dockerfile is a very small I could reproduce it at home to build the images I wanted.\n\nI'd say basic Docker skills are essential even if all you do is build your own learning labs.  Look for courses by Nigel Poulton.\n\nFor Python, make sure you get comfortable with virtual environments. Again, ring fenced learning but you will need this in a Python environment.\n\nLearn about PyTest and Behave for testing your Python code. There are some specific data testing libraries out there. \n\nOnce you build learning labs and are comfortable with testing approaches, life becomes a lot easier.\n\nI built an ETL framework using an early version of Spark. It was effective, what the CTO insisted on, but was overkill for the barely TB data we had at the time. I'm amazed its so widely used given that few companies genuinely have Big Data problems.  Databricks has Spark at its heart.\n\nLearn for the job you want and to keep the job you have.",

Most companies have only a few tools for data engineering, orchestration layer and logic layer. Airflow and databricks for example. Pick a cloud provider, orchestration tool, data lakehouse/warehouse platform and start doing little projects. Like airflow orchestrates databricks notebook that pulls a dataset from azure datalake storage and then run a databricks notebook to convert the file to a delta table. Or durable function pulls API data and writes to bronze layer of databricks. \n\nYou can pick whatever tech you decide I just mentioned those because it’s the route I decided to go down but I also incorporated snowflake just for a more overarching reach. \n\nPython can be learned along the way but it seems a little aimless to just sit down and “learn Python” for something that is as specific as data.engineering",

The major warehouses are shipping with CDC tools to replicate data from your Postgres/MySQL/etc so that you don't have to build that anymore. And more and more SaaS vendors will export data directly to your warehouse, so that you don't really have to build those either. AI will be able to do a lot in terms of glueing that together. \n\nWhere I think data engineers will spend much more of their time in the future is on something much more valuable, actually building data products (internal and external) that derive value from the data. Every org I've worked at wants to be data driven, but the people in the business domains have really weak \"data reasoning skills\". I don't think AI fixes that because it won't help you if you don't know the right questions to ask. So my bet is that you'll have data engineers/scientists/analysts converging more and more into a role where they need to bridge that gap to make all this data we've collected valuable.",

The rules don’t apply any more. \n\nHere’s what I would do (as a leader.. this is what I’m looking for). I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-\n\n1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. \n2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. \n3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. \n\nStart with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. \n\nMicrosoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. \n\nOne thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you. So figure out how to make it your puppet, you will win. \n\nYou WILL have an aha moment after 2-3 months and it will kick in. You will feel like you have a new superpower and feel like you have new energy. Every engineer I work with internally and externally has this moment if they break through the initial inertia - but it’s exhausting for those who have been grinding for years. \n\nYou got this!",

The fundamentals are still the same, so once you are able to figure out what the parallels are between the old and new tools you'll be in good shape.\n\nLearning Python is highly recommended, with maybe Go or TypeScript as a backup language. Learning how to use Pandas and later PySpark will help too. Data pipelines are now typically coded by hand in a programming language, or else configured in a tool like DLT or Bruin (ingestion tools) along with other tools like DBT for transformation. Definitely not impossible to transition, but be aware that it's a very different world than ODI, DataSphere, Cognos, Talend, or Informatica.",

        "body": "Agreed with other comments that this comparison doesn't make much sense, but just to go into a little more detail as to why...\n\nBigQuery and Athena are both serverless cloud offerings. BigQuery abstracts away storage *and* compute. Athena abstracts away only compute, as you need to connect it to your object storage, but fundamentally, it's at least a little similar as an offering. You're not managing infrastructure with either of them, and they'll scale up parallelization to whatever level is necessary to ensure you get query results back in a reasonable amount of time. Because they're both built on serverless billing models, costs are very high on a query-by-query basis, but this can still be competitive in a real-world scenario if you have relatively low daily utilization.\n\nCompare that to DuckDB, where you're using dedicated hardware with an embedded, columnar database. It abstracts away nothing - you're providing the hardware for storage and the hardware for compute. This is radically different. It works well at small scales, and because you're managing everything, it's great for heavy utilization and is extremely cost-effective on a query-by-query basis. It's also not distributed at all. Once you scale up past what a single machine can handle, you have graduated from DuckDB and need to move to something that can distribute the workload and handle scale.\n\nFundamentally, they're different tools solving different problems. So when you run a benchmark with 20 GB of data, you're using a very small scale of data that DuckDB is built for and which BigQuery/Athena are not. Because there's no downtime in benchmarking, you're also simulating what is effectively 100% utilization, the least favorable scenario for a serverless billing model. Of course DuckDB is going to end up looking good.\n\nThe way to meaningfully compare them on cost, at least, if you were for some reason trying to decide between these different options, would be to look at a simulated full month of usage. The hardware you're running DuckDB on costs \\~$1500 for a month on EC2, or maybe \\~$7500 in up front hardware costs if you have it on-site. You'd need to run \\~1700 queries a day on BigQuery to get a similar monthly bill, or \\~13500 of the narrow queries on Athena. You could certainly cut your hardware costs for DuckDB by a lot for this workload, but also, are you running 13000 queries a day?",

Scaling concerns are real but manageable at current volume. We are considering moving out of R2 to dedicated storage servers with appropriate redundancy. This is decent amount of initial engineering effort that's not documented in the study.\n\nYour break-even math is useful context though.

For me it was great experience, since I was not blocked by anything and could experiment and learn hands-on. If you mess up sth, that’s their fault they didn’t hire someone more experienced to help you. Read a lot, use AI to check ideas and don’t be afraid of mistakes. You’ll make progress in a year which guys in huge companies do in few years.",

For example if you order by ID, but then query by let’s say first name, performance hit would be be significant.\n\nI would say it’s a very good and cost effective engine, but even the cloud version, there are several “quirks” that you might stumble upon, compared to like snowflake which I would say works out of the box.

The main python asset imports those helpers and then executes the actual logic of batch processing the extraction and loading to our datalake (hive configured).\n\nFor transformations, we have mostly moved away from python to sql since we can directly query external tables created from our hive datalake. But we still sometimes use python for the first layer where the data is weird file formats (like grib, netcdf, etc.) that require special processing - in such cases we read the files, convert to a dataframe, and then materialize it in our dwh. Our data platform's own built-in python materialization automatically handles incremental strategies and variable injections.\n\nThere are also very rare cases where data needs to be processed in a way thats not possible with sql - for example decoding airport weather reports like metar/taf, which require special python libraries to decode.\n\nTo answer your question about frameworks - we write functional code with very minimal object-oriented programming. For my team the rule of thumb is that a single python file/asset should contain all the logic tied to a single data entity/table/model. We never use notebooks (unless for quick local testing and adhoc stuff). In some cases, we extract different data from a single API endpoint, so for those cases we create a separate agent/helper to connect to the API and configure the parameters - this is the only case where we use a bit more oop.",

Don’t go too deep because there’s a lot of technical stuff once you get deep in the docs, but understanding at a basic level the different functionalities is useful. For example, when just writing to a database and you KNOW you’re using a PostgreSQL database, it might be better to use psycopg2 directly instead of calling SQLAlchemy so you have more direct access instead of going through an intermediary. You might also consider adding in some basic orchestration to this project just to demonstrate you’re able and to understand how orchestration is handled. I would also look into how you would want to transform the data. I always recommend Polars over Pandas if you’re going with Python. The new Pandas update to 3.0 provides solid benefits, but the syntax is still very unpythonic and painful for beginners.",

As most of the bootcampers seemed to only be familiar with the 'happy' path. \n\nIf you need a guided education and someone to drive you to complete things by dates, maybe they're good. But they're often not cheap and if you can self direct the amount of free tutorials and project guides online are more than sufficient and often essentially the same as the bootcamps would cover. I personally wouldn't recommend it unless they have job placement services that are well reviewed by past candidates.",

For actual looping use either (1) do the loop in a driver notebook or (2) keep ADF as the orchestrator and just trigger Databricks jobs. So no, you don’t have to write everything in notebooks, but the foreach part is usually code or external orchestration.\n\nIf you redesign, the main win is fewer tiny jobs and fewer cluster spin-ups. One job run that reads the control table and processes a batch is usually cheaper and faster than 200 little runs. Also, if you are ingesting lots of files, people often go auto loader or DLT to cut orchestration overhead.\n\nAlso lol at being told six hours ago, classic.",

I should build a utility so it can be used for other implementations as well.\n\nEach notebook does a notebook.exit on success or failure and returns a json with relevant pieces of information for audit and easier debugging.\n\nFrom a cost perspective, the batch approach (which I am using right now) should be cheaper than DLT or Autoloader, right ? I am right now going through the DLT and autoloader documentation to see how these can be used to ease up migration.\n\nAgain, really appreciate taking time out to share your experience.",

That is, in a client-server environment where the client runs on a machine controlled by somebody other than you, you must always assume that the client can be compromised.\n\nThat means the client can do whatever they want with everything in your static files and everything that's returned from every API endpoint. If there are particular kinds of data that only specific users should be able to read/write, then that **must** be carefully enforced on the backend.\n\nWhen you write any kind of frontend code, you're essentially sending it to users and asking them nicely to run it as-is. Ordinary users will do so (or rather, their browsers will). Attackers will ignore it and do whatever they want.\n\n(Corollary: if the user themselves is not malicious, but their client machine has been compromised by somebody else or by malware, then there isn't much you can do to protect them. The best you can do is protect yourself and other users from their attack.)",

Once a variables type is determined, it can't be changed. There's some flexibility with casting and umbrella types, but you can't fundamentally change something.\n\n```java\nString a = \"hello\"; \na = 5;  // this won't even compile \nvar b = \"hello\"; \nb = 5;  // this won't compile either\n```\n\nAlso read up on compiled vs scripting languages.\n\nCompiled languages often require you have to fix certain types of issues before you can run the code. Scripting languages tend to be more forgiving of certain issues, but can hide bugs that should have been caught sooner. It's quite easy to write python code that will blow up at runtime and your IDE won't tell you. It's also possible to do this in Java, but between the compiler and IDE tooling, it's harder to have this happen, and you likely have IDE warnings about it.",

First, in a coarse overview and then flesh out each feature/function in detail.\n\nThis document is the base for your programming. Everything in there is what you need to do. Not more, not less. If you have an idea to extend it, *append* it to the document, but do not yet even think about implementing it. Get the basic functionality working first. All that you append is \"optional\".\n\nThe key to everything is the FDS. The more time and consideration you spend on it, the better you plan, the easier it will become to implement.\n\nVague specifications help nobody and lead only to the block you describe.\n\n> someone suggested tools that help you plan before coding. tried verdent and a few others.\n\nDedicated tools are not necessary. A simple text editor, or a proper text processor (like Word, Libre/OpenOffice Write, Google Documents) are all you need to get started. Don't overthink the tooling here. The more specialized a tool is, the more time you have to spend *learning* it, the less you can focus on the actual *content*. Simpler is better in that case.\n\n>  theres so many decisions before you write a single line\n\nAnd this is exactly what is necessary. The better you plan, the better your outcome.\n\n*Code* is the unimportant part of programming. It's only a necessary evil that we need to tell the computer what we want it to do. The *planning*, the *decisions*, the *considerations* are what really count.\n\n*Code* can be implemented by every \"code monkey\", but *planning* is what makes a *software engineer/designer*.\n\nI can give a well prepared FDS to somebody who can write code, but doesn't understand anything about the type of software I want to make and they will be able to program it.\n\nYet, there isn't a detailed FDS, even the best programmer will be completely lost.\n\n-----\n\nWhere you actually start, at the database, at the main functionality, is a different matter and often preference.\n\nI like to start with the database so that I have my fundamental construct.\n\nThen, I work on the main entry point of the program - this is the very first actual *code* that I write - it's sort of the \"ice breaker\".\n\nThe biggest hurdle is always the first line, the first few statements. After that, the flow becomes natural. Yet, of course, this requires experience, and it will get easier with gained experience.\n\n----\n\nAs always with similar posts, some books to consider:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold",

You already made a partial \"list\" in your post. And then implement these one by one. Does not matter if you make a UI first, a database first or a backend/API first. Then it is just however you test that the thing works, it differs. With database you have to use SQL queries. With API you have to use REST calls (unless you use something other besides REST). etc. The order does not matter in your case.\n\nYes, there is a system design and architecture and such in real life projects and some things do have an order, but you are just figuring out how to implement a thing and how a stuff works. Do not consider how the things are done in the real life. Before you haven't made a working app.\n\nAnd yes, there are many decisions before you write a single line. The same way there are many decisions before you lay the first brick when building a house. You can't just lay bricks anywhere you want or however you want. Software development has a planning phase. But this is where the splitting it all into pieces and putting into a list comes in. Why I mentioned it in my first paragraph. Create a list of achievable micro-goals and start implementing these one by one. \n\nYour app is an \"app\" (e.g. a mobile app)? Cool. Pick some totally random tutorial for getting the most barebones mobile app up and running. If it is not an \"app\" as a mobile app but a web application then pick a simple \"Hello world\" web application tutorial, to get it to return \"Hello world\" when run. If your application has a graphical side then get whichever \"canvas\" type working first. And then just add features on that canvas.",

Others have suggested specific design document formats but I think the most important thing is to have something you can use to guide your programming. It should be detailed and specific enough that you could hand it to an experienced programmer and they’d have enough information to start implementing.\n\nI’d also suggest having a concept of an “MVP”, or “minimum viable product”. What’s the absolute minimum set of features that constitute a version of the idea that you’d be happy with? Start with that, add the rest of your ideas afterwards.\n\nI personally find that it’s easiest to start with something that I can actually see working, so for example in your budgeting app you can start with a page that displays your budget overview. Where does the budget information come from? Don’t worry about that yet, just add some hard-coded numbers. Once you’ve done that pick a number that you want to be “real” and build that, hooking it up to the UI. Now you have one real field and a bunch of fake ones. Pick another field to actually implement.

I had to swap to a different library and luckily (this time!) my code did not contain many assumptions about how the graphics work, so the swap was relatively pain free. \n\n**Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate:** \n\nE.g.: \n\n* The app tells me how much money I have left. \n* I enter something I have bought.\n* I enter something I wish to buy.\n* What I have bought has a name and a price.\n\nYou can think of these as questions you need to answer. If you were the budget planner for a large organisation, there would be questions people would continuously ask you. If you wrote those down and for every question you wrote down how come you know the answers, you would have the beginnings of a system.\n\nReal processes used by real people can tell you a lot about what your app must be able to handle. If you start with \"I would like a steak cooked by a Michelin level chef\" you are probably going to get there slower than if you start with \"what goes into a really good steak and who can tell me this?\"\n\n**Identify then build the core functionality first:**\n\nIf you want to start a website that can handle a billion requests per second, start with the code the takes then dispatches the requests (load balancers). For a much quieter website you would probably tackle other tasks first.\n\nIf you want to make a game in which you fly a space ship, fight pirates and trade goods, make sure the ship handles well (i.e. the interface in which the user spends 95% of their time). \n\nFiguring out what the core functionality is though can be the real brainteaser.\n\nIf there are parts of your app that are a known quantity (i.e. others have already solved this bit and documented their solutions) and parts that are not, the latter might be a good candidate. What is your USP, what makes your app stand out from the others?\n\nExample: [how the video game Lemmings was designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5-lH3lZqrg) (YT, 4 mins).",

I've been assured by every exec ever that anyone can build apps with LLMs now... /s\n\nAssuming we're talking web applications, after I've got the spec/requirements down I've always liked to start with the data. So I will usually design database schemas to 3NF and write the DDL. I can then use this to bring up a database instance. Then I write a quick DML seeding script. Then I put together a server application in whatever language I've chosen. I've been around a while so I've written a good few auth/perm systems so I have code for that in JS/PHP which is usually what I'm using. Then I work on the back end API, adding things I need as I go (e.g. job queues, caching, etc.) Finally, I put the client together (personally my least favourite part, maybe why I do it last if it's me doing it). \n\nThere's usually no reason you need to do back/front in any particular order and it's common to do them in parallel too (different teams etc.). I do think that starting with the data, which flows through the entire app, adds a certain clarity and certainty to things, but really anything goes if you don't mind lots of going back to revise.\n\nMy \"plan\" is usually my thinking beforehand and any diagrams I've doodled, as we don't create formal design docs as part of our process. We gather requirements, write software, document the result. I will put effort into writing a technical design doc if I'm handing it off entirely though. I basically short-circuit the written spec part if I'm also the implementer.\n\nFor a personal project, I think the answer is to just think, and make whatever notes/doodles you feel are necessary. How do you want to distribute/deliver it to users? What data is needed at what point? What interactions? How do you want interactions to go? How do you want it to look? Do you need common things that a framework would be able to provide? Etc.\n\nThings that you haven't considered will usually present themselves. Things you have considered will change. If you understand how everything works it all comes together as you work on it more, so my main advice is to be clear enough about what you want that you can start work, and then start writing code.",

Then move on to one with API key auth and do the same, then move on to one that has OAuth and do it again. \n\nOnce you've done that go to [https://restful-api.dev/](https://restful-api.dev/) \\- try creating a record with a POST method, take the ID from the response and GET it. Once you can GET it, try to PATCH and PUT it, then ultimately DELETE it. You can practice this loop.\n\nREST API docs will make much more sense to you at this point when you actually understand auth and what the verbs are for. This knowledge is directly translatable to GraphQL queries and mutations, there are many guides, this is a decent one to see the difference between RESTful GET requests and GraphQL queries [https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql) \n\nAPIs are typically intuitive because we have common conventions, but you have to actually understand those conventions first.

So what I did was start a new project (it's a console-based resource-grinding game with some light story set in The Elder Scrolls universe) and starting very small with just some dialogue and choices. I set up a Trello board and broke all my tasks into \"main quests\" and \"side quests\" (things I'd like to do but are on the backburner) and broke them down into SUPER small pieces. That has given me nice dopamine hits when I get to check off those tasks as complete. It's also way more interesting to me because I love games, and this is something I actually look forward to playing myself when I get it into a more complete or at least MVP state.\n\nAlso, (this may be controversial) using AI to talk through the issue or design I'm thinking off. Not ***ever*** using it to solve the problem or make me code, but rather \"I want to do X in my project, give me a word or two I can google to start my search\" so I have something specific to look up on Stack Overflow or the Ruby docs. That way when I get stuck I'm not just banging my head against the wall because I'm not even sure what to search, I have some breadcrumbs that get me started but I'm never actually relying on the AI to code for me or even give me the full answer.\n\nI work at a large tech company and those are the tips that a programmer friend gave me and I've been finding so much more success in the last few weeks than ever before :)",

Do not come to ask for help when you haven't done your best in trying to solve it.\n\n8)You know web application security on some level.

It isn't that learning some technologies deeply won't matter eventually, just that you're probably a few thousand hours away from the point where that matters.\n\nBasically, if you haven't reached the point where you already know a few languages and are starting to have opinions of their upsides and downsides, it is too early to worry about focusing on anything.

You spend years slowly spiralling your knowledge and understanding of a topic over years, probably for 12 or 13 years at the minimum. As such, when you are introduced to a 'new topic', it's 98% old knowledge. It is built on structures where a lot of the new thinking is given to you and slowly removed bit by bit until you are doing it yourself. This teaches you are taught that learning isn't really too hard, and you should be succeeding almost immediately before moving to the next topic. \n\nWhen you learn something novel it's not a slow progression over years, it's probably a logistics function of logistic functions for each topic. That is, the initial concept is pretty easy, then it becomes hard as fuff where you feel like an idiot for ages, but you eventually learn the concept and it gets easy. But, because you are constantly learning, at no point do you ever feel like a master, or even competent. \n\nI firmly believe that 'good' programmers are people who accept that they will always struggle stuff that they are just learning and can realise exactly how much they've learned. \n\nSo, what's the lesson for you?\n\n- Accept that you might need to take smaller steps, and that's okay. \n- After you learn something, make your own version of the questions/problems, and solve them as well. If you can't do that, go back to their questions and just change one small thing (like a variable) and write down what you think will change when you run it and then run it. Document if it runs the way you thought, and if it doesn't, keep playing until you get it. Then move to two things, then as many things as you can. \n- Think back to other things you've learned and ask yourself if you can incorporate those things as well, if so (and you probably can), make your own versions of those problems. \n\nYou'll likely find that giving yourself that space to learn how to solve those problems will mean that the next step will be easier.",

The level of complexity in restaurant POS systems (in terms of the full suite of features they offer and the level of customization that is possible) is pretty wild. If we ever do try to build our own POS, we would need to scale up our team significantly.\n\nMaybe you can find success if you identify some niche, are very opinionated with exactly which features should exist and how things should be done, and then successfully convince restaurants that your approach is worth it. But to go head to head with the big players in the space, there’s so much scope you are going to need to handle just to get to the point where your POS is sniffing anywhere close to feature parity… I just don’t see one or two people pulling it off.",

The best way is to do both Jonas course and Odin project side by side else you'll get stuck in tutorial hell.\n\nIf you think your teacher is using old way(it is always going to happen) just start building with latest way and navigate through errors.

        "body": ">Would love if someone could break down what networking actually means for a student who is not from a top college\n\nShort background, graduated in 2009 during recession from a school that probably doesn't exist on any CS rating radars. Took 1 year to find first IT job, 2 years to find first dev job. I was in similar shoes and my advice is what i've done.\n\n>I started posting on Twitter and committing to GitHub, but obviously nobody is watching. I don’t know if I’m supposed to keep doing this until someone magically finds me or if I’m doing it wrong.\n\nIs networking just talking to people online? Is it internships? Is it Discord servers? LinkedIn? Meetups? Or is it just something people say for the sake of saying? Networking is getting out and talking to people, not shooting messages into the avoid and hoping someone looks at your social media and goes \"this kids a genius\", thats not networking.\n\nYou need to find meetup groups in your area and start attending, meetup.com. This is a good way to get out there but with networking, you get out what you put in.\n\nIf you just go, attend, and don't talk to anyone, no ones going to know who you are / what you are doing tech wise and what you're looking for. So if you aren't socially outgoing, start working on that.\n\n>I kind of feel like I wasted most of college procrastinating. Now I’m doing DSA and web dev, but its late-very late and I know it. Also I’m from a tier 3 college and people keep saying if you’re from a tier 3 college you basically HAVE to network or no one will even know you exist, so no one will give you a chance.\n\nI had similar experience, didn't do internships, didn't really hit my stride until my senior year of college when things started clicking for me and i felt like i was finally getting it. So the issue is jobs currently want experience / proof that you have some semblance that you know what you are doing. You're not going to like this but my suggestion to you is to work for free for a while.\n\nYou can either keep shooting resume's into the void for months / a year plus on end hoping for the best or you can get the experience you need to set you apart from your peers at similar points in your career.\n\nSure, you'll find the rare hiring manager that says \"i dont care about experience, i just want them to be curious\", in reality a lot of hiring managers are kind of dumb, don't know what they want, and just pray they don't hire an idiot and the best way to do that is to find someone that has proven experience.\n\nAssuming you can build / deploy an app (i tutored college students online and you'd be surprised at the number of students who could barely build something in their senior year much less know how to deploy it), I would start with chamber of commerce website for cities near you that you'd be willing to drive to if necessary. So call it a 25-50 mile radius.\n\nFrom there, look for non-profits and call up their volunteer coordinator and see if they have any needs / opportunities to build software / automate something that they don't have the money/expense to spend on. Off the shelf software / monthly subscription based software isn't as expensive as it was when i graduated these days so maybe they are more inclined to pay for services these days, but you'd be surprised the shoe string budgets some of these nonprofits operate on.\n\nOften times they are taking paper applications and manually retyping it back into a computer which wastes time. They setup temporary shelters and take intake on paper where if they had a laptop there, they'd cut that part out.\n\nLook at rec leagues in your area and see if any of these rec leagues have a need for software to manage teams/schedules/rosters. Some leagues barely have enough money to run the league itself much less any extras so they manage the league in spreadsheets. \n\n1/2",

It can be done, but the end results always cost more, are never finished, and often don't have any targets (requirements) to meet, except for the ones that come from the fires you need to put out today.\n\nThe idea in the past was that this was a good approach, when one took the initial efforts and retroactively fit a design onto it that represented the solution.  Then one would refactor the stuff into the design, and keep the design intact going forward.  The problem is that design has been so maligned that few people even study it anymore, and after you study it you need to gain skill in it by doing a few projects, and projects that actually involve designing as any step (before or after) are so few and far between that you get \"shooting from the hip\" designs that are often inconsistent and difficult to use, if you get them at all.\n\nAPIs are supposed to be the most stable portions of integration.  If they aren't, then I hate to see what your integration and backwards support plans look like.",

That said, if you did do changes to your code without these before, you can improve code quality without. I am saying this, because it can seem that you are not allowed to improve code quality before you learn about two or more different things. (But since unittest is build into the standard library, maybe give it a try and write some simple tests for the functions you change!)\n\n\\- \"but I’m worried that even then it will still feel messy\". Yes, it will still feel messy, but thats just the first step, that enables the next ones. Its a journey and while the goal \"tidy code\" can be helpful as motivation it can also be overwhelming. \n\n\\- Talking about \"proceeding in steps\": A simple technique that can help is identifying sections in code, lines that belong together. Give these sections a comment saying what the section does. Then try to pull out that section into a function. The function name now can take the task that the comment had: It tells what happens, without the need to reading the whole function. Try to make the function only rely on the parameters you pass to it instead of \"global state\" (also called a \"pure function\"). This makes the function easy to test and to understand. This might not always be easy, but at least check if its possible. \n\n\\- There are a lot of helpful texts there – [https://refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a good online resource, Fowlers book \"Refactoring\" is also pretty helpful. Initially read them as inspiration, like browsing a cookbook, don't force yourself to use the methods immediately. Most likely, you will stumble upon a problem soon and be reminded of a section you have read. Then, find that section and give it a second read and try to follow its advice.",

Taking a big function and then making functions out of it often means that you're just switching between different functions, but have the same complexity.  That's often actually worse.\n\nBreaking things down into \"input, process, output\" helps dramatically, especially if you can then extract the \"output\" to a separate method/object.  If your big function makes a call to an API, does something with it, makes a call to another API, etc?  Try to separate at those boundaries, or push things to the end.  A useful pattern can be to gather up all of the changes you want in your function, and then apply them at the end.\n\nOne strategy I've often used is to \"chop the tail\".  What that means is finding the very last thing the function does, and then creating a new function at that point, taking all of the data it needs as parameters.  You can then work through the function as a whole.  This differs from the \"substep\" method because you can, when you make that final call, basically forget about what happened before that.  If you call that last function with the right parameters, then the previous function was correct.  That's also where things like mock objects come into play.",

        "body": "I learned C from books because I am old. ;) But more seriously: check the library for an intro to C textbook. Every one I've ever seen was at least a good intro.\n\nI wouldn't be too worried about being embarrassed in labs about beginner mistakes; that's what class is for. If you already knew C, the class wouldn't be helpful.\n\nRelative to other languages, it helps to understand C's memory model, because it's a lot closer to what actually happens under the hood in the computer and getting confused about it is the source of a lot of errors. \n\nSo, in C, you have two places data is stored in memory: the stack and the heap. The stack is where any variables in your functions live. If you say `int number = 5;`, that puts a `5` on the stack (hey folks who actually know C: yes, I know about registers, keeping it simple to start with, yeah?). Generally, stuff on the stack lives there until the function returns, then *everything* on the stack for that function goes away. That's all the variables you declared in your function and everything passed into the function (all the stuff passed into a function, the function gets a copy of).\n\nThe heap is where longer-lived stuff goes. You get a chunk of heap by going `int* pointer_to_number = malloc(sizeof(int));`. That gives you some int-sized chunk of memory somewhere, and what `malloc` actually returns is a *pointer* to that memory. Now, `pointer_to_number` is a variable (on the stack) that holds an address of something in the heap. You can treat the pointer like a number (if you try to print it and tell print \"it's a number,\" for example, it'll just be the memory address where the data is stored). If you want to modify the data on the heap, you can go `*pointer_to_number = 13;`. The star there means \"I want to mess with the stuff pointed to, not the pointer itself.\" If you wanted to change what the pointer points to, you could go `pointer_to_number = pointer_to_some_other_number;`. Note the lack of a star.\n\nNow here's the place where people get messed up most often: C has no way to know when you're done with the memory `malloc` gave you. It needs *you* to tell it that. So when you're all done with the memory you got handed, you call `free(pointer_to_number);`. That will say to the memory manager \"Hey, that pointer you malloc'd me awhile back? All done with it; something else can use that memory.\" If you forget to do that, when your function returns and the variables holding the pointer go away, the pointed-to memory can't be found anymore and you \"leaked\" it; that memory is stuck with a 'used' flag on it and nobody else can use it.\n\nThe other thing about C is that it's a language with few 'guardrails' and makes it very easy to screw up the memory model or machine state. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you probably just break the memory manager and it'll do screwy stuff in your program from that point forward (modern operating systems give every program its own copy of `malloc` itself so you can't break the *whole computer's* state that way; worst-case-scenario, you can always quit the program and when it terminates all the memory it was using is properly given back to the operating system, including anything `malloc`'d). If you `malloc` a small amount of memory and then try to cram something big in there, C will cheerfully write the big thing past the end of the memory you reserved and clobber whatever's in the next chunk of memory. If you take a pointer to something on the stack (using the `&` operator) and then try to hold onto that pointer and then return from the function where that stack-thing lives, it'll get freed but your pointer will still be around and now it's pointing to the wrong thing. And probably the biggest foot-gun in the language: strings are just pointers to the first character of the string, so if you `malloc` some memory to hold a string and then forget now much you malloc'd and write a longer string than will fit in that memory, you will rip right into some other data in memory squirting random characters into it and you'll have a bad time.\n\nIn a lot of ways, C is *way* simpler than other languages. That simplicity puts a lot of complexity on you, the user.",

Therefore, if I can stick the whole game in 1 file, then that's all it will take, and I organize the classes and methods based on what gets called first in the render method. I remove all need for fancy features, such as special effects, game-ending scripts, and features that don't add to the product's goal, such as cosmetics, unless they unlock the exact feature or mechanic I am trying to highlight.

The program can ask yes/no questions until it guesses what you’re thinking of.\n\nIf it guesses wrong, it asks: “What question should I have asked to get this right?”\n\nStore that answer, and it improves next round.\n\nOnce you understand linked lists and binary trees, this is very doable and surprisingly satisfying.\n\nNot for everyone, I know. You may think this is boring or slightly insane 😁\nBut for me, these kinds of projects teach a language far better than grinding puzzle sites.",

No need to reinvent the wheel.\n\n3.

If you were learning to program as an undergrad CS student, there'd almost certainly be a course in your second or third year that would involve writing a simple HTTP server in C (hint: implement HTTP 1.0, not 1.1, it's way easier).\n\nThere's something really cool about having something you're already familiar with, like your web browser, having a real, successful conversation with an app that you wrote from scratch, and displaying some cool result.\n\nThe exact mechanics of how to implement will wildly vary by language, but really understanding what ports and sockets and addresses and listening and such mean is very helpful, and the concepts will transfer as you move between languages.\n\nThere are lots of famous textbooks in this space. The Tanenbaum is probably the most famous, that's \"Computer Networks\" by Andrew Tanenbaum.\n\nThere are also many great college courses covering computer networking with all of their lectures and assignments posted online. Simply going through one at your own pace may be a great way to get an expensive education for free (excepting the benefits of being able to ask questions). Good example: [https://sp26.cs168.io/](https://sp26.cs168.io/)\n\nOne thing to be aware of: writing HTTP servers quickly starts to involve parallelization and running multiple threads, and then it becomes partly about memory sharing and memory management, and then you're learning about mutexes, and pretty soon you'll find that learning networking quickly begins to overlap with learning systems programming and operating systems.

Now before this I was fine learning Python\n\nSorry, but you haven't really started *learning*. 2 months is nothing in terms of learning programming (in fact, in learning anything).\n\nYou will need to have way more patience and stop jumping subjects.\n\nWith 2 months in, you barely scratched the surface of Python and moved on to web dev already. Way too fast. You suffer \"shiny object syndrome\" - jump from one thing to the next without actually learning anything *in depth*. With this approach you will get nowhere.\n\nYes, there is a lot to learn and the learning never ends in programming, no matter what domain you take.\n\nThe way to go is to not look at the vast amount that is there, but to look at what is next, just like when climbing a mountain, you don't look at the summit but at the next step, at the path ahead.\n\nTake a *solid course*, not random youtube videos.\n\nFor web dev:\n\n+ [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org)\n+ [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)\n\nand later [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)\n\nFor Python, we commonly recommend the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.\n\n> The barrier to entry level is very high for a beginner like me. \n\nNo, it actually isn't. *You* made it high because of jumping around.  As I've said already: stick to one thing and learn it in depth.\n\nLearning anything is not a sprint. It is a marathon where slow and steady wins the race. You cannot speedrun learning.\n\nFor Python alone it takes upward of 6 months to become somewhat proficient yet far from competent, experienced, and good.\n\nFor web dev, you can learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS in about one or two months and then it takes another good 6 months with JavaScript and to puzzle everything together. Give 2 years and you become somewhat competent.\n\n> I've spent 80% of my time basically studying on paper everything, and 20% actually coding anything\n\nThat's the reverse ratio to what you should be doing: 70 to 80% practice, 20 to 30% theory.\n\nYou can only learn through active practice, not through reading.",

In those days we wrote out the entire program on paper, ran through it (still on paper) assigning numbers to variables, etc, to do the best we could to simulate its operation.  Why?  Because the program had to be typed onto punch cards and fed into a card reader, then run usually overnight.  You'd get a printout with a mass of compiler errors the next day, look at the various other reports, mark up the printout, and repeat until it ran correctly. \n\nThe point of telling you this is that it took such a long time to get computer output that we did everything we could to ensure that our logic and syntax were succinct and correct before submitting a job.  So we used flow charts, pseudo code,  walk-through discussions, and anything else we could think of.  This mental exercise made writing code in different languages relatively easy.  As you know, that's mostly syntax and punctuation.\n\nSo I would recommend that you try programming without a computer.  Say, with a book of algorithms (Maybe Cormen? I haven't read it.), or [a book on threaded interpretive language](https://archive.org/details/R.G.LoeligerThreadedInterpretiveLanguagesTheirDesignAndImplementationByteBooks1981)s -- build yourself a FORTH-like compiler -- or join a number of folks from the 80's and build a C compiler.  If that sounds interesting, you might want to read this: [Has anyone read \"Writing a C Compiler\" by Nora Sandler?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1lu9sjd/has_anyone_read_writing_a_c_compiler_by_nora/)\n\nHope this helps.",

Don’t jump into coding right away. \n1-HTML: stat with structure of a page, look at what are common tags a page has ( header, body,…etc). Then add a few div, deal with row and column, under how content is showing in a page. \n2-Css: you know how the page looks, now how to make it sexier. Right? Apply css by id, fonts, style, padding… etc. then at this point, you got an idea about front end. \n3-JavaScript: you can’t skip this. You need to understand how to apply a function to an element, Id… then, use JavaScript to get some sample data. \n4- data: instead of static content, now thing about dynamic content. Questions like, how is data look like, what i want to show in the html? At this stage, don’t need to have a backend yet, you can just have a fake raw json file. \n5- backend. Pick a framework, nodes, .net… etc. learn about what tools the framework provides. \n\nUse AI when you know what you are doing, it helps improve performance a lots.",

That said, I still stand by my comment that if you think you are \"up for it\", then \"go for it\".\n\nThis is more of a \"being on the same page\" when we are talking about system calls.\n\nBack in the day, when I did assembler programming on MS-DOS systems, system calls was pretty much the only option available. I also had to do this on some proprietary operating systems such as TMX (which was an NCR proprietary OS running on M68K CPUs).\n\nIt was a PIA. Back then, in MS-DOS, the interface was pretty straightforward, but tedious.\n\nSystem calls are pretty basic as you are directly invoking functions that the underlying operating system supports - for example, openning, reading, writing and other file operations. Or, forking the current process and replacing the image with a new image (fork and execute). Terminate this process and other \"basic\" operations.\n\nIn DOS, you setup the parameters in various CPU registers and invoked a software interrupt (INT 0x21 if memory serves).\n\nLinux is very similar.\n\nIf running on Intel hardware, there is a special instruction `syscall` (added in Pentium class CPUs I believe) that is used in place of the INT 0x21, but you still have to set up the CPU registers.\n\nPerhaps have a look at this: https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/linux-constants/syscalls/#x86_64-64-bit\n\nThe CPU registers that need to be set are listed at the head of the table,\n\nNote that there are no \"graphics\" system calls - I don't know how this would work, I imagine it is some sort of IPC between your process and a kernel driver which manages the display hardware. IPC could include any combination of:\n\n* Shared memory (shmget, shmat ...).\n* Semaphores (semget, semop, semctl),\n* Message Queues (msgget, msgsnd, msgrcv...).\n* Pipes (pipe, mkfifo, open, read, write...)\n* Signals which operate like interrupts (kill, signal, sigaction...)\n\nand possibly others. But the same thing would apply, there would be some mechanism (defined by the driver) that defines how parameters are supplied and functions invoked.\n\nIf you want to learn system calls (and the above is what you are talking about), you might try doing some basic File I/O using the system calls, perhaps some IPC between two processes that you create (and thus know the protocol being used for them talk to each other) - perhaps a simple command interpreter that can accept commands, fork and exec a sub process.",

But it's not the only way! You could also hard code every ability into your character and have a series of boolean flags for if you have that ability or not. Big name games from developers like Nintendo still do this today. This strategy can be easier and faster to write and perfectly adequate for your needs.\n\nBasically if you catch yourself writing code that seems like 3000 line crazy spaghetti functions, consider how you could redesign it to use classes.

Once i is no longer < 8, it stops looping. Worth noting that it's starting at 1 because we already set max equal to [0] so there's no reason to check numbers[0].\n\n>if (numbers[i] > max) //so, if 'numbers' is greater than 'numbers'? How does the [i] factor in here? What exactly is happening when we add the square brackets containing an 'i' to a variable?\n\nUsing the [] brackets is checking at a specific spot in the array. [0] is the first one, [1] is the second, etc. If you had a string array named \"numbers\", it'd look like this:\n[0] = n, [1] = u, [2] = m, etc\n\nSo we're adding a check to see if the part of the \"numbers\" array is currently bigger than the initial number (we first set max at the top to the first element) and in further iterations, it will replace it with wherever we currently are in the loop. E.g. if numbers[1] is bigger than numbers[0], max will be set to numbers[1]. If numbers[2] is not bigger, it skips the \"max = numbers[i]\" line. It keep repeating this until we're done looking through the \"numbers\" array.\n\n> return max;\n\nAt the end of the loop, it returns \"max\" with whatever the largest value should have been set to during all of the loop iterations and exits the function \"findMaxNumbers\".\n\n\nOverall CSS and HTML are not really comparable to actual programming languages so it's likely you just haven't ever actually learned fundamentals. There's so many online resources for learning these things that you can find just searching \"how to learn javascript\". Half a dozen popular websites with similar straightforward information explain all of this.",

At this point you are using C++ to investigate the concepts.   Actually learning C++ well and becoming conversant in the language is an entirely different issue and frankly takes years of study and practice.    \n\nAt some point in your Computer Science study you should also be starting in on a second language.    Python is a good option here, but if platform specified programming is in your future, the common language for the platform.   For example Swift for Apple's products.   Don't stop with C++ for now.",

        "body": "Yea I wouldn't spend big money on a bootcamp. I would try to setup a study schedule where you are programming every day however. I see you mention wanting to be proficient in AppSec and AI, then it is important to understand that there is more to this than just the language. Many times, when in comes to the language it is just the tool you use to apply logic and with that said AppSec and AI both rely heavily on the fundamentals of Computer science concepts. Discrete math, Data structures and algorithms, operating systems fundamentals, networking basics, databases, etc. With all that said, the one thing you can look at that credentializes you while teaching you all the relevant concepts is a Comp Sci degree. Especially with your stated goals. If you can't get a degree, then focus on first building the foundation for a self made CS curriculum. Appsec in particular isn't just finding bugs in front end code, it includes threat modeling, devops and other infra principles, tons of code review, database management, etc. AI security is emerging in 2 forms. The first being red/blue team tradecraft oriented security. So hacking the models through prompt injection, data poisoning, first order attacks etc. The second form is securing the models themselves, which is actually more inline with the AI/ML engineer/MLOps skillset, the best way to get into this is to pursue a traditional AI focused CS program. Notice, how everything comes back to CS fundamentals. Not assuming you want to jump into a senior position, but security isn't really a beginner focused field. In order to do security properly, you need the knowledge of an engineer and the knowledge of someone who can actually break the app and recommend remediation. Lofty goals is what keeps us motivated, but I would break down your goals in meaningful steps and a meaningful timeline. \n\nTo answer what you would use to learn programming and CS fundamentals, the only course that ever stuck with me was a \"bootcamp\" I took last year for $150 from exercism. They didn't even use a real language for the first half of the course, yet the fundamentals they taught have still stuck with me today. The biggest benefit from this course however was their discord where mentors were there to help guide you to answers on your own. After that I recognized my own shortcomings when it came to algorithmic thinking. I focused on the math and discrete math fundamentals, before jumping back into doing algorithm problems to improve my thinking. Point being AppSec and AI are long roads, try to set yourself up for that journey.",

You could do that as a way to explore different areas of coding though before deciding what to pursue more seriously later once you have more of an idea.\n\nIf you want something that will more likely immediately benefit you and your work, then automate the boring stuff is a great book.

        "body": "Yes and no.\n\nThere's several layers to this question and your intuition to be sceptical is correct, but there's some small things in between.\n\nFirst: on the entity level, there are no ids. On the entity level, you only talk about relations between entities, not how you model that in Java or in the database. This distinction is important precisely because the materialisation may end up completely different than the logical view.\n\nNext, ownership. Ownership is a special case relationship that usually isn't really fully expressed in ER lingo. What we mean is: the owned object must not exist without exactly one owner. The owner controls the lifetime of the owned entity and must delete it or move it to a different owner if the owner is deleted. The reverse relationship may be of a weaker kind. Most many-to-one relationships are just to look something up in the parent, but in many cases you can throw those out by not having the logic on the child element.\n\nFor real teams and tournaments you wouldn't have an ownership here because teams can outlive the tournament. Both would be full business objects that can exist independently.\n\nNow, that's the logical entity view, but you still have to materialise that in Java and the database. And that's where the trouble starts. If you simply give both Tournament and Team a slot of the respective other type, you can not handle them atomically any more. You need to create both and then link them. You need to break up the links before you delete them. This gives you all manner of nasty chicken-and-egg problems when dealing with constraints and temporal integrity of your data, so we usually avoid it where possible. It's even worse in the database, because now you can't but referential constraints on your data any more - again, because it needs to be in an inconsistent state for a very short time.\n\nIt's even worse in languages with a ref-counted garbage collector. There, the GC will simply count how many times an object is referenced by others and so these circular references will leak memory if not broken up manually. Luckily Java's GC is not ref-counted, so that's one problem less.\n\nWhat you usually do for your specific problem is to move logic away from dependent entities. If teams cannot exist independently and you need information of the tournament, then the logic that acts on them should take the tournament and the team and sit outside of your entities as some sort of service actor.\n\nThat of course would mean that any api endpoint working on players would need all three ids, which is stupid. Luckily that's where the separation of entity and database model helps us. Because one-to-many relations are usually stored inverted in the database anyway, in the database each team knows its tournament directly. In the entity view it does not. So instead of calling an accessor in Java to let JPA fetch the relation, you take a tiny detour and ask the database to look up the tournament (likely through a native SQL or similar query method anyway, but the thought counts!). That way your entity model can model ownership unidirectionally while the database can do what it does best.",

        "body": "At the moment, it's hard to give solid recommendations on how to best structure your data. We don't know what operations you want your program to support (what 'verbs' you want). This in turn makes it challenging to figure out the best way of representing your data (what 'nouns' you need).\n\nI think this is a common trap for beginners: you start with nouns, trying to create a 'model' of some real-world scenario you're looking at. But instead, you should start with the 'verbs' you need and work backwards to figure out what you need to build to support those actions.\n\nAnyways, without further context, in this scenario I'd probably set up a SQL database to be the source of truth for your teams/players/etc -- maybe sqlite to start, to keep things simple? I would then run sql queries to perform steps like 'grab a list of all players belonging to team X during tournament Y'. There are two advantages to this:\n\n1. This side-steps your problem, since you can grab data in exactly the shape you need for each distinct operation, instead of being locked into one specific one. (In this case, your `tournament -> {teams, players}` shape)\n2. More generally, it gives us maximal flexibility in cases where my verbs are unknown.\n\nIf you want to stick with your current structure, I would perhaps consider changing Tournament no longer store 'Player' objects and instead have those be stored under 'Teams'. The 'Tournament' class can then implement helper methods that iterate over teams to return an iterator or list of all players.\n\nThough granted, this is not perfect either, since a team could potentially belong to multiple tournaments, and a player could belong to multiple teams over time... To support this in full generality, you would most likely end up creating your own 'querier' abstraction -- basically a database, or something conceptually similar to it. So, we're back at square 1.\n\n> Is avoiding bidirectional relationships between domain entities generally considered best practice in this case?\n\nBidirectional dependencies are usually suspect, yeah. It's not always a problem, but it's usually a sign that some common functionality could be refactored out, or that the 'shape' of the data is not quite clean. Having to keep both directions in sync is a bit cumbersome and potentially error-prone, and it's better to design our code to avoid having to do it if possible.\n\n> Is it more idiomatic to allow Team to hold direct Player references and rely on invariants to maintain consistency, or to keep entities decoupled and move cross-entity logic into a service/manager layer?\n\nIf the data is fully immutable -- never changing after it's first created -- I'd probably be ok with allowing both Team and Tournaments to hold player references. To make this work, you'd want your 'Tournament' object to be a fixed snapshot of a specific point in time instead of the source of truth and handle updates separately.\n\nBut if it's mutable, then I would prefer to avoid having duplicate references to reduce the odds of human error, where you accidentally break some invariant. (After all, the best invariant is no invariant.)\n\nThat said, it's sometimes useful to have duplicate references in cases where it would materially simplify your algorithms or improve performance. But we would need to understand the desired verbs of your program first before exploring this path.",

You can start now. \n\n\nTarget companies that automatically give OAs, start-ups, and small local ones. It might help if you speak in person, reach out to them somehow, or curate quick projects related to them. \n\n\nContinue your learning as you dedicate that time. If you don't want to learn for free, attempt to build things that can generate revenue, freelance, get a contracting gig, make the jump to open source, or offer your services to spruce up small local company sites. Otherwise, get used to building for fun as your skills improve. Carpenters don't get better by simply working for cash. They build a lot of things. You're a builder/maintainer now. \n\n\nTarget skills related to the job type you're looking for. You might want to search for \"essential skills for getting a fullstack job\" and see how you size up. What you suggested as a learning path isn't what I see hiring managers focus on. \n\n\nYour easiest path might be from actual connections, so don't be afraid of tech meetups and stuff. Be enthusiastic about what you build and learn instead of handing a resume and begging for a job. ",

In fact, you may understand the value prop of TS better if you continue to focus on JS. \n\nWhat should you learn next? Idk. I usually get the most value out of building something.

If you really want to go crazy (and can spare a few bucks a month) see if you can automate deployment of your website to a VPS on AWS or Digital Ocean via CI/CD.  Hope that helps!",

That will likely lead to huge gaps in knowledge and dead ends.\n\nSo for example start by making your homepage. Then make it load items from a database. Then add an \"add to cart\" feature. Then add search. Then add a recommendation system but where the recommendation is pregenerated. Then make the recommendation smarter.\n\nAnd so on. Don't bite off too much at a time. Each new feature should only take a day or two.\n\nIf it takes longer, stop and break it down into smaller pieces. If you can't make a shopping cart in a day or two, break it down. First make a shopping cart icon on your app. Then make it so that clicking Add to Cart increments the count. And so on.",

Since you're already using FreeCodeCamp, some of the beginner explanations might feel unnecessary. However, there's a great thing about TOP: even if you decide to switch, you won't need to start from scratch. You can skip some sections.

In general, though, TOP doesn't actually force you to finish everything, though it strongly suggests it.\nAs for my background, I'm just a hobby developer. I don't work in the IT field. However, the knowledge and skills I gained from TOP allowed me to create apps and systems for my own convenience at work. Let me tell you, TOP works! Once you're finished, you'll have a foundation, and then you can jump into different frameworks and languages. For example, I'm currently migrating my apps from Remix, a React framework, to Laravel.

Look at your initial state, look at your goal state, make a plan about what you need to be able to do to get to your goal state, and then apply the tools in your toolbox to transform the initial state into a solution.\n\nIf the answer to all of those is \"No\" then it isn't a programming problem. It is probably an attention span problem and a lack of mental endurance to work through a problem and think hard about it. I find having solutions always just an internet search away make this problem much worse - you train your brain to never think too hard about a problem because it always knows you'll find the solution and you won't have to work at it.\n\nOften it seems people think that they should be able to just look at a problem and instantly recall a solution, and if they can't it is too hard - without every putting serious mental work into solving it.\n\nAnyways, if you're in that boat you probably need to focus more on building your attention span and mental endurance first and foremost.

If you're in the U.S. the pay is excellent.\n\nIf you build indie apps, games, or websites, then the barrier to entry is very low. You can make a website or app after learning for less than a month. You could even make a few dollars. However, the chances of making a living are tiny. The top 1% of indie developers make nearly all of the money.\n\nThe third option is freelance / consulting.

It can't understand game feel, performance tradeoffs or player psychology, it also has trouble with architecting systems properly and cleanly and of course, it's also not too good at optimizing things. AI can't replace all programmers, only the ones that don't understand what they're doing\n\nCoding is still worth it, even if you're not a genius, you can still get paid well, ship games and freelance, maybe build some other tools if that's what you end up interested in and it also opens a couple doors to tech roles  \nEven if you're \"pretty good\", understand fundamentals and know how to debug and optimize, you'll find a spot on the market, the top of the top make real good money, the middle top still live very comfortably\n\nCoding has good money if you stick with it long enough to get good and specialize in something and if you actually build stuff instead of only learning theory, your value as a developer is mostly indicated by your portfolio so especially work on that, ESPECIALLY in game dev because I feel it's generally more competitive than other IT sectors, knowing how to really optimize is a rare skill and rare skills get paid better (generally speaking)\n\nSpeaking from my own standpoint as a game dev, there's luckily some benefits that help irl too :)  \nLearning to code helps you train structured thinking, breaking down problems, I've also especially noticed I've gotten a lot more patient and persistent, this might be because of debugging? might be the cause? idk? on top of that, you'll understand computers more if you don't yet and you'll learn that ideas in your head can actually very quickly become real things that you, yourself can make instead of waiting for someone to invent it for you  \nIf something is broken, you can understand and fix it, is a mindset I often see return in IT and it carries around in every field\n\nLearning it obviously takes time, there's no shortcuts but you don't have to rush it and you don't have to master it all right away at the same time and you don't have to do it for the money instantly either, if you're already feeling interest, that's a big sign it's worth learning\n\nIf your goals are to make games, optimize systems and working with 3D and web (and understanding how things actually work) then coding isn't just something useful but rather foundational, making a game without code or little code (especially if you go into more complicated games) is nearly impossible\n\nEven if you don't become a full time programmer, knowing how to code helps you in general and gives you some kind of leverage in pretty much any tech related field\n\n\n\ntldr: Yes, it’s still worth learning to code now especially if you’re into games, optimization, 3D, and web but don't do it cause \"coding = guaranteed money\", it also has benefits outside of your specific goal",

The blunt truth is most people treat learning to code as a get-rich-quick scheme, and when they realize the hard work involved, they bail.\n\nOf the people that reach a professionally capable level *at all*, it's not only the \"extremely good\" that make money.

It helps to look out for errors and no exceptions upon exceptions and weird behavior like in JS.\n2. Don't pick Rust -> as it's a pretty high-level language as it still abstracts a lot of the concepts that happens at the back.\n3. C++ -> not a bad pick.\n4.

Once you have those pieces, you should be able to play legal chess. \n\nAdd a minimal minimax search and a simple material position evaluator, and your program will beat beginner chess players. This search code can be done in very few lines of code - like, less than 20 - but it requires some non-beginner techniques, like recursion. \n\nJust a warning: this is not a small project, especially for a beginner. You can easily spend weeks just debugging a move generator. But that's what makes it a good intermediate project.",

But at a large place that column on a critical table like such can likely: break 3 other teams downstream systems, add millions in costs in various places for storage, affect multiple critical APIs from added latency of making the payloads larger through out the stack, lead to bad downstream decisions who mis interpret the column perhaps (it happens a lot), not to mention new scaling concerns for > millions of rps\n\nThat's just a few things off the top of my head but now factor that with how many sub features those big platforms have across multiple systems. There are literally thousands of sub systems at larger places that need coordination at human scale.\n\nThe pool of engineers who can navigate this tends to be limited to a smaller circle, since lots of folks can code a system from scratch but many companies don't have such a scale.

Im a Software Engineer and it took me a year to get my first career job, felt like every day stuck working at Walmart was a hit to my hireability. I was terrified of not being able to get my foot in the door and not being able to keep it there. \n\nIf I failed, 4 years of college would have been pointless. Plus, I knew id be taking care of my Ma once Dad retired. After graduating, I only had 2 years to get a high enough salary to support us both.\n\nOnce I got hired, I felt I had to prove myself with failure resulting in a dead career.

Not one.  Every job I apply for has 100+ applicants in less than 24 hours.  Even the ones at 40-50% of the average salary range, which I apply for just to see if they'll call back.  Some of them stop accepting resumes, then reopen a month later because they didn't find a qualified candidate the first time.  Then they get spammed again.  Then reopen a month later.\n\nA friend of mine had a guy on his team (offshore) who never turned his camera on.  Would be told in meetings turn your camera on, \"I can't figure out how, it doesn't work\".  Sent a new laptop where they verified that the camera worked, wouldn't turn it on.  1:1's with the boss, no camera.  They terminated him because his job with them was one of 6 jobs he was working at the same time.\n\nAI has broken the ability of companies to match talented people to roles, by filling the intake process with incomprehensible amounts of noise.

Fewer companies and smaller budgets also mean they'll spend less on SaaS products, which also means less revenue for those companies. Harder to borrow + less revenue means they have to shrink their budget. Cutting headcount is always the easiest thing to do, even compared to making your infra spend more efficient. This has further effects as well to non-tech companies that also can't borrow money as easily. They'll do RIFs which also means fewer seats for SaaS products which is another way revenue drops. All these factors reduce hiring. Not to mention the number of people wanting SWE work has increased a lot leading up to the recent years.",

I got the offer, but I was very concerned about the predatory nature of the business, so I asked to talk with a business-oriented person about my concerns before I could accept.\n\nThey sat me down with a product manager. He corrected some misconceptions that I had and explained that their primary business model was to compete with banks. Banks are also pretty predatory to their low-income customers, but that's a couple steps above things like payday and title loans, and, honestly, I probably would not have had similar concerns about an offer from a bank. The meeting convinced me that the company's business was above my own personal ethical line. I ended up working there almost a decade.\n\nI now work for a fintech that facilitates money movement for the customers of our clients. Most of the payments that we facilitate have very high fees, but our clients are crypto companies and legal gambling. I consider their customers' desire to transfer money into and out of those accounts to be discretionary spending, and the customers of those companies choose to pay the high fees for very quick transfer of funds. So, that also falls above my personal ethical line.",

The guy that got promoted into their position was know to be a 9-9-6 type of worker who took it upon himself to replace people with as many work visa Indians as possible. Last i heard they shut down whole departments and replaced them with teams in India. Tbh i wasn’t surprised by the layoff since it was going around. I’m haven’t graduated so can’t tell what life will be like after the switch but what i can say is that while i was a coder I really couldn’t see a path that i wanted to take to further my career but as a nurse I do.

If you want to break through it you'll need to take some risks and really push yourself.\n\nIf you can, find a new team in the org to work in. What would be better though, if possible, would be to get a new job entirely.\n\nMost people move jobs for a salary increase, but another big part of it is the ability to sort of \"start over\" from step 1. Obviously if you're coming in as a senior engineer or something they'll expect you to onboard a bit faster, but you'll have that opportunity to start off asking those clarification questions and gaining that deep understanding without feeling like you're desperately behind. I've talked to other engineers about this exact feeling before and while some people boil it down to things like \"imposter syndrome\" the cold hard truth is usually that you actually aren't good enough at the moment. There have been critical mistakes made early on in your career that have stagnated your growth as an engineer and sometimes the best thing to do is simply acknowledge that you're in a position where growth is no longer possible and move on.\n\nAka, you can try and fix the soil or you can just plant your seeds somewhere else. Both options are perfectly valid, but I've found that most people find it easier to improve with a small do-over period. It's a daunting prospect though I won't lie.\n\nKeep in mind this only applies if you want to be one of the giga-nerd seniors who seem to solve every problem and know every code solution. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with just doing your job.

And all my friends who stayed put, were turning into degenerates, getting hit hard by the opiate crisis, drinking, partying, etc. All the friends I respected moved to cool cities, were enjoying their life. I made a bad choice.\n\nI remember being alone in my apartment after college missing the chaos of my roommates and crying because I was so bored and lonely and nothing felt right. The girl I loved was still in school and she cheated one me, I had a lot of decision paralysis on what I could even do on my free time. Nothing felt good.\n\nSo I researched \"Best cities to live in your 20s\" (this was 2015 mind you) and Denver popped up. I love outdoor activites, and wanted a city center where I could make friends. I wanted a fresh start. Most importantly, I did have an uncle who lived in a suburb there, and 1 single friend I could hangout with. It wasn't much, but it was enough of a safety net for me to take the leap.\n\nI changed my linkedin and resume address to say Denver.\n\nI got picked up by a recruiter, and they flew me out to a job in Denver for an interview. The culture was warm and chill, in a cool place, laid back, not overly corporate.  It had plenty of other fresh grads, I could hangout with them.  Beers in the fridge. End at 3:30 on friday and have some beers with my coworkers on other teams. I took a pay hit. Man I miss those days of pre-covid.\n\nOffice cultures vary dramatically from office to office. Sounds like you have a shitty one.\n\nAnd it was so chill I'm still there today, even though I did switch teams. I also found my wife in this city.\n\nEveryone has different needs. Hopefully my story helps.\n\nSadly it's a lot harder to land new jobs than it was in 2015. I'm currently shocked by this. But maybe you can investigate a similar approach that I took.\n\nEDITED a bit to add more context",

        "body": "Your resume has significant room for improvement I have some recommendations that could make a major difference in how recruiters perceive your candidacy.\n\nThe most critical issue is your experience section. You have too many bullet points per role (standard is 3 to 5 maximum but since its one company around 5 is okay, maybe 6 if it’s really really worth it), and more importantly, they lack substance. When you write something like “Diagnosed systemic product-line defects, implemented robust fixes,” you’re not telling recruiters anything useful. What defect did you find? What made your fix robust? What changed as a result? Right now you’re describing tasks instead of demonstrating impact.\n\nEvery bullet point should follow a simple structure: what you achieved, how you did it, and ideally with numbers to back it up. Instead of listing what you did, show what happened because you did it. Compare “Implemented automated testing” to “Cut deployment time from 6 hours to 45 minutes by building an automated testing suite in Jenkins that caught 80% of bugs before production.” One is forgettable, the other proves you deliver results.\n\nYour summary section needs to go entirely. It takes up valuable space without adding value, and it creates a wall of text that makes recruiters skip to the next resume. Remember, most people spend under 10 seconds scanning your resume initially. Every line needs to earn its place.\n\nWith that space freed up, add more projects. Keep a rotating collection you can swap based on the role you’re applying for. Tailor them to highlight relevant skills for each position. Your current project description is far too vague and you’re missing an opportunity. If university teams are actually using what you built, name them specifically. That transforms a generic claim into proof of real-world impact.\n\nIf you want to preserve some of the context your summary provided, move your skills section to the top. This immediately tells recruiters what you bring to the table and helps them understand everything else they read through that lens.\n\nYour formatting also has problems. Company name, job title, and dates should all be on one line for ATS compatibility. Include months with your dates, not just years. Separating projects from education will also improve scannability and make both sections easier to parse quickly\n\nHope I don’t come off as too harsh. Good luck!",

If you can work on personal projects, building stuff for friends and family, that’s clutch. But almost as important is applying to anywhere and everywhere. Take a look at Glassdoor to find places that pay low wages (reviews will mention this), are constantly hiring (because people leave), and work there long enough to find your next job. That worked for me 8 years ago when I entered the industry. First job was as a Web Designer, making 43k, less than my wife earned working at a Church in the DC area. 8 years later, I’m making almost 4x that amount.",

For example, they could have been a Data Analyst that took on more software engineering adjacent responsibilities in their role. I've seen Product Managers and Business Analysts do similar things. In short, they took on responsibilities in their current role that reduced the gap between their work and software engineering.\n\nThey also tried to switch in their own company as the goodwill of already working there and knowing people, processes, and the business can offset some of the lack of Software Engineering fundamentals.",

As for the interview specific purpose, the problem with a monolith is you can draw a single box and say it does everything you need, so it won't highlight your ability to break down complex domains, create reusable functionality, or address scaling concerns.

I had a couple really solid companies like PepsiCo, Tiktok, Camping World, and others that invited me for interview rounds, and all of them just straight up didn't send the interview link.   It's like when someone matches you on a dating app, says \"hey, how's it going?\" and then immediately ghosts you.  YOU MESSAGED ME!?!\n\nYet, I've also had some recruiters reach out from better companies than my current one that I didn't apply for.  And they set me up with recruiter prescreens, and then hiring manager interviews.\n\nJob market is so damn lopsided.  I got ghosted by Dish TV with a referral from the guy who worked on the team I was applying for. The pay was very mediocre, like $120k in the SF bay area, and they weren't offering sponsorship.  I don't think many people who are better than me would have applied for such a role. And yet not even a first round screen.  And then they reposted the job to look for more candidates 🙄.\n\nI think anybody whose credentials aren't enough to get headhunted is going to really struggle in this market.",

        "body": "During the pandemic I left my job (was there 4 years) and decided I wouldn't immediately get a new one. I had ~15 YOE at the time. Due to multiple factors, by that time I had no motivation and was burned out, and I didn't feel like getting a new job just yet (this was right near the end of the tech hiring boom).\n\n> For how long were you away from work? \n\nIt ended up being over a year - late-2021 to the end of 2022.\n\nGoing into that hiatus I had no idea how long I'd stay jobless, and really it was more luck and timing that brought me back to the field more than anything else.\n\n> And how did you spend that time?\n\nSome of the bigger stuff...\n\n* Getting much more into cooking - I stopped dining out as much (somewhat for financial reasons, but also health reasons), and started focusing a lot more on actually cooking most of my food, and learning how to make a lot of different things\n* Started running - The pandemic and transition to WFH really did a number on me, health-wise. During my year off I ran nearly every day - I ran about 2000 miles in 2022. This is one of the lifestyle changes that really stuck with me even after returning to work.\n* Some trips - went camping, went on a few domestic and international trips\n* Seriously learn Japanese - I had been learning Japanese off and on for years, but toward the end of my hiatus I lived a few months in Tokyo and attended a Japanese language school. Massively improved my skills.\n* A lot of reading - normal literature, not tech/business books.\n* Getting _more_ cats - Through an unexpected confluence of events, I adopted a third cat.\n\nI basically did not touch a computer for the entire time I was off. I did do some light coding on some open source projects, and built a tiny service for a friend's workplace, but I'd say ~95% of the hiatus my computer stayed closed.\n\n> Did the time off change your definition of success, or your relationship with work?\n\nNot really. It instead changed my relationship with my finances.\n\n> Would you say it was worth it?\n\nIn hindsight, yes. I really enjoyed my time off, though the biggest things I had to face were...\n\n* Actually needing to dip into money rather than have an income - My entire year-plus was funded by savings and dipping into investments. For reference, I'm married and at the time I left my job, I made 25x what my wife made (she was launching a business). I had no plan for any of this, the mental hump was huge after an entire career of never having to touch savings or investments.\n\n* Health insurance is fucking expensive - I live in a decent state when it comes to healthcare and insurance, and I had to buy marketplace insurance for the entire time I was unemployed. $1200/month for two people, for a medium-level plan. This, after spending years of paying $0 to a pittance for top-tier insurance from any employer I had.\n\n* Having a lot of unstructured time - the first couple weeks were almost surreal, waking up and having literally nothing to do.\n\n* Getting back into a \"I should probably work again\" mindset - I could have gone on for longer, though by the 12-month mark I was like \"yeahhh, I think my tech ennui has passed.\"\n\nBut in terms of just having all that time to myself and thinking about how it got me to where I am today, yeah, worth it.",

Savings going down, bad job market, AI boom, and grueling interview process was weighing heavily on him in the second year so much so that he became a bit depressed towards the end.

Its getting to a point that hes thinking about switching career.\n\nOverall your mileage may varies as I have also heard of more positive case but one thing he did stress to keep in mind is that unless you gain some clarity or switch career you will most likely be getting back to the same type of job that burn you out in the first place.",

That, combined with the really low pay, make me think it’s probably a pretty small company that kind of doesn’t know any better. They’re probably going for someone early career who is passionate and knows their stuff. If that person were smart, they wouldn’t stay long. \n\nA single person could do the work, but their pace would be slow from being stretched so thinly. \n\nI’m skeptical of the environment given some of the assumptions, but it could be a decent early job from a resume-building perspective. It lists as part-time and internship among the job types. This job sounds a lot like a couple part-time jobs I had while in school. My hunch is their expectations will be lower than what you’re expecting from the job description. Could be a small business or a university. \n\nIf you hit the top-end of what they’re offering, that’s over $60k a year. That’s on the low-end for a dev, but given some of the posts you see in this sub, some of those people would kill for this job. \n\nNot every job is part of an enterprise software team, and it can be an opportunity for someone to start. ",

It also helps too that the technologies and frameworks we use at my workplace (C# .NET 10)  are very modern and up to date. I have been applying what I learn at work into a side project that has the balls to be pretty descent project. \n\nI too felt like I would start a project and never finish it. I can count up to 10 projects that I would begin and then never have the motivation to want to finish them. I struggled immensely with backend development. It was so hard to pick up and start that when it came time to work on any backend stuff (after finishing the frontend) for my projects, I would just cave in and give up. I recently picked back up on application that I sort of gave up on around a year ago and have been implementing new pretty lengthy features in terms of getting endpoints implemented and a SQLite database because of what I have learned at work. \n\nThis isn't the same for everyone, but I have definitely started to enjoy working on projects more at home. Hopefully when you start your new position, you can use the knowledge you learn and apply it to your personal projects. That is what has helped me gain motivation to want to create and develop personal projects on my free time.",

Adult hackathons are usually more like marathons/sprints, because we don't have time or energy for those 24 hour deadlines. Usually more like between 1 week and several weeks.  Having a deadline and a team will make you feel obliged to finish something (even if it's not great), while also having a ton of creative freedom because you have no manager or customer expectations.\n\nYou could also propose to your HR / manager to do a corporate hackathon, but that's more of a move for career progression than fun.",

Ideally should be easier while in college but many students also work while having school work to complete. For side projects your goals should be minimum viable product. To get to that you should plan out the project and not just code without a plan. Planning includes design, functionality, technical requirements, etc. Feel free to use AI as well, but don’t get in the trap of using it for everything. Side projects should be treated like goals. To be successful with goals, you need to have both short term and long term goals. Long term goals without short term goals will lead to failure unless you’re a rare individual that can push through without feeling small wins/progress frequently.",

I was getting ready to switch careers a few years ago and then decided not to after the market turned for the worst. I still lurk this sub sometimes in case things change.\n\nRight now my teaching career is actually peak. I’m so experienced that nothing phases me anymore. I know my curriculum like the back of my hand. I don’t even need to plan anymore and can just walk into the classroom with nothing but a topic I’m supposed to teach and I can instantly deliver an engaging lecture on it. I have a huge arsenal of assignments that I can use to match my lessons. Most of the assignments are auto graded and my workflow allows me to not take any grading home at all. The kids are good, never give me any trouble, and generally speak highly of my class. I make 115k doing roughly 1300 hours a year and will get a fat pension when I’m done so I don’t have to really save for retirement at all.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nThe first 7 years were absolutely brutal. That’s the period of every teacher’s career regardless of how smart or talented you are that you just have to grind out 9-10 hour work days 6 days a week during the school year just to keep your head above water. There’s no way to avoid it. Nobody tells you what to do, which is a good thing until it isn’t. Your main motivator to actually work this hard is that if you don’t actually deliver a good lesson, your classroom management goes to shit. No matter how good the kids are, if you start disengaging them or showing up unprepared, kids will eat you alive. They lose respect for you very quickly so you’re putting in the hellish hours just to make sure that you’ve timed everything out to perfection and that every moment is interesting (don’t forget your competing with TikTok brains these days).\n\nOh and you likely won’t be able to teach all AP CS or whatever you’re interested in. You’ll likely have to teach 2 or 3 separate courses over the 5 classes you’re given, which means you double/triple the amount of planning you need to do for no extra pay.\n\nIt’s an absolutely exhausting job that turns into a still exhausting but easy job after you’ve put in the first few years of hell.",

If you have a few good projects with a diverse tech stack (I done Next.js, React, FastAPI, Flask etc..) then employers will see that as a green flag. \n\nThey aren’t judging off code quality - they will know you’re a junior level with no XP and it’s something that you just learn as you go really, companies tend to hire people that are atleast familiar with their tech stack / used something similar.\n\nI would say learn a Python framework (FastAPI was what I learnt first, and then my current job preferred Flask but as it’s really similar, non issue.) and maybe another framework in another language so you don’t limit yourself (here i would recommend a JavaScript one). If you got a few frameworks/common libraries under your belt, along with DB knowledge (ORM is common these days), testing frameworks, being comfortable with git etc… then at that point, it’s just a numbers game and landing that first role which is always the hardest.",

As for Django vs FastAPI, I think (?) Django is more common in industry, but id advise you go on LinkedIn and look at job postings yourself and see whats in demand, especially so that you know what other relevent technologies there is to learn (e.g. docker and AWS).",

If it doesn't, then change that thing back and change something else. If changing individual inputs doesn't fix it, change them in pairs.\n\n>How did you learn to slow down and test one change at a time?\n\n>I notice that when I’m stuck, I’ll tweak multiple things and then have no idea what actually fixed the issue.\n\nThis is the answer.

It’s definitely harder than getting a regular job but honestly just requires a lot of preparation.

From what I've seen, there's a good number of senior level people from the linkedins and instacarts of the world applying for those roles, so that's your competition.\n\nIdeally, you'll have gone through at least one project end-to-end (from design to maintenance) to be able to speak about it coherently, and there's specific interview structure formulas that you'd normally want to practice.\n\nIf you're planning to boomerang, then you don't necessarily need to target the high end jobs in SF, a lot of regular roles in US pay more just from currency exchange, but also not all of them are necessarily open to dealing w/ the legalities of TN visa expiration.",

I bartended previously, and tripled my income when I accepted my first job. fwiw I graduated in 2022 when the job market was more favorable - it still wasn't easy back then, and it is *much* more competitive now and it is actually very hard to enter the industry.\n\nThat said, there is opportunity in this field, but you should know that it is extremely competitive and difficult to enter, and the work can be very demanding. When job hunting for my first role, being a mid-life career changer played to my advantage because I was up against 22 year olds with no attention span and no adult workforce experience, so I was an easy choice against them. Being in school was actually fun, I made great relationships with my professors. \n\nBut the job itself? Not at all what I expected it to be. I love computers and I love building things, I like writing code and I like problem solving, I taught myself PHP when I was in high school and I got a 4.0 when I got my CS degree. The reality? This job is mostly meetings and paperwork and politics and all of that corporate doldrum, paired with high expectations for intellectual output from deep task work that you are expected to somehow find time for between all those meetings (or do at home after hours). You know that feeling when you were in school and it was exam day and your brain felt like jelly at the end? I arrive home every day feeling like that. \n\nThis is only my experience, and I am only 4 years in at this point and this is anecdotal, but honestly I am actually considering switching careers again. Others surely have had better experiences. But for me- the job is insanely stressful, the constant pressure to meet a perpetually raising bar and always learn new things, the horrendous demoralizing job search process, the on-call expectations and non-existent work life balance boundaries, the corporate politics hunger games, the cognitive dissonance of contributing to immoral corporations, the inability to escape AI, the constant anxiety of pip or layoff and the stack-ranking... the list goes on. My financial life has improved considerably, but my health in literally every other way has gotten considerably worse. I would love to take a more relaxed lower-paying job, but can't find one. I know that people love to say that engineers don't know how good they have it unless they've done manual labor or been in other industries, and I do think that is true in many ways. The money is insane if you can land a job at big tech and can be life changing, and it is true that many engineers seem to have no clue that they are rich and that this salary is not normal. But also, I was a service industry worker for over a decade, so I have perspective on being at a low income person and, well, I actually think I was healthier and happier and had it better back then. This is not sustainable but I feel like I cant leave because I don't think I'll have opportunity to make this kind of money again. I look around and most people at the office don't seem happy, they all seem stressed out.",

Start bringing it up in meetings that the best thing the company can do to ensure faster development times is take some time now to build out a full suite of tests so developers can make changes without unknowingly adding bugs that will cost time and money to fix. Phrase it as a company focus for efficiency. The more tests you have, the faster new features can be created and the less time you have to spend fixing unseen bugs. As the sole developer, this should be part of your job, find the ways to speed up development without sacrificing security. If your management is decent, you speaking up about problems should be welcomed.\n\nIf they refuse as it's not the current focus, just be sure to bring it up (respectfully) whenever they get annoyed by bugs, or the slower than expected pace of development/fixing.",

I had other issues at the time as well and felt like a complete failure. My honest advice would be to never give up. I ended up getting something near Summer. People told me it was too late months before that and would humble brag about their offers.\n\nAlso, make sure you get your sleep (easier said than done I know). You won't be able to perform during interviews without sleep though. Also your resume looks good, I'd include a bit more metrics in your work experience and maybe add another point there as well.",

The anxiety is real but you need to shift from panicing to systematically fixing what's broken. If volume is part of your strategy (and at this point it kind of has to be), SimpleApply keeps coming up when people talk about this exact problem.\n\nIt automates the application grind and tailors your materials for each role, so you can hit way more positions without burning out on the repetitive form-filling. Worth checking out since you're already in spam mode anyway but need better targeting and customization. Beyond tools tho, get someone to review your resume.\n\nNo-name school doesn't matter as much as you think if your projects are solid and your resume isn't getting filtered out by ATS for dumb formatting reasons. Also look at smaller companies and startups, not just the big names that get 10k applicants per role",
