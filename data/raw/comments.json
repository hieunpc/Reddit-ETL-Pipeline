If your time are mostly spend on doing the mental work of wrangling data, the tools that are much user friendly is much preferable. \n\nThe same reason why python is popular. Ofc there’s a factor where you can do rust/cpp bindings but in general it’s more to do with how python is much more user friend interactive scripting language.

That shift feels pretty fundamental.\n\nThe biggest change on my side is tighter collaboration cycles. DE gets pulled in earlier when a new product idea forms since everyone knows messy upstream data will kill the project later. Ownership has improved a bit too, mostly because teams finally realized they can’t bolt governance on at the end.\n\nIt still varies a lot by company, but the places that treat DE as a core layer tend to move faster and spend less time firefighting.

If you constantly put in bad gasoline and never change the oil, the car will still run for a while but over time, performance drops, parts wear out, and things start to break.

I work in Norway and rather not describe the industry, as it is such a niche thing that a google search will hit us on page 1 lol - but it is a big and profitable industry :)\n\nCurrent project: establishing Snowflake as a data platform for enabling large-scale internal analytics on structured data. Basically involves: setting pipelines to copy data from operational databases into  analytical databases (+ setting up jobs to pre-calculate tables for analysis team)\n\nData size: a few TBs in total, but daily ingestion of < 1Gb.\n\nStack: AWS Lambda (in Python) to write data from AWS RDS as parquet in S3 (triggered by EventBridge daily); (at the moment) Snowflake Tasks to ingest data from S3 into raw layer in Snowflake; Dynamic Tables to create tables in Snowflake from its Raw layer up to user's consumption; PowerBI as BI tool.\n\nArchitecture choice was to divide our data movement in 2 main parts:  \n\\- Part 1: From our operational databases to parquet files in S3  \n\\- Part 2: From parquet in S3 to Snowflake raw layer.\n\nInside Snowflake, other pipelines to move from RAW to analytical-ready layer (under construction/consideration, but most likely will be dbt building dynamic tables) -> so  a medallion architecture.\n\nThe idea was to keep data movement as loosely coupled as possible. This was doable because we dont have low-latency requirements (daily jobs are more than enough for analytics)\n\nIn my opinion, keeping the software developer mindset while designing architecture was the biggest leverage I had (modularity and loose coupling being the 2 main ones that came to mind).  \nTwo books that I highly recommend are \"Design Data Intensive Applications\" (for the theoretical aspects on why certain choices for modern data engineering are relevant) and \"Software Architecture: The hard parts\" (for the software engineering trade-offs that are actually applied to data architectures)",

Here are my two cents *with a twist* on it.  \n  \n**Type of firm**   \nFinOps - SW Procurement and IT Cost Management\n\n**Current project brief description**   \nBuilding Data Platform for Client Expenditure Reports\n\n**Data size**   \n\\~2B records raw (source), \\~1M aggregated (target)\n\n**Stack and architecture**  \nPySpark, SQL, Azure (Databricks and SQL Database), GitHub\n\n**Brief explanation of the flow**  \n0. Multiple datasources (files, DBs, APIs) -> 1. DataFactory pipelines, transferring data to Databricks (Catalogs) -> 2. Writing custom transformations (Notebooks) -> 3. Packing them in separate Jobs and scheduling execution -> 4. Transferring data to Azure SQL DB. -> 5. Data used in (PowerBI) reports.\n\n**Two cents**  \nI'm working in a small, but very capable team - initially we were a band of three, since recently only two persons, so we get occasional helping hand from SWE Tech Lead when load becomes too big. We don't have dedicated architect nor major restraints regarding stack, other than to have pipelines running inside Azure Databricks (medallion arch ofc). We started this project from scratch, having *all the freedom* regarding implementation. Currently we are in our 8th month, approximately two more to finish this phase (creating and migrating all reports from old to new platform).   \n  \nBiggest lesson learned - **DO NOT** get in love with your code!   \n  \nIf project is constantly growing, take time and effort to make sure you **still** have scalable solution. Don't be afraid to completely overhaul your solution.   \nWe refactored our complete codebase 2 times already. First time right after our very first successful production run (4 month into the project). It wasn't good for the moral because we put great effort to come up with working solution at that time, but we knew we had to re-do almost everything if we were going to add more things in near future. Felt low-on-fuel, but overall happy with what we had. Second one came just a month after all that, in order to accommodate some intra-company changes... Didn't sit right with us, especially because we were short-staffed at that moment, but went for it. And it's the best thing we could have done! Now we have highly reusable code, flexible to implement any new request and not worry of breaking any existing feature. \n\nAnd finally, the **Twist**  \nIf you want to learn more (quickly) about DA, kickstart some personal project! Try to solve something that's dear to you. Leverage available vibe/ai-tools if you want to come up with full-stack solution, trust me it's worth the effort! I've dived into two personal projects since summer (one NBA fantasy related, other for organizing my pick-up basketball group) and I couldn't be happier to see them up and running, and even used by some complete strangers! That way I branched out (and returned) to some other tools, services and methodologies (Airflow, Postgres, Supabase, CORS etc.) which I probably won't touch in my current company. I feel like I've expanded my horizons in more ways and topics from this experience than with any other work/company related one. You get to wear multiple technical hats, call all the shots and learn from your (and only your) mistakes.\n\nAnyhow, whichever learning path you decide to take, make sure to \\*enjoy the process! \\^\\^  \n  \n^(\\*but don't fall in love with your code/solution :D)",

Personally I think she was more capable than 99% of alleged managers who claimed to be technical. What she had was the mother load of common sense and soft skills that could turn a honey badger into a kids pet.\n\nShe was a listener, someone whose mantra was trust but verify. She expected you to know and do your job. She'd fight for (and mostly win) when we told her we needed resources.  If you betrayed that trust then God help you.\n\nIf you get a manager like her, look after her, support her, make sure she doesn't burn out.\n\nThe worst, non sociopathic manager was someone who actually had been a successful developer, was a bit of a geek. Would describe themselves as a \"Thought Leader\" and clearly believed they were a 12x developer. \n That meant they wouldn't listen. Thought they new it all, made fundamental decisions in isolation without consultation. They turned the data estate into a data sewage farm.\n\nHe wasn't evil,  malicious or unpleasant as a person. Have you ever seen the 1950s film When World's Collide where a giant spaceship gets launched into space along an inclined rail ramp up a mountain?\nIf that mountain was named Dunning Kruger then that spaceship was his ego.\n\nAnyway, if you get someone like the lady I mentioned,  no worries.

This will be revenue generation, adding new features but unlikely to be cost reduction. They also assume that things automagically happen; that you are doing the 10 billion things they want AND finding time to shovel years of tech debt shit.\n\nIt takes a lot of skill to design a bonus scheme that doesn't result in negative results in the medium/long term. In my experience the C Suite rarely have that skill or foresight.\n\nAs an ex-DBA I tune queries and code as a matter of personal pride.  It's caring because it's in my nature and what lets me sleep at night. Eventually the accumulation of unturned code and queries does catch up with you. Eventually the cost of throwing hardware at it is just too great. I notice that experienced DEs tune to. It's an uphill battle when the company just wants a magic feature pump and will reward feature pump behaviour.\n\nIf you run your own datacentre there is a physical constraints on how many servers, cooling systems, power conduits and racks you can fit within 4 walls.

A company might have tons of things they can do but resources are limited and cashflow is essential for stability so sometimes you might have something that is profitable but it doesn't align with the cashflow plan and resource management (people) or even it's outside of what the company is invested on (that's a balance execs usually decide on).\n\nThat's why very big companies hire tons of people to fire them afterwards (bad resource management and cashflow). For instance, they hire 100 people because the numbers of query optimisation show that they payoff but in the end they don't and even if they do query optimisation will not create cashflow which makes resource allocation in the end a tricky matter.",

It is there only to ingest data and it works well for that purpose.\n\n  \nMain advantages are it can be deployed on a container within your network(more work to configure) where it runs next to your sources will PUSH data to Snow (no need for open inbound firewalls) OR can be hosted in your account fully managed by Snow which then will PULL the data (will need to open up firewalls to allow).\n\n  \nFor most Databases, it uses the lightweight change tracking features of the host database (not the CDC which uses a lot of resources on host server) so you don't need to install agents in your network or on the DB servers.\n\n  \nI have many customers who use it for this purpose perfectly fine. As long as you use it to replicate and use other Snow Data engineering features for Transforms, it should get the job done.",

You can't really bring a software development mindset into designing a data analytics environment (though software engineering skills and practices are certainly valuable for parts of it) \n\nThe best starter kit I'd recommend that lets you start simple and lightweight and local and then grow is Dagster+dbt. Go through the Dagster+dbt tutorial and examples to set up a monorepo that contains both projects. Until you deploy a persistent server instance somewhere, they're both just python packages you can import and run locally. I like to use uv and require them both into different dependency groups within the same root `pyproject.toml`. Using Dagster as a hub you can get really close to the full stack opinionated framework feeling \n\nfor analysis you can do notebooks out of that repo or use Evidence.

Lock interfaces with data contracts so schema drift breaks CI, not prod. Promotion path: infra as code for env parity, MLflow as the model registry, shadow/canary deploys, and a feature store (Feast) to keep train/serve consistent. \n\nHave one dashboard for ops with logs, metrics, and run status; Datadog or Grafana + Loki works.\nWith Prefect and MLflow handling runs and model registry, DreamFactory helps when we need quick REST APIs over Snowflake/SQL Server so product teams can call models and tables without spinning up new services.\nMake failure obvious, standardize the path, and production stops taking months.",

A production pipeline should never fail silently. If the issue is more on the SLA side you can use an observability tool external to Airflow that supports SLAs or a control Dag that flags if a Dag that should have run did not.  \nAlso make sure you have a good way to forward issues to the person who developed the prototype so there is a feedback loop to catch patterns that cause production issues.\n\n\\>  too many moving parts (Airflow jobs + custom scripts + cloud functions)  \nThat one is tricker, might help to have a more defined CICD workflow and if it is not the case yet having everything in version control, so no part gets changed without validating the change does not break anything. Also clear code ownership.\n\n\\> no single place to see what’s running, what failed, and why\n\nThe budget solution here is to add Airflow Dags that check what is running and what failed (control Dag again), the fancier solution is to add lineage to your deployment and evaluate that through an observability tool.\n\n\\> models stuck because infra isn’t ready\n\nMight be helpful to orchestrate infra provisioning from within the same pipeline as the models with a setup task before the model related tasks and a teardown one afterwards.\n\n\\> engineers spending more time fixing orchestration than building features\n\nThere is an upfront time cost but all of the above should help with this. :)\n\n\\> business teams waiting weeks for something that “worked fine in the notebook”\n\nSame; that hopefully will get faster once the processes and best practices are in place. Which I know is always a battle to communicate to business teams why reliability and maintainability work matters. What I've done before is trying to explain it like this:\n\nThe notebook is like having working prototype of a car. We can drive it around, verify that it runs great. But having the feature/model in production means we have to make many cars automatically, build a whole car factory. If we have to build all the robots that make the cars from scratch that will take a while but if we take the time to build very flexible good robots, eventually building a new car factory will be fast as well. And maybe we can even start to quickly build a bicycle factory if needed.",

If you're in the UAE and you feel trapped, makes me wonder if you're from a developing country where UAE is offering a good alternative.\n\n\\- People with jobs are almost always more attractive to employers than people without. Is there a reason searching for new jobs while staying in your current job is not an option? Could you search for different jobs in UAE or at home whilst still in your current one?\n\n\\- 5 hour commute is absolutely insane. Doing anything you can, even accepting worse housing options or conditions, or paying more for housing, may be worth getting back that time. Even if you had one hour back from commute, that's 1 hour you could develop your skills, or meditate and try and separate yourself from the stress of work, or search for jobs, or just relax. Giving you more personal time will multiply your effectiveness both at work, at self improvement, and at pushing your career.\n\n\\- freelance or remote work seems extremely difficult and competitive. It will probably need you to be good at optimising your offerings to clients, being a good salesman, good at negotiating more work,, etc etc. If you are struggling with stakeholder management at your UAE job, this may not be the way.\n\n\\- Real life experience >>>> bootcamps and self driven projects, unless you are very good at learning real life 2skills from self driven projects (past positive achievements in this would be a green flag).\n\n\\- Again back to the jobs thing, bootcamps, freelance, etc puts you in the desparate masses of unemployed tech. Having an actual, real data job elevates you above everyone else in the bottom of the barrel. Don't take your foot out of the door unless you are ok with it closing, or you have another door open elsewhere.\n\n\\- For your UAE job, you have to step back from your tech focus and focus on people skills, expectations management, and building alliances.\n\n1. Find smart, driven people in the org who understand you and are receptive to the problems. Recruit them as allies. Find out what they need and support them. Example from my work. Normally, cybersecurity and data have an adversarial relationship. Data wants to move data and make it accessible, cyber wants to say no, to wrap everything in paperwork. But by meeting with the cybersecurity guy, saying noone in my dept cares about cybersecurity, wants to make it happen, I want to do it, help me, we become friends. I speak up for cybersecurity in my department, he is careful with how he rolls out cybersecurity (he avoids saying \"no\" reflexively because he knows I can be trusted, and he needs to balance security vs useablity), he speaks up for my data needs as a precondition for effective security in meetings, etc.\n2. Your job sounds like a consultant job. Consultants have the problem all the time of being parachuted into crazy broken situations with clients who want everything fixed, but don't have much money and are defensive about change (dogwithfrisbeeinmouthmeme.jpg - only fix, no diagnose or make us look bad!). This is a huge industry so learn from consultants about how to come in, get the client on your side, help talk them around to fixes without making them look bad, change management, etc etc. Youtube, books etc might be a help here.\n3. Expectations management, expectations management, expectations management. You need pitch decks about what you will be doing, what might come up, and how this can help them. etc etc.",

Fuzzy matching, probabilistic matching, joining on multiple identity columns/definitions, blah blah blah - if you've soaked up some of those kinds of problems in a reconciliations environment, you'll be surprised how often they come up in different situations.\n\nAs you mention, a lot of those \"garage-clearance\" problems are at the root of what stands in the way of success in any large organisation - this is the type of work that an Enterprise or Data Architect would seek to address/solve - so if you've got the stomach for trying to fix those kinds of very real problems, that might be an angle to look into - entry might be through a Solutions Architect route, where you get to design specific systems targeted at solving specific problem areas - that was my \"in\", and I found it presented a nice wide range of things to work on, while keeping a reasonable focus project per project. What you're also noticing is that there's a set of things that separate \"what looks good\" from what's been rushed or hidden due to incompetence. A good architect needs to be able to demonstrate one from the other.\n\nIf you get the change to study some TOGAF that can help give you some useful language and tools to shape larger projects both at a Solutions level, or if you want to go in that direction at an Enterprise level. Data Architects are still a bit of a nebulous term, with no real solution/enterprise level distinction. (Personal gripe on my part, I often go into a role as a DA, but sometimes the expectation is to provide modelling and understanding support, and then in another project, I might be asked to spec out a data platform on some new cloud-based data platform - totally different tasks/roles, both called Data Architects! - v annoying)\n\nBut best of luck, it can be frustrating to find yourself mid-career in a role/situation that doesn't stretch you, or support your development - part of that you've already overcome in identifying the problem, so compared to 70% of folks, you're already making the right moves.",

So you're computing over long baseline rolling windows, and you're wrestling with the fact that\n\n- old records can receive long-delayed updates\n- that could meaningfully change your past computed values\n- bringing those values closer to 'the truth'\n- but the source system has no recorded update timestamp that you could use to decide which data to include in the batch, only a unique ID for each record\n?\n\n(Before I suggest something, let me just note that there's a solution space that involves talking to whomever it is that controls the upstream and persuading them about the merits of SCD fields. But assuming that's not an option:)\n\nHow about this:\n- you have to load _all_ data into GCS every day because of the lack of update timestamps\n- use GCS lifecycle rules to quickly move old data into archival storage: you're not going to need it unless you need to run the entire process from the top\n- in your warehouse, create staging tables:\n\n1. CDC table, which persists (more on this below)\n2. today's batch, overwritten entirely every day, simple upload from GCS\n3. change table, created every day by comparing (1) with (2) to find rows that have changed (for example, using `EXCEPT DISTINCT` if supported by your warehouse)\n\nNow, the idea is to update the CDC table using the change table. It should have a couple of extra columns vs the source: `valid_from` and `valid_until`. You filter on `valid_until IS null` when constructing the change table, to get the latest version of each record. Otherwise, you ignore these columns when constructing the change table.\n\nIf a row with a certain ID appears in the change table, you first need to update its latest record in the CDC table, such that `valid_until` is changed from `null` to yesterday's date. That record now tells you that the row changed in today's batch; it had those values yesterday, but not today.\n\nFinally, you insert the new version of the row (from the change table) into the CDC table, setting `valid_from` to today's date and `valid_until` to `null`: this is now the current version of the row.\n\nI think this gets you where you need to be:\n- the CDC table is a persistent record of all changes\n- it can be rebuilt from scratch in an emergency, by iterating the above process over the old data batches in GCS archival storage\n- you can `SELECT * FROM cdc_table WHERE valid_until IS null` to build the current version of the data; you can then compute your rolling window over _that_ table",

Uses the fact that storage is cheap and keeps the ingestion simple and straightforward.\n\nDuring ingestion, add an extracted_at timestamp column. \nAfterwards as a post-processing step, dedup by keeping the record with the most recent extracted_at timestamp per unique key (using row_number() over the composite key partition for example). Index/cluster on the timestamp and composite unique key for performance.\n\nIf recording the exact changes (SCD2) is not part of the current requirement, I think this approach keeps the ingestion simple, produces less logic to maintain, and is flexible enough to allow for a more complex logic in the future when the need arises (you can recompute/backfill as you have all of the raw data).\n\nYou always keep the most recent version of each unique entitiy in your table, thereby having an exact copy of source. This approach also handles deletes in source.\n\nLastly the real solution here is collaboration with the upstream owners of the data. Sit with them and figure out if there is a way to add a CDC field to the source. Or ingest with cdc on logs. \nIn any case communication and collaboration will always be the more sustainable and cheapest solution over overengineering.",

Besides a managed opinionated runtime with nice ci and an \"implicit data mesh\" architecture, adds a transformation engine that enables runtime-agnostic code via python or sql.\n\nWith end to end lineage, metadata etc and python native, this is also a LLM-native dev tool with some impressive results. I won't spoil it, but transformations don't need to be so time consuming either. we were experimenting with adding boring semantic layer.\n\nwe are going to release the \"one man data team\" version (with limited collaboration features, think small teams) end of q1 next year.\n\nSo if you're a team of 1-5, apply for our early access linked above :)",

Some readjustments maybe. Then you add Spark streaming or Flink on top which is pretty similar to batch pipelines, you already know windowing, exactly once, at least once stuff etc. \n\nThe questions start afterwards, what are you doing with the data. This is where people dont hear satisfying answers, are you making a model like hypothetical customer propensity. Do you have a schema registry, feature store, online vs offline, inferential pipeline, entity resolution, processed timestamp vs generated ts etc.Chwckpoints, Storage questions like Redis vs Cassandra. You are in a pretty good position to learn streaming pipelines, just read some books and extend the knowledge towards streaming, its not about the technology, its always what are you tryijg to solve and the tools supporting you.

You already have years of that.\n\nStreaming helps when the business truly needs low latency, but plenty of teams still run on well designed batch work. If you’re worried about the gap, picking up a small personal project or contributing to something internal can be enough to show you understand the concepts.

No point having any kind of MI that refreshes every second if your people who action only look at a dashboard in the morning and after lunch and cant do anything with that info anyway. \n\nIve recently finished reversing a lot of near Realtime pipelines as they are expensive and add complication to what really is a batch BI process.\n\n  \nStating the obvious that applications do need realtime pipelines though and im referring to BI/MI",

So, the question for me is always, how easy is it to customize that last little bit? Is there a framework/tool that covers the common stuff, and has a way to easily add a bit more custom behavior to meet those last few things, whatever they are. And, of course, \"how risky is it to adopt this tool?\" -- is it too new/untested? Is it too old/dying out? Or is it \"just right.\"",

But the current state of the job market makes that difficult.\n\nNext best: move internally or upgrade the responsibilities of your current role. It is worth having a direct discussion about development goals with your manager (assuming they are a reasonable person). I would also ask directly how you can move into the \"real\" dev team. The answer might disappoint you but it will help you decide on next steps.\n\nThe most likely situation is that you will be stuck in your current role for a period of time. You will need to make the most of it. The upside to this is that you are directly involved in customer onboarding and therefore revenue generation, so your job is likely to be safer than the developers.\n\nTo do that I would push standardisation of projects as strongly as you can. Migration inputs should follow target a standardised schema with a well defined spec for all fields. That then allows you to work on building tools to automate as much of the process as possible. For example, comprehensive validation and data quality checks, with automatically generated reporting outputs.\n\nYou can follow a similar approach to reporting: standardise and automate. Push back on customization. Even if it is a potential revenue stream, customised reporting is effectively low margin contract work and will be a maintenance nightmare in the long term. Focus on the business reasons and less on your personal motivations for avoiding this type of work.\n\nAnd of course work on your skills outside of work. Build an end to end pipeline using one of the big cloud platforms. This can be extremely simple from a data modelling perspective. The purpose is to get hands on experience of setting up processes and managing cloud services yourself.",

I use duckdb’s read_blob with hive partitioning against s3 to load blob assets without needing a database for metadata. Only problem is that the read_blob fetch mechanism loads all data at once instead of just the batch being fetched. The incremental fetch loading works fine for read_parquet though. For now I have a workaround where I load all the metadata by not reading the content and then incrementally calling read_blob with a batch of filenames from the metadata at a time, but would be nice to just natively support incremental result loading to make the experience more seamless and approachable. \n\nhttps://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-python/discussions/92",

Models can help interpret messy text once it’s extracted, but they’re not great at pulling characters off a page on their own. The slow and inconsistent behavior you’re seeing is pretty normal when you rely on an LLM to do both jobs.\n\nWhat tends to work better is splitting the pipeline. Use a dedicated OCR tool to get clean text and structure, then let an LLM handle the fuzzy parts like picking out which date actually matters in a contract. It also keeps costs and latency predictable since the model isn’t wasting cycles trying to guess handwriting strokes.\n\nIf your contracts follow similar patterns, you might even get away with a simple template based parser once the OCR is solid. The fancy model becomes more of a fallback than the main extractor. Curious if the slow part for you is the OCR step or the interpretation step.",

As to your question, if you have spreadsheets that have similar or same info listed under different labels, then yes. You may have import tables where you upload your spreadsheets initially and can settle for \"NAME\" instead of Owner, Buyer, etc. But to get to 3NF, you want to get to a point where you only have one table that has the NAME column on it with other info. You don't want to have multiple tables with the same type of data.\n\nTake time to define what you want from this CRM database. Flesh out the details of reports you want to run. Keep in mind some report data is derived from facts in the database and aren't necessarily stored as underlying data. Also have a handle on the data you are importing. Iterate how you will map that data to your new data structure. Once you have a line of sight on how your raw data will map to your normalized database and that then generates your reports, create your objects.\n\nAlso see [diagrams.net](http://diagrams.net), it's FOSS flowchart tool.

The challenge is that a spreadsheet is more like tables in a micro data warehouse  that a true relational database. As a side note once you do this you could migrate off spreadsheets to cloud tool like Airtable that is a little more enterprise like for a CRM tool. It has the feel of a spreadsheet with the some of power of database tables. Back to the original question, renaming column names across spreadsheets in the theory shouldn't be a problem unless you have some wicked formulas that depend on unique column names. You could always make a copy of the excel spreadsheets and try using the FIND and REPLACE function to do renaming across the sheets. If it doesn't work or causes issues then you haven't killed your main CRM files. Happy to look at a few screen shots of what you are wanting to do and provide more targeted help.",

For example, if you want to run the feedback loop (let's call it \\`feedback.py\\`) every 6 hours, you would simply edit the crontab. This is done directly in your shell by running \\`crontab -e\\`. Then add the following line: \\`0 \\*/6 \\* \\* \\* /path/to/your/script/feedback.py\\`.\n\nThis tells your server to execute the \\`/path/to/your/script/feedback.py\\` scripts every 6 hours.  \nHow often the script should run depends a lot on how you use the feedback, and how much traffic you have.\n\nFeel free to send me a message if you need any help!",

I mean, if you don't do UI, get an LLM to set you up a React project, have it throw together a couple of example pages, read the code, and you're probably off to the races making changes in a day or two at most.\n\nDon't give up your power!",

You don't see YouTubers doing it for the same reason TV cooking shows have \"one already made\" in the oven to skip over the step most people find tedious to witness. But in terms of actual practice: doing that gives you insight into how different patterns overlap (or are even the same pattern wearing a different moustache) and it's *great* for building your capabilities.\n\nIdeally, for maximum safety, you have tests in place before making changes like that so you can confirm that a change that was just \"saying the same thing more clearly\" doesn't actually break the program. But the importance of doing that scales with the number of people on the project, the likelihood someone who didn't write your code becomes responsible for maintaining it, and lines of code in the project; for a small, personal project, one script, one file of functions, that kind of testing might be overkill.\n\n(To put on my guy-who's-been-at-this-for-thirty-three-years philosopher's hat: programming is different from other engineering disciplines because the description of the thing we do very nearly *is* the thing we do. It's like magic... Like *old* magick. \"The name of the thing is the thing.\" If you find yourself only being able to put two hands on a problem after you've written one crack at how to solve it, that's *extremely* normal, because you describe the problem with words but also solve it with words. As you gain more experience you often can do more of that work in your head and you'll see more problems that you immediately go \"Oh I'll just solve that with X\" because you've solved a nearly-identical problem before, but looking at the code you just wrote and going \"Oh it'd be easier if I just\\~\" is extremely normal. Programmers aren't rock-stars; we're *writers*. Much like an author realizing a deeper truth about their characters after making a first draft, we often grasp our problems better one we have *one* solution for them on the table.)",

What the CLI app does doesnt matter a ton, maybe its a thin wrapper around git, maybe just checks the weather from some external api. The key is that you are able to talk about your experience creating the CLI app on your resume and in an interview. As for the API, I have only had experiences with a basic CRUD and REST HTTP Apis. If you want to use something newer go for that! But as others have said, it would be best to use some form of enterprise framework. If you dont know any, dont worry too much! Just get a first draft out there and start applying! Take inspiration from something you care about in life, i built a movie tracking api, pretty much a letterboxd.com clone when i was trying to beef up my resume for my first job.\n\nBeing able to talk about the standard coding practices like DRY, DI, OOP would be good too.

If you have done a few different things and I can ask you questions like, \"How did building an app in TS/RN compare to buidling it in Swift/Kotlin?\", or \"Which of the JS/TS toolchains did you prefer?\", some good answers to questions like that will get you about 95% of the way there for a hire from me. \n\nThe AWS certs are useful, kind of, but immediately become much more useless if I ask somebody what they have actually done with the knowledge and they tell me \"nothing much\". I'd much rather talk to a person who has built a few different things with AWS and can talk about what worked and didn't work for them and what they might do different. \n\nI'd say just go and get the experience you can't get at work, if you are motivated to do so.

Yeah, those things that took whole minutes to load part of a game.\n\nAnyway, I was hooked. It looked so cool. You could make the computer do anything you could think of.\n\nI loved games and fancied myself a future game programmer.\n\nI didn't take any classes (there weren't really any back then, where I was from)\n\nI didn't LEARN programming, like sitting in front of a machine doing lessons. I wanted to try something, tried to research what I needed to do to accomplish it, and tried it out.\n\nI made many, many things along the way and most of the time, it was, \"for fun\".\n\nAs an example, in the early 2000's the MMORPG Ragnarok became popular around the world (and in south east asia). I came across some code that could extract and view the 3D models of maps and buildings in the Ragnarok data file and decided I wanted to make a program that would let you look around the map as you wanted using WASD controls.\n\nThus RagCam was born, and it was shared in some communities.\n\nI was also able to find some code to import 3D models into the then popular 3D software 3D Studio max. \n\nI also made a system tray Desktop Toy that let you \"Store Files\" in the \"Kafra Storage\" A Kafra is a NPC in the game that you interact with to store stuff, and I made a program that pops up the image of the anime-style girl in a kid of maid outfit where you can store notes and files.\n\nWhen I got into pirating (ahem, \"streaming\") TV shows I wanted to get notified if there was a new episode, so I made a local site that checked for updates. I also made a scraper that downloaded (english) subtitles based on the file name.\n\nI try to make programs that intersect or tanget my interests, which include anime, games, emulation of retro consoles, and more recently AI generated images.\n\nIt's really up to you to define what programming means to you,\n\nI'm an old soul, and for me programming is more than just a way to earn money or the latest technology and cool frameworks.\n\nIt's an interface between me and my inner self. A way to self-express through technology.\n\nMake programming fun. It's all about you.\n\nIn the corporate world, I did some fun stuff.

If any bucket shows >1, it's not an isogram. \n\nADD: But can we go even faster? Do we need to check the whole word? No, we can say \"not isogram\" when we discover the FIRST repeated character. We don't need to got through the whole word. \n\nADD: So we loop through the word, +1 to bucket of matching letter. \n\nBut before you add 1, check if the bucket is 1 or 0. If it's 1, this is a repeat letter, then you exit the loop and answer \"not isogram\".

You gotta treat it like a petty toddler that is going to do exactly what you tell it to, to. the. letter. Take a problem you want to solve break it down into smaller problems, then worry about combining them later. While you're doing that discard any features that aren't critical to accomplish the primary goal, this gets you a minimum viable product. Worry about bells and whistles after you got and MVP.\n\nSearch Stack Overflow, reddit, and youtube for help and, if you really want to learn programming, ignore AI. Using AI will not make you a competent programmer it's robbing you of the headbanging frustration required to breakthrough to understanding.

The best way to learn is to try things, and you will find success so long as you don't stop trying to achieve your goal.

        "body": "The battleship game actually sounds pretty hard for a beginner, which you still are. My expectation would be that resources would be provided to you to help you complete the project. If there are no such resources, then it's understandable that you've turned to using a tool (AI) that genuinely can help a beginner write a moderately complex program. Though I don't use it for certain reasons, and I don't really recommend using it, I don't think there's shame in using it for this purpose.\n\nHowever, if there are resources available to you, especially professors or teaching assistants you can talk to, I advise you to go to them with your questions. You can also look online for help with some of the more common pitfalls.\n\nThe key thing I will emphasize is that there is usually some frustration and discipline required in order to \"get\" what your program is doing (or isn't doing, if you've run into a bug). Staring blankly at the screen or turning to AI for an attempt at a quick fix won't do much to resolve the root problem, which is a lack of understanding. And to understand sometimes really does require you to step through your program one line at a time with a debugger, printing things out along the way, until you know exactly what your program is doing.\n\nIf you're just struggling to get any code written, it's best to start by breaking the problem down into smaller tasks. For example, you said the game uses a 4x4 grid. My first thought would be: how am I representing this grid? Probably it's useful to know if a part of a ship is on a grid cell or if it's just water. That might lead you to the idea to represent the grid as an array of bools, where a cell holds true if a part of a ship is there and false if not. That's not necessarily \"the best\" way to do it, it's just a way. As a beginner you're not expected to come up with the best or fastest or prettiest solution, it just needs to work.\n\nIt also helps to translate your ideas into plain English and then into pseudocode before writing any actual code. The jump from thoughts in your head or words in an assignment specification to real code is usually too much when you're just starting, except for the really simple things. If you go straight to writing code, you'll usually end up running into errors or bugs that aren't easy to fix because you haven't thought enough about what your program should really be doing yet. Better to do that thinking up front, write the key things down, write pseudocode that roughly represents what you wrote, and then translate the pseudocode into real code. As you get more experience you can skip/truncate some of these steps, but it's rarely a waste of time to be diligent in this way, in my experience.",

The advice that served me well when I started 20-ish years ago (I’m 40 now) was this: early in career, build broad base general skills and allow your curiosity to drive casual exploration of niche disciplines -> later in career build specialized skills in what you’re most interested in and what you can get a job in, both. \n\nThe way I did this: \n\n1. Python and C were my broad base languages. I learned them well and chose them because they’re used everywhere. Early on, I focused on design patterns and learning the abstract algebra and category theory that explains why those design patterns work. I also focused on getting really good at C and Python intending to keep them as my core language. \n2. From there in 2013 I noticed functional programming was gaining traction, so I decided to learn Haskell. After that I got put on a project at my company that required Scala and I excelled at it because knowing Python, C, and Haskell gave me an edge over other engineers who didn’t have all three (especially Haskell). That set me apart and enabled me to get good at Akka, Spark, and later Cats Effect, which propelled me into Big Data. Also given the landscape at this time I was forced to learn Java 🤷🏻‍♂️, I didn’t care for it and more or less endured it. \n3. At this point as a mid level engineer I’d now gotten exposure to low-level and embedded C, desktop development, server development and database programming, web development, streaming development, microservices, data science, big data engineering involving batch and mini batch processing and data ingestion, machine learning, AI, procedural OOP, and functional programming through Haskell and Scala.\n4. I discovered I liked the problems and wild-west style complexity of big data environments so I chose to specialize in that. That prompted me to focus on Scala FP for streaming (Cats Effect, Akka) and Spark (batch and mini batch), Python (PySpark, Pandas, Scikitlearn, Airflow, etc), and Go (Kubernetes and other distributed system type stuff).  In 2025 it’s still doing really well for me. \n\nI was able to learn all of this stuff by taking about an hour a day 4-ish days a week plus 2-4 hours on Saturday a couple times a month in the first 5-10 years of my career to work on personal exploration type of stuff and choosing to stay focused on one thing long enough to really know it (when I got curious about something, I would add it to a list I kept for that to give me the feeling that I would get to it even though I knew I wouldn’t - but I did pick from that list when I finished something and wanted to pick up something new).",

Usually push back on things that will take a lot of time, currently not supported.\n\nWill sit down have a think at what teams need to be involved, meet with their engineering managers, try flesh out if timelines can lineup. Use any political clout i have to try get them to adjust  etc.... At this stage usually starting to break it out into sections and who can do the work and if they are free. Meet with EM's and PM's again to break down further and cut scope if needed.\n\nFrom here I usually have a good idea of what is needed, the requirements in terms of performance, accessibility, delivery time frames, apis, storage etc.\n\nNow I usually try and research any unknowns etc, high level data structures and apis to use. This involves prototypes and a lot of throw away code. Sometimes reading papers etc.\n\nThis will usually result in some form of document, DACI etc that can be shared to gain consensus, get alignment amongst EM and PM etc.\n\nThen all of this gets thrown away and we do the actual work cause none of this stands up to reality... as deadlines loom, VPs change their mind on priorities, marketing doesn't agree with what we are delivering, teams that we rely on to deliver their features descope and no longer support what we are doing... \n\nThen we usually just do what you do and start coding and deal with the issues as they turn up....",

        "body": "Basic project management, and this is something that I fought with every day in my former job as PMO head.\n\nIf your job is to manage a software project, then you need to act like a project manager, not a software developer. \n\nProject management is pretty simple (in theory), but often difficult for technically-oriented people. \n\nFor example, the manufacturing department came to us (IT) and told us that they were developing a new product and putting up a new production building for it. The project was assigned to an ERP solution architect, who immediately saw that this is an ERP project - implementing a new BOM (bill of materials) and warehouse management for the new site. This was designed, built, tested, and delivered. \n\nBut, because he was an ERP solution architect, and not a trained project manager, he completely ignored the whole infrastructure side of the project - it was a new building, so it needed cabling, WiFi routers, client devices, and a new conference room. This only popped up a few weeks before the \"ribbon cutting\" on the new site, when someone came around and asked when we were going to install the hardware, and no one knew what he was talking about. \n\nWe were literally pulling cables inside the building while the CEO was outside talking to the local news teams announcing the start of production. \n\nSo, my advice to anyone who is given a project to lead: First, stop and think. Ask yourself if you really see the ENTIRE problem that needs to be solved. THEN break it down into manageable chunks, and plan each one of those in terms of resources and efforts. Once the plan has been agreed and the necessary resources are on board, THEN you start designing the solution (either traditional/sequential project, or a series of agile sprints).",

HTML basics - create a \"recipe\"-webside using sections, headers, paragraphs, lists, images and links. (This also includes getting to know the editor, setting up a local server, using git, deploying on github, etc.)\n2. HTML semantics - look into `b`, `s`, `i`, `strong`, `em`, and a lot of similar tags.\n3. HTML tables (if you want to)\n4. CSS basics - colors, fonts, backgrounds\n5. CSS layout - understand block vs inline, then immediately move on to `grid`!\n6. Forms - use HTML and CSS to create nicely layed out \"interactive\" forms with input-fields and buttons, that don't really do anything.\n7. (optional) interactive HTML elements, `dialog`, `details`, etc.\n8. JS introduction - using document.queryselector to select elements and change their class.\n9. JS events - add event listeners and functions to add (further) interactivity to your pages\n10. JS variables - keep state, make counters, etc.\n11. JS forms - receive form submissions in JS code, read values from forms, write to console\n12. JS DOM manipulation - write JavaScript code to modify page content, modify form-values\n13. JSON and Dynamic webpages - use JS to read JSON data and build a webpage with (optional) dynamic data, just read from a (server) local file.\n14. REST API - write JS to access an existing REST API, make a CRUD webpage\n15. ???\n16. profit!\n\nNote how additional HTML and CSS can be sprinkled into making the webpages more interesting as you add JS to them. Depending on your interests, you could add animations and color-grading and lots of other stuff, or go more towards the data-part of the application.",

You'll see things like objects, classes, methods, inheritance, etc. And from the perspective of a Java programmer, all that stuff just works \"by magic\", because the Java compiler and the JVM implement everything for you. Whereas if you think about how to implement the same thing in C, you'll be peeling back the layers of abstraction and you'll be forced to learn more about what's actually happening under the hood.\n\nThe same thing applies to data structures. In Java, you can just declare an `ArrayList<Foo>` that automatically resizes itself to fit the data it contains. C doesn't contain such a resizable array type, but you can implement it yourself using the lower-level primitives such as `malloc` and `realloc`. And doing that work yourself forces you to really understand what's going on. Writing something like that in C is a way to force yourself not to \"cheat\" by taking advantage of existing higher-level constructs.\n\nEven if you never plan to *use* C for any real projects, I personally believe that understanding low-level programming will help make you a better developer in the long run. \n\n(For one thing, it helps you get a better understanding of performance. In higher-level languages, the speed of a given piece of code depends largely on the behavior of many layers of abstraction that are being hidden from you. In C, what you write is much closer to what the CPU actually executes.)\n\nBut having said that: as a student, I don't think you should prioritize learning C over the actual courses that you're being graded on. Just study it on your own as time allows.",

Graphics card shaders are also written in a C-like language. I guess C is most similar to Assembly, so that's helpful when you want to learn about compilers or IT security.\n\n\nI don't know for sure where you would use Rust. Rust is less frustrating to build than C++. It's a more clean, modern language, but the borrowing model requires some patience to learn. Maybe five years ago the ecosystem wasn't as mature as C++ but now you can build the same kind of stuff.\n\n\nMaybe, for personal growth, learn a programming language that requires a different way of thinking, such as Haskell.

You will be missing things like pattern matching, type classes, multiple dispatch, etc. etc. and programming in something like Python after an exposure to, say, Clojure will make you frustrated from time to time. But it's ok, and the main advice I can give you for your future career is: \n\nDon't really focus on the language, editor, tools and libraries you use.

And it can be really really hard at first and takes a ton if practice and repetition... but the fun part, is that it's even easier to learn new languages the better you are at a previous language because of how concepts transfer. \n\nIf you know English and want to learn spanish, you arent \"starting over\" with spanish. You know what a verb is, you know what a noun is, adjective, subject, that conjugation exists, etc etc. You dont know how exactly that works in spanish, but you know that some words are \"things\" and those are called nouns and you just need to learn the rules spanish has for where to put a noun. Coding is the same. Once you learn what a loop is in Javascript, learning how to do that same concept in another language is just a quick google search for syntax and some memorization.\n\n\nSo think about what you want to make, then google \"best coding languages for X\". Dont waste any time finding the perfect language, look for like 30 seconds and then pick the one with the coolest logo, doesnt matter. Then stick with that language for as long as you can and master it. The more you focus on that one single language and master it, the faster you'll learn more languages in the future. \n\nYou dont care if Python is \"slow\", or JS is \"only for the web\", or that C++ is \"too hard\". That literally doesnt matter. The dude who made Vampire Survivors prototypes with Javascript because he knew Javascript, if you told him that JS is bad to make games with he would just laugh at you while he sits on top of his giant pile of money. Same could be said about Python, you will read about how \"slow\" it is, yet Spotify seems to work as far as I can tell. \n\n\nOnce you do a LITTLE research, and dont get too concerned with picking \"the best\" language, start learning and building things. Importantly, when you run into an obstacle that the language struggles with, power through and get it working with your chosen \"suboptimal\" language. You will learn a massive amount by doing that, and in the future you'll learn another language might have a shortcut for the issue at hand you were having, but leave that for the future. \n\nI'm not your dad so I cant tell you what to do, but if it were me and i didnt have a specific project i wanted to make, and i just wanted to learn a bit of everything,I would unironically just google \"top 5 coding languages\" and pick the one with the coolest logo. Whatever you go with, hyper fixate on that language and forget ever switching to a different language. Then after a couple years in the dojo with your first language, you'll be able to learn another language in a fraction of the time you spent on your first.",

All programming groups related data to manipulate them as an item. Where oop differentiate itself is that these groupings of related data have private implementation details and public interfaces that the rest of the program uses. An object may be holding on to a property value or it might have access to a database where that value is, but the rest of the program doesn’t need to know any of that.

If you're going solo, you're having to discover everything on your own.\n\nIntroductory programming materials are just that - introductory. They're teaching you grammar and syntax - enough to be dangerous, but it's only just the start. These tutorials and materials NEVER teach you how to USE the language, and they can't. There's so much nuance and detail and intuition that it can't be captured - you can't just be told.\n\nSo yeah, this is the time they call \"tutorial hell\", where you learn the hard way that there ARE NO tutorials that carry you to where you want to go. You burn yourself out on that before you accept your fate, and it's hard work from here.\n\nAnd I hope you're over this hump already, but learning C++ won't teach you how to make a game. You need linear algebra, calculus, and physics. You need to learn concepts like collision, frustums and culling, the light equation, model hierarchies, graph theory, inverse kinematics, audio, input, networking, shaders, normal mapping, texture mapping, gameplay, then you've got design, you'll probably want some embedded scripting like Lua, you'll need to support assets and their file formats...\n\nIt's best if you pick up the maths, because you can't avoid that one, and that you then use an engine that implements all the bits you're not interested in doing yourself. Building a game engine is every game developer's \"forever project\". If you actually want to MAKE GAMES, then make games, not engines.\n\nIf you want to get to the end, you can't escape it. Don't give up. Project planning and management is a powerful skill you can develop right now, because organization will set you free. Don't schedule due dates, but a road map, the things you need to do. You don't need a single straight line, you can offer yourself multiple paths, even in parallel, sort of like a choose your own adventure at times. Some things you have to learn in order, some things you have a choice. But get it all written down, along with planning your game. Don't go straight to coding, figure out what you're going to do first - no code, not even pseudo code. Start with some smaller games just to get smart and make cheap mistakes. Then get more involved.

We are all cognizant of time when learning as we are result expectant. (I need to know this now because I need money).\n\nFurthermore, to teach a concept like DSA 'will' require examples.

        "body": "Tldr: I dont understand your question or what your friend is saying... because data structures and algorithms are used in literally every programming language... below is a rant clarifying what I believe is what info you're missing. At the end of the day it doesn't matter\n\n\nIm assuming by DSA you are referring to Data Structures and algorithms right?\n\n\nThose are used in every single programming language, the only difference you may be hearing about is that some languages differences and not actually related to anything about data structures or algorithms... No shade meant by this, but that is something I think someone with an AI/ML background would be familiar with so I am going to assume it's not necessarily an AI background in the sense that you an ML engineer, and possibly what you mean is more that you use AI. I only say that to preface that I'll try and explain what I mean about languages, not to cast aspersions.\n\nAnyway, what you may be hearing i suspect, especially because of the recommended languages you've received, is more related to low and high level programming languages. You know all code eventually becomes machine language, ones and zeros is the name of the game, but we dont type out ones and zeros, we use words that them selves get converted to something, then something else, then something else, then eventually something a machine can understand. In coding terms these are layers of abstractions, something \"represents\" something else, and the magic is often that you can hide complexity by having thing X not only translated to thing Y, but also do Z as well to make the statement more concise. \n\nLow level languages (like C++) are ones that you work closer to the hardware, meaning there are fewer abstractions away from giving a computer 1s and 0s. This can be a very good thing, abstractions require effort, and that means you can write code that uses less effort on the machines end and make things go fast and use less memory. However, abstractions are done for a reason, and the flip side of a low level language is that you will write a lot more code to do the same thing that another language may be able to do in a fraction of the amount of lines of code, a big pain point being you end up handling memory yourself at this level. \n\nHigh level languages on the other hand are abstracted a more layers up and hide the scary bits like memory management from the developer by handling it themselves, and tend to be much closer to readable human language as a result. Python and Java are both high level languages, but keep in mind that doesnt make them better or worse, just different. \n\nSo why isnt everything done with a high level language if they can take away all the annoying things that exist in programming? With abstractions come trade offs, the more that your code does \"for you\" the less control you have. You dont have to do annoying memory management and consider a lot of stuff when programming in a language like Python like when its OK for your app to \"forget\" something to free up memory. In languages at this level a feature that is built in handles it for you by occasionally checking the app, and deleting unused memory and freeing it up for later, its called a garbage collector, and this does not exist at the low level, and not having it can be a pain in the ass. But what happens if garbage day is on Monday, and you forget to bring out your trash and today is Tuesday...? You are stuck with the garbage until the garbage man comes around next week, in high level languages this happens to because its not a constant process and works kind of in cycles. Low Level languages can create memory, use it, and the second its no longer needed free it up for something else to use that memory. This allows more efficiency in your code, but requires more dev work, and opens up Pandora box and can lead to an exponentially amount of new bugs or issues. \n\n\nIf I wrote 2 programs in Python and C++ tonight, I could do it. But I promise you that my Python will without question be faster than my C++ code. Is Python \"faster\" than C++? Nope, I just am a novice at C++, I know enough to be dangerous, but beyond that 9 times out of 10 my Python is faster due to my own lack of experience with it. And if you told me to create an app in 10 hours or I will die, Ill choose Python every time because the high level abstractions lead to increased developer speed. NOT better app, NOT faster code, less of my time as a developer being used (which in theory could be used to make more code for some other project or learn something new)\n\n\nAs far as data structures and algorithms are concerned, they are not language specific, it makes no sense to frame it that way imo. Data structures are ways to organize data. Algorithms are sequences to process data. The programming languages are like syntax in verbal languages, DSA is kinda like forming complex sentences. So there's no correct answer to your question, because it doesnt really make sense.\n\n I suppose if you goal is to learn data structures and algorithms at a granular level and really understand how the computer really handles them, a low level language will force you to really get down to that level and put the work in to learn that stuff. If your goal is to apply data structures and algorithms more than learn the granular details, a high level language is the choice. Honestly even that dichotomy isn't a super great way to put it, its just the closest way I could think to answer your question in a way that gives you something to consider. \n\n\nAnother way to put that is that learning DSA concepts in a lower level language will expose you more closely to how a computer really uses data structures and algorithms, giving you a better baseline. However, a high level language will allow you to learn these concepts faster and more efficiently. There's no avoiding learning them, and neither path is correct. That being said... if you truly \"know\" python... to be honest you should already be familiar with a lot of data structures and algorithms, so my recommendation would be to stick with Python and fill up those holes in your skill set without having to learn these concepts and a whole new language at the same time slowing the process. Just my opinion.",

Specifically the Exception handling and the huge risk of null-pointer exceptions everywhere.\n\nAnd it doesn't get any better that Java was never truly intended to run interactive text-terminal applications, but for some crazy reason almost every school thinks that their students should be forced to struggle with System.out, System.in, Exceptions and the Scanner - which is intended for \"scanning\" through text-files (hence the name) and not for receiving badly formatted input from the user ... \n\nSo, sorry if I didn't answer your question fully, but every single thing that you mention are weird quirks of the Java language, and the way it is being taught, and I still cannot fathom why it is still chosen as a beginner language, especially when we've had Python for exactly as long, and that also runs on every single platform out there!",

Learning how it all even makes sense is computer science or computer architecture.\n\nLearning this field is building a bridge by spanning from both sides. Well, EVERY side... Then all the sides eventually meet in the middle, and it all starts making sense. It's not a sudden ah-ha moment, but a gradual understanding unless you think about it.\n\nLearning any programming language - there is a barrier to separate the language and it's products from the system. You do this, you get a program. You send text to `System.out`, and it shows up in a little window. We can talk about the `java.lang` package, the `System` class within it, the `out` static field within that, how it implements an instance of `PrintStream`, you can look up the documentation for the interface, or on that specific instance, but it is \"implementation defined\" what happens, that under the hood, a system call is made, and the data - your text, crosses a barrier from your program to the operating system that controls the terminal window and the transfer of data between it and your program.\n\nIf you want to learn about operating systems, read a book or take a class. That's going beyond Java, and your Java class has to stop somewhere, or else the conversation is going get down to electron volts and semiconductors, PN junctions, quantum tunneling...\n\nWhere's it end, Sharon? Where's it end?\n\nA top-down approach isn't helpful, because look where you are; What the hell is `System.out`? Why do I have to do it? You've seen the top, now you have to work your way down, but you're so damn distracted by the question I don't think you can see the forest for the trees.\n\nWe teach programming from the bottom up the same way Euclid taught geometry. First the axioms, then building blocks, because everything new is going to be a consequence of everything prior. You crawl before you walk, and your legs can take you to the fence. Beyond is another class, another subject, and yes, it's a topic worth learning at some point.\n\nBut you know what? You can do a lot with Java now, without having to personally survey the whole kingdom first.\n\n> Printing text, which for some reason requires me to add \"System.out.\" beforehand [...] Creating a Scanner object to read user text input, which for some reason requires me to specify \"(System.in)\"\n\nNo one is going to explain everything to you. Look it up. There's documentation. Both `System.in` and `System.out` are stream objects, and they wrap some system specific implementation details that allow data to be passed into and out of your running process. That's the fence - go take an OS class or read a book about kernel architecture, because they way this works on Windows is different than how it works on Linux, is different from how it works on NanoVM for AVR...\n\nYou don't NEED a `Scanner` to get input, the input stream has a `read` method to get you bytes, the `Scanner` is just convenient for converting bytes into different types.\n\nThere are more streams than `System.[in|out|err]`, you can make your own, so passing `System.in` to a `Scanner` tells it WHICH input stream to scan.\n\n> Catching all errors, which for some reason requires me to specify \"(Exception e)\"\n\nBoth these things tell me you haven't gotten to or don't understand inheritance. So much for the top-down approach... Did you dirty again.\n\n> Fixing a Scanner after inputting a number so it correctly takes text input, which for some reason is as simple as executing the command \".nextLine()\"\n\nThis is not a concern of teaching you Java, but of USING Java - of software engineering, architecture, and design.\n\nPresume you told the scanner you want an integer, but the data in the stream contains text, not digits. What now? You get an error - your specification cannot be satisfied.\n\nBut you didn't \"fix the problem\", you just SKIPPED over the data in the stream, looking for something you CAN parse out.",

It is also syntax sugar for passing structs to functions as paramaters.  eg: if myObject is an instance of a class called MyClass, then myObject.foo(1) is syntax sugar for MyClass_foo(myObject, 1)\n\nedit: The project is somewhat irrelevant, as any project can be done in an OO way, or a procedural way, or a functional way, etc.  It is more about how you organize the relationships between data (variables) and behavior (code).

The rest of your code need only have a valid instance of PhotoStore to function.\n\nI've just described a couple useful scenarios for OOP.  Basic code organizing and perhaps security.  And, more common, writing to an interface.  However, if you don't need either of those things, or anything else OOP buys you, then it won't really make sense.  Look at things you've already written and try to find where OOP might improve it.",

This has been very suitable for the C# .NET Entity Framework applications Ive maintained so far, however your experience may vary.  \nIf you like reading, I would highly suggest familiarizing yourself with Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design first before delving into derivatives like Microservices, Vertical Slices or even Moduliths. There is good material on it by Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler and Eric Evans.\n\nIf not, set your own standards for how you want to name classes for specific patterns (i.e.: Builders, Repositories, Controller, Services, etc.) and then decide a folder structure (like most layered: Application, Domain and infrastructure) and rules for which classes may be defined in which folder structure.\n\nYour goal should be to make your code more resilient to the \"big ball of mud\", essentially trying to keep it \"easy to change\". Ive seen a lot of architecture for the sake of architecture, which is besides the point.",

Its how you organize your written code and decide on common styles so to compromise on writing \"same\" code across time as well as people. This is incredibly valuable, since you will recognize old or foreign code much easier, saving time on debugging, additions, modifications, etc. If Coding Guidelines define how you write code within a method, then Architecture is everything beyond that: Methods, Classes, Dependencies of Classes, Modules and Projects. However, its distinct from System Architecture, because it really doesnt \"care\" how which system or component is talking or integrating with another outside of code.\n\nFrom what I understand, project codebase organization is less a \"how do you code\" but more of a \"where are the files\". Software Architecture doesnt care if you use Github or TortoiseSVN nor does it care which IDE you use (on a high level, this actually isnt quite true).\n\nMVC is Microsofts take on a 3 Layered architecture (Model View Controller), MVT presumably is djangos version of the same thing, then there is the Onion/Clean Architecture that separate layers into Domain, Application and Infrastructure, sometimes even adding Contract and Presentation...\n\nThe goal with all these is the same thing. Each layer is given an access hierarchy as well as a specific type of issue to address. This is an overhead and sometimes cumbersome but it ensures that you deal with specific problems in appropriate places and dont risk needing to rewrite your whole application just because your database got an update.\n\nMVC's approach decided to disregard making your application incredibly dependent on the used technologies, meanwhile Clean Architecture is the very opposite of that. Its why their structures are different. Some other Architectures like Moduliths or Microservices try to accommodate scalability in their approach, allowing your code to be designed to be spread across multiple servers from the ground up. Monolithic Architectures meanwhile do not.",

You want to erase type information, you want to hide complexity, in order to simplify how one interacts with it and to protect its internals and invariants from the client.\n\nA handle, the only thing you can do with it is hold onto it and pass it. The actual value is meaningless to you. There is no printing it, there is no modifying it, no adding or subtracting it... It is given to you from some interface that is the barrier between you and the resource, and you hand it back through the interface so when you `foo` the resource, you're `foo`-ing THIS specific resource.",

My first few years covered computer architecture, databases, python and Java, data structures, and object oriented design (and design patterns in general)\n\nI started learning web dev with the basics, Javascript/css/html.  After a couple months, I started learning frontend frameworks starting with Vue (easy-ish to pickup imo) and eventually moving to React because it is more widely adopted in the industry.\n\nThen I went deeper into backend and ops.  Setting up auth, logging, APIs, and deploying the application.  This part was absolutely the most difficult for me and I had a written step by step guide walking me through the process of setting up VMs on Digital Ocean and AWS where I'd have to ssh in and setup hosting and start the application.  This process would have to be repeated (condensed a bit) whenever the backend application was updated.  Nowadays, it is much easier to host fullstack applications but this is still good to know as a professional.\n\nAnyway, all of that was another 2yrs of grinding and I did a webdev bootcamp around the end 2020.  I got my first job in 2021 (July/August).  So 5yrs doing this basically full time lol \n\nBut even then, programming is an ocean and I've spent nearly every day as a full time dev learning new things and improving the way I build applications.  You might be able to build your Spotify clone after a year or two, but I promise that another year will pass and you will look back on it as complete garbage.  And that's fine, that is the process of growth.  Just be prepared for a very long journey, this is not something that you will master in even a couple years.  It will take a lot of time, patience, and perseverance to reach your goals.",

That's not what I mean at all. Writing a full course on OpenGL would certainly be useful *for you*, as a way to practice your writing skills and deepen your understanding. (It would also be a lot of work!) But what I mean is that if there's nothing significant to set your work apart, then it probably won't attract very much attention. So just prepare yourself for that possibility.\n\nRather than writing up your own complete explanation of OpenGL, it might be more productive to talk about your specific project. Like, here's how you *apply* the basic OpenGL concepts when building a universe simulator, and here are the interesting details and gotchas that a general overview wouldn't cover.\n\n> Once again, sorry if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to.\n\nThis subreddit has a pretty broad scope, so I don't think there's anything *wrong* with posting here, as long as you're not aggressively or deceptively self-promoting.

In the end, it will ultimately be a series going over most basic concepts and advanced concepts. However, I wanted to make it so that even if you didn't want to program yourself, you can learn and internalize the interesting concepts that underpin graphics programming. I really appreciate the feedback and will definitely reconsider how I may approach this differently to stand out against the already existing content. I will also ask other groups aswell to seek their opinions. Thank you.",

Just capture it.\n\nThen look up the \"Hedgehog Concept\". It's three overlapping circles: what you're passionate about, what you can be good at, and what's actually useful. Revisit your idea list with that framework and see what lands in the middle.\n\nHere's the key part: pick ONE and commit to finishing it. Even if it's a dumb one. Even if it's small. \"Too hard\" or \"too easy\" doesn't matter - either way you're learning something. If it fails, you learn why and carry that into the next thing.\n\nWhat you're waiting for - that spark of excitement - usually comes AFTER you start, not before.

Just knowing React isn’t enough to land a first job. AI, like the World Wide Web 20 years ago, is making the low hanging fruit/foot in the door jobs harder to land",

I mean if I were you I'd evaluate how competitive you can be in this space and also what college you're going to and decide whether cs is the right choice. If it is then, start with courses like cs50 to get the fundamentals down.

It's very possible you are a logical thinker, but are overwhelmed by all the choices available to you. What's more, it can be a challenge to just dream up a project out of thin air.\n\nAdd to that, it's difficult when you're too young to know what your personal strengths are. That often takes time to develop. All you can do is experiment and explore until you discover the things that you find interesting and exciting. For me it was solving technical problems. It was like solving a puzzle for me, and I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment once I found the solution. It wasn't always easy, but it was rewarding.\n\nI'd recommend picking a language and focusing on it. Find tutorials and sample code. Study them and try to understand how they work. Then take the next step and create a project of your own. It doesn't have to be complicated or flashy. It might just be a simple console application that performs some utility function like a calculator.",

For the exceptions (I'm not sure if you can generalize the exceptions) create a class for each set of exceptions or worse case a custom class for each noun that just doesn't follow all of the rules of the other nouns.  All these classes would either implement your noun interface or extend your abstract noun base class.\n\nYou could also have your custom noun classes extend the\"common noun class but only override the necessary conversions, like if a word mostly follows the common noun rules except in a few cases.\n\nThen I would probably create a NounFactory or something that would construct the correct noun class based on the noun provided.  Or maybe a static function on some class, it really depends on how much logic you need to choose the correct noun class.\n\nIf you have things like exception 1 and exception 2, and IF a noun needs exception 2 and it ALWAYS needs exception 1, you can start building a hierarchy of classes to handle these exceptions. So exception 1 would extend the base noun class, exception 2 would extend exception 1.  This of course breaks down if exception 2 can happen without exception 1. So this approach while keeping all the exceptions nice and reusable would not work.\n\nHopefully that makes sense....",

Or do you anticipate doing something like:\n\n    rose = Noun.builder(\"rosa\", FIRST_DECLENSION)\n\n    new_form = rose.decline(ACCUSATIVE, PLURAL)\n\nPerhaps you might also have an \"exception\" method for those pesky irregular nouns:\n\n    virus.exception(DATIVE, SINGLUAR, \"viro\") // or whatever it is. I don't remember\n\nThe declension will proceed completely normally, unless there is an exception for the particular case.\n\nPerhaps thinking in terms of inputs and outputs will help (as I said, sometimes the best solution is a massive text file with all the forms of your noun).",

        "body": "Ooh, linguistics + CS double major, and honestly, digging the idea. That said, you may run into some hiccups if you're not too familiar with Latin\n\n>Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.\n\nThis is arguably not all that interesting on its own; well over 50% of the languages on earth have inflection on nouns. That said, that's a minor gripe. Another minor gripe:\n\n>And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.\n\nCase, Class, Gender, and Plurality are all involved in declension. Declension is the act of changing the inflection (grammatical affixes) of a noun. In talking about the different suffixes nouns have based on case, we are inherently talking about declension - not putting it aside.\n\n> I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.\n\nDon't know how effective that'll be for learning the language, but as a programming project, it's neat!\n\n>In the nominative case, its just \"Servus\", while the genitive case has \"servi\", the dative has \"servo\" and the accusative case has \"servum\" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations). But then there are also the plural forms, which are \"Servi\", \"servorum\",\"servis\" and \"servos\" respectively.\n\nIf you intended to store things as stems, you might run into issues as there are 5 basic noun classes in Latin ignoring irregulars. \"Servus\" may be class II, but \"Puella\" is class I, and thus declines differently. In order to determine which class a word uses, you need both the nominative, and the genitive forms of the word - you can't always derive all forms from the one stem alone.\n\nAs for how you could handle this, there's a few options.\n\nLeast structurally intensive is just feeding the noun constructor an enum of the noun class, followed by the stem, and just switch-casing how the noun declines the stem based on that. Alternatively, make an abstract noun class, and create subclasses of it that each handle a different type of noun.\n\nThe problem with the above is that it couples your conjugations to the noun classes/subclasses, which isn't very SOLID - bad practice. Preferred option would be to ditch the enums, and create a number of Declension Strategies (See: [The Strategy Design Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)) you can feed the constructor. This has the benefit of decoupling your declensions from the nouns themselves.\n\nRegardless of which of the above do the job, if you want to restrict which nouns get which declension without putting that logic in the noun class itself (again, best practice), you could also implement a Noun Factory or Builder (See: [The Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) or [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)) which can take in the nominative / genitive forms of a noun, determine its class, and create a noun object with the appropriate strategy for you.\n\nBut that's a whole lot of over engineering, so take it all with a grain of salt. All I recommend is that you read more about Latin morphology before embarking on this, as it'll help you understand what actually has to happen when declining the nouns.",

Earning as much as possible in the shortest period of time without taking any large risks (FAANG) is probably the best strategy. You could also build deep domain expertise in a target industry, and then get hired to work at these companies anyway, and this will probably yield a better result because you won't just be doing micro optimizations for them if you go this route. You can still do this in your spare time, but I would strongly suggest you prioritize your economic welfare first rather than primarily chasing a technical ideal. You have to find a balance, it's okay to experiment and learn niche things in depth, but you want there to be an eventual payoff if possible. For example, learning Rust or Elixir is a good investment of your time, and you'll naturally develop a network to draw from if you want to start a company or join one, but something like Common Lisp has a low probability of a payoff even if it's more fun (yes, I'm bitter). I followed my interest and got a very good career out of it, but I've also seen what happens when people optimize purely for skill. As a developer in any mid to large sized company you'll basically never be given the discretion needed to fully utilize tools designed around peak individual productivity, but the money will dull the pain somewhat.\n\nYou have to develop a certain pragmatism about how you do things.

You can think of programming as artistic expression. I want beauty and elegance. I want to make the best software that I can.\n\nAlong with that comes learning. Along with that comes a job, because the pursuit of my craft overlaps with people's need for software.\n\nThe job is not the craft. Jobs don't pay you for beautiful, elegant solutions, they pay you for results. You have to figure out how to be a craftsman within the context of THEIR time and THEIR money to make what THEY want. You do get some push-back, though; if they hire you, they can tell you WHAT, but they are deferring to you for HOW. No one gets to tell me how to do my job, or they can do it themselves. As a junior, you get told HOW a lot, because there's still a lot of learning at the beginning of your career, but then you start developing an opinion, and eventually, it starts holding it's own. That's how you know you're ready to be a senior developer.\n\n> If you're only in this for money then you may struggle to find the motivation to continue progressing with your learning as jobs are not easy to get in this field.\n\nWho are you speaking for? Because I would say the majority of the industry would probably disagree with you. I have found very few craftsmen in my 30 years of pursuing software development. Most I've met have never given a damn, most I met literally say \"just get it done\", they say - and I've been told by them that they \"code for today\", as they see that as virtuous; that sounds to me like the goal is doing the least amount of work possible without getting fired, the least amount of work to gain status and pay, until they peak at diminishing returns. To them, their craft is corporate politics, and BOY HOWDY have I seen them master THAT.\n\nJobs are surprisingly easy to get in this field. You don't even need a formal education. Jobs are hard to get TODAY because the Trump administration is terrible for business and has ruined this economy. You won't see good job production until some time - probably ~2 years into the next non-Republican administration at the earliest.\n\n> Trying to speed run the learning process will also lead to burn out, there's no point in trying to learn everything that takes years into a month.\n\nYou can temper this with a sufficiently large ego.",

For me, I have to understand the why in order to remember it. I was never good at reading a book and memorizing the material. I had to put my hands on it, break it, and fix it before I could commit it to memory. The benefit for me was once I understood it, I would never forget it, but it took longer for me to go through the cycle. \n\nI think it's always best to have a problem to solve. It doesn't have to be a difficult problem, but simply something that software can help with. Often times a tutorial will provide you with a basic framework that you can leverage to build on. \n\nMy programming journey started with simple projects in electronics, like solving resistor networks that required a target impedance and range of voltage offsets. I often implemented an iterative solver that started with a guesstimate and automatically adjusted itself until the solution was found. I learned a lot about iterative problem solving as well as learning the language.  Those programs became utilities that I would use from time to time.\n\nAnother project of mine was a Monte Carlo simulator to test various strategies for maintenance contracts. I learned a lot about Monte Carlo simulations, event queues, and the distribution of non-normal data. This was a much more ambitious project and never reached a production ready state, but still it was a useful means of analyzing my problem and learning to leverage features of the language I was working using (C++).\n\nWhatever you decide to do, you need to write code. Just stepping through a tutorial is unlikely to provide long-lasting knowledge (if you're like me). However, tutorials, videos, and course-work may be a great springboard inspiring you to solve other problems. Maybe you learn how to build a simple web application that uses a database and you decide to build your own budgeting application. Be curious and be inspired.\n\nKeep a directory of all your artifacts so you can use them as reference material - a grep utility is good way to find them for future reference.",

Look at some of your old projects, try and add a new feature. It's easier to add something on to a working product, than it is to create a new product.\n\n  \nThen, try start from the bottom. Make a simple project on your own, like a to-do list. Break the problem into smaller pieces, and then if you can't figure out those smaller pieces, Google it. As you keep working on the project you'll gain more understanding of what to use and when to use it, and you'll rely less on Google for the simpler stuff. It's important you don't try to Google the solution to your larger problem, but instead a smaller chunk of it. Splitting work down to the smallest piece possible is the best way I found to learn.\n\n  \nIf you get your to-do list done, keep adding to it. Sure, it starts simple, but you can expand it to do way more than it did before. Try and find a project to create that you're passionate about, that passion will translate to motivation to learn and create. Keep working on it, don't go too hard on yourself, and try to avoid videos that tell you exactly how to do a project if you feel you're ready to move on yourself.\n\n  \nGoogle is a great resource for asking questions, becoming a confident developer is mostly about learning how to ask questions, and how to word the problem you are facing. Once you've done that, you can create anything really.",

At least for me it helps me to understand better.\n\nLike if you’re just starting to learn JavaScript, start with a bare naked project and get the script to say something. A simple hello world. Then build it up to be a simple, SIMPLE calculator. All just in the terminal, no ui. Then when you’re comfortable with JavaScript itself and getting things to pop up on the terminal, then you’re ready to start learning how to build a project from scratch.\n\nTake your script you made, and try and slap a React ui on top of it, moving your logic to the backend to get practice with full-stack development (if that’s a goal of yours). This is the important stepping away from the tutorial part. This is where you make a decision to NOT follow a tutorial and instead look at documentation and examples to understand what is going on in these, in this instance, React applications. Every engineer uses references. It’s okay to not know things. But the goal is to understand the process, not copying and pasting to create a finished product as fast as you can to feel impressive. I struggled with that part of the mental frame when I first started. \n\nOverall, just pick an IDE (vscode or IntelliJ community edition, whatever floats your boat), create a file, and start practicing. Don’t overthink the process. There is no fast path to learning, it’s at your own pace. Place the emphasis on understanding what you want to do and how to do it using best practices.",

If I get stuck, I google the specific part and keep going.\n\nAs a “real programmer” (i.e. someone pays me to write code professionally), this is pretty regularly how I do my job - the biggest difference is that I (probably) get stuck less easily than you do because I’ve built a lot of things.\n\nI wonder what your friend thinks about open source software. Sure, OSS is great because it contributes to free software everyone gets to use, but the real value is that there are code bases that “real programmers” can use as a base to build upon or learn from the example of others.\n\n> A friend told me this is a “bad habit,” because a “real programmer” should build things from scratch without checking someone else’s code first. And that even if I manage to finish, it doesn’t count because I saw an example.\n\nThere’s a world of difference between looking at someone else’s code and just re-typing it in your editor vs looking at an example then trying to rebuild it yourself.\n\nCopying someone else’s code verbatim or just typing in what a tutorial tells you to type *is* useless to your learning. It’s equivalent to writing down the text from your favorite book and calling yourself an author. \n\nOn the other hand, looking at an example of what you want to build, studying their approach, then attempting to recreate it on your own is a valuable learning exercise. Artists do something similar, called a [study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_(art)), as a way to better understand the challenges and techniques involved in creating different types of art. \n\nI’d go even further to say that it’s a bad habit *not* to study other people’s code. Building everything yourself in a silo is a really great way to form bad practices and deprive yourself the opportunity to learn different ways to approach a problem.",

If you're still building UIs that look like MS-DOS and the Commodore 64, you're not really allowed an opinion on UI development.\n\nIn principle though, the recent trend has been for libraries to provide the functionality of common UI elements, and for developers to add the minor visual fashion changes. ShadCN, Radix, DaisyUI and HeadlessUI seem to be the most popular ones in my React bubble. This is a big change from even 5 years ago where if you wanted to build a dropdown select with styled options, you'd first spend a day building it yourself in styled-components or CSS modules before giving up, Googling a pre-built one, eventually doing `npm install bumfuck-dropdown-react` and praying that their styling API doesn't suck. Now you just pull it in from a library you're already using somewhere else, and add your own CSS. \n\nThis also works well with AI. LLMs know how a dropdown select should work, but they can't see it, and even if they could they don't know what looks good.",

Which means every framework must implement them from scratch. To do that in accessible manner, they have to use aria semantics and behavior that are limited to those 40+ year old ui component concepts. For example, when you make a dialog, it must have dialog semantics and behavior, and it's going to look recognizably like a dialog in GEOS. \n\nNow what the hell is the point of that. If frontend was a sane world, html would have native dialogs with all that required behavior hardcoded and plenty of look customization to theme them any way you like.",

It depends on what kind of \"system\" programming you are doing.\n\nFor investigating how a real system behaves, the best option would be a \"metal\" installation of Linux on the hardware, the second best option (in my opinion) would be something like VMware Player or Oracle Virtualbox with a \"soft\" installation of Linux as a guest system onto that (supplemented with the \"additions\" option to make things like video output and mouse/keyboard integration work less painfully), and the third best option would be WSL2 (which has a real Linux kernel, and AFAIK already handles integration fairly well -- though for some things, I/O performance on WSL2 is said to be worse than the VM alternatives).\n\nOn the other hand, if you are just doing \"normal\" C/C++ programming as we often do in introductory courses, like calling stuff from the standard library, and possibly implementing your own data structures and your own version of such functions (e.g. implement your own malloc() or something), which don't directly touch hardware, and if you aren't using OS-specific features like memory mapping files to memory, etc. then the WSL2 requirement is too much; you won't even need that.",

        "body": "> Is Windows enough for my usecase?\n\nNative Windows is perfectly fine.\n\nMicrosoft Windows Server edition is an industrial standard used across the ecosystem. I see a shitload of it in trading systems. Operating systems are collections of utilities for YOU, the software engineer to use. The OS can \"get out of the way\" of software as much as you want it to. Windows or Linux, you can get right down to the hardware if you have to/want to.\n\nMicrosoft also has an industry leading C++ compiler.\n\nUnderstand that C and C++ are completely different languages that diverged in 1979, before EITHER language was standardized, and their \"compatibility\" is an intentional layer built into the C++ standard. It's not \"backward\" compatible, it's more \"cross\" compatible, and it's contrived. C/C++/COBOL/Fortran/Ada/Objective-C/Forth/D/Assembly, and many other compiled languages are very compatible - the linker is a separate step in all of these languages which allow their intermediate object libraries to be combined into a single cohesive artifact. Mostly C++ shares common syntax with C, but so does Java, C#, Golang, PHP, Lua, Pearl...\n\nWith that in mind, most C++ compilers are built on C compilers. Microsoft has barely ever written their own software. Mostly they acquired software, rebranded it, and extended it. They didn't even write their own first OS - MS DOS, they bought and rebranded PC/M.\n\nSo then we get to Microsoft's own C compiler, with C++ extensions in the 90s. They did indeed write it themselves, which is amazing, in 1985. One of the things about C and C++, that cannot be matched in C# and other modern programming languages, is that they can be compiled as a token stream. You just start reading your source file, chunking character sequences into tokens, and then building your parse tree from that as you go. The moment you get the smallest compile-able unit, like a statement, you can generate object code and flush that to disk. This was necessary when C was first written for the PDP-6 in 1972, and necessary in 1985 when the IBM PC typically had only 64 KiB of memory, and more than half that was used by the OS and compiler.\n\nThis same stream processing core from 1985 was used up until ~2019. They got the rewrite done around then, that now takes advantage of modern multi-core processors and big memory, and they've been competitive against GCC and Clang ever since.\n\nOn top of that, Visual Studio (NOT Visual Studio: Code) is as turn-key as a C++ dev environment gets. All the tools you need are already bundled and work cohesively. Project configuration and file management is built in. They even support Git source control - which is a whole separate technology you're going to have to learn, and early. C++ hails from an era where each part of the whole was a separate product that the system admin had to piece together, and most of the ecosystem is still like that.\n\nI will caution you, though - CULTURALLY, the Microsoft system is in isolation. If you write POSIX code, it works everywhere, because it's the most copied OS standard there is. The various Unix vendors saw cross compatibility as a boon because it meant you could migrate to THEM, and they would attract you with features and services. Microsoft did everything their own way for vendor lock-in. This means everything the rest of the world has always had, the Microsoft ecosystem has to do it themselves on their own. Incredi-Build is a fancy thing people talk about like it's revolutionary - everything it does, I've been doing since the 90s on Unix. But ask a Microsoft developer, and they'll tell you there's nothing else like it...\n\nAnd then WSL is great and all, but Microsoft still HATES Linux and FOSS. This compatibility layer is a part of their new and openly published strategy - \"Embrace, Extend, Extinguish\". They want to foster adoption of their platform by offering compatibility, then they'll extend that compatibility platform with unique Microsoft products - again with the vendor lock-in, and with that dependency, they will dominate the FOSS market and extinguish the competition. In theory, at least.\n\nNone of the politics matter to you, you're just learning the C++ grammar and syntax. I'm just providing some color of what's been going on. While Microsoft has a leading C++ compiler, they are also actively sabotaging the C++ standard itself, trying to foster more C# adoption. C# .NET Framework is their new cross-platform C# initiative, which is also EEE - get Microsoft products on Linux and get people hooked on it.\n\nContinued...",

Pick one, get good, learn the other later, they're similar! Don't avoid frontend because it's \"saturated.\" Your design background makes you uniquely qualified for design + code roles (design systems, UI engineering). Most frontend devs can't design. Most designers can't code. You can do both. One skill worth adding here is accessibility. Relevant to C#, Java, and frontend. Companies care (legal, UX, SEO). I know AudioEye has free courses that are practical and sets you apart  [https://www.audioeye.com/courses/](https://www.audioeye.com/courses/)  \n  \nLearn frontend (HTML/CSS/JS/React) as it's the fastest to paid work and leverages your design.

        "body": "With composition the idea is not that it's easier to *write* — it's sometimes a bit more boilerplate in 1-2 places. But it *is* easier to read, and to refactor without accidentally breaking things.\n\nHaving said that in your example, whether the implementation of the behavior is the same or not, composition will look similar: it will make heavy use of *interfaces*. Using Go as an example (a language that only has composition, not inheritance):\n\n```go\ntype Collideable interface {\n    Collide()\n}\n\ntype Renderable interface {\n    Render()\n}\n\ntype Entity interface {\n    Collideable\n    Renderable\n}\n\ntype Octopus struct {...}\nfunc (self *Octopus) Collide() {...}\nfunc (self *Octopus) Render() {...}\n\ntype Spaceship struct {...}\nfunc (self *Spaceship) Collide() {...}\nfunc (self *Spaceship) Render() {...}\n```\n\nIn the example above, Collideable is an interface that describes \"anything that collides\". Interfaces are commonly described as contracts; they do not contain any implementation, but they describe that such-and-such object will have such-and-such methods.\n\nthe \"Entity\" interface is defined as \"anything which both collides and renders\". In order to be considered an \"Entity\", a type would have to be both Collideable and Renderable.\n\nA type satisfies an interface by implementing all of its mandatory methods. In order to be Collideable, a type needs a method called Collide, that has the same arguments / return type as in the interface. If it does, we say the type *implements* the interface.\n\nIn Go, once a type implements the necessary methods, it will automatically be recognized as implementing the matching interface(s). In the example code above, both Octopus and Spaceship implement all 3 interfaces. (In some other languages you need to do something like `class Foo implements Bar` to make the interface relation explicit).\n\nNow on to your question. Focusing on just the Collideable interface, there are 2 scenarios: Either we have a common implementation, or we don't. If we don't, then the `func ... Collide() {...}` blocks above will contain different code. If there *is* a common implementation, you can e.g. pull it out into an external function:\n\n```go\nfunc Collision() {...}\n\nfunc (self *Octopus) Collide() {\n    Collision()\n}\n\nfunc (self *Spaceship) Collide() {\n    Collision()\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use composition to create another Collideable object, and reuse it for the Octopus and Spaceship:\n\n```go\ntype Collider struct {...}\n\nfunc (self *Collider) Collide() {...}\n\ntype Spaceship struct {\n    collider Collider\n    ...\n}\n\nfunc (self *Spaceship) Collide() {\n    self.collider.Collide()\n}\n\ntype Octopus struct {\n    collider Collider\n    ...\n}\n\nfunc (self *Octopus) Collide() {\n    self.collider.Collide()\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the above example has a bit more boilerplate, but we have successfully combined composition and interfaces to give both Octpus and Spaceship the same implementation of the Collide() method, by giving them both the same \"collider\" property internally. Both Spaceship and Octopus implement Collideable, and they do it using the same implenentation (from \"Collider\").\n\n(Note: In Go, interfaces cannot contain implementation, only a list of methods (and their type signatures). In some other languages, interfaces are also (optionally) allowed to contain default implementations of their methods. That would allow us to skip the whole \"Collider\" thing and just write the default implementation for Collide() on the interface directly. Having said that, this can be a bad idea.)",

But I think it's wrong to dogmatically apply it (or most best practices) in a universal fashion.\n\nIf I wind up with several classes that all inherit from the top of the hierarchy in a default fashion and have almost all of the same methods just delegating to some member/field/property/attribute, and in particular if I'm conceptually referring to that class as a form of that delegated object class, it's a sign that I would probably better benefit from refactoring it to inheritance.\n\nSo do Octopus and Spaceship have no explicit super class? Do you think their instances ARE entities? Do they delegate heavily to a private entity instance? You'll probably have an easier time if you model it using inheritance. That's the way I think about it. I also don't mind getting it wrong and refactoring later, assuming I don't make a total mess of the system and I don't have a bunch of external systems that are going to be coupled to this particular design decision.",

There are projects all around you. You don't have to come up with a project. Just pick something you use and try to build one small part of it that interests you. If you want to keep going add to that.\n\nStart small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. If you can't come up with a project, I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.\n\nThe rest of this is mostly cut and paste from my other comments as the questions you ask are quite common.\n\nStart small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.\n\nMake TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.\n\nNow for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.\n\nDo this with every small project you work on. A calculator, an address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.",

It’s really hard to stay motivated when your environment feels “dead” and everything around you is just degree-chasing and easy homework.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I’d probably stop worrying about LeetCode for a while and stop trying to find “the perfect complex project”. I’d try to build one small but real thing that I would actually use myself.\n\nSomething like: pick one annoyance in your life (school, schedules, games, Discord, whatever) and say “I’m going to spend 2–4 weeks building the smallest possible tool that makes this less annoying”. It doesn’t have to be original or impressive, it just has to be real enough that you care whether it works.\n\nAlso, I wouldn’t rely on classmates for inspiration. If the local environment is dead, you can treat the internet as your “real” environment. Hang around subs like this one, dev discords, open source repos, etc. It’s much easier to stay motivated when you see other people building things in public, even if they’re strangers.\n\nYou already did more than many people by trying projects and solving problems on your own. It doesn’t feel like it now, but that “I want to build stuff but I don’t know what” feeling is a pretty normal phase.\n\nIf I were you, I’d pick one small problem, commit to shipping something imperfect that solves it a bit, and use that as my anchor. After that, do it again with something slightly bigger. Over time that builds way more confidence than another pile of LeetCode easies.",

Contact companies that are more likely to take interns and ask what are their requirements. Go over job offers and see which technologies and tools are listed. And then learn these technologies and tools if your current university is of no use.\n\nAs you mentioned OSRS then go over all these plugins that exist in Runelite and in its plugin hub (accessible VIA the Runelite not via some scam website). Study these plugins. Usually in the plugin list there is a small ? mark on its description. Clicking on it will bring you to its plugin site in plugin hub. Then, look for \"Report an issue\" link top right. It will bring you to the Github repository of that plugin. Study these plugins. Work on open issues and submit high quality merge requests (covered with tests and such. Nobody likes a low-quality MR). That will improve your Java development skills.\n\nAnother thing you can do is making something for your own use. Something related to your interests and hobbies. Perhaps you can automate something. Perhaps you can make something easier, more accessible, faster, etc.\n\nIf you want to stick with Python and C then decide the field you want to work at (both have their own niches). And then just google \"Python uses\" or \"C uses\" . If \"C uses\" gives nothing meaningful then \"programming language C uses\" to get programming related findings.\n\nMy C is really bad (only touched it a bit during course where we did something with Arduino). But I can figure out it is a low level programming language. You can look into projects where you are developing firmware or programming devices. Python has all kinds of uses: web application development, data science, AI, cyber security, DevOps, etc. And then you can look up projects in these fields.\n\nIf it is any use then I can give you a project idea that WILL be way over your skill level. But then you at least have something to figure out. Your router (perhaps your old one, to not brick the current one). Install a custom firmware on it. You can also modify some open source firmwares like OpenWRT.",

There should be little to no \"business logic\" in this layer.\n\nThe one or more layers of \"composition\" methods, which bring the generic bits into more specific methods.

By far the biggest roadblock to their growth, according to them, is the small addressable market. Despite its huge population, India has a relatively small number of people with enough disposable income for startups to feed on. This means a startup has a limited domestic ramp up before they must try to find foreign markets.\n\nSecond, India doesn’t have the volume of original IP including, but not limited to, university research. You cannot exploit ideas you don’t have to become a tech giant.\n\nThird, the policy atmosphere and capital markets in India don’t really compare to the best countries. So, many companies move elsewhere once their requirements cannot be met in India. InMobi, one of the largest mobile ad serving companies in Asia ($1B), was started in India but moved HQ to Singapore.\n\nMany companies were sold off by founders as they no longer wished to continue. Walmart bought Flipkart, an Amazon competitor, for $16B from founders who wanted to exit.\n\nThere are several companies that started of great, became household names, but were then unable to keep their momentum. PayTM ($10B), at one time, was backed by SoftBank, Alibaba group and Berkshire Hathaway who all exited.\n\nFinally, while India produces a high volume of CS people, the quality is very uneven and many of the best choose to immigrate (to the US till recently but also elsewhere). This means the best Indian minds are not necessarily working in India.",

We work in service based industries for the most part where demand for labor ebbs and flows on an almost hourly basis.

This is simply not the same for majority of modern jobs. Demand is not static and neither is the workload. Sometime you have to update a button on an app and it takes you a hour and then there’s nothing else to do for the day. Other times that button takes you multiple days to figure out.

He expects my team to maintain his code - literally said, “I don’t want to maintain that.” He said it appears to work because his endpoints work (who cares about user interaction).

How do I express how ruinous this is as a business decision when both the CEO and CTO are on board?\n\nYes.  \nSooner or later; eventually that decision will be made for you. See above.  \nYou don't. Not your circus, not your monkeys. It is unlikely that anyone will want to listen to you, let alone heed your advise. you have far more to lose here than win.",

Good luck in your search!\n\nEDIT: I'll also add to start prepping for system design as soon as you can. Two of the four interview cycles I failed were because of my inexperience with system design interviews. The algorithms interviews I encountered weren't that bad except one of them from G (which probably sunk me) that requires tries and I never studied how to actually implement them. Most others as long as you know your basic patterns (two pointer, sliding window, etc.) as well as graphs and trees you should be just fine.",

So it’s both harder to land something and the pay isn’t what it used to be.\n\nExperience matters, but not always the way you’d expect. Lately a lot of companies avoid senior people because they don’t want to pay higher salaries, so candidates with 2–3 YOE sometimes get more callbacks than someone with 10+.\n\nThere was a dev (post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/)) with around your level of experience who couldn’t get a job for months. He pulled hundreds of companies from Google Maps, emailed his resume to all of them, and ended up getting a couple mid-size projects that way. If normal applications aren’t working, trying something unconventional like that actually helps.\n\nAlso make sure your resume is ATS-friendly and keyword-optimized. It really makes a difference. Someone recently shared an AI resume-tailor prompt here and using something like that boosts your visibility a lot in recruiter searches.",

Some recruiters in the past have said that premium members tend to be higher up in their search results.

When I have LinkedIn premium off, I don’t get any recruiter activity.

Most of the world is dependent on few major companies like Nvidia and Google etc.. to make the best AI models and the best infrastructure for AI. Most of the world is just using the tech rather than developing it. So it will be hard to get into design for low level or PCB ASIC or really deep into AI because so many people have masters and PhD in AI and looking to get into these few companies who are actually developing AI models because it needs heavy infrastructure that most companies can't afford.   \n  \nSoftware Engineering in general is going through a lot and what needed an entire team of Engineers and Juniors can now be established by a couple of caffeinated Senior Engineers with AI tools. There is barely any real use for Juniors unless paying them like crap and treating them like cheap labor. Covid also taught a lot of the world to be remote-first and this opened doors for companies to hire from India and Turkey and countries with cheap software developer labor which take like 500 bucks a month. So many companies don't bother hiring a Junior who is new and unexperienced and paying them 10 times the amount. (this goes for remote company settings).\n\nIt is a tough spot and honestly. I am in the same boat as you and some of my friends landed a good job with really good pay but all they do is manage legacy code that seniors don't want to deal with. 7 years ago having some leetcode skills and 1 e-commerce website in your resume could land juniors decent jobs. Today there is so much competition, the need is reduced and companies don't have a lot of money to work with. \n\nI am still looking for a job tbh so I can't be your guide to success. But personally I am just learning cloud devops and automation. It gives some weight on your resume than just \"I can code\". I am applying for jobs in Europe and hoping for the best. Being really good at coding is just not enough anymore.",

On the other end of the spectrum, some people think React is a specialization, whereas a lot of seasoned web people will argue that \"it can be learned in a week\", aka there just isn't much depth.\n\n\"Web\" is a specialization, and there's not a lot of newbies that can speak intelligently about web security and accessibility and performance and/or any of dozens of advanced topics within that domain, and conversely, seniors that can are going to be in demand, precisely because learning about the domain in depth takes effort.\n\nDiversification, in the sense of a principal engineer level of scope, is more or less about having to have an opinion about how some deep aspect of the web stack might interact with some deep aspect of the networking stack or the mobile stack or the storage stack or the ML stack or whatever happens to be on fire this semester",

One of the largest mistakes of my career.  I was promoted multiple times, got yearly 7% raises, and all that stuff so it wasn't clear that I was committing career suicide in the moment.\n\nI didn't know people working at actual tech companies to compare what was happening.  2 of my friends whet to get their Ph.D. in CS and the others I knew went to work at DOD jobs or equally shitty non-tech companies.  It wasn't until I found various subreddits that I realized what was going on at actual tech companies and how different our experiences were over the years.\n\nI was even leading teams of 20 SWEs, have my name on patents, and responsible for all software aspects of the medical device. I was working with interdisciplinary teams and all that good stuff.  The problem was I was learning learning one way to do things and that way was not how modern software was created.  It was old school 90's style engineering company with managers that have been there since the 80's and 90s doing things that exact same way.\n\nIt was top down management where they want engineers that just do what they were told and think minimally for themselves.. The company had a lot of lifers that got a job there as a new grad and just never left.  If you were not a lifer then you were early in your career and was easy to take advantage of.  There were very few middle career engineers with multiple jobs under there belt at the company.\n\nOnce I saw the light I started telling every new grad hires on the down low that they should stay for a year or 2 and learn what they can.  After that leave and get a job at another company that is more tech focused.  This company would talk about how they are growing by hiring 90 new engineers in the last year, but they don't tell you they lost 80 engineers over the course of the year so it was a net gain of 10 engineers.\n\nTake charge of your own career and don't expect any company to manage it for you in a way that's best for you and not the company.",

There might be a specific track or set of classes you take (honors, AP, etc). \n\nOnce you choose a college, choose a major, etc, there starts becoming a pretty wide range. People who are better students don't necessarily become better in the workforce, and people who were better students don't necessarily lead better lives. It's the same for everyone as they get older, not just CS grads. I have a cousin who is a lawyer and very successful. She's very friendly, outgoing, and good at her job. But she also says she got lucky and had a really great mentor at her first job. An old friend was a terrible student. He got a job partially by luck. A recruiter contacted him, he passed some new grad interviews (not tech), but they forget to check his transcripts. He did well enough in his interviews they took a chance on him once they saw his GPA. It worked out for him. \n\nAnd it's not like your first job sets things in stone. Plenty of people \"level up\" at different points in their career. A great support system is obviously awesome, but it won't always be available. And at a certain point, you're responsible for your own life and career. \n\nI've been solo a lot of my career. There are times I wish I had more mentoring. But I look at a company I used to work at. It fell apart after acquisition and leadership changes. People tended to scatter to one of three companies, all of which had people in leadership positions from the previous company. One the one hand, it's great you have a good working relationship. But it also felt weird, and there are times I wondered if people were scared or hesitant to try something new and expand their networks. I saw some places where once one of those legacy execs left, everyone started leaving. Maybe it was a sign. Maybe people couldn't last on their own. Maybe a combination. \n\nYou could also argue people later in life have more at stake (I personally don't like this argument). But some people will say they have a spouse, kids, a mortgage. Do they deserve less stability and mentoring than someone fresh out of school? You'll see some experienced people post here looking for career advice. \n\nI've given people who reported to me advice that at some point that they might outgrow the company. I'm sure there are other manager-types who would prefer their team stay put, since it makes things easier for them. \n\nYes, it's better to have a great manager, but you can't rely on that to shape your career. Most people aren't going to get carried and have things handed to them.",

Some of the technical infrastructure at big banks and major retailers is almost completely run by these people.\n\nMy theory is that it's much more efficient for these \"main\" companies to hire a core staff and management, then farm out the entry level tech work to these consultancies, than it is for them to hire entry level talent directly. The cost of acquisition and retainment is high and entry level tech work is often not that unique or specialized anymore, so they'd rather leave that headache to the consulting agencies.",

FAANG is probably one of the best places for someone like you, because they index on general problem-solving skills and less on selling yourself (ehhh, with the exception being Amazon and its leadership principles) or passing stack or language-specific quizzes.\n\nI was actually in kind of the same scenario. The company was Google, so it had CV weight, but between all the internal systems, configs, and getting passed around to different projects, I hit a point where I felt like I didn’t even know how to program. Ended up taking a year off and when I started again I got a lot of interviews but blew most of them because I had such a hard time communicating and selling myself on that kind of extremely specific, internal work. It was super frustrating. One of the few offers I got was from Meta, and now I’m doing ML infra work and feel like I’m starting to level up on those skills. \n\nOne of the biggest things for me has been working on personal projects just for fun, and it’s made me so much better as an engineer. The natural progression of those projects basically forces me into more modern stacks and approaches. Like I had this idea to do network analysis on Twitter hate groups, and suddenly I’m deep into TLS fingerprinting, optimizing hundreds of concurrent workers without hitting Postgres deadlocks, building a double-buffer architecture, messing with text classification, yada yada. It’s taught me way more than I expected.",

What really helped me was doing (paid) projects for people. When I was working service industry, I’d rebuild the restaurant’s site. When working in an office, I’d help the IT team fix internal apps. If friends needed help with CSS for their squarespace, I’d do it. With the crunch in the market, trying to rustle things up on the side might be the only way to get the experience you need for entry level. Say yes to everything until you can afford to be selective. It’s hard now, but there’s an inflection point where each little project creates a critical mass.",

It helps you get the knowledge to get a job, and the connections while in college to spring from. You don't learn AWS or React in college or usually even modern programming languages, skills that many people spend 2-3 years on learning just to get their entry level positions, but the ability to learn those quickly.\n\nAnd should be applying to 2-3 quality positions locally a day, not per week (I wouldn't bother applying remote for a first position).\n\nGood news is that most people applying to junior roles wasted their time and are just as clueless as you. It's a tough field to break into but the payoff, a near 6 figure job with great benefits and work life balance, far better than other 6 figure jobs that require far more schooling and work and *money* to get into, is worth it. Work as hard as any doctor or lawyer or vet and getting your first job will be easy. If you don't, well it'll be very difficult.\n\nIt's not like the 70's where having a degree guaranteed a job. It hasn't been that way for a long time now.\n\nMotivation comes from how bad do you want it, and discipline. If you're hungry enough, you'll do the work.",

Ignorance, youth, and naivete just easily succumbs to lies, this one in particular.\n\nEducation is the act of learning things. Education isn't bad. It's just that your education didn't end when you graduated. Right now you're being educated on tenacity, grit, the ability to adapt to pressure, the ability to evaluate previous decisions, navigating market conditions, extrapolating financial impacts, and all kinds of things.\n\nThe good (and bad) news is, even when you're hired, education will continue to not be a scam, as your education will continue in ways you did not expect, with topics that may include but not be limited to: how to deal with people you don't like, how to navigate ambiguity, how to deal with tasks that don't have criteria for success, how to draw boundaries, how to make mistakes gracefully, and more.\n\nEducation isn't a scam. I'm sorry you're going through what you're going through, but take it from someone who also struggled with a job hunt that lasted longer than the one you've been through: it is a filter, and there will be another filter after that, and another filter after that. You get to decide how you react to the negative pressure placed on you, and if you find that whatever you're currently doing isn't worth it to you: stop. Stop before you don't have a choice to stop, as the rest of your life now depends on that thing that you no longer find worth doing.\n\nYou don't get to choose what happens to you, but you do get to choose how you react. The world does not owe you anything, and I suggest internalizing that. Not getting the thing you want in a quick timeframe shouldn't lead to regret and feeling like you \"wasted\" your time, it should just make you ask yourself if you really wanted it to begin with. You sound young, and youth is, by definition, about making mistakes. I see you mentioned in the comments that you're only sticking to this because you've already dedicated time to it -- that's a sunk cost fallacy. Time you've already spent is gone no matter what you do, but the time you still have in front of you is 100% yours to choose how to use.\n\nGood luck.",

I got this degree thinking it would improve my life but it's only resulted in a lot of wasted time. 800+ job apps in five months got me about 7 interviews, resulting in 3 final rounds that led to 0 offers. The standards are ridiculously high to the point that even coding everything perfectly doesn't guarantee an offer. Then if you manage to land something in this God forsaken market, you need to worry about it being taken away because of company layoffs, AI or some guy in a third world country getting paid 1/4 of your salary.\n\nI'm quitting this field and not looking back.",

I mean this is so simplistic I could understand the stories of employees being angry their employers handed it out to them.\n\n> Several high school classmates meet after a class reunion and discuss the challenge of handling the changes in their lives. Michael, a business manager, says that he was afraid of change until he heard an allegorical story, which he proceeds to tell.\n> \n> In the story, two mice and two \"littlepeople\" – people the size of mice – live in a maze. The mice, named Sniff and Scurry, are simpleminded and instinctive; they run the same path every day, eating cheese when they find it, but are always ready to move on. The littlepeople, Hem and Haw, search for a special kind of Cheese that makes them happy and fulfilled by keeping track of where they have found it before. All four discover a spot where their favorite cheese is regularly available, called Cheese Station C. The mice continue to run the entire maze each day while the littlepeople stop exploring and settle at Cheese Station C.\n> \n> One day the supply at Cheese Station C is exhausted. The mice accept that there is no more cheese and continue their running path. The littlepeople sit at the station confused and upset. Hem protests that there ought to be Cheese, and Haw wonders where the mice have gone. Meanwhile, the mice find a new supply of cheese at Cheese Station N. The littlepeople remain at Cheese Station C for several days, growing frustrated and hungry. Eventually Haw accepts that running the maze is the only way he will ever have Cheese again, faces his fear of moving on, and leaves Hem behind.\n> \n> Haw finds crumbs of Cheese scattered around the maze and some other Cheese Stations that are already depleted. He returns to Cheese Station C and tells Hem there is other Cheese, but Hem refuses to budge. Haw continues exploring, writing observations about his journey on the walls of the maze, until he arrives at Cheese Station N which is stocked with all kinds of Cheese.\n> \n> Haw reflects on the lessons he has learned and hopes that Hem will finally let go of his doubts. On the wall of Cheese Station N, he writes several lessons that change is inevitable and keeping up with it is the only way to continue having Cheese. Cautious from past experience, Haw inspects Cheese Station N daily and explores different parts of the maze regularly to prevent complacency. Hearing movement in the maze one day, Haw realizes someone is approaching the station and hopes it is his friend Hem.\n> \n> After Michael finishes the story, the classmates agree to meet again before dinner and discuss it. They tell different stories of encountering change and how they, or someone else, failed to respond to it. All of them agree that the Cheese story is a useful parable to follow and tell their friends.",

I never went to a bar when I was in college, so I didn’t have much use for cheap Jeopardy-like information that I was learning.\n\nIn my five years of university, I think I actually enjoyed maybe two or three classes. The coolest one was data science, where we used algorithms in Python like k-nearest neighbor to classify clusters of data and iteratively displayed the algorithm converging, which was a pretty neat and beautiful display of mathematics.\n\nBut the other stuff was like memorizing the five-state diagram of a CPU round-robin task priority queue, and how tasks were transferred from cache memory into RAM and vice versa. Not my cup of tea, and I forgot the information quickly after the test.\n\nOne class on RISC-V assembly was neat—making a little library to read and write from a text file by meticulously setting up the assembly memory registers. \n\n  \nbut all in all it was a pretty painful experience and until I get a job the in the field I cannot really recommended it.

It’s fine to want to pivot your career but it doesn’t really sound like you know what you want? or what jobs you’re interested in? no one here can make those decisions for you? \n\nI work in data, same age and on about £70k. I only got here by being ruthless eg constantly putting myself out there out there at work, learning new things, leaving roles/environments that weren’t suitable etc. \n\nFrankly I don’t think any 3-5 month course is really going to do much for you. Many data careers want a masters in maths for example so your bootcamp just isn’t going to be competitive give how many relevant degree holders are going to be in the pool of candidates. It’s not really a career where someone that isn’t passionate about it, will do well because it is so highly saturated. The bubble has popped in that sense. \n\nIf you do want to do some courses I’d recommend things like AWS certified courses or Microsoft certifications. Not free but might help you leverage some credibility. But the gold standard would be getting any role and leveraging data in that role as a stepping stone to a better job.",

        "body": "Sorry to hear it, this is a rough spot to be in. The biggest thing that’s going to hold you back is making it through resume screening, and without any internship or real production experience it’s going to be very hard. \n\nMy biggest suggestion is to network at companies where a referral actually helps you get your foot in the door and pushes you through the automated resume system. This means FAANG+ and big tech are out the door, as a referral will hold very little weight, and even if a real person reviews it, lack of experience will likely be your down fall. Connect with as many people as you can at smaller companies - even if that’s <200 employees. It might not even be a software company. Many CS majors have a “FAANG/Big tech or bust” philosophy and see everything else as a failure. If that’s you, you must put your pride away and take any chance you can get. This is a stepping stone, not the final form of your career.\n\nThe next thing is to get very good at interviewing, leetcode, and preparing for a specific companies interview. This much is obvious, but your hit rate for interviews will be low, so when you do get one, you need to maximize the opportunity.\n\nI’d also really inspect how meaningful your personal projects are. I was surprised at how much weight they pulled during my interviews/screening, and I was told by multiple interviewers it made a large impression - which also means I got grilled on them so they could verify it was real/I did it lol. If your projects are very generic, even if done well, they likely aren’t helping as much as you think. Pick something you’d really love to learn about or make - maybe hobby related  - and flesh it out a ton. The more niche/specific, the more memorable. Document well, consistent pushes, make graphs of your data and put them in the repo, reference research papers that informed decisions, etc.\n\nLastly, I’d genuinely consider if a masters is right for you. New grad applications are already hell on earth, but doing them with no internship will be a challenge and a half. A masters degree puts you back in “intern” status before you finish it, so if you put your all into the things above during intern apps, you would likely snag some. Once you’re back to new grad apps, you could have an internship(s), maybe some light research experience (even if no paper), TA positions, and a higher degree. \n\nGood luck, and give yourself some grace while understanding what you’re willing to do for the job.",

Recently, I started working as a delivery driver, and it pays 50% more per hour than my tech job from 3 years ago.\n\nIt's not because of AI though, it was already like this around the time chatgpt was first released and the AI craze started. The actual reason is that there is an enormous oversupply of software developers and not anywhere near enough demand for them, especially in a country that doesn't put any value on tech like the UK. There are just way too many people getting CS degrees.",

They too want to get stuff out on time and are frequently more flexible than you would think, especially if you push back with solid compromises. Make your concerns known quickly so folks can shift scope. Use data if you can to support your case; using only your gut will frequently get you no where. As you get more practice and work with the same people your assumptions will get a lot better when faced with stuff like this. \n\nAnother thing I started doing later in my career is try and get involved more in project planning with product just to have a jump start on things.\n\nAnyway, good luck!",

Which is nice, but it also means there's plenty of space for communication to get lost.\n\nYou work for a startup. The whole company should be able to sit down and align on these things in one meeting. If you're not sure what the current stack/setup/codebase is capable of and how it's used, sit down with every other technical person in the startup and ask questions until you get it. If you find that requirements are changing on the fly, ask to be involved in all the meetings where requirement changes are decided/discussed. Enforce best practices by documenting the infrastructure, take meeting minutes e.g. in confluence, make sure discussions and decisions are not lost or forgotten.\n\nAlso document your struggles with the changing requirements so that you can show your boss, look, I wasted X number of hours rewriting stuff last month. If there's a dollar value on the time wasted, your boss will be more likely to try to support you, because the business also can't be wasting thousands every month on wasted effort.",

If you're having issues w/ lack of vocabulary/articulation, chances are that your fundamentals are lacking. You can go about filling the gaps either in a top-down way (e.g. start from what you know and work \"downwards\" into lower levels) or bottom-up (e.g. start from from C/ASM and work your way up back to high level).\n\nThe former tends to be a more pragmatic form of learning. You can, for example, go from knowing about calling fetch (vs whatever is the abstraction for it in your favorite framework) to RPC/REST to HTTP spec (what different headers do, etc) or go from ORMs to raw SQL to reading about db normalization, etc.\n\nThe bottom-up approach is useful for getting stronger at fundamentals, e.g. reading source code for hashmap implementations in various languages can help you understand how they actually work wrt memory layout, complexity, etc.\n\nWith that said, senior level isn't necessarily about those. There's some level of importance in being able to accurately convey technical ideas via jargon, but equally (or perhaps more) important is communicating at an appropriate level for the audience (e.g. a junior vs a director). You're not really going to find resources on how to navigate this stuff, your best bet is imitate your seniors until it becomes natural.",

ADHD shows up differently in women, we tend to police ourselves a lot by trying to be “normal” and also are anxious and quiet around authority figures \n\n\n\nI think with leetcode you can use neet code and go through each pattern, doing all the easys for each pattern, until you get comfortable enough to do mediums. Do 2 problems at least a night (1 hr) If you have to redo easys until you get it, do that. I would say spend 10 min on ur own on the problem if you can’t figure it out watch neetcode solution - then do it and then wait two days and try and do it on ur own and then if you forget watch the solution again. Copy and paste all ur solutions in a Google doc so u can go back to them (cause you most likely will have pseudo code next to it). Keep doing this with the easys until ir makes sense to you and you can technically explain what is happening, watching neetcode solution more than once will help you because you will start speaking technically and confidently. And then when you’re good at all the problems u previously did time box yourself for 30 min to work on the same problem - pretend it’s an interview by then u will be confident because you have done this easy problem more than once. And just repeat for mediums and hards (time box 60 min) \n\n\nMaybe you should also go back to the fundamentals in the language ur comfortable using (w3 schools), relearning OOP principles and other things you might have forgotten. \n\n\nUse ai to help you study, ask it to ask you interview question and then you write the answer  or if you don’t know what the algorithm solution is doing when reviewing the solution ask it to go through each iteration. Also ask DeepSeek (ai I use) to make you a study plan. But regardless you should do hacker hour where no matter what you do 1 hr of algorithms (at least 2 problems a day). Also use pomodoro where you study for 25 min and then you get a 5 min reward to scroll or get up and stretch or lay down. I use my Apple Watch to do it because it buzzes. You could also have a big timer on ur screen if you need to see it visually.",

Yeah you can Google it on the side, but a lot of times it's easier to briefly pause the meeting and have it explained by the person doing the talking. It signals that you're paying attention and willing to learn. I've had a lot of positive feedback about my willingness to do that, from both the business folks using acronyms I don't know and colleagues who were similarly confused but not confident enough to speak up.\n\n\nHonestly it sounds like you're selling yourself short a bit. I had some excellent mentors that beat in the idea of advocating for yourself in a corporate world, and being willing to make a change if the company you work for won't accommodate that.\n\n\nThat said, I also went through a destructive leadership turnover cycle and it fuckin sucked! I was having full on panic attacks and needed to consult a therapist to get through it, and I think I've come out the other side more resilient. \n\n\nSo do what you need to do, and if that involves seeking some professional help that's absolutely okay. My therapist likes to remind me that a significant portion of her clients are there for work related anxiety. Software Engineering is a high-stakes, high-stress career field.\n\n\nOh! Also, therapy exposed that I had a sleeping disorder which caused me a lot of physical symptoms like brain fog, difficulty focusing, and memory problems. Anxiety can absolutely play a role in that too, but in my case it was physical symptoms making my anxiety worse not the other way around.",

For any concept or specific interaction  between technologies I'm not 100% certain about or haven't touched in a while, I make a little sandbox on my personal computer with practical examples that I type out (not paste from google/ai) and play around with it for a day or 2 and leave some notes in markdown in the folder.\n\nSometimes you haven't worked with a technology in depth for months, I come back to those folders in such times and its a quick memory boost, imo more than you'd get if you simply read up on it or googled a singular question.\n\nFlashcards are decent for interviews but imo not amazing for in depth knowledge.\n\n2. Intelligence can't be faked (at least when working with intelligent people), trying to sound smart isn't a cool look. The people who work with you will know how well you know your stuff in the same way that I assume *you* know how well each of your colleagues knows your stuff - usually some are a cut above the rest, no matter where you work.\n\nI think you taking the time to write this post shows you care about your knowledge which is frankly more important than how \"smart\" you are in the first place, I'm sure it's really tiring being a sole provider and most people would also have trouble finding the energy to upskill in your shoes. Not always possible, but maybe try stealing a bit of work time to read up/practice if possible, when you're less tired during the day. Best of luck!\n\n  \nEDIT: Also, some times you just wont get a promotion - regardless of how well you do, there's many variables deciding who gets promoted - so don't take it to heart. The opinion your peers and/or technical leadership have of you and you work is more indicative of your skills than a promotion.",

Again, some don’t have exposure. \n\nBut a lot depends on what you know going into this. \n\nI’d be curious about context. What additional interview steps are there? How much time are you being given?\n\nAlso, don’t go in with the mindset if the interviews doesn’t work out, it was a waste of time. Think of it as a way of learning some new things. You might want to dig deeper on your own, and these could become talking points during future interviews. \n\nA lot will also depend on the people doing the evaluations. Some people want to understand how you think. Others just want to nitpick. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that some companies also use a project like this as a personality test.

I’m grateful to have a job, but I’m hoping to leave once I have enough experience\n\nTruth is that nobody is going to own your growth, learning, or development like yourself. Managers, good or bad, have a strong preference for self-reliant employees. Try to learn what you can at work, but mostly a lot of gaps will have to be filled in on your own. Your seniors are busy trying to drive business value and manage expectations with leaderships. Mid-level engineers might have more time to mentor you but they are not motivated to.\n\n> On top of that, I’m assigned high-priority tasks with a lot of ownership, but I drop the ball or I am given no guidance. I’ve felt completely in the dark and left to fend for myself. Feeling extremely disappointed because I am older than the usual junior because I switched careers.\n> \n\nYou've got to make sure you nail down requirements and get the answers you need before you start coding. After coding, make sure you do QA, and have confidence in your happy path tests and edge cases. If you're working on a difficult task, then improve your communication and manage up for your PM and manager. Prioritize tasks that unblock other engineers so they trust you and don't blame you for delays.\n\n> How do I up-skill effectively, perform better in my current role, and prepare to transition to a healthier company?\n\nIt's as simple and hard as starting now, practicing consistently, and documenting your accomplishments so you can talk about what you've done and can do. The market is tough right now though for non-senior engineers and you'll have better traction once you get promoted.",

        "body": "Having been through this a couple times, my advice is to look at how much you're being paid to stay. Deals differ, but in my experience if you're going to get a compelling equity payout, retention bonus, stock grant in the new company or are seen as playing a role in the acquisition (in a way that materially benefits you) you'll probably know about it (even if not exact numbers) within a week or two. If you're not being paid anything, treat it like any new job, and evaluate it on those terms. Would you have applied for this company before they bought your current employer? Are they doing anything exciting? Are they hiring for your role + experience?\n\nAlso: executive bullshit can get especially thick after deals like this. They likely do have retention bonuses or targeted bonuses for certain milestones even if you don't, and otherwise decent people have a way of rationalizing really shitty behavior when someone dangles enough money in front of them. So, if you're hearing about the 2026 roadmap, that there will be no layoffs, or other stuff that paints a rosy picture around the future, take it with a big grain of salt. They _might_ not be lying outright (or they might be!), but they may have a lot of incentive to hold off a mass exodus even if leaving would be the better move for employees.\n\nWhat I'm reading is that you weren't really happy before this deal, you were serious enough about leaving to have offers on the table relatively quickly after the deal, you're not super jazzed about what the new company is doing (you don't mention this at all in your post), and you're probably not going to get much/any retention $ from this (sorry, but I think you'd know about it by now). I actually had almost exactly this situation earlier in my career, bought the BS, stayed, and regretted it. I like to think I'd be out the door pretty quickly if it happened again.",

My cohort has had a very wide range of outcomes, from people getting big tech/FAANG research jobs to people adjuncting at the local community college and living a low-key life. (I find myself drifting towards the latter, now that I'm closer to 40 than 30 and realize that I'll never want kids or a house in the 'burbs.)\n\nThe people with the tech research jobs actively sought that out during their PhDs. They found advisors in other departments working on ML, and attended ML seminars, helped run ML workshops, did tech internships, etc. There was a time when generic math/physics/etc PhDs got hired on to these jobs, but Covid slammed that door shut if you weren't actively keeping it open... nowadays, given the market, even getting hired as an SWE or data scientist right out of grad school isn't easy. Being a smart guy/gal who used Sage for your number theory project or MATLAB for your CFD project doesn't really cut it any more.\n\nThe average time to completion in my program was 6 years. I knew a few people who finished in 4, and a few who stayed for 9-10, but most people got out in 5-7. I was on track to be a 5, until I got scooped, and I ended up making it out in 7. You said it was a foreign PhD program and these tend to be shorter because they expect you to already have an MS coming in and start working on research immediately, but it still raises an eyebrow that you're already 28 and penciling in being out by 32-33. (Mid-30s isn't old by any means, but it is just old enough that you will look around and see a lot of your friends having kids and buying houses, so if you're prone to comparing yourself with people that could gnaw at you.)\n\nSo I think my gut reaction is this isn't a bad idea, but at least my experience has been that a STEM PhD is not a golden ticket to a high paying tech job any more. You will want to align yourself with that from day one of school if that's your goal. If you drift into doing a pure math or even classical applied math (e.g. CFD, PDEs) thesis, it might not get you where you want to go.\n\nedit: sorry, I said \"foreign\" but you're not even from the US, so from your perspective it's not foreign at all! I am from the US, and my message is written from that perspective.",

I loved automating stuff, tuning servers, learned a lot about networking and public cloud architectures, and got my hands dirty with k8s extensively. That said it also forced me into a bad place mentally. Being on a pager is rough. Being on a pager for a team that constantly has issues is also rough.  \n  \nI developed severe anxiety issues that I attribute to my on call duties. Had to be at my computer within 10 mins for any p1 issue, and on call cycles were generally a week long. That week was one I learned to dread, a lot. \n\nObviously many people don’t have this problem but I know a lot of former SREs that had similar issues. It did equip my well to move in to tech sales, though, and I definitely am grateful I had an off ramp.",

Both positions will likely come with some degree of on-call but an SRE will often have more.\n\nSRE is a relatively new career track so many companies are still figuring it out. At some companies SRE's are SWE's who focus on infrastructure, observability, and reliability. At other companies they've basically took the old sysadmin roles, added more responsibilities, and relabeled it to be SRE.\n\nI realize I came off as pretty harsh on SRE's which isn't my intention. Many of the SRE's I've worked with in my career are incredibly smart and well respected. I personally realize it wasn't a suitable role for me but if you enjoy the tech stack and work that an SRE does then definitely give it a shot!",
