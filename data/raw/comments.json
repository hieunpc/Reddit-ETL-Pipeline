I ask chatGPT to write scripts, read logs, research solutions, etc. THIS is the new iteration of software engineering and by extension data engineering. If you’re not using AI at your job, you’re falling behind.  \n  \nHaving said that, I’m still up to date on technology, I still read documentation, and I review every single line of code chatGPT writes without exception. If I don’t understand what it’s doing, I research it. If I’m skeptical on what the script does, it does not make it into prod. No exceptions.  \n  \nA word of caution, we had someone on our team write a script with AI and run it without reviewing. They deleted a bunch of data from the database without knowing. We had back ups, but there was data that went missing. When asked about the obviously ChatGPT written script they could not explain what it did or why.",

All the cdc pipelines work great, and I haven't had any issues.\n\nI have to ask, how come you can't use mirroring for your on-prem sql? Or at least spark if not mirroring.\n\nFor the front end, I just approached it via segmentation of capacity. So, each business domain only throttles themselves. But that doesn't happen much since nobody uses paginated reports, and the data models are pretty clean.\n\nHonestly, I'd still rather use Databricks, but my problem is I can't justify it to my organization since I made the Fabric site work too well on its own...",

About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.\n\nIts not always about \"saving\" time for me but rather its about doing things the \"better\" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the future\n\nI know what I've said above is not related to \"AI on top of broken data stack\", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.\n\nBy fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to \"slap AI on top of our data\" as in:\n\n\\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\\_xyz contain data from source\\_abc? how often does table\\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\n\n\\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like \"what was our prediction accuracy last week?\" \"how did model A perform vs model B last year?\"\n\nI think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the \"self-service\" utopia we've always dreamt about.",

We’ve seen many thousands of companies use Postgres and ClickHouse to build their data stacks, and the adoption is growing very fast. The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)\n\nWith regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads. We plan to invest heavily in this area to make application migration as seamless as possible.\n\nApart from all of this, the Postgres we are offering is NVMe-backed, which is very fast and comes enterprise-grade guarantees. We are building this in partnership with a world-class Postgres team at Ubicloud who were ex-Citus, Heroku, Microsoft Postgres.\n\nThis launch was a primer, stay tuned for a more very soon! :)",

        "body": "The meta for llms changes every week, so don't get two freaked out about it.  \n\nBusiness context is usually captured with either RAG or graphs.  RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data.  Basically look at how Neo4j works.  They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have.  That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like.  Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant.  \n\nYou can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that.  But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else.  AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen).  Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create \"tools\" for the LLM to use based on the context.  Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call.  \n\nIt's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the \"best\" approach changes almost weekly.  It's still very early in AI development so I guess I would say don't freak out about learning one thing as it will likely change, but definitely do get into working with AI is future work will depending on it.  It's not going away.",

Their role is a bit on the lowcode side(Dashboards mainly) so it's not as much of AI slop code, but everything else.\n\n\nHe was supposed to document a certain onboarding process for a new product and dude made a fuckin 30 page doc. Obviously AI. It has like 40 different steps in 5 phases. Then he set up a 2 hour call with the team to review the doc. Manager postponed the meeting to 3 days later cuz no one had the time to read that. \n\nIn the end, maybe only the manager read the doc. Not even sure of that.\nRest of us just gave a go ahead without reading the whole shit. And the dude is so proud that he has contributed to documentation in extreme detail. 100% no one is going to follow through that shit.\n\nNow when you slack the guy, he'll reply with obviously AI generated messages. The meeting invites have AI slop agenda with 👉❌✅📅📍🚀 emojis \n\nOther teammates have started to use AI to summarise his messages and emails into human readable summaries",

Now, our new Indian coworkers are copying text from Jira tickets, pasting it into Claude, copying whatever Claude generates, and opening PRs without testing the code. The code usually doesn't run, and these people are completely closed off to constructive criticism, so nothing has improved for weeks. They do like to bitch about us, though. \n\nMy manager came to me yesterday to tell me I needed to be more patient and to train one of these guys more. There is no training taking place, because they're not actually attempting to do what is asked of them. Copying and pasting things into and put of an LLM is not learning or trying, it's just creating slop. Ive gone over the changes that need made to a file three times now and have shown them the exact lines where changes need to be made. Something that I've told them is only a 3 line update turns into a 600+ line diff.\n\nLast week, I got on a call with my tech lead and one of these guys and went through every single line he had updated in a PR and asked him to explain his design decisions. He literally couldn't explain what the code did at all. \n\nSo, at least on my team, it's a huge issue. We are hiring people that aren't competent because our leadership assumes that any idiot can generate code via an LLM, so they're hiring the cheapest idiots they can find. We have guardrails on everything, so no one has brought down dev, let alone prod, but jfc it's an exhausting, neverending mess around here.",

As long as everything was simple with a single region and incoming product, and a few people had been working on it and had direct experience with how everything was done, then the 'quirks' were kept to a minimum and everyone knew them.\n\nThen as new team members got onboarded things got harder. People had to be taught all the quirks of which role to use when creating a glue job vs an interactive notebook, they had to be shown the magic command boilerplate to get glue catalog and iceberg tables working, they needed to know the bucket that was set up for output for Athena queries. With more people working not everyone could be across everyone else's work, so people weren't familiar with how various custom jobs and scripts had been made, and because each job was its own mini vertical stack there was a lot of repeated components in infrastructure, policies, ci/cd scripts.\n\nAs new use cases came on that didn't fit the mould new ways of doing things had to be added. Kinesis and firehose come in, airflow orchestration gets tasked for some small transforms while others go to glue jobs. Someone wants a warehouse/database to query, so redshift is added. Exports to third party processors are needed as are imports, so more buckets, more permissions. API ingestions are needed so in come lambda functions, with each one coded and deployed differently because nobody can see what everyone else is doing.\n\nThen finally users need access to data, and the team just isn't set up for it. There is no central catalog with everything, it is spread out across half a dozen services, and the only way to know where anything is or goes is to dig through the code. That 'worked' for the DE team, since they were the ones doing the digging, but there was no effective way to give access to everything. Every request for data took days or weeks to finalise, and often required more pipelines to move it to where it could be accessed.\n\nWe're moving to Databricks soon. It gives a unified UI for DE and other teams to access the data, you get sql endpoints, you can run basic compute on single-node 'clusters', it has orchestration built in, it gives you a somewhat easier way to manage permissions, and it works for both running your own compute and giving data access. Instead of a mishmash of technologies that don't make a unified platform, you get a consistent experience.\n\nYou'll just have to pay extra since it is doing a good portion of that unification work for you.\n\nIf you had a hundred DE type roles it might be more cost effective to stick with base aws services, and have a dedicated team focused on dx, standards, and productivity, to cut out the managed compute cost. But if you're just 3 people, you're probably not there.",

I have experience with spark, orchestration, A.I. Agents, etc. \n\nDatabricks can do everything you listed. It is not the best in each category. Airflow is a superior orchestration tool than Databricks Workflows, for example. However Databricks provides tools in all categories that are more than good enough.\n\nI find myself surprised how easy most things are. I usually  do a POC with a G.U.I. first.  Then reimplement with code, checking against the G.U.I. POC as I go. There is a G.U I. for Databricks Workflows and A.I. Agents. In general, everything seems to be as easy as possible, with good default settings. \n\nThe advantage of having good enough tools in broad categories that all integrate well with each other makes life easy.\n\nMeasured against AWS, Databricks is more expensive. Your company can either pay more for compute ( go with Databricks) or pay more to expand the team with specialized people (AWS). Expensive compute is cheaper than expensive specialists.\n\nPlus Databricks is moving to everything runs on serverless. In practice, I would say 80% to 90% of prod code runs on serverless. I see this improving with time.\n\nClosing remark. Databricks is a thought leader. They have made many open source software that everything else is compared to. (Spark, MLflow, DeltaLake,...). Databricks competitors run Databricks open source software. Agent bricks hosts 20+ LLMs out of the box. I don't know what the future holds, but I bet Databricks drives it.",

We used all of the technologies you listed except data tone and only a bit of lake formation. Then we wanted to have a business facing data catalogue with lineage and there wasn’t much available in AWS. As of 2026 I would argue that is still the case. For data catalogue we used OpenMetadata. For hosting we used EKS btw.\n\nLong story short it takes a lot of development effort to put all of these technologies together and to maintain it. It works well once done and it is scalable. \n\nBut if I would do it again I would use Databricks in 2026. Gets you started quickly. Downside will be cost as you have to pay for DBUs on top off AWS cost.  Arguably you would need less data developers which could pay for the additional cost.  I know this is a bit off a sticking point nobody wants to think about. But if you plan to use your devs to build the AWS solution then you already covered the dev cost. If you go with Databricks you may need less data devs, assuming that some part of their time is currently used for infrastructure work. If the new AWS architecture would need more devs than the argument would be that Databricks would allow you to operate with the current number of devs.\n\nIf you decide to go with databricks use an open source table format like iceberg to reduce vendor locking. Also bear in mind, databricks can support all of the requirements you listed, but is not best in class for all of them like BI, orchestration, gen ai etc. the core is around spark and related services.",

Here is my advice:\n\nIf you want to break into this field you need to take your studies very seriously. In the age of AI your coding skills alone are no longer enough. You need to be able to help the business architect solutions to data problems. Furthermore if you are not knowledgeable on architecture design you probably won’t land a senior role at all. Those who stand out the most to me are knowledgeable on modern tools but more specifically the value they provide. Those who standout the least cannot explain how to design a data solution. I think it’s a highly rewarding field with opportunity for growth but you have to be ready to work hard, especially when it comes to continuous learning.",

Some people have 5 years and that mean different problems with higher and higher scale every year. Some other have 5 repeated same years. That said, to achieve certain title, sometimes you do need to \"wait\" for certain amount of years to pass, unless you are able to **get** & **execute** a wide-scope highly visible project.\n\nAs you grow throughout the years and solve more complex problems, inevitably you will encounter new tech stack or rethink your data modeling approach, so you will have organic grow. But more important than arsenal of long list of tech stack is your structured problem-solving skills.\n\nLast but not least, communication skill. Usually senior-level engineer is able to communicate values and communicate complex tech in simpler terms. *Personally this is something that I keep on striving too* :).\n\n  \nGood luck!",

The trick is not trying to learn “everything.” You don’t need mastery of every tool you need a solid mental model of how data flows end to end. Once that clicks, new tech becomes variations on the same ideas, not brand new worlds. Your PM/BA background is actually a plus. Understanding requirements, tradeoffs, and why pipelines exist is something a lot of younger DEs struggle with. Focus on building a couple of boring, real pipelines and ignore the noise.

Best-practice in terms of this kind of thing is to know the trade-offs), implement observability from day 1 (that can be writing logs and checking them daily in cloudwatch at the start).\n\nNote that MANY of your trade-offs and architectural decisions will depend on what kind of requirements are required downstream. In fact, the very first thing you need to map is who are the data consumers and what are their needs - mind you that more often than not the end-users have very vague requirements (it is often a big part of the job to translate vague business requirements into technical choices - also, often what they want is different than what they need). If applicable to your case: also talk to upstream stakeholders (feks, in my company, the data is generated by services written by developers, so I have to sync with them to understand what is doable or not in terms of data serving/latency)\n\nEDIT: also, if you are not super familiar with AWS, dont underestimate how much time you'll spend implementing things there :D\n\n(I'm in a similar position, where I wear the architect, tech lead and engineer hat at the same time - and oh, Iam also brazilian ;) )",

The biggest challenge for me is taking on primary responsibility for a large project like this, more than the lack of technical support itself.\n\nI will follow all your advice and start small, validate realistic scenarios, and evolve the architecture carefully. Thank you for sharing your vision!",

LLMs may seem reasonable, especially for a one time match, but I guess I would want to see it in action compared to other approaches.

It was frustrating when I was stuck but that gave me all the opportunity to learn without someone putting fire behind me. I was literally just updating my manager in our 1-1 and would ask for minor inputs here and there and he wasn’t even inputting anything. I honestly think the project could have hone better. That project helped my confidence to move to the next job.",

They isolate DAGs per batch, manage lineage, and prevent silent exits due to metadata growth. If you stick with batch loops, you need a mechanism to restart the Spark context periodically and checkpoint and clear lineage aggressively, but that is more fragile. Tools like dataflint can also help flag where your plan or metadata is growing across iterations so you can catch it before it silently exits. Structured streaming gives predictable long running behavior and scales better on YARN for production workloads.",

ODBC and JDBC are Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that specify how a driver can be built for different databases that allows client programs to use the same API on different databases.  The way you send a query, read results, execute statements, etc, then can be the same no matter which database you are using.  This API layer doesn't standardize the query languages you need to use; you still need to send valid SQL commands for the target database, but the code you use to send those queries doesn't need to be specific to the target database.\n\nThe difference between ODBC and JDBC is that ODBC is a C-style API and the drivers are platform-specific.  IE you always to build a Linux version and a separate Windows version.  And some ODBC drivers are only available on Windows (where ODBC originated).\n\nJDBC is specific to Java (and other JVM languages like Scala), but a single pure Java (type 4) driver can be used across platforms.\n\nIn data engineering JDBC and ODBC are the default, legacy connectors to get to data from various systems.  Both suffer from their heritage as drivers for client/server database systems, and so typically will use a single TCP/IP connection to send queries and read results.  In big data engineering this can be a bottleneck, and so things like native Spark connectors have been built for more scalable data connections to big data systems.",

It's great.\n\nWhere I work I use the MySQL v8 ODBC in a Windows server running MSSQL in prod, and push tables across the network truncate/load in a remote staging tables of a MySQL server (that the Wan IP addresses & ports are fixed and whitelisted for security). Once the load is completed, a stored proc is called remotely to signal the MySQL to process those staging tables.\n\nIt's an annoying process though, I would rather create flat files, push them somewhere, and an event triggered at the remote end (like a datalake container/folder) processes them. I could then make JSON data and send that, also based on events.\n\nIOW, JDBC/ODBC between servers is a \"work-around\" solution, and it's slow. Like 45 mins to send 2 gigs of data.\n\nHTH",

TPC-DS generators are useful too, but they can feel a bit artificial compared to semi-messy realworld data. You can also look at public datasets from places like AWS Open Data or Google BigQuery public datasets and just pull subsets under 100GB.\n\nMedallion isn’t the *only* layering pattern, it’s just the most common mental model. Some teams add things like a “raw but validated” layer, or domainoriented marts instead of a single gold layer. The naming matters less than being clear about guarantees (schema stability, data quality, latency).\n\nFor monitoring, beyond infra metrics, it’s worth looking into data-quality checks at the Spark/Iceberg level (row counts, freshness, null checks). Tools like Great Expectations or simple custom checks in Airflow go a long way in a POC. Scaling pain usually shows up first around small-file problems, metadata growth, and orchestration complexity rather than raw storage cost.\n\nHonestly, you’re already doing the right thing by focusing on practice and observability early that’s where most realworld lakehouses struggle.",

Glue jobs with bootstrapping logic (or even AWS SDK/CLI scripts) can generate and update the tables as needed, while the Terraform state stays clean and manageable. It does add an extra step to your deploys, but it’s more transparent and less prone to silent breakage than bending Terraform out of shape.\n\nFor versioning, a lot of folks lean on dbt’s schema versions and migration patterns, even if it means treating Glue like more of a catalog pointer than a true source of state.\n\nCurious to see if anyone’s found a less clunky solution that keeps everything declarative—but so far, the split-responsibility model seems the most maintainable.",

Your Python service pulls data from the carpark API and publishes events as they arrive. From there, you usually want some kind of streaming or messaging layer to decouple ingestion from processing, so bursts or failures don’t break everything. Next comes processing, where you clean the data, handle duplicates or late events, and compute whatever metrics you care about (occupancy, availability trends, etc.). This can be done in near-real-time or small micro-batches depending on complexity. The processed output then lands in a store that’s optimized for querying or visualization, which your frontend reads from. The key ideas to focus on early are idempotency, schema consistency, and what “real time” actually means for your use case (seconds vs minutes). Start simple, get something end to end working, then layer in streaming frameworks, windowing, and fault tolerance once you understand the flow",

You should treat your SQL server as the Control Plane and a dedicated file store (like S3, Azure Blob, or a MinIO instance) as the Data Plane. Your Python script functions as a gateway that pulls data from your various sources and subjects it to a strict validation suite before it ever reaches the ML team. Instead of raw CSVs or SQL dumps, have your script convert the data into Parquet files; this format is compressed, schema-enforced, and significantly faster for ML frameworks to load than standard text files. Once the script validates and saves the file to your central storage, it should write a record to a \"Manifest\" table in your SQL server. This record includes the file path, a unique version ID, a checksum to prevent corruption, and the results of your quality tests. The ML team then simply queries this SQL table to find the URI of the latest \"Verified\" dataset, eliminating the need for email threads and manual downloads.\nThis setup transforms your manual 70GB bottleneck into a robust, versioned data pipeline that maintains the SWE standards of your core application.",

Chunking with pandas is a solid approach for memory management, but you do have to be careful: some operations just don’t make sense chunk-by-chunk.\n\nChunking is great for row-wise, stateless preprocessing (cleanup, type conversion, basic feature engineering). But for anything that needs a full view of the data—global normalization, deduplication, calculating rare category frequencies, finding global min/max—you’ll either need multiple passes or a clever accumulation/aggregation step.\n\nA typical workflow for your scenario:\n- First pass: Scan over chunks to gather global stats (means, stds, value counts, rare category thresholds).\n- Second pass: Use those stats to transform the data in chunks. Outlier detection, normalization, etc. can be done chunked, but with knowledge of global parameters.\n- Save intermediate files as Parquet if possible, for speed and compression.\n- Tools: Dask and Polars both handle these kinds of workflows better than vanilla pandas, especially Polars for very fast I/O and multi-threading.\n- For Colab: keep an eye on disk (mount Google Drive if needed), and be ready to restart if you hit session limits.\n\nIf you ever need to empower less technical folks to safely interact with this data (without risking direct DB access), there are platforms nowadays that let you build internal apps over your datasets via drag-and-drop, or even AI chat interfaces. Could help with democratizing those big data insights beyond just the Python crowd.\n\nBut for now: chunking + multi-pass over Parquet files + Dask/Polars is the combo I’ve seen work well in similar RAM-constrained settings.

At 30M rows, this almost always triggers an OOM (Out of Memory) crash in environments like Colab.\n​Serialization Overhead: Converting DuckDB’s internal format to Pandas and then to a model-ready format creates unnecessary CPU work and memory duplication.\n​Moving to Polars solved this because it feels like it was built for the 'Model' part of 'Data Science.' Since it uses the Apache Arrow memory format, it integrates seamlessly with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Scikit-Learn with zero-copy potential meaning the model can often read the data directly without doubling the RAM usage.\n​The Lazy API and Streaming mode let me handle the full 30M-row feature engineering pipeline with way more stability. I can build complex transformations (scaling, encoding, joins) and only 'collect' the data when the model is ready for it.

Unless it's highly critical and you are allowed to maintain a live copy of production in test environment, the test data is inevitably less complete. The smart and efficient solution is to have a proper analysis of the different cases existing in production, and use them to build your test data, ideally by the upstream team that is responsible for this data. Consider that it cannot be complete, try to make it good enough. Don't think you can predict all future use cases, the solution for those is proper error logging, monitoring and alerting, so you can react fast when they will happen.\n\n> In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing.\n\nTeams should be free to have their team-only development environment were they can break everything, but there should be another test environment that is relatively stable to allow downstream usage of data like you need. I think you need to talk about having such a stable test environment with the engineering management, in my experience it was mostly called \"staging\". It's not supposed to be a copy of \"production\", and it's better if it is not for information security, but it should be a good simulation of production cases to test the code edge cases (as I described above).\n\nIn our case, our dev environment is our local laptops. We have hand crafted test files crafted to represent the different cases, and we are able to run full flows locally with either our tools running locally or mocking. Local allows to iterate much faster than if you have to deploy and rely on non-local tools. The unit tests and full flow tests are automated to be able to run in CICD or on request on PRs if they are too slow for systematic run. \n\nThen there is the company's staging environment that is fed by upstream teams with simulated data representative of production, and the same code and tools as production. There we can run our code in the same tool environment as production. \n\n> Upstream tables aren’t versioned\n\nWhat does this mean? If the code that creates/alter these tables is not versioned, that's pretty bad. The process needs to go through a proper CICD.

What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?\n\nUpstream table changes need to be communicated. This is not negotiable for platform stability and needs to be taken to engineering management. They need to establish a proper channel, for example: ticket (with PR links), documentation page, announcement in dedicated channel, regular meetings to plan changes and exceptional meetings for emergencies. A team should only be allowed to deploy such change once the communication process has been respected and the reception by downstream teams has been confirmed.  \nThis also means the upstream team is responsible for updating staging so it matches the change and you can properly test it in staging.",

There are some rare scenarios where it doesn't happen all the time - like the upstream system *never* changes, or is run by the exact same team doing the ETL work.  But in almost all other cases it's a complete mess.\n\nPlus there's other bad cases like where the upstream system adds a new column, you're using a solution that provides some schema evolution capabilities like Fivetran, so your ETL process just silently ingests the new column - but that new column isn't actually used by anything - and it now has 50% of your costs allocated to it from a different column everyone is using.\n\n> What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?\n\nData contracts & publishing domain objects:\n\n   * Upstream system publishes a \"domain object\" any time any field within the domain changes.  A domain is a higher-level abstraction like user, customer, invoice, supplier, etc.  And the domain object is typically a denormalized collection of related info.\n   * The domain object could be published to a messaging system, which could get ingested directly, or simply redirect messages into a file on say s3.  Or maybe the upstream system just writes all pending domain objects to s3 every 5-15 minutes.\n   * And the domain object is locked down with a data contract.  This contract is kept in version control, and both the source & target teams can use it to validate all data being sent & received.  I prefer jsonschema for this, and use it to identify columns, their types, as well as info like min/max values, min/max string length, null rules, enumerated values, regex formats, etc, etc, etc.",

We use either JSON (easy to edit manually) or AVRO (Kafka source), depending on the source of the flow we are testing. If the test flow's source is a table, the source file is turned into the table format we use first by the test logic.  \nUsually, data comes from staging since we already have representative but fake data there that is safe to keep in Git. It is potentially manually modified to add some cases that we need to test.\n\n> Also, just to confirm my understanding around environments: staging is what you always reference in test (and possibly dev, depending on your answer above), correct? \n\n1. When a team member submits a PR, it is required for them to prove that their change works in staging, typically sharing a successful flow run with the different run modes (normal scheduled run, backfill, or whatever specific parameter). That's really the minimum that should be expected for any change affecting flows.  \n2. For any function that does not rely on integration with external tools, we require the very classic unit tests. Those take a few ms each, so they are always triggered in our CI tool whenever a commit is pushed.\n3. A bit more recently, we have been adding \"local flow tests\" that can be run locally on our laptop and in the CI tool. This means we can validate that the flow logic works locally, and we are able to use a local debugger, which is pretty amazing for ETL work. We can also run it on request with a comment during the PR review; the results are written in the commit status on Github. We don't run those automatically at every commit push because they have quite some overhead to set up a local flow environment (especially Spark's overhead); they take something like 30 to 90 s for each flow. This was a lot of work to create, but it is now extremely valuable. \n\n\n> If that’s the case, then in theory our “test” environment should fail, and alert us, whenever there’s a schema change that isn’t properly communicated. Is that the right way to think about it?\n\nFor the tests to fail due to a schema change, the test data needs to have changed accordingly. For local tests, your team controls the test data, so it cannot have changed if you didn't know.  \n\nWhere it should fail is during the staging run, if the upstream team has correctly updated the data they are responsible for in staging and actually ran their change in staging. So, it still relies on the upstream team doing its job properly, which requires engineering management to enforce it if they are not doing it by themselves.\n\nIf it failed in staging, you can check how the data changed and modify your local test data to cover the new situation. But, you shouldn't have to find it by yourself like this; the chances to miss the changes even if it is in staging are still too high, for example, if it only affects a small subset of records.\n\nSo again, the most important solution is that there should be a mandatory communication channel for them to announce the change and collect the confirmation of the downstream teams. At minimum, something like a Slack message where downstream teams are pinged. With this information you can at minimum make sure your staging run goes through the change. If you have a local test, you can then directly modify your local test data and comfortably check on your laptop with a debugger what the consequence is for your flow. \n\nIdeally, there is the data contract system mentioned by others. Every schema is versioned in Git; it serves as the reference for every dependent project, and any change needs to be approved by the downstream teams in the PR. But I think very few companies have this level of maturity; even in my current company, where it is already very high considering the quality of testing I have described above, it is only partially implemented.\n\n> - Upstream Staging -> Our Dev/Test\n> - Upstream Prod -> Our Prod\n\nThe staging environment is supposed to be shared by all teams that have dependencies, so the integration of the different projects can be tested just like in production, except the data is a simulation. The only difference in terms of code is that staging may have the newer version of the code that is being tested. So it should be like this:\n\n- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects\n- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects\n\nLocal testing is a separate environment that is defined in your Git repositories, so you wouldn't expect the upstream team to modify it, just like you wouldn't expect them to change the code you own. \n\n- Local test environment (only your teams): your test data (possibly based on staging upstream data) -> Your project -> your data\n- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects\n- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects\n\n\nYour company could have another shared testing environment before staging. I can imagine a \"testing\" environment being for unstable testing; expect things to break regularly because teams will test early versions, and \"staging\" for stable testing; things should not break too much so you can test in production-like conditions.  \nIn our case, our local/staging/production is covering what we need, so I wouldn't see the point of having a 4th environment.",

So that change shouldn't go to production until you've written, tested, and deployed the code that's ready to support that version of the contract.\n\n> Do multiple versions of the actual data actually get published based on old/new contracts?\n\nNot that I've seen.  What I generally see is that the consumer can support multiple versions of the contract.  Hopefully, not an infinite number, often just 2-3.",

ETL Pipeline: Ingest data from public APIs (maybe weather, finance, or social media), clean and transform it, and store it in a cloud database. Visualize results or build a simple dashboard to display insights.\n2. Data Warehouse Project: Set up a mini data warehouse using open source tools (like PostgreSQL, DuckDB, or even cloud warehouses if allowed by your school). Populate it with multiple sources and practice schema design, partitioning, and basic analytics queries.\n3. Batch vs Stream: Compare batch ETL (e.g., with Airflow or Prefect) and simple streaming (Kafka or just a basic pub/sub) on a dataset. Even if you use sample scripts, explaining the trade-offs is valuable.\n4. End-to-End Analytics: Choose a topic (like campus resource usage or student performance if you can get anonymized data), gather, clean, and enrich the data, and display it in a lightweight front-end. This gives you a taste of the full stack.\n\nDon’t worry about building something massive; depth of understanding matters more than shiny complexity. If your team isn’t super technical, you might look into tools that let you build simple frontends for your data without writing a whole web app from scratch; it’s a nice touch to showcase your processed data to non-technical folks.\n\nBest of luck on your capstone!",

While books & courses are great, practical experience will teach you better than any of those. I'd suggest just look into your current company and see how data engineering is applied there. Consume your DEs' entire docs to get ideas or get shadowing sessions. This is what I did to transition, I just reviewed what I already know from experience. If you can transfer internally, that would be better.\n\nUnderstand your ETL/ELT pipelines like how data moves from point A to B (from source system up to the analytics layer) in your company. Learn how & why certain tools are being used in the system, their trade-offs in terms of scalability, costs, reliability, their impact, etc. Software engineering plus systems analysis & design concepts help a lot like SDLC & Agile methodologies for example.\n\nIf you're proficient with SQL and be able to explain different situations such as knowing when to use subquery vs CTE, view vs materialized view, handling duplicate records, optimizing queries etc. then you're more or less good to go. Knowledge of Python/PySpark helps a lot as well. Understand and differentiate between a data warehouse, data mart, data lake, data lakehouse, dim vs fact tables, normalization vs denormalization, file formats (csv, tsv, parquet, avro), etc. Knowledge of cloud also helps.

There's some tools out there that claim to do this but i havent used them. You can probably guess what part is killing performance looking at the types of joins (broadcast joins are fast vs big fact to fact table joins will be slower, sometimes range joins can be slow if they're not optimized, etc), knowing your data and how it's being joined will be super helpful too.",

I have also been involved with several data warehouse builds in my career.  You are thinking about it in the right way as this stuff is always a series of tradeoffs.  What does feature X do for us, how long will it take and what value does it provide?\n\nIt seems like you are vague on requirements, which is the norm, so I would focus on that as it will inform what you build (i.e. you will be rebuilding and reloading if you miss a bunch of stuff).  Start with what you have today and come up with a list of columns and the concepts they related to as a starting point.  I would also get with whoever does the budget modeling / FP&A work for the company as they know the KPIs and drivers of the business, which you will have to align to.  At the end you should have a list of columns or metrics with a domain and column (e.g. domain is customer and columns for account number, name, address, etc).\n\nThen start with that as you talk to other stakeholders.  A good meeting might involve say someone from marketing who knows the views they  want to see, a data analyst who might know what columns/calculations are involved in producing that view and then you and your DA can bump that off against your model.  It's easier to ask them for what's missing rather than come to them with a blank sheet of paper.  Also get a sign off from the department because they will inevitably come back with 20 more requests on the week you drop the finished product.  The DA should be able to work from that artifact.\n\nThe data model is important because ideally you want one data source that feeds 80% or more of your data requests.  This ensures that data is consistent across all reporting and dashboards as it uses the same core data and calculations.  If there is an error in a calculation, you can change it in one place and it propagates across all the dependencies.  If you build custom data models for each dashboard or request, then you can have inconsistencies where the developer used the wrong formula, or when you need to make a change you have to find it and change it dozens to hundreds of times.\n\nIn terms of important things I would say requirements is first (though you can often do this incrementally), then figuring out your infrastructure.  Like what is your approach to building pipelines and does it provide velocity to develop, is it maintainable, observable, etc.  Does your data platform align well with the likely use cases you know about?  You sort of need this initial planning in place to get going, but afterward you can build incrementally as MVPs or by data subject to show off progress.\n\nYou need to balance delivering value and insight to the business with the necessary things to support a robust platform.  Things like automations should be considered, but it's a question of prioritization.  How much time does the automation save vs time to build right now?  Can we defer it without major consequences?  Which ones are the priority?  Can we produce demoable work each sprint or quarter to show progress, and better if the platform can be partially used to deliver value ahead of being fully fleshed out.\n\n\\-sorry for  the essay.",

A lot of people who get bored in senior analyst roles feel that same shift, less enjoyment from “telling the story” and more from building the systems and models that make everything work. If you enjoy data modeling, Python, and building tools that reduce friction for others, that’s already a big piece of modern DE work. Many DE roles today are less about pure infra and more about enabling analytics at scale, which fits your background well. You’re not starting from zero, you’re just moving closer to the plumbing. On the ITIL / process side yes, it’s more structured, and that can be frustrating at first. The upside is fewer fire drills and clearer ownership the downside is slower change and more ceremony. People coming from “fast and loose” teams usually struggle with pace more than the work itself, but most adapt once they see the stability benefits. As for frustrations, you’ve already named most of them unclear requirements, data quality issues, tribal knowledge, and legacy decisions you inherit. The flip side is that fixing those things is often exactly what makes the job satisfying. If building and improving systems is what energises you right now, the secondment sounds like a low-risk way to test whether DE clicks long term",

If you want to keep it free, there are open source ones used by actual companies like Apache Airflow. You can use this on the open data sources mentioned. \n\nI’ve been through many DE and DE role adjacent interviews, and SQL almost always comes up. Know some technicals like order of execution in a SQL query, CTE’s, Window functions. I have never been asked any python technicals (have done a few OA’s though that are typical leetcode style, but these were not the norm), aside from Spark concepts.\n\nWhen you scour job postings, you’ll see a company can be entirely on Azure, AWS, Databricks, Snowflake, etc. But I also see a lot of postings that are Airflow, DBT + Snowflake for example. Airflow and DBT are free and you can use a local RDBMS instead of a cloud DW for a project to teach you ETL concepts and data orchestration, warehousing, modeling.\n\nGet good at one stack and apply for jobs that use those. Before your resume gets to a human, an ATS will scan for all the relevant key words in your resume with the JD. I have only worked with Azure & Databricks so I immediately stop reading a JD when it’s asking for AWS or Snowflake. In your resume, emphasize the results per experience (ex. optimized X by Y%) first, responsibilities second. I think you can definitely give your many different roles to chatgpt and ask it to reframe those roles to be more DE-specific.\n\nAs for certs, I have noticed consulting roles seem to value those more than product company roles. If you’re fine with spending money, a Databricks DE associate cert, AWS DE, etc could make you stand out more as an entry level candidate. If you want to work with the cloud, AWS is more commonly used over Azure and GCP. Having worked in consulting before, the certs are how the firm pitches you to clients and gets you staffed (and therefore make money off of you).\n\nLastly, use Linkedin and have all the relevant DE skills and experiences on your profile. It’s a lot easier for recruiters to find you first instead of the other way around. \n\nGood luck and I’m happy to answer any more questions you may have!",

We had this sprawling CRM system that had been customized over the years by like 5 different consultants none of whom seemed to talk to each other. Marketing was using one set of IDs for customers sales had another and finance was just throwing their hands up in the air. Trying to get a single reliable customer view was a nightmare. We spent weeks just trying to map out the different entities and how they related to each other. It felt like unraveling a giant knotted ball of yarn. And then of course once we thought we had it figured out someone would drop a bomb like Oh yeah that table We stopped using that three years ago but nobody told anyone. The worst part was the constant requests for data pulls. Sales would want a list of customers with X Y and Z marketing needed a segment with A B and C and the data team was stuck writing custom SQL queries all day long. It was completely unsustainable and we never got to work on anything strategic. What finally saved us was this virtual data platform we implemented. The thing that impressed us most was its ability to automatically discover all these hidden relationships between entities that would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. The AI engine identified and resolved data quality issues too duplicate entries mismatched data types the whole nine yards. We didnt have to move or duplicate any data either which was a huge plus for security and compliance. Then once the data was unified we started building no-code ETL processes to push cleansed data to the different systems and to our data warehouse. That part really freed up our data team. Instead of constantly fulfilling ad-hoc requests we could focus on building actual data products and analytics. Seriously the reduction in headaches alone was worth the cost. I know it sounds like Im selling you something here and I kinda am. The company that makes the platform has a referral program and yeah Id get a kickback if you ended up using them. But honestly based on what youve described I genuinely think it could solve your problems. Id be happy to make an introduction if you want to explore it further no pressure either way. Just let me know if you think a connection would be helpful.",

Those \"let's just do x for now\" always bite you in the ass. It seems today's strategy is to limp things along until the business is fed up enough to wait for an entire redesign. Then the tech team and manager are replaced and you don't even fix all the tech debt because the people aware of it left! Tech debt NEEDS to be tracked and talked about regularly. Where I'm at they pushed anyone technical out of those discussions and it's only been band and worse. The consulting team they brought in pointed the finger at the data/tech team, promoted mid level managers with no tech background into those leadership positions (now they have to lean on the consultants for EVERYTHING AND EVERY DECISION! So much wasted money and time but theres no one technical to explain anything, even WHY things are as messy as they are. \n\nI saw this happening and tried to get my boss to understand what was happening. Instead he fought her about design differences instead of division of responsibilities.

The big mindset shift is that schemas tell you how tables relate, but they don’t tell you how data changes. Streams only show what Snowflake sees as new or updated rows since the last run, so if the source system quietly edits an old record, you’ll never see that unless you deliberately go back and reprocess it. That’s why a lot of pipelines use a lookback window (reloading the last N days every run) or just full refresh smaller tables. If the source doesn’t give you a reliable “last updated” field or CDC feed, you kind of have to assume old data can change and design around that. For tables without dates, truncating by time doesn’t really make sense. Those usually get merged by a stable business key, or fully rebuilt if they’re small enough. The “forked” tables usually follow the lifecycle of the parent record, not the ingestion date. In general, when you’re trying to understand ingestion, I’d ask “how does this data change in the source system?” rather than “how do these tables join.” Once you answer that, the truncate vs merge decisions start to feel a lot more obvious",

From the outside it looks less like “networking is unimportant” and more like Fabric being designed as a very opinionated SaaS first, and an Azure-native platform second. MPEs feel awkward because they’re basically abstracting VNET concepts into something Fabric can control end to end. That gives Microsoft tighter isolation, simpler UX for less technical users, and easier multi-tenant guarantees, but it also means every new resource type needs explicit support. That doesn’t scale well for power users who expect networking to just work like it does in Synapse or Databricks. The slow rollout of MPE types is probably a mix of security review, product prioritization, and yes, commercial incentives. Fabric clearly pushes “bring data into OneLake” patterns first, and anything that bypasses that path feels like a second-class citizen. Whether that’s intentional cost pressure or just product focus, the effect is the same for customers. I don’t think it’s a lack of technical capability so much as Fabric still deciding who it’s really for. Right now it feels optimized for managed ingestion and analytics inside the ecosystem, not for complex private networking scenarios. Until that changes, Fabric is hard to recommend as a full replacement for Synapse/Databricks if deep network control is a requirement. Curious if others have found workarounds or just accepted this as a current limitation",

It is frightening that they are so convinced their customers want to abondon PaaS for an expensive and inflexible SaaS.

So it's O(1) time relative to table size. \n\nObviously a PITA to do this if you had 100s of tables, but since you only have two tables, dead easy. \n\nIn theory you could query the metadata directly to get this programmatically. It's one of the sys views, but I never remember which.\n\nOther than checking table counts, I guess the important question is how is the server migration being performed? If it's a backup of the old DBs being restored onto the new server, then this is a pretty bombproof approach, so long as:\n\n- writes to the DB have been completely stopped first (e.g. put DB into read only mode first)\n- the backup is run with the checksum option\n\nSo in this case, I'd focus more on making sure the process for the migration has been thought out fully - then you don't have a lot of validation to do. Otherwise you're just validating that a widely used quarter-century-old enterprise RDBMS doesn't have a certain type of seriously fundamental bug.\n\nIf the data migration is happening via some bespoke approach then you do need to validate further. But you first need to ask why they're not doing the more obvious simple backup/restore. \n\nFor further validation, you really need to take the hit on slow scan queries and make sure the time needed for that is built into the migration plan.\n\nGathering stats is the right approach but I'd focus on sum() of numerical columns that mean something to the business (currency values, quantities, durations, etc). Just sum the whole table with no group by. It doesn't have to be a useful KPI /metric that way, it's just a number that would be very sensitive to anything going wrong in the migration. And if all those numbers are unchanged, you can be pretty confident that whatever you use the data for will still work.",

This of course won't fly for many leet code problems, and some platforms don't even allow one to use many functional languages and set hard time requirements for execution time of the solutions. Parallelism and code cleanliness is given no thought. You can write all shit code with single letter variable names mutating shit everywhere, and it will accept your solution more likely than a very clean functional solution, that is trivially parallelizable and would scale (if ever needed).\n\nLooking at LC mastery mostly selects for people, who have ground that stuff hard and memorized that stuff (which won't be of too much use on the job for actual real world problems) or people, who think that this kind of procedural mutating way of programming and the typically associated languages are the end all be all, and have limited experience with other things.\n\nI much prefer advent of code (AoC) style puzzles, where you can use any language you want, and you just need a number as the solution.\n\nI feel like solving AoC puzzles has improved my ability to solve problems the functional way, even, if they at first seem to not lend themselves well to the functional paradigm. I found some pretty neat functional solutions at times. Like for example using bitboards represented by numbers as an underlying data structure and boosting performance of my previously too slow solution by a factor of more than 1000. I had to sometimes write functional versions of well known procedural algorithms. Things like A-star algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm, depth-first-search, breadth-first search. I've had to interpret how they work and how I can replace data structures they rely on with functional versions, and how I represent a graph or create it in a functional way.",

You've taken two entire years of classes in a CS program. The only thing you've learned is basic C++. You didn't learn any of the other things that are normally taught in the first two years like patterns, web development, databases, intro to security, or general theory. Of course, programs can vary. I haven't seen a single one that's like \"C++ 101 and nothing else lmao.\"\n\nSecondly, you had to pass those classes to be going into your third year. So you passed a C++ class. You certainly had to build basic programs. You were able to follow guidelines, design by the prescribed principles, and received a passing grade. You also took an OOP class and passed it. Now you can't make your own basic programs at home. This does not make sense.\n\nThirdly, you're just figuring this out after 2 years. You paid money to be bullied and ridiculed for 2 years. You didn't go to your counselor or program director to ask if this was normal. You just dealt with the abuse, passed your classes, then immediately forgot what you learned. This is not believable.\n\nOf course, you could be telling the truth. Maybe you have an undiagnosed learning disability. Maybe you ended up at a particularly cruel CS program that only teaches C++.

        "body": "You are making several mistakes in your learning:\n\n+ *learning but not really practicing along* - you maybe do the course projects, but never any small and simple projects of your own that you then gradually grow into larger and larger ones\n+ *giving up when things get more difficult* - the amount of times you have given up shows an attitude problem - you need to fix this. You need to push through obstacles or you will never make it\n+ *jumping around* - this goes in line with the former bullet. You give up and seek the next shiny thing, try it, give up, and so on\n+ *listening to influencers* - they can safely be ignored.\n+ *you try to learn too much at once*\n+ I also bet that you have run through tutorial after tutorial without even trying to build small and simple projects on your own. Projects are like training for a marathon. You don't start trying to run the full distance. You start with short distances and gradually ramp up. Same for projects. You start small and simple and with every project you build you increase scope, size, and complexity.\n\n\nYour problem with Python's whitespace rules shows a lack of self discipline. You should actually in languages that don't enforce proper indentation always properly format your code so that it stays readable. Actually, I think that Python is a great entry language because the syntax and vocabulary are fairly simple, but also because it enforces *discipline* with its whitespace rules (which is something a programmer has to apply and adopt).\n\nThere are a few skills that one should really obtain over their time, as you mentioned *git*, *DSA*, sooner or later a make/build tool, but in all honesty, most of them come later in your learning. The only exception I would put down is git. Git is a life-changer in programming. It is a great backup tool on one hand, and on the other hand it should encourage you to play around, to experiment, to try and break things because it always gives you a fallback.\n\nTo give you *some* credit, maybe you used the wrong resources to learn. If a resource doesn't force you to do the thinking, to do the programming and instead presents you with the solution, it is bad. First and foremost, *you* need to do the work. That's why, for Java, we generally recommend the MOOC [Java Programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi) and for Python the similar MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi), both from the University of Helsinki. These are 100% free, textual, extremely practice oriented courses that give you the tools you need upfront in the text before (not necessarily directly preceding) the exercises and then force you to do the exercises on your own with an online checker. They are both top quality and proper first semesters of Introduction to Computer Science.\n\nYou mentioned DSA. These are later subjects. They are best learnt when you already have some programming experience through your own (not tutorial) projects so that you can draw relations.\n\nYet, overall, it doesn't seem that the problem is the actual *learning*, the problem is your attitude towards it: you give up as soon as things go rough, you jump around, you never finish anything. As long as you don't change these things, you will not succeed in anything.\n\nWith your current approach, you will not get anywhere. You need to develop persistence and a certain stubbornness to not give up as soon as things get hard. - This is not something a course can fix. This is something *you* need to fix. Also, this is not even directly related to learning programming. I would bet that this attitude applies in everything you try to learn.\n\nYou even have a classic here:\n\n> I can read code and understand examples. But I can’t build anything.\n\nTo put it in relation:\n\n> You can *read and understand* books, but could you *write* a fully developed, meaningful novel?\n\nIt's basically the same thing. The former and the latter (both for programming and authoring) are two completely different skillsets that need to be individually trained. You will never get better at programming (or writing novels) if you don't actually *write*, if you don't *practice*. Reading alone doesn't help here. It can extend your horizon, but doesn't give you the skills to directly apply it.\n\nI'd suggest that you read through some of the following threads that are very similar:\n\n+ https://redd.it/1qdfc9k\n+ https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pmzjoe/how_do_you_learn_programming/nu4ufej/\n+ https://redd.it/1pmzjoe\n+ https://redd.it/1p7bv8a\n+ https://redd.it/1oynnlv\n+ https://redd.it/1ouvtzo\n+ https://redd.it/1opcu7j\n+ https://redd.it/1on6g8o\n+ https://redd.it/1ofe87j\n\nEven though you already have some of the best books you can buy, some more suggestions:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V.

It never goes away because we don't get paid to write code or make apps, we get paid to solve novel problems that have no clear solution, decompose them until the discrete parts can be solved, and orchestrate those solutions in a way that fits the needs of the business. This usually means a LOT of initial uncertainty, and requires a lot of self-directed research and no small amount of stress and anxiety.\n\nI'm gonna be blunt with you, man.

If things get hard, use your skills to find a way through it. \n\n\nIt's okay to bounce between things, but actually commit to completing something this time.\n\n\nPython: The Python Crash Course\nWeb Dev: The Odin Project\n\n\nBoth will have you build things to learn. Have fun learning it, even if it's restarting on things you know. As you learn, try to recreate everything you see from scratch without referencing the materials. If it's still a little confusing, try to recreate different variations of things, slightly different from the source material. If you still don't get it, reference other materials for that specific topic. Don't jump around different topics and languages to give up. Use AI to help guide you through understanding things, but avoid having it solve your code. \n\n\nAvoid trying to understand and memorize every little thing, because most people don't. Keep your digging \"a single layer deep,\" keeping your questions on a Docs page as they come up, and only research it at the end of a session.\n\n\nThe moment you start feeling overwhelmed, because at this point you know the feeling, take a small break and just rest your head. Calm yourself down. Go for a walk. Avoid social media and random clips. You're not dying because your head hurts a little and you're stuck. That's just what improvement feels like. Learn to not only be comfortable with it, but enjoy the feeling, because that's what improvement feels like. It's what you want. You're just scared of it right now, so it feels like crap. \n\n\n.\n\n\nYou're not unique in your issues. A lot of people experience them and quit.\n\n\nYour past experiences weren't useless, because a lot of the clutter and fears of a complete beginner are beyond you now, even if you don't notice it. \n\n\nYou just lack the building aspect to tether all your knowledge to and continue learning from. It actually doesn't take much knowledge to start building, but it's scary when you go so long without doing it. The ones that learn fast actually start with building outright, ignoring how scary it all is, and learn what they need as they go.\n\n\nIf you want, DM me and I'll learn with you. I've been struggling as well. ",

That’s where you run into real debugging, learn how tools work together, and build confidence in production-like thinking.\n\nAlso, sharing your work (like you did) is itself observability practice , it makes your progress visible to others and invites useful feedback.

A calculator, a todo list, a basic website, a script that automates something annoying on your computer, or a very simple game.

You can reuse the language, focus on Spring Boot, REST APIs, databases, and production concepts, and become employable faster. Once you understand backend fundamentals, picking up Go later becomes much easier and much more attractive to employers.

They don't make the learner do the work and *think*. You won't learn much if the entire code is presented to you. You will only learn if someone *guides* you but you have to do the thinking and work. This distinguishes a top quality *course* from just another *\"how to create X\"* *tutorial*.\n\nOnce one has the foundation laid, e.g. through some proper *course*, it is time to throw away the training wheels and to start trying, doing things on their own. Use the documentation, use specific targeted articles, blogs, or even tutorials - but not the \"how to create X\" ones, rather some short, narrow, targeted tutorials that only cover some aspect of your project, e.g. if you want to do something with a SQLite database in Python, check for a quick tutorial (there are excellent ones) that teach you exactly that - how to connect to a database, how to create tables, how to query fields, etc.\n\nChanging your way how you approach tutorials also can help: When a concept, part is introduced, try to do it on your own first. Do not look at the presented code. Write it yourself. Play around, experiment. Once you have done it and it works or if all else fails, look at the code.

Doing pseudo code really helps with this. \n\nIf I need a variable of function explained further, I would type it into chat gpt and ask it to explain it to me like I’m a first grader. When I’m struggling with creating something, I’d first search up as much as I can on the web, and if I still can’t get it then ask chat gpt to give me hints but don’t give me the code/answer. \n\nHope this helps!",

HTB is a bit more \"try harder\" with its labs, while THM is very beginner friendly. Offensive ctfs are typically compromising a machine going from a user/service account > to root/admin account, these could be windows machines, Active Directory machines, Linux servers, web servers, even cloud environments. Great for building the hacker mindset. Defensive ctfs are all about investigation and recreating attackers steps uncovering their moves. Understanding log sources and how to properly investigate an incident. Network security operates more on the defensive side, but I know plenty of security engineers who have a base offensive skill set. You got to remember, almost everything in tech generally is connected to each other. So even your web development project with python is incredibly relevant to web security and bug bounty. Possibilities are endless if security is where you are aiming. Join the Hack the Box community if cyber interests you.",

Bugs only become easy to detect and fix when\n\n* the programmer is somewhat good at debugging and familiar with the codebase,\n* the code has been written in a way that facilitates easy debugging,\n* the infrastructure has been set up in a way that facilitates easy debugging,\n* the programmer has tools available that facilitate debugging.\n\nPeople can have different preferences for how to go about achieving these things, but they're likely to involve stuff like\n\n* [Good error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/index.html#common-message-styles)\n* Observability setups (logging, metrics, tracing)\n* Access to actual debuggers\n* Tests (both unit tests and integration tests)\n* Automated builds and common integration & testing infrastructure (to eliminate the \"it works on my machine\" situations)\n* Linters / rule engines that prevent certain code from being merged\n* Static typing and a [reliable type system](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (there are some people who swear by dynamic typing, but Typescript is gaining ground over Javascript, and it's pretty common now to have type hints and typechecking for Python too, and apparently PHP)\n* Various code architecting styles, though preferences there _really_ vary, but see e.g. \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" and \"parse, don't validate\"\n\nI.e. a lot of the work we do is done to make debugging easier, and avoid bugs reaching production in the first place.\n\nBut depending on situation and the technology involved some bugs can still be pretty hard to figure out.

You need to fix this so you can do well and build confidence. A good short book I read on this was \"How to Become A Straight A Student\", where the author basically just shares study strategies that work for each major type of course, and general advice for doing well in college. I had similar complaints until I accepted that maybe I was the problem and needed to change how I approached everything - when I did, there was a night and day difference in how well I did in all courses.\n\nArrays are fundamental. Like anything else, just spend more time working with them. A very fundamental thing in all of computing is to have a \"list\" of something, and have code that processes that list in some way.\n\n> Professors at college barely teach anymore\n\nTry not to be dependent on the quality of the professor or course. I know that can be difficult to accept. However, most of the learning is going to happen in your own time in the cycle of solving problems for HW and exam prep. And for projects, use them as practice in breaking down problems to smaller chunks that can be more easily solved (and bonus points for learning how to use a debugger and how to write basic tests that keep your projects on the rails and help you not get as bogged down when you make changes).\n\nWhen possible, use supplemental things like a REPL (node for JS, jshell for Java, etc.) or scratch files in your IDE if available, to quickly experiment with small ideas.\n\n> and they get annoyed when I ask questions\n\nthis is common. The reason they get annoyed is that people tend to ask questions before really investing any time in the assignment or embracing the struggle that is part of the learning process. How to handle this is simply to start homework as early as possible, make as much progress as possible, flag questions when they come up but move on to other stuff to keep making overall progress, then try to get help on those questions from other students or TAs before going to the professor. Try to only use the professor as a last resort, and only after you've already put in effort and can ask a clear, specific question.\n\n> self taught\n\nA way to succeed in college is to view it as self-taught, rather than as if the professor is inserting knowledge into your head. The difference is just that the material is being provided to you in a structured way according to what the university and instructors have decided is important to teach, rather than of your choosing, so you end up getting exposure to things that you might not otherwise have chosen to do, which can be good & bad. Think of instructors as _guides_ for your own learning process. Also imagine that you are a professional learner and they are a professional instructor - you are both professionals and you both have jobs to do.",

If you do less than that, you won't have the group project experience and advanced topic fundamentals to hit the ground running. You'll be competing with offshore code monkeys we can staff during US or EU business hours for under $20/hr loaded cost rate (salary, benefits, support staff, equipment, building, everything). And now, you'll be competing with Claude. May as well wait tables at that point. \n\nAt 19 years old, the best advice anyone can give you is to go to university and do an engineering or CS program. You don't have to go to MIT or Cambridge or IIT etc. If you have a four year state technical school whose program is well respected and that has a strong internship placement office, that's fine. Hiring managers nearby probably graduated from that program and will recognize the credential. Especially with AI, your goal is to be solid enough to do the job without AI so you can manage AI as though it were a junior developer. I get customer hires and sometimes staff hires that came out of these six month bootcamps and it's tedious. I'm essentially their TA/professor for what they would have learned in their first big sophomore year project practicum to say nothing of the next two years of courses. And they'll be hamstrung because no one's going to ever make them build a simple database server or webserver or memory allocation method and they'll never really understand how that works.

Moving the window one step only changes a single data point. To make the list sorted again you only need to move this specific point to the correct place. \n\nGoing a bit further into potential optimizations you can also notice that if the point that's dropping out of the window (`op`) and the point that enters the window (`np`) are both larger or smaller than the current median, the median won't change and you can just replace `op` with `np` without resorting the list. Another observation is that if `op` and `np` are on different sides of the median, you don't actually have to resort everything to rebalance both sides because the balance can be easily restored by moving one element to the correct side:\n\n* `op` < median < `np`: move the smallest element to the right the median to the left of the median; this element is now also the largest element of the left. The new median lies between this element and the new smallest element on the right side.\n\n* `op` > median > `np`: Find the biggest element on the left side and move it to the right; it's now the smallest element on the right.\n\nBy using those observations and moving from fully sorting the window to simply partitioning it you should be able to make updating it much cheaper because you no longer have to shift all elements between `op` and `np` to either the left of the right.",

And there's of course, Unreal, Godot, and other 3D engines besides Unity. \n\nAnd you can always study classic game sourcecode as many of them have been released (Wolf3D, original Doom, etc.) if you want to learn how those work (may not apply very much to today's gamedev, but everyone starts somewhere). \n\nYou can stick to making mods in the short term. The company who made Terra Invicta started as XCOM2 Mod Maker (mod was called \"Long War\"). Valve even bought a couple Half-life mods and published them back in the days. \n\nSo, what are you interested in? Pick something.",

Eventually you will want to start working with a game engine like Unity or Godot but if you try this too early it will just be overwhelming, so just work on coding first. \n\nFrom there you can learn more about the theoretical parts of game design, graphics etc etc. The Coding Adventures YouTube series is a great place to get your appetite wet for how various graphical ideas can be made with code",

His code (in java) was very weird at first: lots of methods taking and returning Map<String,Object>. I eventually figured out that as a js developer, he was not familiar with strong typing or even class type definitions. Of course JS6 and TS in particular support those, but JS does a lot with anonymous functions and weakly typed, ad-hoc key value pair objects as a programming norm. Memory management is also completely under the hood and so the whole idea of a pointer or reference type was new as well.\n\nWhere I'm going with this is, the basics translate, but I still maintain that C/C++ is great first language followed by an OO-first language like Java, Python, or C# because it makes you internalize these concepts and gets you ready to write scalable, non-browser code. I don't prefer JS as a first language because it's hard syntactically to keep track of exactly what each construct is and the patterns, while syntactically concise, can easily be confusing on those points.\n\nJS is great; learn something else too. At least get to a point where you understand the difference between a function that's a method, a class template, or an instance of a class, understand variable typing, and understand why you might want strongly typed code and by extension what the typescript project was going for and why it was widely adopted by large js code bases.",

Having something in mind you want to build gives you the motivation to keep going, even if it takes years to get there. If programming just feels like doing homework or meaningless exercises (like Path C sometimes can), I think sometimes people lose motivation before they've really gotten into it.\n\nI would say, be cautious about Unity or Godot since those are generally more 'intermediate' than beginner level. Your intuition to start with something like Ren'Py is a good idea. I'd also recommend Game Maker since it's even easier to get started with something fun/playable (though it uses a slightly weird programming language that's not useful anywhere else). Pygame and Love2D are also popular although maybe a little outdated at this point.",

So we need to break that problem down.\n\nWhen the program isn't doing what you expect, put a 'print (whatever\\_variable)' followed by an 'exit' and run the program again.  See what the variable looks like at that point.  If it is what you expect it to be, then move the 'debug' statements down one line and see if the program is doing what you expect on the next line.  At what point the program's output diverges from what you think it should be doing, that is the point that is worth studying closer.\n\nThen just consider that little piece of program code and look up syntax and research what the command does until you understand it, and fix the issue, and move on to the next line.\n\nWork it out like that.  You need to understand how the 'wires' connect together, so to speak, before you get to the real fun part, of connecting bigger components together like graphics and saving files and using networking and such.  Just take it slow and give yourself some patience to look at the small problems.\n\nIt's like math class.  There is a reason that math classes spend awhile on the fundamentals.

Maybe the problem is that you try to \"translate\" your code. It's probably better to not just translate it line by line but to think about what objects there will be and how they communicate. Calling a method is how that works in OOP. And they can have side effects. \n\nThere are books. Some of them are bad many are outdated. The problem is mostly that they spend a lot of time on inheritance of state because it's so problematic. That chapter has to be in the book, but it should just be about what you prevent as much as possible. And beginners think because there's so much about it in the book it  must be important. \n\nYou probably need a type for each expression in your syntax tree. You could use an abstract class as a base that has a field for the token(s) from the tokenizer. But you really don't need this. Just design each class as a final class and it's a lot simpler.

A lot of the “name vibe” you want can come from rules, phoneme patterns, and weighted randomness, and you will learn faster by building a baseline you can compare against.\n\nIf you do want ML, the roadmap I would follow is: get comfortable in Python first, then learn how to prep text data, then try a simple character-level model that generates outputs conditioned on your input root. Start small with a dataset where you have pairs like (root, modern name) and ignore multi-step history at first. Once that works, you can add intermediate forms as extra training examples or as a multi-stage pipeline.\n\nThe hardest part will be the dataset, not the model. Etymology data is messy and sparse, and “multiple steps through history” is basically asking for aligned sequences across languages and time. I would prototype with whatever clean pairs you can get, then iterate. If you can make a dumb version that produces plausible names, you will be 90 percent of the way there.",

It places restrictions on the object which can be used to ensure you don't do things you shouldn't with it, and can be used to refer to automatically allocated objects.\n\nYou can pass a unique_ptr, the implication being that ownership is handed to the callee. Or const unique_ptr, meaning the callee can use and modify the object, but not move ownership to something else.\n\nYou can pass by shared_ptr, ownership is shared and lifetime managed by the pointer. I rarely used these. There are also weak_ptrs but I've not yet had to use them.\n\nSometimes it's perfectly valid to just pass a copy too.\n\nI try to avoid using raw pointers in c++ unless forced to, e.g. using a posix or third party C API, and if given one, I'll try and wrap them in a unique_ptr with custom deleter where and as soon as possible, so I don't forget to clean them up.

You can absolutely do so studying computer science as well, but math teaches you how to analyze data, propose a testable and predictive model, and then to use that model to evaluate its efficacy.\n\nWith regards to practicing when it comes to programming, write out the strategy your are thinking of using before you just jump in and start coding: that way, you can see that your logic is sound and covers all cases in a way that is general enough that you don't have to write code to accommodate huge numbers of exceptions / corner cases.",

If you change one of those files (a .css file in your case) and save it, it just gets saved to the drive. \n\nWeb site files get read by browsers, and the browsers do whatever the files say: show some text and images and apply css rules to make them look the way you want.\n\nBut the browser doesn't fetch the web site files you just saved **unless you tell it to.** \n\nAfter you change your .css file, try **holding the shift key and pressing the refresh button** in Edge. It's the little circle at the upper left of the Edge window.  That tells Edge to reload the HTML file it's showing and all the linked images, .css files, .js files, and other objects.\n\nOr **hold the Shift key and press F5**. That does the same thing. It's what I do.\n\nThere are software solutions to make Edge (or other browsers) automatically refresh themselves when a file changes. \n\nBut, with respect I suggest you do not use such a solution until you thoroughly understand how the browser works in this business of needing to re-fetch files you have changed on your drive.

A base interface for the shared fields, then two interfaces that extend it, makes the differences explicit and easier to reason about. Marking lots of fields as optional works, but it gets messy fast and weakens type safety you end up constantly checking if things exist. With separate interfaces (ideally as a union), TypeScript can actually help you narrow types and catch mistakes. Optional fields are fine when something is genuinely optional, not when it depends on which response you got",

You already have the beginning and size, and here you're decrementing that in addition to incrementing the pointer. Offsetting into an array vs moving a pointer into it is a very old debate that I'm not convinced was ever *particularly* important as long as memory access happens the same (e.g. moving linearly through memory despite multidimensional subscripting, same as pinter increment).",

Even for a multi-dimensional array that is guaranteed to be contiguous, an array is a higher order type than raw machine memory, with semantics that are enforced by the COMPILER, not the machine. You violate bounds and aliasing rules, which the compiler doesn't check for you - because it correctly ASSUMES you're writing well defined behavior and you wouldn't intentionally violate the language rules you're personally responsible for. The compiler is going to optimize assuming correct code, and access past the bounds can blow up in your face in interesting ways.\n\nUB is no joke, it's how Zelda and Pokemon are famous for bricking the Nintendo DS when glitch-hacking.

It also asks for an unnecessary addition on every loop iteration. The compiler will probably optimize that out, but textually you're expressing something different from what you actually mean. Your loop should EITHER go until the pointer reaches some limiting address value, OR until some count is reached. For what you're doing, choose the count by comparing N to zero.\n\n\n* The variable names are unhelpful. What is N? By convention it looks like the array size, but it only means that at the start of the loop. It's actually the number of items remaining to be visited. And what is A? It's not the address of an array A, it's the address of an element of that array.\n\n\n* The empty initialization of the for loop means you're expressly designing this code to leave artifacts available for the rest of the block. Sometimes that's useful, but not here. Those artifacts are A, pointing just past the last element of the array, and N, which will by definition be zero. Neither has any useful meaning, so it would be better to make them local to the For loop.",

        "body": "TLDR: The reality is most starting out heavily lack basic DSA or basic language functionality like stacks, heaps, and virtual space. There are countless things to learn but overall I recommend advancing in DSA and don't feel rushed to know everything. Take your time deeply understanding the simple stuff. Ask questions where things are assumed and seem obvious. If you can really feel what's going on it will stick better. If you're going to Leetcode try to stay in a particular topic for a while and avoid spreading your learning too thin across many different challenges back to back.\n\nI was in and out of university for a while and in between completed Coding Dojo Full Stack Development (don't recommend), made a bunch of projects and eventually a successful app on iOS and Android. You might already know many of these topics but this is what I find useful.\n\nWhat I learned is that anything.js (edit I mean most .js solutions, not literally a project called anything.js lol) React, Angular, etc. these full stack web frameworks are constantly changing and new trendy APIs are always coming. Many new APIs are made when someone has some slight problem with the existing options. The right way to use them imo is to know the good general fundamentals like CRUD, validations, DB servers and back end controllers for them, MVC structures, dynamic pages and templates and when you come across some new API you must use that's the only time to get into the specifics and spend time on it - when you need to.\n\nLeetcode is good with the right mindset. You can spend too much time on topics that don't improve your skills that much or focusing on the difficulty more than what you're actually learning. Every programmer should strive to be solid in DSA. Focus on things like arrays, binary trees, string modification and linked lists. Take your time to know the little things well. Ask AI for small learning project ideas and when you don't know something syntax or language specific don't ask AI but check the documentation because there you will be surprised at when else you come across or multiple examples of using a function. Try to solve the Skyline problem. The skill level rating shouldn't get in the way of what you want to learn. If knowing how to solve that problem advances you then just take your time on it and try to have solid knowledge in the small steps. If you learn how every little part of a single problem takes all day when you could've done a bunch of random ones to feel more comfortable in the language, it's fine because the former will stick with you.\n\nMaybe do a simple learning project in hash maps, or make a multi multi level index database with JSON files and JS and see how you can optimize it. Take a JSON file with test data and make a function that splits it to 3 files where the first is an index, and the next two is part A and B. See how you can modify the function to take number of files/splits and how to split them. For learning I try to keep my attention in the same realm for a while so don't jump around too much or do a project that spreads your attention thin.\n\nThose skills will follow you everywhere you go but a new JS API probably won't help you with much else.\n\nKnow the topics that are needed but programmers starting out struggle with or are frequently missed either by curriculum or not needing it in a specific language:\n\n\\- What is a stack and heap?\n\n\\- What is a virtualized address?\n\n\\- Asymmetric vs symmetric encryption, passkey generation, basic structure of encrypting and decrypting data and how to ensure you're doing it safely.\n\n\\- When to use structured SQL data or NoSQL. What are the pros and cons? You can use both in an app so what do you want strict and what should be flexible?\n\n\\- Allocation for data types.\n\nRelating to networking I don't know what fundamental work is needed I haven't dealt with that much yet, but less low level topics are solutions that reduce data redundancy, but also latency which can fight redundancy, and the size of transfers all while keeping security which can also fight latency for users. We are producing and sharing data in a rapidly growing rate as the corporate world wants everything cloud based and as AI does what it do. Any little changes to make an app function just as fast and secure but with less data being transferred or stored is very valuable. AI companies will be considering things like Azure Cosmos DB or something equivalent/better. I won't comment much on AI I don't know where that is going.",

For that you usually pick Unity or Unreal, so that means C# or C++.\n\nAs far as C++ being difficult to learn, that's somewhat true, but Unreal Engine does simplify it a bit by being opinionated. They have a way of doing things. And it has libraries that handle the hard stuff like memory management for you.\n\nTake a look at Unity if C# is more your speed. It's a lot \"cleaner\" than C++ IMO.

It does not particularly matter if it is vscode, Visual Studios, CLion, Eclipse, vim, emacs, whatever...\n2. Be comfortable with setting up your local environment so that you can successfully compile and run code locally, using a compiler such as GCC, Clang, or MSVC.\n3. Understand how to download, setup, and use 3rd party libraries within your project. This can indeed be non-trivial, especially given the relative immaturity/messiness of C++'s packaging ecosystem compared to other programming languages. (Installing libraries can be tricky in C/C++; newer and more modern languages took note and added in better built-in support for it.) But if you plan on writing C++ professionally, it's something you must become familiar with, for better or for worse.\n\nNote that:\n\n1. Pretty much no employer will let you use an online IDE. It's pretty questionable from a security standpoint (if you use a free editor) or a cost standpoint (if the company pays for it). The overwhelming expectation is that you use a local editor of some sort.\n2. Most employers (and open-source projects) will already have the project set up, and have a recommended workflow. In practice, this _can_ save you the hassle of figuring out how to wire everything up from scratch.\n3. That said, employers will still expect you to be familiar with how to use the toolchain of your primary programming language, especially to complete basic tasks such as setting up and using a new library. It would be a bad look if you struggle with this sort of task.",

At least 2024 year's IntelliJ and PyCharm do not have. Haven't updated both to the latest version. Yes, it is possible to use AI plugins and such, but by default the thing that we understand as an \"AI\" is not turned on. Yes, the IDE tells if you have syntax errors and code smell (bad coding practices) and is context aware in terms of indexing existing code and libraries but besides that it does not behave like a ChatGPT or such.\n\nYes, you might have to figure it out how to use WebStorm (or any other Jetbrains tool) on your own as in the course they might tell how to do the exercises in Visual Studio Code, but other than difference between tools, the coding part is still the same.\n\nAnd I do recommend to switch over to Linux. As a beginner there is not much difference between Windows and Linux, but on a more advanced level Linux is more user-friendly for software developers. In Windows you have to get stuff working with WSL and not always it works. In Linux things work out of the box.",

The image is loading  \n2a. The correct image has been loaded  \n2b. The correct image couldn't be loaded  \n3.

        "body": "> I am struggling with creating linkedlist manually, how bad is that ? \n\nIt sounds like you're a programming student trying to learn structured thinking for the first time. This is typical. Your peers are all struggling at it, too. Even your peers who have prior programming experience are getting challenged in ways they've never had before.\n\nYou're in good company and doing just fine.\n\n> I was doing jsut fine until i started this , and its all a turn off\n\nYou're used to things coming easily to you. You've never actually been challenged before. I bet you've found school to be droll up to this point.\n\nAnd now that you finally have a subject and a teacher that's meeting you academically WHERE YOU ARE, you don't like it? This is actually very common to people who have had an easy academic experience. You have to choose to rise to the occasion, because your alternative is to run from it and SETTLE for something easier. You'd be hiding from the world. You'd be hiding from reality, because college isn't the end - it's just the start.\n\nYou're probably not going to like this, but in the real world, you're not graded, you're judged. Every day is a test. No one knows what the right answer is, and that is because there are no answers, merely the best explanation in the room at the time. No right or wrong, just good enough to ship.\n\nNo one knows what they're doing and everyone is figuring it out as they go. And you can go find a different subject that falls in your lap, but no one is hiring for someone who just does the same shit all day, every day...\n\nExcept accountants. Accounting is weird. Human calculators, that's all you are...\n\n> is it really simpler than what i think? \n\nSimpler than this? Hardly. You've just about got the simplest linked list you can make. Your code looks like someone who wrote a linked list for the first time. That's fine. Does it do linked list things? Is it the best you can do? Then there's no reason your teacher wouldn't give you an A.\n\n> i dont have a programmer s brain >? \n\nI dunno, man, you've demonstrated a working linked list.\n\nLet me tell you a (short) story. Circa 2005, I interviewed a PhD, he wrote his thesis on linked lists. Ok, buddy, you know C, you wrote the book on linked lists - code one for me in C...\n\nHe couldn't do it. Not even with help. A comp-sci PhD is 5-6 years, typically - and what did this guy have to show for it? I don't begrudge a smart guy, an ideas guy - he can certainly think at a higher level than anyone else, but that he neglected the practicals and tangibles... In essence, he failed to articulate his ideas. It makes me suspect he was gaming the doctoral program for the title, which does happen. Again - not stupid, not a cheater, but thinking he was going to leave academia and enter the industry, he missed the forest for the trees. He was purely focused on publishing.\n\nAh well. You can do more than a PhD can, and you've proven it. I think you're doing just fine. I want you to celebrate the JOY that it is that there's something you don't know, and you have to find your own way to A solution, SOME solution, in a world of no right answers. Now do it again. And again. And again... College is where you will experience some of the most rapid and focused personal growth in all your life. Revel in it, because it's going to end, and you're going to miss it, and also, this is going to help set your personality for the rest of your life - because THAT window closes around 26.\n\n---\n\nContinued...",

In C++, templates are Turing Complete, type safe source code generators.\n\n      class node: public std::tuple<T, node *> { public: using std::tuple<T, node *>::tuple; };\n\nClasses in C++ are `private` access by default. Here I describe a `node`, which is just a kind of tuple, but I have to deal with 55 years of legacy and syntax.\n\n      using node_ptr = node*;\n\n      node_ptr head, *tail;\n      std::size_t size;\n\nJava manages memory under the hood, here we're a bit more manual. The nodes will be dynamically allocated on the heap, and I have to keep tabs of their location with a handle. `head` is a pointer - a handle. It's a variable type that leads to a resource in memory. Since pointers are a variable type, they take memory and are addressable, they are themselves resources, and we can point to them. So `tail` is a pointer to a pointer.\n\n    public:\n      list(): tail{&head}, size{} {}\n\nPublic interface from here on out. `list` ctor. I don't even bother to initialize `head`, because I don't have to care. Other languages have different rules and considerations. I could have made this list JUST with a `head` pointer, which means I'd have to take a different approach than I'm showing you.\n\n    void add(T &t) {\n      *tail = new node{t};\n      tail = std::get<node *>(*tail);\n      ++size;\n    }\n\n    std::size_t size() const { return size; }\n\n    bool empty() const { return tail == &head; }\n\n`tail` points to the pointer that is going to handle the next `new node`. This is taking advantage of type erasure - which Java also supports. We don't distinguish WHAT sort of `node` pointer we point at. Whether it's a member of `list` or member of `node`, a pointer to `node` is a pointer to `node`. I don't have to ask which pointer I'm pointing at, I don't have to know if the list is empty or not.\n\nI'm caching the size of the list for performance, but I've also demonstrated that I can know if the list is empty just by comparing the address `tail` is storing to the address of `head`. Is `tail` pointing at `head`? Then the list must be empty. If `tail` is not storing the address of `head`, then we're not empty.\n\n    void for_each(std::function<void(T &)> fn) {\n      for(node_ptr iter = &head; *tail != iter; iter = std::get<node *>(*iter)) {\n        fn(std::get<T>(*iter));\n      }\n    }\n\nHere we hop nodes from `head` to `tail`.\n\nI think you know enough Java that you can READ this C++. The trick is applying these principles to Java. A `tail` is a way to append quickly, but you need two levels of indirection to do it. When we add the first element, `head` gets assigned without accessing it directly by name.",

Even front desk staff can usually answer that without needing manager approval.

If you simply don't know what tool exists for something you want to do (like a keyword, a module, an IDE, or whatever), just Google it or ask someone. Whenever you feel stuck on a project, like you're not making progress, just find another, more difficult one.

        "body": "In addition to what others have said, you need to realize that coding as a \"class\" and hobby by the nature of how it works forces every new concept and lesson to be cumulative even if your school isnt testing you that way\n\nWhat I mean, is that during week one you learn variables and data types and have a test on those. Week 2 you may learn how functions work and be you'll be tested on functions AND variables and data types even if its not on the test because you'll be writing functions with variables in them. So when Week 20 rolls around, you are expected to have a baseline of everything that came before it because those concepts are used to do other things. \n\n\nIt may sound stressful, but if you're struggling with new information and not knowing how to start, then like a lot of beginners you likely lack that foundation of skills. Its easy to learn something new, but if youre also only kinda comfortable with the concepts youve learned so far, you arent learning just a new thing. Youre learning a new thing AND still learning the concepts your class has moved past. \n\n\nYou likely need practice, repetition is how experienced programmers can type code out quickly. When I need a loop, I dont think about the syntax at all, Ive just typed out a million of them incorrectly and it's muscle memory. So for me, if Im being taught something that assumes I need a loop, I wont be spending any mental energy on the syntax of a loop or any other concept, my entire brain is focused on the new concept. Coding is hard for new programmers, but if you feel you're getting overwhelmed, id implore you to consider looking backwards and not forwards, because you may not be hitting a wall due to the new concepts being tough, but rather because you're attempting to learn the new concepts while the old concepts are still being mastered. And if you feel thats the case, build things, use those things and repeat them over and over again until they're muscle memory. \n\n\nYou're a CS student, so it probably irks you when you see people typing with their pointer finger. But if you think back, you probably were annoyed learning to properly touch type and keep your hands in the correct position. But now you dont even think twice about typing, your brain thinks of a word and your hands do the motion required. The same process happens with coding, you just dont have years of experience like you have with typing.",

I’d bet money that the *person getting the job*—one of hundreds or thousands of applicants—is the one that can do it without. \n\nA lot of people had a tendency to blank during job interviews BEFORE AI existed, so do yourself a favor and make sure you can pass a strictly no AI mock interview.",

I also messaged my outgoing manager and he said he gave me a strong (although maybe not exceptional) rating before he left, so it seemed weird that my new manager randomly chose me to put on focus. My new manager told me in our 1:1 that he had to choose someone to put in Focus or he would be the one getting rated poorly (lol).\n\nAfter I found out I was put on Focus, I really put in the effort to work hard and finish my project on time and deliver. This was back around 2023 when the market was very uncertain. For my new manager’s credit, he told me about halfway through my focus that he saw how hard I was working and he was pulling me out no matter what. “I’m telling leadership we need to take [my_name] out no matter what”. Our relationship was much better by then and we actually became pretty good friends after. He actually did yank me out of focus and I got strong ratings every time after that.\n\nSo… no, focus is not a death sentence. Sometimes your manager’s hands are tied and you have to work with them. But it is definitely possible to make it out!",

Those three together put you ahead of the majority of people complaining on this sub. Layoffs in this climate are also not frowned upon so I wouldn't worry about your 5 month stint too much.\n\nThe market is not great but it's also q1 and nearing the beginning of some companies fiscal year so you're in a better spot now hiring wise than if this happened in November.\n\nThat being said as someone (now 8-9 yoe) also in the nyc area that was laid off at the beginning of 2025 and in 2023 and had 3-5 offers each time in <3 months for solid comp (no prior faang or really big name experience), I would say your situation is definitely not insurmountable.\n\nIf you need a little time for your mental health take it now, imo no longer than a week and I wouldn't travel or go on vacation unless it's to visit family. You don't want to distract yourself you want to decompress emotionally and let your new reality settle in, low stimulus time.\n\nOnce you're ready to start hunting then you update your linkedin and get your resume together. Take your time but don't take too long, you can always update it more as you apply. \n\nStart sending out apps, I would aim for at least 50 a week. Personally I never did the tailor the resume per application and fuck that cover letter shit, but at the same time apply for places where you're a reasonable fit. Apply for startups, big tech, and everything in between. At this point you just want to pump the numbers, get your feet wet, and collect data.\n\nTrack all your job apps in a spreadsheet listing out what platform you applied, what version of your resume you applied with (if you modify it), and if you were rejected or not. This will help you tailor your strategy and give you success rates to A/B test approaches against. I had about a 5-10% callback rate on cold apps and a 20% callback rate on recruiter DMs/inmail (moved past the screening round). This is a pretty solid ratio to have in today's climate.\n\nAlso start connecting with a ton of tech recruiters and if you see a job with a good fit DM the recruiter directly with a short message, the job link, and your resume.\n\nAim to spend half your day doing leetcode /system design and the other half on job apps. Always be interview ready and at the beginning take every interview you can get even if it's something you would never accept just to build your confidence.\n\nThe big thing is to always rethink your approach and try tweaking different strategies to see what gets better results. It's a shitty position to be in but it's one that you can turn into a positive growth experience if you handle it well.\n\nKeep your head up and work hard! Also stay the fuck off of reddit, you do not need this negative shit filling up your head! Good luck!",

There's no way I'm letting it review code that is involved in the trunk of the system, but if it's linting/best practice code changes then I will let it make the PR and I'll review it quick.

When I brought up (nicely) some of these points and wrote them with my human brain and human thoughts (as he requested me to do), he replied with some generic GPT answer. It was clear it was GPT because I copied my comment into GPT with the prompt: \"Write a response to this\" and it spit out some of the exact same sentences and bizarre words. \n\nSo yes, AI has affected my job in the sense that now I am a slop reviewer, and it is showing me who the braindead people are who rely on slop generators to get their work done.

The pay will be shit, but most likely better than your current job. You can do your time, grind, and then stand on your own. \n\nIt comes with its own risks. Some people go through the training, never get a job, and get laid off. So this isn’t full proof and you would have to make that calculation yourself.

        "body": "Preface: I'm currently a remote SDE at Netflix, but I'm only one opinion, others might have different views obviously.\n\nFirst let me point out two facts:\n\n1. Getting a call != getting the job.  You are getting the cart in front of the horse a bit, so I'd highly recommend you not get too excited.  It is very hard to get an offer from Netflix, I've seen jobs stay open for 6+ months waiting for the perfect candidate to come through.  Also, if anyone is ahead of you in the pipeline and they accept an offer, Netflix will immediately cancel all interviews with anyone currently in the hiring pipeline.  I'm not telling you this to get you down, I've just seen too many folks surprised and disappointed by this.\n2. Lets be honest, if you get an offer you are going to take the job.  It doesn't really matter what I say after this.\n\nTo answer your actual questions:\n\n>What's the catch?\n\nThere's no catch.  Its a good company to work for, but the keeper test is a real thing.  You need to do good work to stay employed.  There are people who definitely coast, but that's not common.\n\n>Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day?\n\nNo.  I suppose if you were the type of person who wants to go from Engineering Manager to Senior Director or something I'm betting it's a journey only to be successfully traveled with a lot of in-office ass kissing.\n\n>How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus?\n\nI would say to get the idea of \"pay growth\" out of your mind.  First of all, based on you saying you were at a financial company, I'm guessing that your pay will probably double when coming to Netflix.  Given that, if it doesn't grow from there, would that be terrible?  Netflix has terms/acronyms for how they do or don't increase pay, I won't bother spelling them all out.  The TL;DR is if pay in the industry goes up across the board, then Netflix pay will go up.  If it doesn't go up or it goes down (like it has for the past 3 years), Netflix pay will stay the same.  You will never get a pay cut at least, but you also won't get a pay raise.  In the 2018-2021 timeline people were getting huge raises each year.  For the past 3 years, pay has been flat.\n\n>How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year?\n\nThey honor it.  I don't take a lot of time off, but that's a personal choice, but there are people on my team taking 30 days off per year easily.  We don't really keep track honestly, there's no place to click some button to take time off.  I just tell my manager my plans and then set my self as out-of-office on my google calendar and slack and that's about it.\n\n>How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it well\n\nAFAIK they do.  There was someone in my greater org gone for nearly a year after their baby was born.\n\n>What do you think about the health insurance they offer?\n\nIt's fine, pretty standard.  The HSA plan is usually the clear winner.\n\n>Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?\n\nNo, not at all.  My org is almost entirely remote.  The only rumor I've heard was from the Ads org requiring in-office, but that team is almost all ex-Meta and ex-Amazon, so who knows what those nerds are up to.",

Some intern managers are great, some are just mediocre, but this is unusually bad.\n\nThat said, this is an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation, so here's my advice:\n\nFirst, do the work you're assigned, no matter how stupid or boring it sounds. Finish copying the data to Excel, email it to your manager and ask for more.\n\nIf you get more, do it as professionally as you possibly can, even if it seems boring and stupid. Part of the experience of working at a company is that sometimes you have to do boring, stupid work. Doing it well is necessary for success.\n\nHowever, for the rest of your time, you should have two goals:\n\n1. Make yourself useful\n\n2. Learn as much as you can\n\nYou're in an amazing position right now. You have access to a whole company full of professionals, and almost no responsibilities.\n\nThis is a fantastic opportunity, if you want to take advantage of it.\n\nWho cares what department you're in? Start meeting people in different departments. Tell them you're an intern on the Data Analytics team but you're not very busy and you'd like to help.\n\nIt won't be hard to find someone who has some work for you.\n\nI don't recommend keeping it a secret! Tell your manager you did all of your Excel work, and that you met someone in another department who gave you a task. I highly doubt your manager will care.\n\nAnd of course, your goal is to learn something. Find people who are actually good at their jobs (unlike your manager) and are interested in teaching you how they do them.\n\nHaving your manager give you a good review at the end of your internship is nice, but it isn't the only good outcome. Any other employee who ends up impressed with you at the end of the internship could end up being a great resource. When you apply to future jobs and give a reference, you don't have to give your manager - give some other senior employee who liked you. And make contacts with as many people as you can, and when you're graduating, contact all of them to ask for referrals.",

Ask somebody to give you something to do. But here’s the thing… The best thing you could possibly do is make the best of the opportunity you have. As long as you do that, you’ll leave on positive terms and be able to ask for letters of recommendation in the future. That’s your end goal.\n\nSo here are some ideas… Ask someone what is the most important codebase for you to investigate? What are some fundamental principles that you can look up, if you’re interested doing that person’s job? What is a problem that the company currently has that could provide value for the company if it was solved?\n\nBe sure to let people know that they can answer this in a very high-level, simple way if they don’t have a lot of time. Let them know that you’re not trying to interfere with their daily work… But more so, you’re trying to find some things to dig into and research independently. After a while if you’re at a good internship position, they’re going to give you some more useful work… but if you’re at a bad place, this is going to be all you get. Either way, though, if you take this approach, everyone will know that you tried, and you would have documented evidence that you asked C questions and got Y answers. Document everything (your questions, the answers, and the research/work you did), and write up report from your internship. Save it somewhere. Memorize a 30 second breakdown of what you did. If you do this, it won’t matter if you have three bad internships. You will seem more prepared, and experienced, than 90% of all candidates for other jobs. The real skill to legitimately learn and to genuinely get jobs is to:\n\n1. Do your best, genuinely.\n2. Document what you did, at every place on your résumé.\n3. Create a logical and truthful story about what you learned..\n4. Always learn, at every position, even if you’re learning about what not to do (pay special attention to proactively investigating how you can provide value… and managing yourself in a way that provides value to the company).\n\nYou can do all of this systematically no matter what anyone else does. You don’t have to be a genius, and you don’t have to become a rockstar. All you have to do is to provide documentation that you work hard and are willing to reasonably spend your paid time, focusing on providing value for the people that pay you (if at all possible).\n\nThe worst thing you should say about the company is, “Even though I had very little guidance, I was able to spend company time improving documentation [something you were told was important] and learning about [something you proactively researched]”\n\nYou should always be looking for how this internship can provide value for you. If someone helps you provide value for the company, great! But if no one is giving you work to do, make sure you get what you need from that opportunity. This could impact how much money you make (10k-20k+ a year)… or it could impact if you get a good entry-level position.\n\nI purposely did not respond in a way that had anything to do with, how to make the company act differently. Because this is something you cannot control… You should focus on how you can behave in a way that would set you up for success no matter how the company behaves. You want to optimize for the best future for yourself.",

From what I’ve seen in my own job search and from hearing my husband’s recruiting war stories, companies like that rarely shift their comp philosophy, so waiting around for bigger jumps doesn’t magically pay off later. What a lot of folks in your situation do is treat the current job as the stable base while slowly prepping in the background—updating the portfolio, doing light interview practice, feeling out the market without actually committing to a jump. That way you’re not betting your family’s livelihood on a cold plunge, but you’re also not stuck forever on a raise curve that can’t keep up with inflation",

You just gotta keep going and apply. You’ll have to be open to relocating where they provide relocation or not. If you don’t have to money to relocate you can always take a small loan as long as you have a job lined up and know you’ll be able to pay it back. That is what I did. Also you don’t mention if you have any internships on your resume. If not I’d suggest applying for some. While they are uncommon for new grads, I have definitely seen people do it. That’s going to be way more valuable to your resume than any project you put on there.\n\nEdit: also post your resume on r/engineeringresumes or whatever it’s called and ask for feedback. And if you’re a US citizen feel free to dm or send your resume, my workplace might have a few positions for new grads.",

I did not have a degree in tech, I used to work as a counselor and wanted to try career switching. I worked help desk until 2024 where I got a new job as app support where I coded for the first time on the job writing some scripts to update our relational db. It was fun but I sucked so bad that they laid me off 5 months in!  \n  \nFrom July 2024 until October 2025 I worked my butt off teaching myself how to code. I worked a few small contracts, contributed to open source, and made a ton of friends in tech by going to local meetups and occasional conferences (got in for free either through volunteering or finding people who were giving away tickets). This past October I landed an offer and have been working as a full time SWE.\n\nThe market absolutely sucks and it took me over a year just to find a role but the main thing I did was stay in community to help encourage me when I felt like throwing in the towel. Best of luck on your search!",

I see people telling you tot need to apply to 1000-1500 jobs. That’s not quite accurate. There’s some randomness to it all. The more you apply, the more you have a chance for finding something that aligns with you. But it’s not a guarantee, and some people luck out and find something sooner. \n- People are really bad with perspective. There’s nothing wrong with what you wrote about yourself, but there’s an issue of scale and perspective. How do you compare to all the other people currently looking? There’s no way to answer that, but it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. There will be a lot of people with similar backgrounds, better backgrounds, and worse backgrounds. You can’t control much except making yourself a better candidate and trying to give yourself as many opportunities as possible. \n\nAnyway, you have to just understand that rejection is a part of life, and it’s a part of the job search process. That’s easier said than done. \n\nRegarding false certainty, that’s just part of life. There is just a lot of uncertainty in life. If you’re a sports fan, there’s uncertainty in the outcome of a game. There’s what likely will happen, but no guarantee. Some don’t watch because of anxiety. Others watch and let the result really impact them, and others watch and move on with their lives. You could probably do fine in a lot of roles at a lot of companies. So can a lot of other people.",

Unfortunately those boom days are gone, but it is still not impossible.\n\nMy first recommendation is find a dev sweatshop and see if you can break in this way. You’ll get bent on the hours and make about the minimum wages, but it may open some doors for you.\n\nI also got a friend who is (hopefully) still in process of breaking in last year from working as a dev in startup, also making minimum wage in a vhcol area. His work experience was also horrid with years of wastes, but he made some very interesting projects that I believe impressed the startup folks to giving him a shot.\n\nNo sugarcoating but it is a lot of hard work, grit, and luck. Be willing to do anything and move anywhere, even at a minimum wage.. personally I had gave it all a go with a hard one year deadline of make it or try something else.\n\nGood luck",

What you need is visible proof you can ship, like a real app or something, so that website idea could be cool, if you actually do it.  \n  \nI think realistically your best options are SWE-adjacent roles (QA automation, DevOps junior roles, support/production engineering, data analysis with SQL and dashboards), government or university tech jobs, or small freelance or contract work.   \n  \nAs for the gap, don't hide it, just acknowledge it, explain it without drama, and then immediately talk about recent work that proves you can actually be taken seriously and be trusted, not someone literally did nothing for years.  \n  \nI know I'm being kind of mean, but I really do think you got this IF you start today and work seriously for a year.

This also goes for job titles: junior software engineer roles will have a considerably higher lower limit to their salary range than an IT support role generally.  I’ve known people from my undergraduate institution that have published multiple papers and done multiple internships as well as people who did basically just their coursework.  This is the biggest toss up though, since I’ve seen people from both cohorts accept offers in the $50k-$60k range as well as the $100k+ range fresh after graduating.  To put it plainly, a good lower limit is a bit more than what you need to live off of.  I say that because your experience is what will get you a higher salary in a few years when you apply for another job, and as a fresh grad it’s not always in your best interest to be picky.

It's usually 1 of 2 things, either you had clear goals in life and are finding yourself not getting closer to them, or you were constantly under some ethereal pressure to always deliver and been told what you were doing mattered -- but it really didn't.\n\nIn the first case, it usually manifests in the form of a midlife crisis i.e. realizing you're not where you want to be and your life's almost over, which you sound young enough and are on a decent trajectory (gf + social circle/gym) to not be applicable to.\n\nThe second case is clear overworking, I'm talking like 70-100 hours a week for years which doesn't seem like your case.\n\nThen lastly, there's also a sort of mix of the two in high-achieving younger folk I've noticed in recent years. Those who were mostly successful in life and then landed great gigs out of uni, constantly being told they're delivering mission critical things and are a part of something bigger. After a few years, you start to realize, if you took some PTO, missed some deliverables or just straight stopped working for more than 1 hour a day like yourself, nothing really bad happens. Work moves on, your company and coworkers move on, and really nothing you do is that critical to the business. For most, this is OK, but if you made it a part of your personality for the past 5-20 years of your life, then it could cause this divergence/burnout you're experiencing.\n\nPersonally speaking, I was never really an early overachiever but knew a few in the Bay Area who skyrocketed their schooling/careers really fast and burnt out hard. I don't really have advice but it seemed like those who went through it had to soul search for a long time to get out of it (some became NEETs or worked in unrelated jobs for a few years), or just switched and coasted at a smaller company until they shifted their perspective or found something they cared about.",

I hate how I spend most or even all of my mental capacity for work, and then I have none left for me afterwards. Not enough to learn more challenging things, not enough to do good art, not enough to read difficult literature, not enough to write music. Even on weekends I have no creative energy because I'm just recovering from work\n\nAnd I know its work because after a vacation of 3 weeks or so, I start getting so much creative energy back and I just start naturally creating things\n\nYou just gotta keep taking breaks or switch to a less mentally demanding jobs\n\nThat's not so bad, don't force yourself to do this until you crash and burn entirely",

At first I was panicking thinking \"shit am I supposed to know all these obscure things? I've never seen these nor have any idea what they're used for \".  But then after reading through the lines you were just supposed to rationale how things worked.  Like a type for a variable is blank but you can see the method setting it is returning Foo. And then the last blank was some class that  was the only import not used yet. Some were more challenging. But it seemed more practical like when you're actually walking through code trying to mentally put together how everything works. Idk if this is more common than I'm aware of but in the past I've always had miserable overly complex live coding assements usually with some ass hat who keeps telling me to talk him through what I'm doing when I'm trying to mentally work through it. As though waiting 20 minutes until I've actually finished to talk through my solution is just unfathomable.",

That's the reason companies are doing this. I don't think it's a particularly good solution, but the rationale makes sense in our field given the utter lack of a unified exam and licensing system like other professions and engineering fields have.\n\nDoes it make sense that we have to go through multiple full day onsite interviews with multiple different companies whenever we do interviewing rounds?  No, it's terrible for us as candidates. What I want is one trusted testing organization where I can do a 6 hour interview on site once or every X years and have every company accept the results.

I'm probably mid-level SWE at a top tech company at best.\n\nI'm just not top tech company smart at the end of the day.

My husband's been seeing companies take 3-4 months to fill roles that used to get filled in weeks, and they're being stupidly picky about \"culture fit\" which usually just means they're scared to pull the trigger.\n\nThe interview process has gotten worse too - expect 4-5 rounds minimum now, and leetcode has crept into everything even for backend roles. Companies are doing this thing where they'll give you a take-home that's basically a mini project, then still make you do live coding anyway. It's exhausting.\n\nYour F500 experience is actually solid though, especially the k8s/cloud stuff. Non-tech companies are weirdly respected right now because everyone assumes you know how to work with legacy systems and actual business constraints vs just burning VC money.\n\nFor someone with your background I'd honestly skip the traditional job boards - they're even more of a black hole now. Platforms like Twill or Hired tend to work better for mid-level folks since you're not competing with 500 other applicants on the same posting.\n\nStart grinding leetcode again like now though. Even if the role is 90% backend architecture they're still gonna make you reverse a linked list or whatever. The bar hasn't gotten higher but the process has gotten longer and more annoying.",

Doing some tinkering with AWS and getting familiar with their primitives would probably be one of the most impactful things you can do to increase your value in the job market, since it'll naturally open you up to lots more companies/stacks.\n\nSome thoughts inline for your other questions:\n\n> If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?\n\nGet your story straight. Ideally, both your internal story (for yourself, what you wanted out of it, what you ended up getting) as well as your public story.\n\nBut if you can only do one, get the public story *concise* and have the elevator pitch ready to deliver when the inevitable question comes up in the interview. You want 1-2 polished sentences about why you took the time off, what you accomplished, and how you're thinking about your return to full-time work.\n\nPractice telling the story, over and over, until it sounds natural.\n\n> Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE?\n\nRemember that you also need to like the job you end up getting. ;) It's okay to focus, especially initially.\n\nIf you do end up going for general backend/SWE roles, make sure to have different version(s) of your resume for those roles.\n\n> What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?\n\nOne underrated tool is mock interviews. Hire paid, experienced mock interviewers that actually have work and interview experience at the kinds of companies you want to join.\n\nSchedule at least one mock interview every couple weeks. That way, you're getting *real* feedback every couple weeks with specific guidance on what to work on.\n\nFor me, right before my real interview, I also then loaded up one last wave of mock interviews to get in a bunch more practice.\n\nIt gets expensive, but you should be able to make back everything (and more) with your signing bonus.\n\n> What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?\n\nOops... my advice is from experience in the US. Adjust accordingly. :)\n\n> Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?\n\nPaying for a training or a course certificate *from an actual credible source* can be a nice bullet point. It shows you're willing to invest in yourself, literally, and it shows you can learn on your own.\n\nGood luck! And don't beat yourself up about taking a break. It's *very* common. Professional athletes prioritize their rest days and rest weeks. It's totally okay for you to take care of yourself and prioritize rest in the same way.",

BUT if you're losing your coding skills from stress/burnout, it might actually be worth it just to have structure and forced learning time. plus the internship angle is smart - some companies have way lower bars for interns than junior hires which is backwards but whatever.\n\nhonestly though, skip the mass applying thing for a bit. you're burning yourself out and it's not working anyway. spend like 2 weeks just coding again - build something you actually want to use, not a todo app. then start reaching out to actual humans instead of application black holes.\n\nalso try some of the referral-based platforms like Wellfound or Twill where you're not competing with 1000 other resumes in a pile. the bar is still high but at least someone looks at your stuff.\n\nthe coding skills thing is real though - if you feel rusty, you probably are. fix that first before you interview anywhere good.",

Didn’t care that I had transferrable C++ experience and it’s a JUNIOR role. The rest of the interview he’s just asking questions off a paper without much feeling and we’re done like 15 mins later. Of course as I thought, I was rejected soon after.",

In my head, I wanted to blame getting into a small car accident on the way there. I rear-ended a semi on the highway in bumper-to-bumper traffic. They didn’t even notice, but it made my nerves even worse. I knew I was bombing the interview, and I think I may have even said so. The interviewers, being typical consulting bros, decided to make me squirm more and keep asking questions. Felt like they just wanted to laugh about it later. \n\nAnyway, I found a job later, and now these are just stories. Failure is a part of life. I’m sure I’ll bomb other interviews in the future and pass others. ",

When it comes to Front End work items on our board in DevOps, I am usually the one that gets handed these types of tickets since front end work is pretty much straightforward and self explanatory. \n\n“Self-sufficient, don’t need handholding” — I’ve noticed probably within the past 4 months that for this portion I am starting to be more self sufficient, but occasionally I do need support or guidance getting through the work item. For instance, I had to edit a table (database migration for C#) on one of our database tables for an application that we are in the midst of building and kind of got lost. I had to nudge one of our lead developers for some assistance, but I still occasionally do need help with more difficult problems that I sometimes run into. \n\n“Can own features end-to-end” — for this specific point, this is NOT true with me. If you really do own features end to end I expect these to be more front end feature work items, but not back end stuff. I struggle with back end work items immensely. Correct me if I am wrong please!!!\n\n“Collaborate with other teams on system design and write ADRs” — At my company, we really don’t have “ADRs”. Sure we understand the things we work on, but my company is so small that having things like this does not really benefit us. For bigger companies I could definitely see the benefit of this. My coworker who has been doing Software Engineering for 15 years wrote up the architecture design documents and database schema for a new application we are releasing soon about 6 months ago. He knew EXACTLY how to get it done, how long it would take, and how hard it would be. That’s something I totally expect from someone with that much experience. \n\nIt also depends heavily on the work place you are at. Especially what you work on, how difficult it is, and if you are learning new things. \n\nI would say that from what you said in your post and comparing where I am at, we are probably in a similar spot. Now I don’t know how much you make, but I expect the next job you get (hopefully for me too) you will make substantially more. \n\nWhat I would work on for improving your knowledge is maybe look at more back end specific problems. I am currently working on a full stack application that calls a local database and uses REST to grab information from said database. I had a coworker who moved on to bigger and better things that told me back end development is where the big money is at. If you can understand that more, you will do great!",

Maybe use LLM to help and then make sure you understand what you made. Senior dev probably still modified or rejects solution.\n\n\nDevOps specifically just depends where you work. I found I need to know how CI/CD works and some basic to touching intermediate topics about AWS / K8 for interviews. I have only gotten the opportunity to write unit tests and update yaml files and deploy docker containers, so I can't speak there. I had dedicated DevOps teams at my other jobs.\n\n\nSo my opinion (that may not be that accurate) is learn as you go and get your work done in a timely manner. If you have time afterwards review the work and make sure you get it.\n\n\nWhen you get to interviews though, different ball park. They want you to know (in my experience):\n\n\nthe ability to system design large projects, solve medium LC's in 10-15 mins or a custom coding challenge, random trivia of basic to intermediate topics about your coding languages, varying levels of DevOps questions, SQL questions including asking specific syntax or make a query right now verbally or type in chat, strong behavioral stories that show impact and good team dynamics / easy to work with.. \n\n\nThen I got my job offer finally, and I'm potentially being bait and switched to doing lowcode despite needing to be some on paper super coder to get the job 😂",

I'd like to get back soon though. \n\nThis all depends on your circumstances, if you have friends and family to fall back on, you don't mind selling your home or moving, whether you have a family of your own that depends on you etc. \n\nWhen I was laid off a few years back I went into panic mode and landed plenty of interviews, I knew one manager who could tell I was a bit stressed. He interviewed me and offered me a position with no questions asked. I worked at that job for six months and learned it really wasn't for me and we parted ways. \n\nI took a step back and realized I had plenty of money in savings and also realized I didn't really want to work at that moment. I don't recommend just taking any job out of desperation if you can avoid it. I'm using my time off to relax, reflect, and become an even better developer.\n\nI feel for people with families and quality of life that needs to be maintained, I feel for people who go through this with a mortgage or health issues (I personally had to get on Medicaid when I lost my insurance). In those cases take whatever is on the table until something better comes along. I had interviews lined up within weeks when I was in panic mode. Now that I'm calm I can pick and choose roles that interest me. \n\nJust one thing to mention though about mental health, software development is a rapidly changing, confusing, and mentally taxing field. Going through a layoff in this field takes a toll on everyone, doesn't matter who you are. Try to stay positive and realize it's not your fault, you're just modernizing. You're not useless or undervalued, and you don't lack skill. You will make a comeback in this field. Take the high salary they'll give you in your next position and make sure to save enough for the inevitable rainy day, do this until you're six feet under or computers cease to exist.",

I billed them $500+ USD for this but not before giving them an estimate and plan. \n\nSo OP, it’s criminal that your assessment is not paid. And as others have mentioned, even if you’ve done it, it’s not guaranteed that they will read, test and give feedback. And it will break you mentally after learning and building something so intensively just to get ghosted. \n\nFYI, I did pass mine and got an offer, as well as feedback after the assessment. Which is the best case scenario, paid intense work, feedback + offer. Also for context, this assessment is requested after 3 rounds of interviews.\n\nI do not recommend you taking the assessment because you’re technically not in the interview loop yet, and your worse case scenario is unpaid intense work (and not sure if you’ve done it properly since it’s your first time), no offer + no feedback. You should only do so if you’re prepared to face the worst.",

Other people in the hiring process (correctly) act more as gate keepers, your recruiter is more than anybody else you'll meet along the way the person who's actively engaged in getting you hired.\n\n\nThey're the ones who will give you good interview advice, they're the ones who will be most sympathetic to you when it comes to needing rescheduling/accommodations, they're the ones who will make sure you understand what you need in terms of resumes, transcripts, referrals, etc.. They're also the ones who can keep your name around for future consideration if you don't get hired, which _you very much want_. Most people I knew at Google failed their first hiring attempt but were contacted again later because their names were on file and passed later rounds.\n\n\nNot all of them are great. But the great ones are a huge ally to have. If there's any one single person you really want to like you in a process, it's them - _arguably_ more so than a single interviewer.\n\n\nI still keep in contact with a couple of my old recruiters from both jobs I've had and jobs I haven't.

How is a language a skill, then you list all the rest of it and I can’t tell if you’ve just copied a list of buzzwords online. How skilled are you at using any of that? What’s your level of exposure and proficiency in all of that? \n\nfinally, it’s best practice where I am to put your most recent job first then old jobs afterwards. So you’re supposed to lead with your most current experience which should obviously be your strongest experience ie they can see a sense of progression from where you are now vs before. Instead I’m not seeing any progression on your CV, you’ve actually added more bullets on your oldest job than your newest job? That makes me think your newest job is a downgrade as you’re not working on things worth writing about. \n\nPlus you’re listing a bunch of tasks but I can’t see where you added value or what you did well or anything that makes you better than another candidate. Even in your education you’ve given no context as to what you actually studied- not all degree programs cover the same content. What did u study that specifically is relevant to the job?

You should think of college as your part time job and what you do outside of it as your main job to really bolster your chances to get a job once you graduate.\n\nIf it sounds like a lot it's because it is, but it's a lot easier than being unemployed for 2+ years after graduating which is what's starting to become standard.

You're likely to get probed about it so it's best to be prepared. Technical-wise, focus on LeetCode mediums and understand the time/space complexity like the back of your hand. For implementation rounds, practice writing clean, testable code quickly; it personally helped me to time myelf while coding to sort of simulate what I'd encounter during interviews. I also recommend checking out [company-specific interview guides](https://www.interviewquery.com/companies), since some companies focus more on certain rounds like system design while others are more holistic with how they review your performance.

        "body": "Part of my job is mentoring the Team and Tech leads that report to me. A couple of them are 15+ years my senior, and just ended up \"stuck\" at that level. Both of these guys are very smart, great developers, and good mentors to the Junior and Senior engineers on their teams. Their problem is the same thing I've seen skilled developers fall prey to over and over again throughout my career: lack of understanding of the business impact of their job.\n\nYou likely have seen this as you've done Product Owner/Manager roles, so you're already ahead of the game. At the end of the day, though, lots of developers don't want to think about what they are doing in the context of the business, either because they just want to focus on the how and not the why, or because they are afraid of dealing with something that isn't as clean and clear-cut as solving a technical problem. Both of these Leads at my company have these sentiments, despite them understanding that they need to do more.\n\nThe thing that helped me advance in my career and make sure never to stagnate, was to develop the business skills that helped me understand just how my work as a developer directly impacted the business. It helped me understand what to focus on, how to prioritize work that got the most impact internally and externally, and how to communicate critical needs to business stakeholders, especially in the form of long term support in favor of building tons of shiny new features as fast as possible.\n\nThose skills have proven to be transferable in a way that mastery of a specific language or framework simply haven't. I was stuck as a JavaScript dev for the first 8 years of my career, despite moving into a Team Lead role, because I wasn't focusing on the business problems as a whole and instead acted as the tool used to implement a solution someone else came up with. It was in this role that I started to be exposed to the larger discussions around what we were building, and why, which helped me realize that if I added my own voice to the conversation, I could influence what was happening and be seen as much more valuable than a simple code monkey.\n\nThis helped me pivot to other languages and frameworks, including hopping from entirely Node/Vue.js as my stack to .NET/React with no real experience in either. I could understand the business reasons for why decisions were being made, which convinced my soon to be boss to hire me and take the chance that I could get up to speed on their stack in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nNow that I am in management, I use those skills constantly, but I still actively try to code in my spare time. For this, AI has been immensely helpful! I use Claude Code daily, whether its for doing the bulk of the super basic coding that I'd probably have done with snippets anyways while I handle the complex business logic, or having it explain the codebases I have access to but don't work in and still need to help make technical decisions for. I basically treat Claude as a pocket engineer who never needs to sleep, gets way too eager and excited and sometimes needs to be reigned in, but is still clever and helpful. I've used it to help me build fully custom applications specific to my company, Claude API cloud agents that help my engineers debug their work completely autonomously, and basically just manage my day to day work life.\n\nAll of this is to say that you can still work on the things you are good at, enjoy doing, and still be a coveted asset companies would fight to have. Embrace AI as a way to level up the skills you already have and fill in the gaps you're missing. If you use it as a crutch while you're learning the strategic thinking required to lead a technology company, even if you have no desire to be a CTO/CEO, you'll be able to navigate this new AI powered world while still doing what you love. You don't have to go into management to influence the direction of a company either. Prove your ability to think tactically and with an understanding of the business' goals, and you'll have no problems finding a job well into the future.",

This is obviously easier if you are part of an organization with a product team, but there are always stakeholders in every project. Instead of sitting back and being assigned work, ask why that decision was made. Play the junior card and your desire to learn, you'd be surprised just how many people get excited to explain why they have made a decision. Ask to shadow the discussion with stakeholders, then debrief with the other members of your team. \n\nIts important to remember that this is going to be extra work outside of your normal responsibilities, so you still need to get all of your work done or else you can lose peoples' trust. But the skill of learning from people more experienced and rapidly absorbing new knowledge is critical to succeeding long term as a software developer.\n\nAlso, use AI as a coach. Even if you aren't allowed to use AI at work, you can still generally get away with telling it roughly the feature/functionality/application you and your team are building, the context of your company, and relevant tech stacks, then have it explain what it thinks are the likely business decisions. Then take that to the people involved in deciding the work that's been done and explain \"your thoughts\" and see how they line up. If you are allowed to use AI at work, instead of using it as a fancy auto-complete try to use it as a pair programming coach and have it explain why decisions and patterns may have been used. All this needs to be done with a healthy understanding that the AI very likely could be wrong, but at least it gives you a jumping off point to go confirm with somene who knows.",

At a more senior level, you should have the knowledge and skills to be able to look at an abstract problem and implement a robust solution. The key here is that often times engineers with those skills still act like more junior devs, simply taking orders and doing things how they are always done at the company. \n\nThis is where you can approach these discussions from your side. Instead of simply taking orders, insert yourself into stakeholder discussions and talk through what they are looking for and give options on how to build what they want. You'll have to come prepared with the ability to explain what you want to implement at a level that less/non-technical people can understand. But if you keep showing up with good solutions on how to implement what people want, and can deliver on that implementation, you'll start to get invited to more and more of these discussions. \n\nAlso, use AI to brainstorm and propose new design patterns for features. There's always the caveat that AI can very likely be wrong, but its a good jumping off point. Since you're new to it, just treat it like a conversation with another developer. Tell the agent when its wrong or has made a mistake and constantly give it new context. Ask it how you can improve the information you're giving it to help it come up with better answers. I am constantly getting better at working with AI agents, because I just throw problems at it and see what works. It seems kind of silly to think of it as a skill, but you really do get better working with them simply by putting in the time. I pay for the $100/month Claude Max plan and find it incredibly worth it, because I can have an idea and blitz my way through a rough implementation and decide if its worth pursuing, while also getting better at working with the agent, all in my personal time. At work, I am lucky enough to have the budget to spend a fairly sizable amount of money on Claude API tokens, primarily because I have proven the value of it to my boss, but I wouldn't have gotten there if I hadn't been experimenting on fun personal projects like my homelab server, custom websites and webapps for little hobby projects, and a healthy chunk of home automation.\n\nAs far as resources go, one of the best books I was introduced to by a college professor of mine is called The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. It may be about building a startup, but the skills are extremely transferable to existing companies. Every single business needs to spend resources efficiently to survive, and understanding where you can deliver value the most is key to success. \n\nAlso, I very recently discovered Lenny's Newsletter, which is a site with an enormous amount of content around Product development, Engineering, and how leaders in the AI space use AI to run their businesses and professional lives. I've just started digging into it, but its been really eye opening on how I have just been scratching the surface of using AI, and I already have several fully custom AI tools in use that I build explicitly to help me manage my teams at work.",

A degree can signal depth of knowledge and can sometimes unlock interview doors at larger firms, but it also costs time and money that you could spend building a stronger portfolio, contributing to open‑source projects, or sharpening niche skills that are in high demand for MLE roles (like large‑scale model deployment, MLOps pipelines, or advanced NLP). Since you already have a referral that got you into a big company, leverage that network to get more internal referrals and ask for informational chats at target firms; those conversations often matter more than a piece of paper. Meanwhile, keep your resume tight by highlighting measurable impact (e.g., performance improvements, cost savings, productionized models) and consider short, targeted certifications or workshops if you need a specific skill gap filled. When you start applying, broaden your search beyond the usual big‑tech listings—platforms that aggregate remote and on‑site opportunities can surface roles that match your experience and career goals without the extra overhead of a full program. One such site you might find useful is [Mercor](https://work.mercor.com?referralCode=561d8e89-98bf-43d2-abb9-d4ab0c46b1ba&utm_source=share&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform_referral). Balancing the immediate ROI of experience with the long‑term signal of a master’s will help you decide what’s worth the investment right now. God bless.",
