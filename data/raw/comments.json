A common loading pattern we have been using is:\n\n\n- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)\n\n\n- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)\n\n\n- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)\n\n\nI've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.\n\n\nThere's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

Model the infrastructure (make it modular and scalable), create some processes, and give power to the people within some defined boundaries. It’s more work, but I feel it’s easier — after inital cost I can go do streaming, swap out tools, optimize DB tables, create alert systems and stuff.\n\nPlus the experience managing your own files, metadata, debugging fucking notebooks is atrocious.

Told them that I use AI regularly and asked what they used. I asked them about using it to help answer questions.

Therefore you will never be successful.\n\nI think a lot of newcomers experience this. While the data science people will always be against you, because it is easy to blame the data engineer.",

Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. \n\nI would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. \n\nI’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. \n\nIf you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",

It’s also very possible the new CTO is seeing/know something you don’t, and what you’re reacting to is the first step in a long term plan that they themselves can’t clearly articulate because they are new.\n\nIf you do stay on, you should try to build a new relationship and pull in the same direction for the next year before passing judgement.

Your performance reviews are about to get worse as well, due to downward pressure to push you out.  They do not have to be fair, and defiance is pointless - if the CTO wants it, a \"case\" will be built for removing you, even if it takes months or years.\n\nThe safest bet is to update your resume and reach out to contacts you trust.  Presumably you have those, from former coworkers happy with what you accomplished.  It is far easier to change your environment than to change the nature of a CTO who is not interested in engaging with you on goals, tech, costs, etc. on their merits.

        "body": "I've been in 3 different roles as a Data Engineer, and they've all been so wildly different to me and without knowing more specifics without your role, I can't give too specific advice. But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\n\n\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\n\n\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well.  \nThe former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \n\n\\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \n\n\\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\n\n\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.\n\nI omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.

I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve).   \n  \nIn SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design.  \n  \nIn python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. \n\nThese will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience.  \n\nOnce you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. \n\nWhile you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. \n\nThese should be enough for now. ",

A senior analyst from the parent company does not know how to use your stack and wants to replatform because Databricks has a schedule button he understands. That is a political problem not a tooling problem.\n\nBefore you rip out six months of work, try this. The analyst needs a UI to schedule SQL. You can give him that without Databricks. Set up Airflow with the UI exposed (or use dbt Cloud if you have budget). Show him how to drop his SQL into a dbt model or an Airflow DAG. If he still cannot work with it after that, then the real conversation is whether the parent company is going to force their tooling choices down regardless of fit.\n\nSometimes you lose these battles and the decision gets made above you. But make sure the tradeoff is clear before it happens. Databricks at your scale is expensive and you are not going to use 90 percent of what you are paying for.",

It's actually ridiculous how quick you can get things done. I'm currently playing with agentic systems - I have a bot that looks at some market indicators, asks an llm about it, and either buys, holds or sells Bitcoin based on the answers and provides the justification. I have another agent working on an old piece of software I wrote to refactor it and in future add/update features as my business partner comes up with ideas.\n\n\nIf you can demonstrate the AI skills and have the background of data engineering etc you'll land a good job easily.

The official Docker docs are solid, and TechWorld with Nana has good intro videos if you prefer something visual.For Terraform, Terraform: Up and Running by Brikman is the standard recommendation for good reason. Work through the first few chapters and deploy something real, even if it is just a storage bucket with IAM policies attached. The plan/apply/destroy muscle memory is what makes it click.For CI/CD, GitHub Actions is the lowest-friction starting point for most DE projects. Build a pipeline that runs your dbt tests and deploys on merge to main. Once you have done that once, the concepts generalize to Jenkins, GitLab CI, or whatever else you run into.Raw Kubernetes knowledge is rarely needed for DE work specifically. Most orchestration on GKE or EKS you interact with through Helm charts or managed Airflow, and the k8s internals stay hidden. Docker and Terraform solid first.",

The other is to think about distinctions between: abstraction, generalization, opacity, and other similar \"operating at high level\".\n\nUsually abstraction in engineers context means finding a simplifying solution over otherwise individuated problems.  Example, any math theorem you learned in school, or theory in engineering.  So the abstractions applicability is limited to the details covered.\n\nThus how abstract is your problem space and what are the details, in rough terms it's variety.  Then do the solving & problem abstractions vary in requisite ways?\n\nSo to answer, if you are truly lost in core syntax and implements like debugging, you don't fully know the abstraction.  But does not mean anyone cannot use the abstractions, just being general to a problem or solution.  With all the abstractions these days, you won't know everything and a general knowledge is often where one starts.\n\nLastly your final questions around AI model roles, my feel this is opacity not (your) competence.  The core vector and matrix abstractions in AI and context models are not that deep, nor new.  But given they're \"cutting edge\"-ness often these models are purposefully opaque.  So if you simply cannot see detail, don't blame your abstraction skills lol",

But to answer the part that has not been answered here yet, normalization does save space when contrasted with raw data entering the transactional system, e.g. displayed or entered at Point of Sales terminal, as well as with denormalized data in a DWH. That is not the point however, as storage has grown and cheapened even for on prem systems, since normalization was invented. The point is speed and scaling the write operations. When yoyr transactional (e.g. sales) system has to record hundreds and thousands of items scanned, or ordered online every second, it doesn't have time to repeatedly write the customer address, or name in each row of a big table. Rather thatbinfo is saved once in a normalized table and its id is used in each row representing item bought.\n\nIn analytical (dwh) workloads, in contrast, you want fast bulk reads of whole chunks of a table, and each join is a burden for the analytical system, while storage and write speed are more relaxed",

I mean, PostGIS is everywhere, they tend to use very domain-specific fileformats (shapefiles, COGs, geojson) and datatypes (geometries, WKT, WKB). Oh, and projections gave me a headache at first.\n\nIn addition, at least where I am, remote sensing companies mostly seem to be quite small / young and often lack people that can look at properly scaling things and handling the data. So I'd say being a GIS-DE would make you quite marketable!\n\nGood luck dude!",

There aren't a ton of geospatial DE jobs but then again not that many people have that intersection of skills. It is a niche of DE but an important and interesting one, I think you should lean more into that side of things and find jobs there. \n\nCreate some dummy projects showing off your skills with Vector and Raster data, intersect that with H3/s2 cells at different aggregations. Connect this with real world data like open street maps. You can explore using duckdb/bigquery geospatial functions. Learn about Apache Sedona and maybe try to set it up and get AI to help guide you along and learn. Use tools like OpenCode or ClaudeCode to start building and then ask a lot of questions and make it explain things to you. \n\nThen you can have some projects on your github and start applying for the smaller geospatial jobs. I feel like there is less competition for those and not the 1000+ applicants problem for the more promoted posts on linkedin. ",

But because it depends too much on the skill of implementation and usage and those are normally lacking. \n\nI can make a perfect tool that's so complicated that only I can implement and run it correctly. Nobody would be defending the tool becaus \"git gud bro...\"\n\nI agree that \"it's a tool\" but whenever I see that showing up, I know (with 100% record so far) that it's going to be a disaster. There are no skills and then its very dependent on a low turnover so people \"learn how to use it\".\n\nIMO, it's not worth the hassle.",

So that depends on how convenient it's going to be to query that.  If your database supports JSON properly I think general querying would be easier.\n\nJSON will let you have arrays as property values.

For EAV it's impossible I think, for JSON you'll have to implement tooling that maintains CHECK constraints (if your database even supports that).\n\nI think the only reliable way to have required properties is a classic 3NF schema, but you don't want that; so maybe you would consider relaxing one of those requirements...",

I enjoyed backend more with stuff like stream/notif, auth, jwt, cache optimization. \nIt actually makes me write better code when doing DE stuff, though nowadays copilot writes 95% of my codes. \nI use fastapi and mysql so maybe different than what you do. \nJob wise, backend interviews are more competitive in my experience.

Should we backup and redeploy the prod bronze db maybe after each time? Is Linked Servers really a bad option and what do you mean with cross env  drift and permission weirdness?

Lance's file format is versioned, with the current default version being 2.0. 2.1 is already out there and is going to be the default soon, and 2.2 is also implemented and in the testing phase. The choice of file format used can impact the level of compression and performance you see, as the format is continually being improved.\n\nRe: performance, the F3 paper ([https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf)) shows numbers comparing Lance vs. other file formats and this is a good source of information (outside of the LanceDB team) in terms of scan and random access throughput (it shows that Lance is the fastest). The compression ratio shown in the paper is the worst, but the paper benchmarked against an old version of Lance (pre 2.0).\n\nFrom a roadmap perspective, Lance file format 2.2 that will come out soon has significantly more compression algorithms implemented, with some performance improvements as well. So more numbers will be published soon once that's out.\n\nRe: your performance observations, a) the version of the file format used matter, and b) the data types may not have the best compression ratios for that file version used. In LanceDB's internal suite, we regularly test against these modalities: long-form text, images and video blobs. For these cases, the write amplification in Parquet due to row groups is significant (which is the reason Lance was created in the first place). That said, even for conventional tabular data types (floats, booleans, etc.), Lance should perform on par with or better than Parquet, no matter the scale of the dataset. If you're getting sufficient performance out of Parquet, then well and good, in the end, what works best in practice is all that's needed!",

Glue does not register partitions in Hive-style because it would be redundant and error prone (given that Iceberg already manages partitions, manifests, and snapshots atomically) - which explains why you're getting nothing when you call GetPartitions.\n\nWhen you said \"create S3 notifications, subscribe to those and then run Glue Crawler on those events, which will create another S3 based Glue table with the correct partition information\" -> are you suggesting to create a hive table off **iceberg data files**?\n\nIs running DQ checks on partitions a strict requirement, or more of a practice your team has been following? In Iceberg, the more standard approach is to run DQ checks per snapshot, which can be done periodically by querying the Iceberg snapshots table",

So far, nobody really has. We all see at this point that it’s a huge bubble similar to the .com bubble, and we’ll probably see similar result - AI is likely here to stay, but it probably won’t be used very differently than how it’s being used today and the demand to put AI into every app or service will die down. \n\nIn the programming world, that means that we’ll probably get used to tools like Claude Code or Copilot and adopt patterns where we let it write the boring parts for us, but skilled programmers will still be valuable when building complex software while using these tools. We’ll likely see a knock-on effect of even cheaper compute as all these data centers are built to meet a demand for AI will inevitably to drop off.\n\nIn the short- to medium-term, there’s probably a pretty penny to be made by contractors who can untangle the mess of code written by companies who went overboard on writing their software with AI.\n\nSo I guess TL;DR is that if you’re a total AI Luddite you should probably at least experiment with AI to get used to where it’s helpful and where it isn’t. If you’re an AI hype beast, you should probably make sure not to let your actual technical skills atrophy because the future where AI writes 100% of the code is just not coming.

I can easily add or modify these scripts using a regular text file and put the fields I want in with {{ label }} tags and it will replace them with customer record data. I can just add a template file to a directory and it'll use it. That builds the texts I can bulk or individually send out. As I work, it dynamically keeps track of my availability across the day and updates the scripts for me on the fly as my schedule fills up.\n\nAlthough it has some required fields in the single SQLite table it uses, like first name, last name, phone, status, but other than that, it can import any csv file with at least those field names into it and it'll just slurp up whatever and show the fields from the csv in the GUI.  It also has a customized note taking page where I can put the customer's data into a UI and it'll save is as a json document in a directory and attach the name of that file to the client record.  That document is also a json document, so I can modify it without coding anything and those fields in the notes are not on the client record directly and they don't need to be. I could of course add them later to any data structure I want if I want to.\n\nAlso, now I can parse PDF files for data, match them to a record and update the database and attach the now renamed pdf file to that client and open it in a window from the gui.  I can also create a new record if one doesn't exist, or just fail and spit out a not found. Whatever I need it to do at the time.\n\nThat pdf view window dynamically changes to the corresponding file if I change customers in the gui by selecting, hitting the next or previous client or page buttons, and doesn't break if it's not there, it just happily displays there's no pdf file found for that one.\n\nIt also has color themes, a dark, light, slate, blue and pink themes. These are CSS files and if you want to add one you just drop it in by the name light.css, dark.css into a config directory and it'll pick it up and let you select that from the menu and save it so it always uses that theme until you change it again, with all the other config options that you set as well. They all stay active until changed across runs.\n\nIt can build lists I can use for bulk texts or anything else I can dream up for it. I can just code that in.\n\nAs I built it and made changes, I just kept adding the ability to customize it from the way it used to work, to the new capability. So, it basically just gets more and more powerful over time. Everything it could ever do, it can still do perfectly fine.\n\nIt's awesome and it's 100% mine, 100% free, and 100% not on the cloud, it doesn't even use a web browser either, although it easily could, but I like that it doesn't for now.\n\nWould it pass corporate IT coding standards. NOPE! I wrote them so I know, NOPE! and I like it that way.\n\nIs it easy to use - Yep.\n\nIs it user friendly - Nope.\n\nIs it well documented - other than the code is clearly written - NOPE. lol\n\nThat's (Hell\\^Nope)\n\nDid I vide code it? Kinda. I've got plenty of experience writing software. Big software. No direct experience writing anything quite like this before. It's got the simplest data model I've ever used in any DB lol. There's a lot of room for more things it could do here in the future if I get around to needing it. For now, I just don't.\n\nI started with free AI because I didn't know a some of the available API's and I wanted to try them out. I went through a few of these before I found one I liked and wanted to work with.  AI got me off the ground with them,\n\nI got amazingly far down the line of a prototype and before I knew it, I had something basically working.  As I kept adding more capability however, it quickly ran out of context area and now gets lost and makes so may errors and just poor coding choices I rarely use it anymore. The cool thing is I don't really need it now. I learned the API I landed on and I'm comfortable taking it from here. I also got a very good idea of what AI can and can't do these days as well.\n\nReplace coders and people with technical skills? Maybe some junior slog roles. It can be used to write slog job automation that would have otherwise been way out of scope and not cost effective.\n\nWhat are you going to replace them with? Don't even tell me business analysts. Don't even think about telling me corporate executives or nepo babies. They don't know their ass from a hole in the ground and AI isn't going to help for that. They can't bully a robot caddie into ignoring that extra swing and a miss. I wonder how they make it through the day without dying.",

In many segments you focus on one solutions such as git.   However you should make a point to highlight a number of similar systems.   The idea is to make students aware that there are many options.   Covering the common solution is find after highlighting that students have lots of options.   I actually like that GIT and VIM coverage as good introductions.\n\n2.   I'm still of the opinion that everyone needs to learn VIM, as a command line tool, to some extent.   It is the VIM is everywhere base reality.     However in the modern world using the command line environment with a GUI editor of choice might lead to more productive students.   I'm not even sure students grasp that command line control can be mixed with GUI apps.   This may be personal thing but I find GUI based editors far more productive.   So in the same regards a paragraph that list out a few alternative command line an and GUI editors to inform students makes sense.\n\n3.   A port for compiled languages or an additional segment within this package, would be useful for programs that don't use Python.   A focus on C++ would be advisable as the use of GCC is similar for many languages.  The idea is not to teach the language, but to teach how programs are built with compilers.\n\n  \nLike I said only a very brief view of this site, but guys it looks like it covers much of which sidelines students at the start.   In fact this sort of stuff should be covered in a high school prep course.",

They correlate, but they're not the same thing.\n\nMath gives you vocabulary (sets, functions, proofs) and trains abstract reasoning. But the specific skill of \"I have a complex problem — how do I break it into tractable parts?\" is best built by solving a lot of programming problems with deliberate reflection, not by restarting algebra.\n\nFollow the math list others recommended — it's solid. But in parallel: do structured problem sets (Exercism, Advent of Code easy levels) and after each one, write out in plain English how you decomposed the problem before you touched code. That explicit practice of \"problem → sub-problems → approach\" will do more for your logical thinking than math alone, faster.",

Get error reporting setup.\n\n - From HTML, learn [templating](https://phptherightway.com/#templating).\n\n - Learn proper routing using urls vs direct file links.  Introducing HTTP, like 404 Not found.\n\n - Learn routing with HTTP methods using forms (`GET /form` & `POST /form`).  Starts the thinking in \"MVC\" & \"Restful\" like patterns.\n\n - Learn about validating (not sanitizing) data, returning early, sending error messages to the template with HTTP response codes.\n\n - Learn about databases (using SQLite, less setup) to populate & read data.\n\n - Next would be refactoring to smaller testable functions (Are you receiving the data (input or code to function) you need? Are you getting the output you expect?), \n\n - Then OOP and better project structure.\n\n - Try this out using the common beginner User Registration/Login projects and learn about password_* functions (vs md5, sha1, etc), etc.\n\nA beginner would then be comfortable getting into current concepts found in libraries and frameworks.\n\nSee how this was more focused to learning based on experience?",

Imagine us telling \"Yeah, learn that Go.\" You'll learn it. Nobody in your area is developing his stuff in Go. Countries differ, job markets differ. What is in use in one place can be not in demand in another place.\n\nNow, to your questions:\n\n1)Backend is backend. If you are targeting web application development you won't be using any other math than some simple primary school math. And sometimes even not that. There won't be any difference between picking Python or Java or PHP or something else. If you have to add up your end-user's monthly bills you will use a simple primary school math.\n\nThe only thing you do have to look into is Boolean algebra. AND, OR, NOT and the combinations of these in IF/ELSE blocks. To decide how the process flow will switch based on one or another criteria. But you should have studied it during your degree studies. In Discrete Mathematics course or such.\n\nYou'll need more math in data science.\n\n2)Pick the backend language based on job offers in your area. Sure, you can pick some language that less juniors are using... but you won't be using it at all if there is no demand after it.\n\n3)If you are going to work in web application development you'll need SQL and git for sure. Linux can come useful when having to do some devops. But also useful in general. Stuff more often than not just work when working in a Linux or a Mac. In Windows you have to figure out how to get it working in your WSL and stuff.\n\nNo idea about boot.dev. But as you already have a degree then whichever bootcamp you are picking, should just remind you what you were studying 7 years ago.\n\nYou do need OOP and DSA but that should also be covered by your degree studies, already. It won't be anything new. Just a refreshment course for you.\n\nNow, when it comes to remote jobs then there you should be less optimistic. Better target local office jobs. At least where I live (a country in Europe) they are more often expecting the new junior to show up in the office. For onboarding, for mentoring, etc. It is a bit risky to let a new junior to work remotely on his own. Not saying that there won't be any remote jobs, for you, but expect to find an office job before finding a remote job.\n\nAnd when it comes to a saturation then a web application development in general is a saturated field. Does not matter if you are picking Python, Java, Go, PHP or something else. Because everybody is \"speedrunning\" and trying to get a job fast. And a web application development has its entry barrier lower than in data science and such, where one might need more theoretical knowledge in things.",

The intense math in Python comes in AI and data science, which you can totally stay away from. Java isnt having less math than Python; theyre pretty much the same in this aspect.\n\n2. Should you pivot to Java to avoid Python saturation?\n\nJava is definitely a good choice in enterprises, but changing to it now would stop you from moving forward fast. What is more important is if you can build backend systems and talk about them. After your gaining understanding of backend fundamentals, it will be very easy for you to learn Java.\n\n3. Should you stick with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) and learn OOP, DSA, Linux, SQL, and Git?\n\nYup... Those are good to have backend skills. SQL, Git, Linux, and backend architecture are the things used all the time in real jobs and will make you employable no matter the language.\n\nThe most significant factor is practical experience.

        "body": "I wouldn't worry about math too much, nor choose a language based on that. The business domain will determine that, not the language. And the vast bulk of programming jobs out there don't require much math. It's a misconception that all of us programmers are doing lots of math.\n\nThe most math you may benefit from is boolean algebra (and simple arithmetic), and that's very easy and fast to learn and has some payoff for working with logic in code. See the first two chapters of \"How to Prove It\", he covers the topic really well and it's a breeze.\n\nAnother good topic, related to logic, is how numbers are represented in a computer in general with a \"finite number system\", and in various languages more specifically (integer vs. float vs. double, vs. BigInteger/BigFloat [using memory to sidestep the limitations on the primitive data types]), and to understand the pros and cons of the common approaches. You should try to come away with a good working intuition, e.g. when to use an integer vs. a float/double based on the actual numbers you're working with, how floating-point numbers increasingly lose precision in the integers as they get larger, the kinds of problems you can run into when FP values are part of boolean expressions, i.e. exact equality checks, due to floating-point rounding error (and also how errors can creep in based on how you group operations on numbers of various magnitudes).\n\nJava is a great language. Personally I would choose a language based on the job market, not based on your perception of Python seeming easier to use. IMO it would actually be beneficial to confront that \"strictness\" sooner than later. That strictness you perceive is generally a good thing, it's an up-front cost that pays off in a bunch of good ways. With the exception of `var`, it generally gives good visibility on expected types (and you can always use the IDE to help inspect `var` variables). Types give you something firm to latch onto when reasoning about code at development time and debugging time. Python (AFAIK) has made improvements here, but I don't know the current state of things, how ergonomic it all is, and how good the tooling is. Maybe it's great, I have no idea. But Java is pretty decent in this regard. Anyway, types relate to logic, particularly when using the primitive data types, as you can abstractly think of the types as the sets of all possible values (restricted by the fact that the computer is finite).\n\nWith DSA stuff, I have no knowledge of boot.dev, but I'd probably just think of it as a potential problem bank. With DSA, you want to get exposure to various categories of problems, regardless of where you got the problems from. DSA problems are all scoped down majorly, so it generally doesn't matter where you're getting them from (as long as they're not poorly written). A key though is being able to check your solution for correctness. If boot.dev lets you _run_ your solutions to see whether it passes or fails, and on which inputs, then that's great. Otherwise, platforms like LeetCode can do that (or see Neetcode for a narrower list).  With these, focus on quality over quantity. There are more problems than you realistically have time to do, and that's fine.  If you do one problem from each fundamental category, that's an awesome start. Hopefully boot.dev's problem set gives you a diverse sampling.\n\nOther than that, a key for your career in programming is to actually build small projects of your own choosing on your own time, because you need exposure to the \"problem-solving cycle\". Getting real projects done can be an arduous process of cycling over and over through planning, coding, verifying, and repeating until you reach some clearly defined \"done\" state. At times it can be a psychological thriller. Anyway, DSA won't help you much here - DSA may have some payoff for when it comes time to implement code and not make as many silly mistakes, like \"off-by-one\" issues (or when it comes time to vet an LLM's output, if you choose to use them to actually write code [which I don't recommend doing while you're _learning_, because you really want to learn from the ground up so you can adequately vet their output and more confidently/quickly accept or reject or modify/refactor their output]).  LLMs can be useful, but whatever you do, you have to protect your own mental clarity and attention span - LLMs can easily exhaust it and cause more trouble than they're worth, depending on your skill level and how and when you use them.\n\nIn the process of working on projects, ideally you also learn more and more about how to build whole systems, rather than just \"code\". This is why working \"full-stack\" on your own can be a good idea, even if you don't actually work in a role that is itself full-stack - it gives you exposure to a broader set of concerns that are all part of the building the whole system. Your value to a software company will be your ability to implement systems or at least your part of them, and hopefully in a thoughtful way that minimizes friction for your teammates.",

You will *never* know enough to solve the problem in front of you. That's what your paid for; not to solve the problem, to *become the person who can solve the problem*. So the metric isn't \"Am I good enough,\" it's \"How fast do I become good enough and is that fast enough to make me content?\" Harder to track, because it's a second-derivative effect. But being the kind of engineer that can make senior-level decisions involves being able to know that about yourself: \"Here's a problem. Do I think I get good fast enough to solve that in the timeframe we've estimated, do I need help, or is having me spearhead this going to blow the schedule?\" is *the* game you play in industry with yourself forever.",

But yeah... it gets to all of us. Just don't let it get out of control. If you need to, step away, ask for help, there's nothing wrong with that. And I mean any help, mental, development, hobby, what ever it takes to not spiral out of control. \n\nAlso, this is how you grow... by learning new things. That's why I switched teams a year ago. I felt like I had plateaued where I was after 7 years. I was afraid I had stagnated. When an opportunity came up to change to a new area, I leapt... with out thinking it through. Part of me regrets it because there was another opportunity that might have worked better, but overall, I'm good with where I am... I kind of like not having a ton of meetings. :P ",

For me that was low-level graphics. I sincerely believe the exact technologies are not vital for internships, rather it's about showing your appetite for learning. Knowing OS fundamentals, and having practical projects with memory management, and cache-awareness in mind already knocks the majority of competitors out, especially for internships if you are targeting low-level domain (most go for latest and greatest shiny deployable frameworks).\n\nIf backend is referring to servers, databases, and interfacing with web, I have no idea.  \nFor more closer to metal, I assume getting an Arduino starter kit and do some of the guided projects could be a good idea.\n\nIt sounds like you simply need to do the reps with any type of project. I believe you don't really \"study\" programming. Rather, you start with something you want to create. Unless you are following a tutorial step-by-step (which I highly do not recommend), you have to be inquisitive and work your way backwards from the goal, to figuring out what's needed, and then figuring how to build those blocks.\n\nNaturally, based on problems you want to solve, you find that you want to express some computation, where you then realize that you need some language constructs to do so (just like normal language).\n\nAs a personal aside, it wasn't until after Year 3 (of 5) in uni where I started doing any fully self-directed projects. I understand the \"feeling lost\" emotion well. My gateway was a 3D graphics course using Direct3D and reading various old and new blogs of seasoned graphics programmers, even when I  barely understood most and half understood some. A million instances of trial and error from \"I don't understand this, let me try myself\" later and today I work with GPU drivers.  \n  \nYou do not have to have it all click and figured out with bombastic portfolio by the end of Year 2.",

Those are tools that let you build for multiple platforms using JavaScript. The same is true for Capacitor. These tools make more sense if you already have a solid grasp of web development.\n\nIn regard to Java vs. Kotlin, you'd be using Kotlin. Java usage has mostly shifted into development of the actual Android OS itself, with Kotlin becoming the preferred language for apps, and Kotlin is way more pleasant to work with.\n\nSo, it's hard to give a strong recommendation without a better understanding of what you're interested in and what you are trying to pursue. If your goal is to become a web developer who also builds mobile (and desktop) apps, then I'd pick Tauri (personally) or React Native (which is technically better, since it produces real native apps, with real native bindings).\n\nIf you're starting from scratch and don't really care one way or the other, then Kotlin with Android Studio is probably the more natural choice.\n\nBeyond that, you can also build apps for every major operating system using C#/.NET, which is a nice middle ground. Colleges are more likely to teach C#, and a lot of enterprise software is built on C#/.NET. The same team that created TypeScript also created C#, so the two languages play nicely together as well (and have a lot of the same features) - which is a good lead-in to web development.\n\nAnd then there's Dart/Flutter, which I wouldn't recommend (I usually recommend against it), but it is intended for making cross-platform development \"easier\", so as a beginner, it'd be easier to pick up (at first).\n\nPoint being... you can build mobile apps in whatever you want. So, it's more about your overall interests/pursuits - they typically define which approach you'd pick.",

        "body": "Everyone has answered things really well, but I want to touch on the question about whether folder structure is essential and does it depend on the framework.\n\nWhile others are correct that folder structure is not bound, required, or essential; it is often very important to the build tools you may, or may not, be using.  Different build tools whether they are used in JavaScript, Java, C/C++, all follow some standard folder structure.  Most Java projects are built with Gradle, Maven, or Ant and the Java folder structure is pretty rigid among these.  Cmake for C/C++ is less picky about folder structure as your program's include statements control much of that.  React, Svelte, and many JavaScript frameworks also use their own folder structure.  Even Rebar3 for Erlang has a fairly fixed structure it uses.\n\nBuild tools automate building of final product code so they expect certain files to be in certain places.  These can be changed in the build configuration, but then working with a team used to standard structure can be chaotic. Also, many build tools will create the folder structure when you request a new project to be built.\n\nSo, if you are building projects within a team or for a business, the folder structure will likely be mandated and essential.  Even if you are planning to share a project, using a standard folder structure is still highly recommended.  If you are writing custom code only for you, whatever works for you is just fine.",

For c# / visual studio I use windows for python / nvim I use Linux.\n\n\nTo your questions:\n\n\n- windows is easier to learn on (compared to linux it is an os designed for less technical people). That said if you are serious about programming 90% chance you will have to learn Linux in some capacity anyways. \n\n\n- windows is easier for tool setup at the beginning, at a certain point it flips. The more consumery the tool the more the easy of use starts to favor Linux. In my experience windows has nicer GUI tools and Linux has (significantly) nicer CLI/TUI tools\n\n\n- windows + wsl. I write a lot of c# and play video games, so pure Linux is a nonstarter. Dual booting adds way too much friction. WSL is the best of both worlds - Linux cli + windows gui. \n\n\n- yes. A lot if not most server-based software runs on Linux via vms and containers. A lot of automation and build tools also run on Linux. Familiarity with the system is a huge boon. \n\n\n- it's good enough for me. I use it both at home and at work. Some tools I use, fwiw: git, tmux, c#, ts, python, rust, nvim, vs, vscode, docker, K8s, k9s, ansible, terraform. I use all of those in wsl except visual studio. Modern wsl networking is pretty seamless. I can run a postgres db in docker desktop, a .NET backend in visual studio and a next.js frontend in wsl and have everything talk to eachother just using localhost urls. ",

And `for( int i = N-1; i >=0; i--)` will always iterate the same number in the opposite direction. The problem arises when you don't know exactly what N is supposed to be. \n\nBut honestly, having to mutate an array while iterating through it, should NEVER be an excuse for using a traditional for-loop. Always use the foreach-version if you intend to iterate through an entire list, no matter the language. The only reason to use the traditional for-loop would be when you don't want to iterate exactly N times, but some other arbitrary number.\n\nAnd also you rarely want to mutate an existing array, most of the time you would want a new array with a different set of elements, created by filtering the existing array or something like that.\n\nAnd if not, most languages also have methods specifically for removing elements from arrays depending on certain criteria.

        "body": "This is why I often say programming is easy, at least at this level.   The real challenge is taking a specification (word problem) and turning it into code.\n\nOne thing I can suggest is to take everyday tasks, that a person knows well, and turn them into a word problem and then turn that into code.    It might be as something as simple as checking the mail.  That might sound simple at first but you generally have to open a door or two, walk to the mail box, open the mail box, grab the mail and return.   The more one thinks seriously about what appears to be a simple task, the faster one realizes how detailed one needs to be to get software to do the job.   Creating the pseudo code becomes a challenge of iteratively walking through the code until you can actually get the mail.   The interesting thing about checking the mail word problem, is that you can check your work by physically walking through your pseudo code.\n\nIn any event there are lots of things in real life that can help you understand the conversion of tasks into code.   The more \"everyday\" the task the more impressive the complexity of what a person does everyday not thinking about it.   Brush your teeth in the morning and start to think about how all those actions would be expressed in code.   Would the stroking back and forth, be a function to simplify your code.\n\nAs for the OP I have to point out that this is an extremely common issue.   That is turning written requirements into code and frankly it often has nothing to do with programming.   However it is absolutely critical to becoming a good programmer.   In the real world many times your specification might not be well defined causing one to do some research.    That might mean reading a manual to get a device into a mode that you wan work with.  The point is your word problems become outlines leaving out critical information you need to fill in.   In other words in school you are lucky in that the word problems are generally complete, sometimes you need to figure out what a department really wants.",

Your test fails because the mock was expecting calls in a specific order. Or maybe it's more complex, like now it write A and B in one transaction and then C in another transaction.\n\nIt can be really hard to express in a mocking framework the idea that A, B, and C need to be saved, but the order and number of calls doesn't matter.\n\nSo instead, write a \"fake\". A fake is a tiny, trivial implementation of the storage layer's interfaec, maybe it just keeps track of the objects that were saved in a HashMap or a sorted list.\n\nInstead of asserting that certain methods were called in a certain order, have your method write to the fake storage layer, then fetch the list of things written to the fake storage layer and assert that A, B, and C are in them.\n\nNow your code asserts that the end result is correct without being nearly as tightly coupled to the implementation details.

Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. \n\nWhen choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.\n\nYou also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.\n\nIf you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. \n\n\n**How to test**\n\nThe most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.\n\nTo do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.\n\nEach test has the following pattern:\n\n1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes\n2. If state may change, assert beginning state\n3. Call the function under test\n4. Assert returns if applicable \n5. Assert state change if applicable\n6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in\n7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",

So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. \"This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element\" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

Have a consistent sleep schedule. Keep yourself hydrated (with water, not soda) and try to eat a well balanced diet. Remove alcohol from your diet. Do some sports, even just a light jog (search for c25k if you're a couch potato) and preferably do it in the morning just after you wake up.\n\nYou're brain is all over the place so you need to create habits that give you structure and stability.

The people who benefit most from AI tools are the ones who understand what is happening under the hood. If you can reason about logic, data structures, and basic algorithms, you will use those tools better rather than being replaced by them.\n\nAlso, you do not need to decide your life direction right now. Treat coding like a low cost experiment. Spend a few months building small things. Automate something in your daily life. Analyze some data. If you find yourself losing track of time while doing it, that is signal.\n\nThe bigger win here might not be the skill itself. It is the habit of choosing deliberate practice over passive scrolling.

And no matter how hard you study or what you accomplish, one person can’t know every language or navigate legacy code (in a single day) you have to maintain.  AI gets a lot of hate, but…just being honest, you either stay on top of it or lose your job.  You WILL learn the fundamentals and more because it’s the smart way to go.  AI isn’t something you need to become a slave to.  It’s something you use so you don’t get stuck.  \n\nI’m still very much a beginner.  I’m pretty solid with Python, but I’m not good with flask or SQLite, which is something I need at the moment.  So I need a lot of help in that area along with building a web UI.  My main problem with using AI is that AI isn’t really good for niche, edge-case applications.  So I spend more time prototyping so I can capture the logic of what I want to do at every step along the way before writing the prompt.  The flask route seems really straightforward to me, but I have to connect overything over HTML, JS, and CSS.  \n\nFor me, AI has really democratized programming and allowed me to do things I couldn’t do before.  I can get stuff done and still learn as I go.  AI hasn’t been all that helpful in troubleshooting.  My personal rule is AI has three chances to get something right.  If I can’t get what I need after three prompts, it’s tome to break down the logic and code in smaller steps.",

Where AI can be useful is bouncing ideas or questions off it. If you don't understand something, then you can use an LLM to help you gain that knowledge. Maybe you wrote a thing and it all kind of fell apart and you're not sure why - an LLM can give you some guidance.\n\nDon't become dependant on the models. If you find yourself asking the same questions over and over, that's a sign you're not retaining the knowledge. Treat the models like an interactive version of Stack Overflow that won't be snarky and lock your questions.\n\nAs long as you are internalising the knowledge through actual practice writing code, then LLMs are just another tool you can use. Don't ever ask them to implement features for you. Use them as tools to get instant feedback on the code you write and your understanding of concepts. Also remember they can be stupid and wrong! That's also an important step in learning - when you realise you understand something better than an LLM, or some bozo on the internet 😺",

It is a more specialized field. Even in current boom and that companies want these engineers the hype is dwindling down and the market for new AI / ML engineers will become smaller for the next few years. Most likely Software Engineers will be creating tools that are AI wrappers with foundation models with a RAG or post-model training. You will likely need regular Software Engineer XP to make these things good.\n\nAlso ML and AI engineers are a bit different. If you plan to make wrapper, RAG tools based on foundation models you will still benefit from good Software Engineer skills.\n\n.NET Software Engineer: Established ecosystem and jobs. There are many tools that need to be expanded or maintained or even new tools to be created that attach to the current ecosystem of a certain company. There are multiple tools, languages that do a better job than the current common choices in the market. The established ecosystem, documentation, information, experience and hiring pool make it hard to change to a tool. That applies also to AI. There are 20 ways to skin a cat and AI is just another way to skin the cat (create software).\n\nIn reality. You should look into the regions you plan to work at and what technology is needed. It might be smarter to learn Java with Spring boot or Node.js. There are also many related tools you will need to learn that are framework agnostic, for example PostgreSQL or MySQL and not forgetting good fundamentals and more theoretical stuff. Also the fact there are so many tools in the software market and it is hard to stand out nowadays therefore it is also smart to develop some social skills. Social skills are half of the game in the market. Communicating in a team is very important.",

But here's the thing  I don't think it has to be either/or.  \nThe .NET job market is real and stable. Enterprise companies need .NET devs constantly, and the barrier to entry is more predictable: learn C#, build CRUD apps, get hired. AI/ML has a higher ceiling but also a higher floor you need solid math, Python, and often a portfolio of projects just to get noticed.  \n honest take for 2026: learn the fundamentals well in whatever excites you more (motivation matters a LOT when you're grinding through the hard parts), but make sure you understand how AI tools work regardless of which path you pick. Every .NET dev is going to need to integrate AI features soon, and every ML engineer needs to ship production code.  \nThe best position is someone who can do both, even if you specialize in one.",

But I also know plenty of developers who prefer getElementById, because they don't have to remember to add the '#' symbol every time. And then they only switch to querySelector for more complicated things.\n\n*Btw: I love all the arguments about one being \"faster\" than the other - and I'm willing to bet that if selecting elements is the bottleneck that hampers performance in an app, then you probably have bigger problems than that! Also, I'd like to see an example - a real world example, not a fake made up example of selecting 4 quadrillion elements - of one being slower or faster than the other :)*",

Secure systems still need to be designed, and applications still need people who understand architecture, data flow, and tradeoffs. If you’re unsure, I’d think about whether you enjoy building features and user facing stuff, or digging into threat models and failure scenarios.\n\nYou can pivot later from full stack into security with some focused learning.

That is awesome for reasoning, resource bounds, and making performance predictable, but it also means you do not get general recursion or unbounded while loops without adding extra machinery. From a formal methods angle, that is a feature, not a bug, if you lean into it.\n\nIf you allow unbounded loops or something like “loop until condition,” you are basically back to general purpose computation, and then the “loop centric” part is more about ergonomics and how you restrict or structure control flow.\n\nTwo framing ideas that might help your design doc land with people: what is the smallest set of constructs you need besides loops (variables, arithmetic, conditionals), and what property do you want to guarantee (termination, time/space bounds, ease of verification). If you can say “Gamma Loop is intentionally total” or “intentionally resource bounded,” that becomes a clear conceptual advantage rather than just a vibe.\n\nAlso, if you have even a tiny spec for the loop form and what is forbidden, folks can give much sharper feedback.

For example, if the sides are 1, 2, and 500, that's not a valid triangle, but also, none of the sides are equal, so if you check for \"scalene\" before \"not a triangle\", you'll incorrectly return \"scalene\".\n\n2) A, B, and C are not guaranteed to be sorted in any order. You don't know which one is the longest or the shortest. So you can only brute-force check every combination of A B and C, to see if two of the sides are equal and the third one isn't.",

Start with the person with the most rankings, and schedule their pairings, with the highest ranked other person in the first time slot. Then the next person, similarly. If a timeslot is taken, you just move to the next. If the next paired person isn't available in the given timeslot, you postpone them; I think the best option is to put them last in the queue, if that makes sense.\n\nYou can also optimise differently in order to finish the people with fewer pairings sooner, so they can leave when they're done.

There are online compilers you can use from a browser once you have access. The key early on is writing and running real code, not just reading about it.\n\nAs for where to start, pick one structured path and stick with it instead of jumping between ten. Consistency beats the perfect roadmap. Beyond coding, learn problem solving, debugging, and how software actually gets built in teams. Version control, reading other people’s code, and breaking problems into small pieces are huge skills.\n\nSince you are into art, that can actually be an advantage. Frontend, UI work, or even game dev later on are still possible paths. You do not have to decide your whole future right now. Just start building small things and see what you enjoy.",

Or do you just wnat to learn programming, as is the case more often when this questions is asked and the name of the sub.\n\nIf you really want Computer Science, there is no quick fix for \"mathematical thinking, specifically just treating numbers and such for their own sake\". You will have to get through that. If books are to dry for you, I would instead suggest getting a university lecture for maths for computer science specifically. [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) I think I skimmed this one for an answer here already, and it looked okay. (I mean it's MIT, it's probably not bad) From my experience, University level maths courses can be done without any prerequisite, except the willingness to spent a lot of time. Everything will be explained once, any everything is built up from the foundations (axioms). (at least that was the case at my university, I didn't actually watch this course in full)\n\nIf you really only want to program and are worried that you need maths for that: don't. Just start, and if you happen upon a concept that requires maths, go and learn that, and only that.\n\nEDIT: Since you probably never had mathematics at university: It's hard work, but you don't actually need to be especially bright for the basics. It requires a lot of practice, as it basically teaches you a different way of thinking, which is required for computer science. Learning CS really is just learning a different way of thinking, and the only way to do that is to repeatedly bash your head into a wall until you break through. The wall is made of bricks. You don't have a helmet.\n\nEDIT2: Another advantage of lectures over books is that you get exercises / assignments to go with them. Even if they will not be graded for you",

Assuming you knew they existed and were they were hidden. It was not a good idea and didn’t last long.\n\nThere’ a few HCI problems with the idea. Hidden non-noob features have no perceivable affordances, so users can’t discover them. When they are hidden behind the noob shield users can’t just gradually start to use more and more features. They have to remove the shield and then the UI looks entirely different than what they are used to.\n\nI don’t think the quantity of features even really creates issues. A powerful app will by necessity have a lot of features when it’s a tool for professional’s inherently complex work. That userbase can deal with having to learn the app’s basic functions while being exposed to the existence of other more advanced functions.\n\nThe subscriptions maximizing UX focus of trying to make e.g. Figma accessible for every stakeholder is plain damaging to the core user base.

        "body": "One thing worth remembering is *why* Ruby and Rails were huge. It goes something like:\n\nAt the time, backends were *huge* clunky things built out of Java, maybe .NET, and sometimes mainframes and COBOL. That means tons of Java-isms -- better bake a serial number into all of your classes in case you use native Java serialization to save sessions, but also you need an ORM with fifteen XML config files just so the ORM knows to set the `email` property to the `email` column, and that the `users` table goes to the `User` class. Except wait, you don't set the `email` property, you call `setEmail()` on the `User` class. And you don't create a `new User()`, you call a method on a `UserFactory`, which you need to get from the AbstarctDefaultFactoryImpl or whatever. And this isn't even Java 8, even a *simple* Java list looks like:\n\n    List<String> emails = new ArrayList<String>();\n\nYep, repeat `String` twice and `List` twice and generally be the most verbose, repetitive thing anyone had ever seen until Go gave us `if err != nil { return err; }` after every goddamned line.\n\nOr, at the other extreme, there was the LAMP stack -- stupidly-sloppy messes hacked together with Perl and PHP, the kind of thing people were building blogs out of. Wordpress was maybe the state of the art. PHP is a whole programming language that grew out of a glorified template language, so any notion of separating the view from the model was not really happening -- this is a world where you're taking some static HTML thing you built in DreamWeaver, renaming `.html` to `.php`, and adding a mysql query right to the middle of it with `<?php ... ?>` tags. IMO this explains a lot of why Facebook is the way it is -- it grew out of a tool that was built for adding a guestbook and a hit counter to your Geocities homepage.\n\nSo Rails did a couple things: It cut out a ton of the boilerplate with \"convention over configuration\" -- if you have a `Users` model class and a `users` DB table, Rails can figure out that those are supposed to go together, and you only need to add configuration when you have something that doesn't fit the very obvious pattern. Ruby cut out more of the boilerplate by not making you repeat your type names five million times. It gave you a CLI tool that generates a working Rails project for you instantly, makes it super easy to get started filling in the blanks. It gives you enough structure that you're probably not building your whole app inside the HTML view like you would in PHP. On top of that, Ruby was a nicer language than most of the competition -- PHP and Perl are both pretty ugly, and Java doesn't even have lambdas.\n\nOther replies have pointed out things that made Rails less relevant -- more microservices and fewer monoliths, more web APIs and React and such instead of pure CRUD at the HTML level. But I think it's also because a lot of the basic ideas Rails had either ended up going way too far -- to do that `User`<->`users` mapping, every Rails server needed a complex set of rules on how to pluralize English words! -- or ended up not being necessary for what they were trying to do. Like, turns out with decent type inference (Typescript, Golang), you can do strong, static typing and not constantly have to repeat yourself. Java and even C++ got lambdas, `var` and `auto`, and other basic quality of life code-level stuff.",

IT strongly focuses on Networks, servers, traffic, databases (which is a bit businessy), etc. The programming tends to focus on more automation type stuff similar to CIS. \n\nSome colleges have different curriculums for these courses, others don’t really and you can take any classes. It’s just a big toss up. That’s why almost all job posts have CS, CIS, CIT, IT, or other tech related field. Even if they don’t, it’s usually just implied. Someone with a CS degree that has an oracle box virtual home lab setup, has maybe messed with their home network, and builds computers would obviously be strong contender for Helpdesk. Vise Versa, someone with an IT degree built their own small OS in Rust, maybe has another project developing their own language from C++, and maybe does science and math simulations in OpenGL then they’d obviously be a strong candidate for a true entry level (0-3 years experience, unlike the 3-5 we see now) low level software engineering position.\n\nSo, all of this to say, it just really depends. They 100% have their differences and should be recognized for that. In the world of experience trumping everything, it doesn’t even matter which is why I can see these roles asking for any tech bachelors.",

They know how to market themselves and how to fit in well in a new job. Getting a job is a simple process to them.\n\nThe weaker engineers who want to get a job, cruise, hope for an easy paycheck, can't contribute to technical discussions well, and feel entitled to a job because they have 8 years on the job? They will not survive without reflection and adjustments.\n\nBut now the average senior engineers are in a new market. During the COVID mass hirings they were golden, they were in the \"good\" half by default. You could get the job done and that was great. Unfortunately, the bar has been raised where that's no longer the case. You *need* to be a good engineer or by default you are a poor one.\n\nAt my work, I have seen the engineers I loved working with get a new, higher paying role just because it fell on their plate in a LinkedIn message and they decided to go through the process, nail it in 3 weeks, and put in their 2 weeks notice shortly after. Similarly, I have seen the engineers I detest working with, constantly argue and are not fun to be around, make the same mistakes constantly, etc. complain about how the market is dead and they can't find a new position anywhere.\n\nWho you are and where you fall in these categories is really up to you.

After 1 year, they finally placed me on a project, as the project lead, working with an obscure hardware vendor, no documentation, and as the only member of the team.\n\nI asked for help or more time to finish the task, the manager refused to change the 1-month deadline he imposed, I got reprimanded harshly in front of other employees, forced to come in during weekends until we could finish the project (longest week of my life), and lastly, terminated for gross underperformance the moment the project was delivered by a smart programmer (and as far as I am aware, I was the only person to ever be fired in that team).\n\nThe hiring manager even confessed to me personally that he wanted to yell at me, but was holding back, and asked me if I could stop talking in exchange for not yelling at me (this was in response to a brief, polite, and professional answer I gave to him in response to a question he addressed to me).\n\nI was applying for jobs for 2 years with no success after that, bringing my total unemployed after graduating count to 4 years (goodbye self-esteem \\~).\n\nI saw a job posting for a GPU Software Engineer position (pfft I can't do that!), I applied out of spite.  Desperation can drive someone to make very illogical actions.\n\nI have a job that pays more than double than my previous employer, they give me free sodas, and everyone is really nice to me (despite the fact that I suck balls as a problem solver).  This job is too good for me and all my income goes straight into my chipmunk cheeks.  The company itself is ancient, stable, all about technology/computers (it's neither Nvidia nor AMD).  Given that it's a GPU job, I used C++ both on the role and to persuade my interviewers (I **hate** higher\\* level languages).\n\nIt's fine if you don't consider it a solid career (because I'd agree).\n\nMy current compensation as a junior is $200k\n\nI'm posting this in hopes that it will make an unemployed soul out there feel a little better today.\n\nOh, and they also take us out to eat for free every once in a while and have around \\~5 company holidays (in addition to the normal holidays).  It's so cool.  I'm going to bleed this company dry and hopefully become smarter by the time I have to return to the job hunt.",

Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing. It is the belief in what it will do later that keeps the bubble so strong; if several PhD level papers come out showing we're not even close... that will probably kill the bubble.\n\nAnd of course, that probably won't happen for a while. The folks who would do such research are also largely funded by the people who need the bubble to continue.\n\nThis is normal for an immature technology. What is NOT normal, is thinking the technology is going to replace everyone, without actually proving it can, and everyone hedging their bets on this happening anyways.\n\nCompanies like Apple are probably going to be the big winners at the end of this. They're not firing their teams and replacing them with unproven AI. And at this point in time, it is looking more and more like AI usage just shifts the bottleneck further down the line rather than eliminates it (as far as automated programming goes).\n\nSince the changes it makes can be breaking and it has no accountability, a lot of devs are being forced into code review for thousands upon thousands of changes. It is likely to lead to unstable software, with limited ability to diagnose and maintain, even if companies increase headcount. You just cannot fit the context of the changes into your head fast enough to tell when the AI is doing something dumb.\n\nAs such, the workflow we're accustomed to is not very accommodating to AI autonomous changes... until it can actually take over dev jobs, which is still a long time away.\n\nSite Reliability Engineers and Cybersecurity developers are going to feast.",

Keep in mind that a lot of recruiters are not very literate in terms of tech (as weird as that may be), and so to them it looks like a lot of jargon. I'd really suggest formatting your bullet points like this: (1) what you did, (2) in layman's terms what impact it had (business metrics here a plus), and (3) optionally mention the tech used. \n\nSecond, unless those non-work projects you did are very meaningful or impactful, then I'd suggest getting rid of them and use the space to add more bullet points to your work experience. Anyone off the street can create a school-level project with AI. Business impact is key. \n\nLast, keep applying and practicing. Take whatever you can get. Don't be picky. Target smaller companies.",

There are two separate hiring processes in big tech, and you fall in the gap between them. \n\nEntry-level hiring at big tech is done through the college hire pipeline. You still qualify as a college hire as you are within one year of graduation. You graduated from an Ivy League university- try to get in touch with the college recruiters from large companies assigned to your school. They can help you get back into the college hire funnel.\n\nIndustry hiring generally begins with SDE 2/mid- level roles which require 2-3 years of experience. Which you don’t have. You can still apply for these roles at large companies but you’ll need referrals to get you past the automated resume screen that will see your 6mo of experience and peace out. Reach out to your previous lead and manager at Amazon, as well as people you worked with, friends, mentors. You don’t need to feel close to people to reach out. Send them your resume and ask them to send it to people in their network who may be hiring. Ask your friends to ask their boss if there is an opening in their org. Meet up for lunch, send a message from linked in. Reach out reach out reach out.\n\nThe other approach that works well in this situation is to apply to startups and smaller companies. These companies don’t have established hiring processes so there is more flexibility. ",

They will hire based on what they need for the role. If the role leaning to front end they will ask more about frontend. The cv won’t change that. So just keep your cv truthful. There’s a lot of backend leaning full stack positions and you fit that, don’t apply to front end leaning positions.\n\nBlazor is definitely used and I do see some positions for it. It’s more used in enterprise applications , which I doubt you can get hired as a senior without ever working in that scale before.",

Your 8 years of keeping a production app running is honestly more valuable than most people realize bc that shows you understand the full lifecycle, can handle real user problems, and know how to maintain code over time. The fact that you've dealt with race conditions, auth systems, and layered architecture tells me you're not just copying tutorials.\n\nFor the interview prep, I'd brush up on basic SQL optimization, maybe review some common C# patterns, and be ready to walk through your architecture decisions on your main project. They'll probably ask you to solve a simple coding problem, but it's more likely to be \"write a method that does X\" rather than dynamic programming puzzles. As for the full stack vs backend question, honestly your Blazor experience might be more of an asset than you think as lots of .NET shops are curious about it but don't have anyone who actually knows it well. I wouldn't pivot away from mentioning it, especially since it shows you can handle the whole stack when needed. Small companies love that versatility because they don't have huge teams. The 2.5k salary is solid for a first industry role, especially remote from LATAM, and once you have that professional experience on your resume everything gets easier.",

It may take a LONG time to pay off (jobs are especially hard to get right now) but eventually it will succeed. Hopefully you'll find a position that is better than this one.\n\nIn the meantime, there might be ways for you to work around the problem within your current organization. This advice will be appropriate for some companies and not for others so consider your situation before applying it.\n\nSounds like you've effectively been \"demoted\" by being assigned less valuable work. Also sounds like you aren't being given enough work to actually challenge you (\"haven’t touched a line of code in 2.5 months\" \"just got assigned the most absurdly simple defect\"). Maybe you should go ahead and \"promote\" yourself without asking for permission.\n\nFigure out who at the company WANTS the system rebuild that you thought was a good idea (\"rebuilding the existing native application with my language of expertise that I’ve worked with & loved my entire career\"). Maybe this is a product manager outside of the tech world, maybe it's a VP who doesn't have the clout to get things moving. (If there isn't anyone who wants this done... maybe it shouldn't be!) Talk with this person. Say that you aren't being challenged in your current position and you have some free time. Offer to build what they are looking for as a \"Proof of concept\". Invest some time and just BUILD the darn thing (it's amazing how much faster a \"skunkworks\" project can go. If you succeed, maybe you end up as the tech lead for the project (which would consist of releasing the \"POC\" that you built).\n\nAs I said, it's not the right solution for all companies, but it CAN be effective in some places. And it doesn't sound like you are especially worried about annoying your current manager.\n\nSometimes, the way to stop being a mid-level SWE is to stop behaving like a mid-level SWE and start behaving like a senior SWE.",

If you need that extra edge as you look for a business that really values your knowledge, it might be worth a shot.",

Maybe someone is willing to meet up for a coffee and give you some tips about your local job market.\n\nAre there any local, in-person developer groups you could join?\n\nThe more active you can be at looking to connect with different people the better.\n\nIt’s not usually a natural thing for CS folks like us :) but when it’s about interesting projects or programming topics then you can’t shut us up :)",

Then spend 1.5 - 3 years at your next 2-3 jobs until you find something that has good pay / culture alignment. The only reason, I suggest you don’t leave your current role earlier, is that you don’t want to distract yourself from the degree.

Idk how your experience has been with your current company, but my biggest takeaway from being at the position I am at currently is that you should switch jobs when you feel you knowledge has stagnated (as in not learning much) or you prefer to go in a different direction in your field (switching from a Full Stack Engineer to say a Back End Developer).\n\nIt also appears getting past the 2 year mark is pretty much the golden rule. Now depending on how much you are learning or if you have stagnated, the 2 year mark could be a good indicator to look at how far you have come since starting and analyze how much you have learned. I specifically plan on getting to around the 3 year mark before I start applying to much higher paying position. Be it, I am only a few minutes from my house currently and don't have a house, car, or kids to worry about in terms of big monthly payments. \n\nWhatever you do end up doing, do not just quit your job and hope to get picked up elsewhere fast! When I graduated college in 2023, it took roughly 10-11 months before I got the position I am in currently. Just be aware that when you do start looking, it could be another full year till you find that next job. ",

It really depends on how much friction you want your next job search to be. It's easy to remain in the defense ecosystem, especially if you have a clearance, because getting interviews/callbacks from other defense contractors is much easier after having a proven track record in defense. It's also a very comfortable job outside of the work aspect; a 9/80 work schedule is game changing if you are in company that does that and the slow work pace can be relaxing. I honestly don't think I'll ever attain that same level of WLB anywhere else outside of defense after this. I will definitely consider defense again when I am older and ready to just coast to retirement. I think these factors are huge reason people get stuck in defense; it's what I've seen from my older, high tenured colleagues do and people that have left my company to go to other defense companies.\n\nI will say that defense is varied and even teams within the same company can have wildly different directives and experiences. I was fortunate to be in a team that got to do really cool stuff that also had a more relaxed pace, and I still got to learn a lot about SWE at the same time. Some of my colleagues that got placed into the big money maker team in my company were working left and right on different projects every month from what it seemed like. My recommendation is that you give this a fair shot for 1-2 years and make an adjustment if needed.\n\nYou may actually enjoy the work you do and discover that your team isn't as slow or not productive for learning as you may initially thought, or you completely hit the mark on your initial assessment. As a general life advice, use this opportunity to really isolate what you want from a job, and align your next actions to directly support that goal and don't compromise it just because it's easy. If you want out, commit to finding a job that fits your desired career track or work towards joining a top company that can give you that clout you need to work at your end goal role. Going for what is easy to get is how you really get stuck in a niche.",

If I know I didn't have a good explanation of a detail on my resume, I can brainstorm a few and practice them until they sound natural.  Or if I flubbed a coding section, practice it.  Look up the questions I didn't know.\n\nI guess you can try to read between the lines of the little feedback you did get too.  Like if your profile was impressive, they might have thought your performance didn't match their expectations (for that experience or title before).\n\nOr ask for very broad suggestions on places to improve.  It could be near the end of the interview itself, before the decisions.  Maybe even offering ideas yourself to make it easy for them to parrot it back if you're worried about bothering them.  And to show where you think you could best improve.\n\nMaybe I've just gotten enough experience finally, but \"culture fit\" (and confidence) has felt really important for a lot of my previous interviews.  Do you fit in.  Are you like us.  Can I work with you, and do I want to.  Information can be learned.  New tools often are like other tools (new dialect).

I don’t know if HR sends generic rejections or just ghosts you if we reject.\n\nPhone round - I stopped doing this because i felt it’s pretty useless, it was useful screening tool when we didn’t do virtual interviews and instead had in person interviews. Generally I go over work experience, poke around some technical areas, see if you know what you’re talking about or if the resume was exaggerated. Also good opportunity for both parties to calibrate expectations, so we aren’t wasting eachother’s time. Then wrap up with LC easy question, my go to is a graph search algorithm.\n\nOnsite/Virtual final round - now this highly depends on the role. For IC I usually do system design round, for other EMs, I’ve done system design and roadmap planning and strategic vision. Main reason I’ve failed people who solved the system design was due to lack of depth in understanding. It’s very clear when they’re regurgitating from a video they’ve seen rather than make live trade off decisions and ask clarifying questions. Did I really say speed was necessary? Or do we care about accuracy and freshness of data? Why are you adding a cache? Did you clarify the DAU and types of requests to be confident in your cache hit rate? You get the picture. For EM side, it’s usually their examples from their previous job lacks the scope we were looking for. “How did you drive alignment across the organization? How many teams were involved? Did you come up with a proposal for leadership? How much coordination tax would this take? What is the risk if we don’t complete?”\n\nTL;DR - we’re human, your interviewer needs to like you and you need to fit their similarity bias. Most rejections are because someone better applied, more knowledgeable, better work experience, and just had a good day.",

There are plenty of resources online to learn at your own pace, but if you don't want to teach yourself then that's not a good option.\n\n\"Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree\" Gunna be honest, this is sounds super hypocritical to say right before you talk about how your old major project was completely vibe coded. Maybe you would learn something if you had to build the same project without Claude. It's super easy to understand code especially code that Claude writes. It's a whole lot harder to think of that logic and write code from the ground up. Think about how easy it is to read a book and how much more difficult it would be to write a book.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, it looks like you don't like CS but kept going with the degree and now don't want the last 4 years to be a waste. If I were you, I would really consider what you want your job to look like. I only have 2 YOE and I spend my days sitting in a cubical doing full stack development. In this time, I have learned that real world coding is very different from the fun projects I had during college, so now I'm getting a master's to pivot into a data analytics field. I had a couple data driven projects during this time and realized it was way more enjoyable. However, I also know that I don't have the discipline to self-study without the fear of an exam or project deadline so that's why I am getting the masters.\n\nIll end with this, you're not alone at all. Over half of my friends that graduated with a CS degree went into a different field that involved no coding. One is in audio/visual, one is training to be a pilot, another a scada engineer. While yes, it's a bit demoralizing to pivot a career right after graduation, it's much better than being stuck in a role you hate.",

You might benefit from something that gives you small applied tasks in sequence instead of learn everything about data. Happy to share some resources if helpful",

It seems like everyone recognizes that quality is declining across the board, and yet the trend of trying to push it off on individuals who have little to no passion for it continues. All the focus is on speed, and testing goes out the window. On the flip side, deploying changes only gets cheaper and cheaper, so production issues are viewed as less of a liability -- until you have a $10,000,000 issue.\n\nMy hope is the eroding quality issues and disruption risk of the modern landscape will make quality somewhat a competitive advantage moving forward. Any team who has had effective quality advocates guiding processes and shifting quality concerns left/bringing the quasi-adversarial perspective knows the value they bring to a team/org. Alas, no idea if this will come to be.",

If you want a prestige boost, then having Georgia Tech on the resume might be good, otherwise, likely not worth it.\n\nThe knowledge is somewhat useful day to day in that as a graduate student in a lab I was a lot more like a full-time employee than I was during my internships. The coursework is what you make of it, I took a few RF classes that ended up being useful in my job. I could’ve learned that stuff on the fly though. \n\nI finished undergrad in three years, and used my masters year as my senior year. (Still lived in my frat house, etc lmao) Fully worth it for me, as it was funded by a lab and I got to drink a lot more beer with only two courses a term, but I would not have paid extra for it and would not have stayed in school longer.",

Engineer time is *expensive*. Claude has read the C++ spec in full, I have not, every time I have a finnicky template meta-programming task it saves me 2-3 hours once I have a good definition of what I want the unit to do. But I'm still fairly underwhelmed by how it handles most tasks without quite a bit of guidance from me.\n\nIf I had to put numbers on it, I'd say that *of actual heads-down dev time* (which is probably only 8-10 hrs/wk at best!) it's probably a 10-15% productivity boost for me.

Promotions from Associate to mid and mid to Senior require only a \"budget confirmation\" in business justification, there is a maximum amount we can spend on promotions each year. In my experience, we've never exceeded that budget so these promotions always pass their business justification.\n\nStarting with senior to staff, then staff to principal and principal to senior principal the business justification becomes stricter.  Staff is defined as a role that works \"across teams\", usually within an org.  Principal is inter-org work and sr. principal is company level work.  We must justify why we need individuals operating in those roles.  For Staff it's not too bad, we produce a list of they type of work and project work that requires tech/engineering focus aligning teams (usually building something global/working directly with internal customer teams etc etc).\n\nPrincipal and Sr. Principal things get much harder.  There's really not that much work at that level. My org of 100 has one principal, who focuses on cross-org database work, and one principal who is working torwards sr. Principal by focusing on aligning our entire orgs tech with other org tech leads.  I really have no need for more than that.\n\nI have about 10 Staff engineers however, some recently promoted into that role from Senior. (We do a lot of inter-team work/support). They are all told if they want to make principal, it is /unlikely/ they will get the role within our current org (we'd either have to double in size, not likely, or one of the two principals would have to leave and require a backfill).\n\nFor those staff engineers that want to \"grow\" by title change I encourage my managers to do several things. First, keep a constant eye on opening roles in the company, anything principal they should consider having their staff report apply to it and be considered. Likewise there are some other career paths, such as engineering manager (if they want to stop focusing on being an Individual contributor) or even other leadership roles (technical program manager etc). And lastly, yes, it is not a crime if my managers support their staff engineers in their next career step outside the company (referrals, helping be a career mentor, assessing other jobs etc). \n\nAll of this is to say, yes, at some point, a \"promotion\" must consider business need, and that business need should get harder the more senior the role is.  Managers should focus on the realities and be aware that sometimes growing people means having them leave the team or company, but it should happen at more senior levels.\n\nIf your company doesn't have good definitions of what various levels of engineers should be doing for the company, I'd start there.",

Now, early career, you can generally show \"yes, we need person at L+1, we expect our L to grow into that role\", but major career transitions (Senior, or Staff) generally require a business need.\n\nIn many companies, this is actually hidden by the modern practice of retrospective promotion, where you promote people after they demonstrate a sustained performance of L+1. Since there was L+1 work for them to do to demonstrate that, it is a lot easier to demonstrate a need. \n\nBut it is also normal for people to be in a position where there are no career growth opportunities for them on their current team, or even at their current company. After all, if the company has a CTO, and you are ready to take on a CTO role, you are probably going to have to leave. A good manager helps employees realize that and make that transition.\n\nThink about it this way, if you tried to open up a new headcount for a Senior or Staff level role, would you be able to justify it with the work your team has to do? If you could, you can make the case for a promotion. If you can't, then people looking to go to Senior or Staff need to leave your team anyway, because even if you did promote them, their reviews would inherently be awful because they would have no ability to demonstrate performance at level.

Is there a need for someone to increase the scope of work they’re during and provide further technical value to a line of business? If so, make that argument and push for a promotion. If not, that’s just an honest assessment of the business’ needs. The way I see it, if a team’s responsibilities evolve then the needs of the team change and it’s up to the manager to facilitate that change.\n\nThink of it this way:\nYou have a business and all you sell are apples and the market only has a demand for 100 apples a year. Would you care if your employee was skilled enough to sell 100 vs 1000 apples? Probably not, right? As long as they fill the gap, there’s no incentive to cut further into your profits.\n\nYour decision to stay or leave is fully up to you.

Remember: There are more than just 1000 companies in the world that are powered by applications—custom or out-of-the-box.\n\nI'm not saying titles don't matter—they do, they gate a lot of things including but not limited to your dating life—but if you want to level up your skill, that's a lot more of a different thing than just saying \"I want to move up to Senior Backend.\" ",

This might mean you’ll get more bites at the apple, but it absolutely will not be a fix if you’re a poor interviewer.\n\nIf you’re going to do a masters degree, it should be some sort of specialization. A general CS masters is basically what you learned in your bachelors, and definitely not very additive. \n\nI think programs in AI or Cybersecurity could be additive, or a masters program in CS that specializes in one of those (since those can be argued as additive)",

Unless Android is truly your passion, I wouldn't commit to only applying to android roles. This career is a lot about luck and taking opportunities where they come. \n\nFrom my experience leetcode, networking, and career fairs with the goal of an internship are likely going to be a better use of time than diving deep into mobile dev.

I don't know how often timing was an issue in my Q4 2025 job search because I don't have visibility into whether I failed a resume screen or they chose someone else, although I got offers from companies where the job posting had been up for months and where they took up to two months to get back to me.\n\n3.

The screening process feels so disconnected from actual job performance, especially when you're more direct or don't play the corporate small talk game well. I've noticed this pattern too where founders tend to hire differently than HR departments do.\n\nTo answer your questions: I do bookmark companies but honestly it's pretty manual and messy. I use a basic spreadsheet to track applications because most job platforms are terrible for this. Timing is huge though, I've definitely gotten rejections that felt like they already had someone in mind before posting. The ghosting stats would actually be super valuable, like if I knew a company had a 70% ghost rate I'd probably still apply but adjust my expectations and not put as much energy into customizing everything.\n\nThe biggest BS right now is probably the AI resume screening stuff. You're getting filtered out by algorithms before any human even sees your application, and nobody tells you why. It's this black box where you could be perfect for the role but get rejected because you didn't use the right keywords or format. Companies are posting jobs they're not even seriously trying to fill, just collecting resumes or satisfying some internal requirement.\n\nSuper cool bc I'm also building something in this space too (called Sprout) because the whole system feels broken. We're trying to give people more visibility into company response patterns and help optimize applications for these screening systems. But honestly the real problem is that hiring has become this weird theater where everyone's pretending the process makes sense when it clearly doesn't.\n\nWhat specific automation stuff have you seen people build? I'm curious about the more elaborate setups you mentioned.",

I think the bigger issue isn't just *how* you search, it's that you're fighting a volume game where everyone else is spending 2 hours per application while you're doing the same, which mathematically means you can only reach like 10-15 companies a month max before burnout hits. The unconventional approach that's actually working for people now is automating the repetitive parts without losing quality.\n\nNot talking about spammy mass-blast stuff, but actually letting software handle the grunt work of finding roles that match your criteria, customizing your materials for each ATS, and submitting at scale so you can focus energy on the companies that actually respond. I've heard really good things about SimpleApply for this exact use case since it handles the end-to-end application process and lets you reach way more opportunities without spending 40 hours a week on form filling. To answer your actual questions though: I track in a spreadsheet (Notion got too heavy), I absolutely would skip companies with 70% ghost rates if I knew that data, and the biggest BS right now is take-home assignments that are clearly just free consulting work.\n\nThe fact that we're all pretending 8-hour unpaid projects are normal interview steps is insane. good luck with your product btw, sounds like you're tackling real pain",

On one of my worst projects in terms of hours, I lost weight because I was very mindful of my diet and how I dealt with stress. We’re all human, though. I’m not sure where the cutoff is between discipline and caving. Probably flexible and impacted by a lot of different factors. For me, personally, there have been times a switch went off for whatever reason. Perhaps a visual representation of the behavior spurs action more quickly.\n\nI think burnout is a different beast from smaller actions related to cognitive load. \n\nInteresting to see Monday your biggest food ordering day.

Just trying to go remote as the 5 day RTO has been really frustrating although it’s been about a year since my employer moved to 5 days in the office.\n\nAs someone with a little more than 2.5 YOE and a masters degree in CS, I’ve been applying to jobs that require anywhere between 3-4 YOE as my current level at my current job is for 4 YOE. I’ve applied for 60+ roles so far, ended up getting 2 interviews from random recruiters reaching out to me (not related to the roles I’ve applied to and they’ve got 5 days in the office but they come with a significant pay increase) and one of them just ghosted me. I’m still interviewing with the other one. It was worse when I was looking for an internship and new grad roles",
