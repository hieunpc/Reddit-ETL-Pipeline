Often I would concede to a different design, and after some time the team would arrive at what dimensional modelling advises. E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said \"well Kimball advises against this because its trouble\" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.\n\nIt is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data. Now we have the cloud and storage is less limited. Our mental capacity still is limited, so it is easier to reason about facts and dimensions in separation, rather than a 100-column big table.\n\n...and what about many to many?",

Since people are going to suspect LLMs anyway, I used one to try to reorganize it.\n\nI would probably add some testing too.\n\n---\n\n# Data Engineering Pipeline Checklist\n\n## 1. Requirements First\n- **SLA**: How fresh? (minutes/hours/daily) Daily reporting → no streaming needed\n- **Impact**: Cost of being late/wrong?\n- **Consumer**: Dashboards, ML, reporting?\n\n## 2. Architecture\n\n**Single source of truth**: One storage layer (warehouse/lakehouse/object storage). Everything reads from it.\n\n**Batch over streaming**: Streaming adds complexity (ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills). Default to batch unless real-time is essential.\n\n**Design for backfills**: Parameterized date ranges, versioned transforms, separate raw/modeled layers.\n\n## 3. Reliability\n\n**Idempotency**: Jobs must be safely rerunnable via partitioned outputs, overwrite-by-partition/merge strategies, deterministic keys.\n\n**Orchestration**: Use Airflow/Dagster/Prefect for retries, dependencies, visibility, parameterized runs. Avoid \"cron spaghetti.\"\n\n\n## 4. Observability\n\n**Minimum to prevent silent failures**:\n- Row counts/volume checks\n- Freshness checks\n- Schema drift alerts\n- Job duration tracking\n\n\n## 5. Performance\n\n**Optimize last**. Most slowness comes from bad joins, file layout, or moving too much data—not lack of Spark.\n\n**Fix basics first**: Partitioning, columnar formats, filter pushdown, avoid cartesian joins.\n\n\n## 6. Simplicity Rule\n\n**If your SLA is met with**: scheduler + Python/SQL + storage + basic checks\n\n**Then distributed systems add unnecessary complexity.**\n\n**Use distributed systems when**:\n\n- Volume exceeds single-machine capacity (hundreds GB–TBs)\n- True real-time requirements (sub-minute)\n- Complex streaming aggregations\n- Multiple concurrent consumers need isolation",

Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.\n\nOn the storage side - totally agree on \"one source of truth, columnar, object storage.\" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend. No distributed cluster to babysit, SQL interface, handles GB-to-TB scale without the Spark tax.\n\nThe line I use: if I can run the query on a single node in acceptable time, I don't need a distributed system. Vertical scaling is boring but underrated.",

For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. \n\nBut that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait.

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof. Then go build your application to that architecture. Things will fall into place, and you’ll have a documented trail of why you made decisions. And for streaming itself, just use Spark structured streaming. And if you need to do a backfill have a classic Spark job set up for it. But put these things into a design doc before you even write one line of code, and you can review that design doc with your leadership or other engineers",

It’s a lot to keep in your head.\n\nThat said, I still love it. The newer tools are genuinely interesting, and AI is opening up some cool possibilities. Business folks need someone to make sense of the data chaos, and it’s pretty satisfying to be the one who stitches it together into something useful.\n\nI’ve been director-level for about 15 years and managed to stay pretty hands-on until recently.

A good team and leadership that encourage experimentation and improvement make a huge difference. It’s still a solid career, and one underrated perk is that data folks tend to be closer to business goals and strategy than pure app devs. That context keeps things interesting, at least for me and if you can find a good company to work for.",

I don't think they'll be acquired any time soon.  \n  \nRegarding what I'm seeing, getting a lot of attention lately is the Data + AI stack, and specifically context engineering (e.g. ontologies). Two main choke points for AI deployments are 1) information retrieval, and 2) context management across complex tasks.  \n  \nBack in January 2025 was when I was first hearing about ontologies and context engineering at conferences, and now in December 2025 I'm seeing a lot more articles and thought pieces on this. What typically follows are enterprise POCs where vendors will get first signal of adoption before you start seeing case studies that drive further adoption (if it shows success).\n\nSo I argue 2026 we are going to see a huge emphasis on data modeling for AI, specifically for unstructured JSON data and vector databases.",

Only now they have to adhere to the product owners whims as to how they do things in the product, and how the product owner wants them to do ingestion etc. \n\nOf course this all happens in IT, and the business users who hold all of the business knowledge (how the data is used) are still outside of IT, and the datawarehouse people who could previously work with them directly are now no longer allowed to do so and have to prepare data that is WAY worse to work with for the analysts than what they had in the datawarehouse.",

We haven't implemented a data mesh, though we have talked about it. \n\nA lot of the teams organically adopted systems and contractors and do own their own data. But they aren't generally technical users and there was no governance or standards. And all the data became siloed. \n\nThe central DE team is working to unsilo the data. Our goal is to eventually create data standards and enforce them so the data is actually a good quality. This is a slow process, but I'm optimistic. \n\nThe central BI team does seem to have a problem with scale. At my company, most of the functional users don't have BI experts and can't use PBI - at least nowhere near the quality that the BI team does. However, the BI team moves quite slowly to produce the reporting. The result is that functional teams build their own custom, low governance, reporting off the centralized data out of necessity. By the time BI develops the right tools, the business doesn't need it anymore and doesn't want to switch. \n\nMy untested idea is to give the business access to easy to use cloud based dashboarding tools (like Sigma for example). Then BI provides support, underlying data models, and connectivity to non enterprise grade sources like SharePoint. \n\n\nIn short, decentralizing everything without governance cannot work. Centralizing everything without a plan to scale cannot work. A data mesh is the tightrope that attempts to balance this. It is probably the right answer, but the degree of decentralization depends on the company.",

As usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. An architecture is only as good as its adoption. There are plenty of tools, processing patterns, architectures, etc that are excellent if you have the ability, resources, and will to implement them. In reality, the vast majority of companies do not. \n\n\nThe key is to not throw out the baby with the bath water. For every “failed” implementation of Mesh, Agile, Hadoop, etc we’ve had through the years there has been incremental progress, evidenced by the plethora of options we have today to build data engineering stacks and teams to fit the different needs of companies. \n\n\nFor me, data mesh was indicative of a paradigm shift from the old school prescriptive warehouse to a modern democratization enabled and fueled by the cycle of real-world problem solving. Data warehouse, data mart, self serve bi, data lake, data mesh, lakehouse. It’s just an evolution of trying to solve the same(ish) problem. \n\n\nIn conclusion, use what serves you, throw away what doesn’t, take the labels and buzzwords with a grain of salt, and remember that ultimately you are always solving business problems, not data problems.",

We didn’t say we were implementing Data Mesh because few outside IT knew about it or understood it. Instead, our aim was to modernize the data platform, speed up delivery of technical solutions, and empower the business with self-service capabilities and less reliance on the IT organization.\n\nWe were successful in many areas while other elements remained a challenge. For example, we migrated the two largest data platforms from on-premises, self-hosted and managed servers, to native services in the public cloud. Later, we built “lakehouse” capabilities on top of the public cloud platform. These included data governance features, automated data security, and data domains built for key areas of the business such as human resources, marketing, supply chain, etc. The benefits were quite profound. Within the first 2 years we had empowered 50+ business teams. Between year 1 and year 2 we saw 500% growth in teams able to use their data and the platform to create things that matter. Business teams recognized improved decision-making across the enterprise, increased efficiency and cost savings, accelerated speed-to-value for data product creation, and secure data sharing between teams.\n\nWhile we experienced success, the challenges were many. Some teams thought the changes were just another fad IT came up with. Given their prior experiences they were honestly justified in thinking that. Other teams were interested but couldn’t get their leadership to buy in or they didn’t have enough technical chops to harness their domain data on their own. They continued to rely on central IT. Other business teams were so focused on their own projects and demands they simply couldn’t make the initial shift. They asked us to come back later. A thru line that helped in most situations was having clear executive leadership support (CIO, CEO, CDO, and others). They would knock down roadblocks where needed and help provide resources when we got stuck.\n\nAfter 3 years in the journey one thing was abundantly clear. Technology was not the largest challenge. People and culture were. It took tremendous energy to cast the vision and bring people and teams along with us. This required persistent communication with all business teams and clear demonstration of the value of public cloud through demos, pilots, and “soft releases” of products, apps, and services. The technical teams (platforms, cloud, data, security) all became storytellers if they weren’t already. \n\nTo this day I don’t call the transformation a “data mesh implementation.” But we certainly knew of and studied Data Mesh and sought to implement core principles it espoused: self-service, decentralized data domains/ownership, data governance, and a focus on data product creation within business teams.",

I think the use case was making it easier for engineers to get to grips with new databases or for analytics users (me) to get what they need more quickly.\n\nI have also seen some people experimenting with GenBI tools (I think looker conversational analytics).\n\nIn both instances, the solutions miss the actual problem. You need very clean, very well tagged, very well modelled data. The example I always give is that if you go to the table marked “sales” and count the number of sales…. That is not even remotely correct. Years of schema evolution, changes to products, and poor engineering mean the actual number is much harder to derive. \n\nFor conversational analytics, the prompts must be very carefully tuned and the AI will straight up invent things if you aren’t careful. I would not trust it in the least.\n\nFor the CoSQL model, I haven’t tried to use it, but I notice that solution architects are suggesting I use it rather than curating dbt so I can use that to control our transformation logic. In that regard, it’s a complete distraction and a massive net-negative.\n\n“We don’t have working data products” is the same problem we have had for years and it’s the same problem that will make AI tools harder to implement even if they are viable, but it’s far too unsexy an issue to attract attention.\n\nI am hoping that if I can make clear the dependency that AI has on working data products it might get me the resources and tooling I have needed all along.",

Since a lot of human knowledge is embedded in text, this gives us quite a good basis to create large langauge models that can mirror quite a bit of that knowledge. However, large language models are not very good at doing abstract reasoning on anything other than text, which includes a lot of the work you do as an analyst by traslating some fuzzy business logics to maths, at least for anything nontrivial beyond textbook problems. You may attempt to alleviate this somewhat by providing good metadata for context, but my experience is that this doesn't really solve the problem and i very much doubt this will improve untill we get a different class of models all together as the \"more data+larger models\" approach yields diminishing returns due to sublinear scaling of LLMs wrt. data and size.\n\nNote: you should take everything i say with a grain of salt, as i am a practitioner using LLMs and my formal training is in physics, not NLP.",

The hard part isn't the LLM at all; it's the systems and guardrails around it.\n\nIf someone wants to roll their own, the pieces that actually matter are:\n\n**1) Explicit semantic layer**\n\nYou can't let the agent figure out business logic because it's incapable. Metrics, joins, definitions, and edge cases have to be defined in dbt models, semantic views, or a metadata layer\n\nIf you don't, you run the inevitable risk of fluent nonsense from the LLM. (Variance will get you eventually)\n\n**2) A constrained query surface** (Especially important if you're giving the agent to end users)\n\nDon't let the model generate raw SQL and hope for the best.  \nRestrict it to: A verified query library / A constrained DSL / Parameterised patterns.  \nThis removes a huge amount of hallucination and makes failures actually diagnosable.\n\n**3) Feedback loop/flywheel**\n\n**This is** ***critical.***\n\nYou need traces of every input, generated query, and failure mode so you can see:\n\n* Where the semantic layer is missing context\n* Which inputs result in varied rather than consistent outputs (not reliable + potentially incorrect)\n* Where the agent is making the same wrong assumptions repeatedly\n\nWithout that loop, you cannot really improve the agent, but with it, you can patch gaps, clarify metrics, and improve the agent's ability over time.\n\nThat’s the main stuff people underestimate when they say “just add an agent”.\n\nFor full disclosure, I've ended up building this approach into a full product called Inconvo that helps teams develop their semantic layer and includes built-in query guardrails and feedback loop tracing.\n\nAlso, for those data engineering teams being asked to build this for customer-facing use cases (pretty common these days and a huge ask!) Inconvo has an API and integrations so data engineers can focus on data correctness instead of auth, UI, and other historically full-stack work.\n\n**Main take:**\n\nNone of this works without good old data engineering and well-modelled data; the agent just amplifies whatever assumptions you bake in.\n\nInterested to hear where others have hit the limits of this approach.",

I've used pyexasol (https://github.com/exasol/pyexasol) to enable the agents to write data to my database. I tested out an agentic workflow where I have agents search for local events and predicted attendance and store that in my database as input for some business analytics/decisions. There's a lot of potential - even just starting with an MCP server can get you a long way.   \nAlso - for analytics in particular, it helps the LLMs to have 'semantic' context to help them write more accurate queries and understand what you are asking (in natural language)",

So if CSV has 15000 rows then the staging table has 15000 rows,\n\nThen based on the entity name, a lookup for biz rules to apply to import into the \"real\" staging. It's a PITA the extra step but it works. Once in a table, you use SQL syntax to parse the good data and flag the bad, to send back to the origin what was rejected and thus not loaded.\n\nPlease test with a column called FirstName and put this inside:  GREYBUSH,'\\\\\n\nThen see what happens. It made Snowpipe (python language) go KaBoooooom as the backslash is the escape character. It the Snowflake file format with a bunch of options, nuke the escape character so that there are none.\n\nCurrently in Snowflake we have File Formats with a unique name for every vendor + every entity we receive.\n\nThat dog cartoon \"What a mess?\" yup.\n\nWhy we load as a blob? The biz units **DemandeD ThatT We Do PartiaL LoaD**, not to reject the entire file, if there are any bad lines. Like a carriage return + linefeed inside a column, text columns not wrapped in double quotes when they should be, a comma instead of a period for Decimal columns (French format), dates that are not YYYY-MM-DD, again, Europe/Quebec versus English North America. I get DD-MM-YYYY in these files, UTF-8, and French accents. It all works.\n\nSo if you load in a \"binary\" way you maintain whatever UTF-8 or Iso6500 the file was sent as, and parsing is easy with sub-selects on every column. I run the biz rule analyzer first, and only for IsValidData=1 do we import. Then we use DB\\_SendMail function to the appropriate biz unit of the invalid data.\n\nHonestly, the code quality of SaaS and input forms have taken a serious nose dive since 2020's. What happens when you use the lowest bidder to build your SaaS system.\n\nHTH",

How is it not for so many people?  What the hell do your employers demand of you?  If I do \"overtime\" (lol fool me, I'm on a salary, but I can swing it as take a few hours off another day) it's because I have some weird compulsion to do so: something playing on my mind, something I want to progress or finish off; or some training/learning/research.  Sometimes I'll feel a bit behind, or making up time for going in a bit \"leisurely\" in the morning.\n\n\n\nI enjoy the work I do - most the time - the tech is cool to use, I'm loyal to my employer to an extent (they've been fair, decent, and flexible) but I'm not particularly interested in the actual business or industry.  Or the goal.  Basically help the owners/shareholders/whatevers make more money?  Cool, man... very fulfilling.\n\n\n\nOP, are you more entrepreneurial , do you want to work for yourself more than some company?  I don't have first-hand context of that, but I can't imagine it would be easy, or even highly compensating - at first, at least.

If you don't go out to work for yourself right away, is it realistic to keep looking for something else that fits better?\n\n\n\nEdit:  Unless there's some radical shift in society and economy, we work because we need the money.

        "body": "I've read your thoughts across this thread and have something for you to consider:\n\nEngineers sometimes focus too narrowly on technical capabilities and not on the bigger picture. The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:\n\n- \"this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it\"\n- \"this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find\"\n- \"this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching\"\n- \"we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.\"\n\nBut let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.\n\nAre you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?\n\nWhat will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.\n\nRemember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you. If that happens it's very good news for analytics engineering, but _terrible_ news for you as a founder. Typical outcome: nothing happens. The incumbent has no motivation to improve, and would-be founders have no ability to realise the gains for themselves, so do nothing to change this.",

This can provide a significant edge to performance.\n   * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume.\n   * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here!  You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables.\n   * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers.  But you may need to have postgres dba skills.\n   * All the above assumes vanilla postgres.  Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.\n\nFYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money.  IIRC it was about $20k/month saved AND my queries were much faster.  So, while I would not propose that a single node Postgres instance will always outperform a distributed database, there are absolutely scenarios in which it will.",

It is just pressure.\n\nIf anything, the fact that you are documenting discrepancies, rebuilding inherited messes, and validating edge cases suggests you are doing the job correctly, not slowly.

Microsoft has the free SQL Server Express for OLTP - perfect for staging area - 10 gig limit per database - so have a DB per source and ingest, you'll have 2 cpu peformance and decent ram usage (16g I think, check Microsoft's web page).\n\nSo what's nice with SQL Server Express is it plays nice with your AD and talks easily to other MSSQL systems, so you can avoid flat files when flat files don't make sense.\n\nIf you want history of all changes, without the hassle of CDC, flat files on a massive file share dedicated for this, you basically emulate a datalake. If this file share system is Linux, there's probably Datalake compatible open-source you can use so you can do SELECT directly on the CSV/Json/XML flat files, just like a real cloud datalake. But I haven't done it - I'm sure someone here has.\n\nIn any case, Google Big Query and even Azure Datalake are not expensive. Probably on-par with dedicated hardware costs internally adding a 4TB mirrored fileshare system, when costed and budgeted over 36 months.\n\nIt depends on CAPEX versus OPEX, your boss should know this.

Make do with tools that can do a lot, even if they're not perfect for every single case.\n\nIf you want Postgres, look at extensions for Postgres like pg_duckdb so you can do your transformations inside Postgres quicker and skip Polaris (and/or use duckdb in-process instead, so it's the same engine). Use pgvector to do vector inside Postgres.\n\nOr use ClickHouse instead which also fills those roles. Fast enough you can just do the transforms in the database, supports vectors, has an in-process engine called chDB if you need it which also doubles as a data science data frame lib.\n\nPeople always default to wanting a big bag of tools, but it just makes it more expensive.

I think this medium article describes it pretty well: [https://mbvyn.medium.com/understanding-dbt-incremental-materialization-c32318364241](https://mbvyn.medium.com/understanding-dbt-incremental-materialization-c32318364241)\n\nIncr models load existing tables with more data using various loading strategies. The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.\n\nA key thing to understand would be is\\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)\n\nThat means anything wrapped within is\\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.\n\nThis is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.\n\nYou can also flip that and use NOT is\\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.\n\nEDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.\n\nIf this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.\n\nOnce we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH.\n\n    {{\n        config(\n            materialized='incremental'\n        )\n    }}\n    \n    select\n        *,\n        my_slow_function(my_column)\n    \n    from {{ ref('app_data_events') }}\n    \n    {% if is_incremental() %}\n    \n      -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run\n      -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model)\n      -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records)\n    where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} )\n    \n    {% endif %}",

        "body": "There’s actually a few things to be concerned with. One issue is making sure you are dealing with the proper timestamp. A lot of the examples in this space gloss over this aspect. For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.\n\nAnother concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`\n\nAnd this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.\n\nIf you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.\n\nI would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.\n\nIt’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",

At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.\n\nIf you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.\n\nIn this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.\n\nOn every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.\n\nSo we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join.\n\n    {{\n        config(\n            materialized='incremental'\n        )\n    }}\n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }}\n    \n    \n    {% if is_incremental() %}\n    \n        where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} )\n    \n    \n    {% endif %}\n    \n    \n    {% if not is_incremental() %}\n    \n        union \n    \n        select\n            customer_id,\n            period,\n            total_sales\n        from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }}\n    \n    \n    {% endif %}\n\nThis means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table):\n\n    -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN \n    \n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system\n    \n    \n    \n        union \n    \n    \n        select\n            customer_id,\n            period,\n            total_sales\n        from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system\n    \n    \n    -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN\n    \n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system\n    \n    \n    where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",

        "body": "Last paragraph imo is the big one. I have hardly met any coworkers that understand the problems that come with incrementals involving multiple tables. This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.\n\nFor me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.\n\nThe example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. \"Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day.\" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",

If you have bespoke code, maybe look at a load framework like DLT. Is the framework any better, or do you like having more control over the process?\n\nSave your raw data to a more modern file format with proper data types (e.g. Parquet, AVRO) - do you need to do any transformation on the source data to make it fit? Are there any unexpected issues with the data that you have to handle?\n\nLoad your data into a local database, either directly from source or from your raw files. Then you can start running proper SQL queries against your data and get some practice with querying databases in general. DuckDB comes to mind, it's powerful and lightweight with good support across many languages.\n\nDo some transformations on the data - consider cleansing data quality issues, perhaps normalising the structure, or transforming it into a better shape for Data Science modelling. You could do this with some bespoke code, or look into transformation tools like dbt or SQLMesh.\n\nBuild some visualisations of the data to build more of a story around the data than just raw values.\n\nIn each case, try out multiple tools. If you're using Pandas, consider trying Polars or Ibis, or leveraging DuckDB's APIs. What do you like about each one? What do you dislike?

One idea is to turn it into a time series problem and look at how orbital elements drift over time, then try to predict short term changes for individual satellites. You could also flag anomalies when a satellite deviates from its recent pattern, which maps nicely to real monitoring use cases. Another fun angle is building a small dashboard that shows constellation level trends, like altitude decay or clustering by inclination. Those kinds of projects translate well when talking to teams because they show you understand pipelines, modeling, and downstream consumption together.",

        "body": "This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully you find this useful. There's actually a lot to your question.\n\nWhen it comes to designing a mart, I keep the \"analyst\" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.\n\nRegarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the \"analyst\" persona querynig the star:\n\n1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability\n2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example\n3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usability\n\nThe ideal query would look something like this:\n\n    SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name\n    FROM fct_sales AS f\n    INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d\n    ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk\n    GROUP BY d.customer_name\n\nThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.\n\nIn order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for \"unknown\", \"missing\" or \"not applicable\" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. \n\nFor item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.\n\nIf your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone:\n\n    SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name  \n    FROM fct_sales AS f  \n    INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d  \n    ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk\n    AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts\n    GROUP BY d.customer_name  \n\nUsability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.\n\nTo achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.\n\nAt this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.\n\nTL;DR integer lookups",

For the love of God don’t event try to build your own DQ framework, so many teams make this mistake. Instead use some of the already available open-source solutions, some of them are very very good. \n\nTesting is also very important part of pipelines, which are unfortunately neglected by most of the DE teams. It will make sure that your commit editing “pipeline A”, won’t alter the logic of “pipeline B”. \nEnd-to-end Testing is the best thing you can do for your Data Architecture. Create a small sample input dataset, dozen of rows usually is enough. Create expected output dataset. Run pipeline on using sample input as source and compare your actual output with expected output. Do it on every merge to main branch. Very simple, straightforward but gives you a lot of confidence in you data pipelines. It requires some simple CI/CD pipeline and probably separate env to run the tests but data quality always comes with a price, like all good things in this life :)",

We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first..  the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. \n2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.\n3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path. \n\nIf you tried doing this in prod: how are you handling this tradeoff? Do you allow wide read access and rely on RLS/RBAC + logging, or do you gate it behind a semantic model / query planner / allowlists?",

Those are the level of questions i was thinking of when I mentioned needing schema exploration and multi turn deep research.\n\nThe only approach I'm using in 'prod' is stuff that heavily depends on a human in the loop. What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers. It's still in the data warehouse environment but the agents can only access those curated views. What I found with this though was that I couldn't answer questions on the level of what you are describing very well, which is why I think if it's ever gonna work a much more flexible approach is needed.",

Maintaining data integrity and reliability at scale across platforms can be a very tough challenge, especially with any reasonable volume. All that to say: you're right that it's a real and difficult problem to solve.\n\nI'm biased (I'm one of the founders of Prequel, where we do something similar to what you're talking about), but hopefully I can also be pretty helpful on the topic -- let me know if there are any questions I can help with.\n\nAlso, the Pontoon team put together a helpful feature comparison matrix among the players in the market (though they recently discontinued work on the project): [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms)",

As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries  \n\n\nDepends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?\n\nBy design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)\n\nIf the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.\n\nBtw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",

Now that all Snowpipe/Snowpipe streaming is a fixed price (0.0037 Credits per GB), it should be easier to see what your costs will be regardless of the number of files. Generally Snowpipe will be cheaper, but your time is worth something too. As you mention, Snowpipe can support schema evolution with ENABLE\\_SCHEMA\\_EVOLUTION = TRUE. But if you need more granular control, I could see scenarios where you might want to do it your way. Bottom line, get an understanding of GB/hour for data coming in so you'll be able to answer the cost differential between the two approaches.

Then build additional steps that extract the data from BigQuery and do more complex transformations on it.\n\nIf you don't care about access to the raw data, just do all your transformation steps between the json ingestion and Bigquery.\n\nAlso, if you just want to cache your json, you don't necessarily have to convert it into a BQ table. You can just store the json in an unstructured data format in something like an AWS S3 Bucket or GCS before you begin processing the JSON into a dataframe for BQ.\n\nAlso, if you're already working with pandas, I would recommend looking into polars. It's like pandas, but newer and faster (built on rust) and it comes with some features that make validation and type casting a bit more intuitive.\n\nLast thing, depending on your usecase, casting everything to a string has pros and cons. You might end up losing data as a result. For example, if you have a datetime column that you cast into a string and back, you lose any non-represented data like timezone that you can't get back anymore. I personally like maintaining the typing as close to the data source as possible.",

For pipelines like this that have been stable for decades, the biggest risk is changing logic that no one fully remembers the edge cases for.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work better in similar situations is a phased approach. Keep the Pro C transformations intact initially by containerizing or running them in a controlled environment, then focus on validating inputs and outputs aggressively. Once you have parity and confidence in the data, you can start peeling off pieces of the transformation logic incrementally instead of all at once.\n\nModernizing is valuable, but preserving correctness first usually buys you time and reduces risk, especially when the business depends on this pipeline behaving exactly the same way it has for years.",

They help to simplify the design of asynchronous systems where you send a lot of time waiting on network traffic, disk reads, or user input.  Async does not run anything in parallel, and you will not see any performance improvements from in; in fact, overuse of async methods in tight loops can significantly harm performance due to the added overhead of the event queue.\n\nPart of why async design is popular in Python and JavaScript is because threads really suck in those languages.

Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.\n\nSo we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!\n\nHowever, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.\n\nSo we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like:\n\n    function foo() {\n      Promise.all([\n        getUserDropdownData(),\n        getCityDropdownData(),\n        getStateDropdownData(),\n        getDepartmentDropdownData(),\n        getSomeOtherData()\n      ])\n      .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded\n        const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values;\n        buildUserDataDropdown(userData);\n        buildCityDataDropdown(cityData);\n        buildStateDataDropdown(stateData);\n        buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData);\n        buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData);\n      })\n      .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns\n        refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately\n      })\n    }\n    /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */\n\nYou would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \\~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \\~220ms instead of \\~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.\n\nWe also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.\n\nAnd that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",

Multithreading can.\n\n> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?\n\nAsync is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.\n\n> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?\n\nIt's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.\n\n> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoid\n\nI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.\n\nBecause async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.\n\nThere's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",

Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.\n\nAn example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like\n\n`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`\n\nthen accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in \"John@Doe.com\" as the username and \"RubberDucky\" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database\n\n`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`\n\nfair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of \"Admin';--\"? The application would pass the following \n\n`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`\n\nThe database will return the first user that has the username of \"Admin\" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, \";\" would terminate the SQL command, and \"--\" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors.  \n  \nthat is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it \"secure\" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like \"UPDATE\", \"DELETE\", \"\\*\", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen  people do it in HEX\n\n  \nOnce you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do. Here is how you might be able to get the server credentials from a SQL injection \n\n[https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478](https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478)",

The front end then sends the name to the back end to retrieve the stats.\n\nLet's say the backend does an SQL query on the database like \"SELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = '$name'\".\n\nNormally this works great.  But what if I type the following:\n\nRobert'; DROP TABLE Students;\n\nNow the SQL query on the backend looks like this:\n\nSELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;\n\nWhen that is executed, it will search for Robert in the database, and then it will wipe all the data out.\n\nOf course you can do more advanced things other than deleting stuff in the database.  You can add other queries to try to extract more information than the website would otherwise allow.  You can probe the database for other tables, like maybe asking if there is a list of credit card numbers.  You can get really fancy like querying to see if any columns start with the letter \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" and so on, and if you do enough of those queries you can reconstruct the schema for the database and discover all sorts of interesting things.\n\nI wrote a simple website one that had a shell injection vulnerability.  It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did!

        "body": ">when in order to access a database you need to authenticate to it\n\nIt's only an issue when the application that is getting attacked (i.e. the backend) has direct access to the database. If the backend also only uses interfaces to other system, then it's no an sql based attack. However, if the other system is vulnerable then maybe the injection happens there. And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it. You can make it so that certain commands are not allowed, like dropping tables, but modifying data and reading data your are not supposed to might still be possible. \n\n>how are they able to get data returned from a database with their query if they are not an authenticated user to the database\n\nThe application is authenticated. \n\n>and how would they even know what to inject into the SQL database to get what they want\n\nThey often don't. But they can guess. Often there's a table called \"users\" or \"user\" and it has columns, such as \"name\", \"email\", \"password\" etc. That's why it's hacking. They just \"hack\" until it works. \n\n> this is purely educational because I honestly don't understand it?\n\nThere are many books about this. You really have to see how 90ies PHP websites were made to understand how insecure it all was.   \n  \nNote that it's only possible in very old libraries that let you just create strings containing sql queries that you then execute. Wo now use templates and make sure that user input is checked and always passed as a certain type (string, number, date etc). You can't just pass \"1' AND 1;  --\" and have it be inserted into \"select \\* from users where username = '%s' password = '%s'\". And we salt and has the passwords, if there even are any. But some people are idiots and think it's ok to use 20 year old libraries and not do anything for security. Then it's easy. Others use modern frameworks and even they can have vulnerabilities. But it's not as easy as it was back then.",

The bigger issue is usually lack of structure, not lack of ability. Pick one practical goal, like building a small project you actually care about, and let that drive what you learn next instead of grinding LeetCode randomly. Once you have one or two projects, GitHub and LinkedIn become much easier to set up because you actually have something to show. Consistency matters more than intensity here, even 30 to 60 minutes most days adds up faster than you think.",

For example \"ZOO-123: Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" This ties that commit with Jira ticket ZOO-123 that either is about changes to RabbitMQ messaging or about fixing an issue with said messaging.\n\nAlso, some companies use conventional commits. It is just a way of formatting your commit message so that automated tools can process commits in an easier way. Read about it from [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) An example would be \"fix(ZOO-123): Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" There the fix() keyword shows that the commit was for fixing something. A feat() keyword can be for adding a new feature or for working with some new functionality. For example \"feat(SCHOOL-23): Add Japanese language.\"\n\nThe commit message itself is often in imperative present tense. For example \"Fix to\" instead of \"Fixed\". The commit should give a summary of the change. What was done. Keep it concise and clear. Do not add a whole essay. But also do not just write \"Added more changes.\" Which changes? Why? Read about it from [https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3](https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3) \n\nAvoid frustration and all kind of nonsense in the commits. Yes, when the stuff does not work and your earlier commit did not fix it then writing \"Get working already!!!!!\" or \"wgo8g7tfwo82w37fdto238gd\" is not a rational way how to deal with the issue. It is unprofessional. In the previous company I worked at, we had one guy who raged in his commit messages.\n\nAvoid adding too many details. Instead of writing \"Fix to UserNotificationIntegrationTest, BillingIntegrationTest, BaseIntegrationTest, RabbitMQPublisherIntegrationTest\" better pick \"Fix to integration tests\". Which tests, that can be seen from the git commit itself. Neither go with \"Added an email support to UserNotificationService by introducing emailSender() method that uses angus-mail library\" just write \"Add support to send user notifications via email\" Some good and bad examples are in [https://chris.beams.io/git-commit](https://chris.beams.io/git-commit) \n\nAlso, it does not really help when you finish your whole project and then add it via a single commit that has a commit message of \"Initial commit\".",

Mindlessly asking AI to generate code for you teaches you nothing. But using AI to explain documentation, recommend improvements, provide examples, and break down code can be immensely valuable. There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.\n\nWhat I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: \"I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?\" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: \"Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?\" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills. While I'm doing all this I'm also checking documentation and taking notes. \n\nAI is like a tool box but you shouldn't drop the toolbox off at the job site and trust it to build everything itself. Learn to use the tools and apply them properly.",

I don't think kids need to learn how to code. I mean if they want to learn how to play around with animation games and animation game loops with the Scratch visual programming language that's fine, but I don't think kids need to become professional level as kids (and by \"kids\" I mean under the age of 18 or 19).\n\nWhen you get to a Computer Science program like say Harvard Computer Science, there are kids in it who have been coding since elementary school and there are kids where that is their first experience. Either way, they ultimately end up in the same sorts of jobs. Like a kid could have been coding since elementary school, but if he messes up badly on the coding interview and the kid who started coding in university doesn't, the kid who started coding in university will get the coding job. Nobody cares when you started. It's the same interview for everyone.\n\n\nThe important stuff is more like mathematical, analytical, computational thinking. People who do well on the coding interview tend to also do well on math tests like the SAT Math section and the Math Olympiad. All of coding fundamentals and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) can be taught in 3 successive university courses. After that you're not REALLY learning coding, you're learning other stuff in the Computer Science program like Operating Systems (OS), Databases (SQL vs NoSQL), Team Project, etc. It's totally fine to cover the material in university rather than at a young age.\n\nUltimately the stuff that gets in the way in real programming jobs often isn't actually coding ability. It's other stuff like teamwork, people skills, social skills, delegation, team leadership, disabilities (ex. cognitive issues or disabilities, head injuries causing brain issues, neurological/psychiatric stuff), corporate politics, office politics, corporate corruption (ex. the boss is a psychopath/sociopath and is secretly taking a cut of some dishonest project deal), etc. Focus on making people functional, social, well-rounded people. Coding isn't that hard to learn later.",

What tends to work well is a small project with constraints, like recreating a simple game, automating something he already cares about, or modding an existing system he uses. That gives him feedback loops, problem solving, and room to explore a language deeply. If you want to support it as a gift, hardware, books with real projects, or even just time and encouragement to build something slightly ambitious often go further than any dedicated learning game.",

Games & Software\n\nRealistically, there aren't many that could serve as a Christmas gift... Most of those types of resources are already available for free online! If there is a Coursera or Udemy course that's paid, or if he would like a subscription to a learning platform like [https://www.boot.dev/dashboard](https://www.boot.dev/dashboard), that could fit your question, but maybe that wouldn't work as a Christmas gift.

You could use one of my suggestions, or something else. A raspberry pi is also a nice option. \n\nMake a nice gift basket, get him some nice books, put in some plushies if you want.

It can be done in Python, but typically, Python offers \"too much\" and makes it too easy, not really giving a solid view of what goes into DSA, in my opinion.)\n\nIf I were you, I'd audit a course on DSA if you feel that it would strengthen your knowledge of the subject instead of enrolling in it. Auditing is a great way to review or to learn new concepts without the pressure of assignments and exams with deadlines.\n\nI'm surprised you took a course on web programming: it's a landscape that changes so fast that by the time you've started the course, what you're learning is probably already obsolete. the others sound pretty standard for a CS curriculum, but not learning advanced algorithms or the theory of computability (unless you covered that in discrete math, which seems unlikely) seems like glaring omissions.\n\nAnother option would be to pick up a book on DSA and work through it at your own pace... that undirected learning style doesn't work for everyone, though, so pick what works best for you, but yes, a solid foundation in DSA is very important to have: knowing what data structures and algorithms to pick and why is something that I would consider essential.",

Remember that most programming languages do only one thing at a time, and even fairly simple tasks like asking the user to enter a number, and printing it back, requires a lot of individual steps.\n\nThe program you have written performs these steps:\n\n1. Print a message to the user, asking to \"Input a number: \"\n2. Reads a number entered by the user\n3. Prints a new message to the user, saying \"Your number: \" followed by the number the user entered\n\nThen there's a lot of additional \"invisible\" steps, like storing the number in a variable - creating a \"Scanner\" that is apparently some tool to get input from the user, and also a lot about importing that and creating a class and some magic incantation \"public static void main\" that probably doesn't make any sense.\n\nBut keep the main focus on the steps you want the program to execute, and gradually understand how to write them, and what extra \"invisible steps\" you need to add!\n\nAnd when in doubt about something particular - ask about that particular thing.",

Some people have learned the \"single return\" style and stick with that.\n\nOthers prefer the \"return early to handle error conditions\" style, which has its advantages.\n\nMost people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two \"not nice\" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.\n\nIn your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an \"error case\", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the \"if\" branch and the other within the \"else\" branch) would make the \\*intent\\* slightly clearer.\n\nNow, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of \"error condition\" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so \"idiomatically\" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.\n\nOnce the \"error returns\" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is \"correct\" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",

What happens if an email address doesn't match the \"`isValidEmailAddress`\" check?\n\nIt's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this:\n\n    // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred\n    String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) {\n      if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) {\n        return \"Alex\";\n      }\n      if (username == \"\") {\n        return \"Sam\";\n      }\n      if (username.contains(\".\")) {\n        return username.split(\".\")[0];\n      }\n      if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) {\n        return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0];\n      }\n      return username;\n    }\n\nIn the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting \"weird\" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",

        "body": "I was in the same position a few years ago and was looking at General Assembly, but I wasn't willing to go into debt. I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.\n\nI did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs.  \n  \nI ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.\n\nIf you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.\n\nAnother tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do. Just make sure you're doing your own personal project after every tutorial project.\n\nHope this is helpful. Good luck!",

Sometimes they even make more objects.\n\nThen there are four \"pillars\": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.\n2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a \"subclass\" of another (\"superclass\"), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. \n3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. \n4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same \"subclass\" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.\n\nThat's it, that's OOP! Now practice those ideas with C++ since you know the basics of it already. It's very conducive to object-oriented programming - in fact, in college, my advanced OOP class was all C++.

Not from the comfort of your room, but in the office while you work for example. You won't pull headphones to watch any videos there. \n\nFor now it looks like cs50 or a Udemy course would be a better fit for you. But in the end it doesn't matter much.

Their main YT channel also has several long video tutorials and crash-courses to my knowledge.\n\nThere is also lots of videos all over YouTube about most programming topics / concepts, computer science, as well as specific tutorials on projects.\n\nSecond, unfortunately, reading is just a part of programming as I am sure you're aware. You're going to have to read requirements of projects and their documentation, as well as write it. You're going to have to read code and genuinely try to understand it, both the functions and the larger whole. You're going to have to read documentation of the programming languages, tools, and APIs you're using.\n\nI'm not saying that to shame you, God knows, I barely read books. But reading is very much a part of programming, from the learning to the actual process of doing.\n\nOdin Project and FreeCodeCamp are both what I have experience with. They're both solid platforms, and I'd probably complete FCC first, and then circle back to Odin Project and see about the gaps and more advanced knowledge it covers. One of the big advantages is that it is fairly unguided and gives you a set of objectives to complete. This forces you to think about what you're doing, how and why, as well as forcing you to acquire knowledge and documentation just like you would on any real project.\n\nAt that point, I'd probably just try making projects. Maybe dabble in a game engine like Godot because of its lightweight nature, GDScript which is very easy to read and write, and ability to do web exports for Itch.IO. Hell you can even use it to make applications / tools, not games, but I digress.\n\nI'm just not sure what to suggest that can fulfill that video requirement, besides trying a hybrid approach. Try to at least read the highlights and general idea of a topic, and then look for some videos about it, maybe practical examples. Don't force yourself to deathmarch paragraph after paragraph, but I don't know if you can truly avoid reading either.\n\nI'm sure others know more, I mostly learned by messing around modding games, reading books, nibbling on these tutorial sites and such. Best of luck.",

If you're building a calendar or scheduling app where the primary goal of the app was to schedule things, then rolling your own might be worth it to deliver an amazing experience and have full control over it. If it's just one tiny feature, it probably makes more sense to use a good existing library.\n\nSecond, what are the costs of using an external component? Let's say I need a matrix multiply function. Adding a dependency on a huge linear algebra package like BLAS or numpy might increase the size of the build, add a new license to check, and just overall add a lot of complexity to the project. If the only thing I need it for is to multiply some small matrices and performance doesn't matter, I might implement it myself and use another library to verify that my implementation is correct.\n\nLast, is this something that needs to change/update frequently or is it stable? If it's parsing a data file that's internal to my project and not user-generated, then that code might not ever need to change. Writing some custom code to parse it might be fine because it's not likely to break. On the other hand if it's parsing user-generated PDFs, a third-party library probably keeps getting new bug fixes and improvements over time, so it's probably way better to use a library.",

Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.\n\nSome cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way. Some cells needed to reformat data in a certain way - for example, if we got a timestamp, did we need to show just the date, just the time, seconds since time, etc. One manager always wanted us to separate date and time as two separate columns for Excel reasons. Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).\n\nWrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. \n\nEventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did \"the same thing but better\". My answer, after looking at the library, was that I wrote mine 4 or so years before the npm library was created according to its github history. It also didn't support all of the features, or at least not in some of the specific use cases we had. So it *wasn't* something that existed when I needed it, and it also still didn't technically do everything we needed it to do.\n\nSimilarly, I'll also \"engineer\" extremely simple things from scratch if I feel like it would take me longer to find a library to do the thing than it would to write. This case was we had a dashboard for a monitoring tool that just needed to show groups of \"top 10s\", so 10 rows, each containing a bar, another bar (with a definable color) inside of it with width based on a percentage, and a text value (that could also be a link). Easy enough: div wrapping a div and p or a, a dozen lines of CSS, and a function to manage it, took 5 minutes to write, 100% localized code I don't have to rely on a library for.",

Didn’t look great, so eventually I found an online map generator that happened to have the source open to anyone. I made an API to call its C functions that generated a height map I could use in C++.\n\nIf you can legally use it in your source code, then use it.

Libraries are well tested, maintained and updated for years by very high level developers. (Good and well known libraries). Also there are docs for every library which helps to understand code and change it. Don't reinvent the wheel.  \nIf you need something simple, then it should be created from scratch. Also you shouldn't use many libraries that do the same thing. For example, you want 3 different image sliders, you shouldnt use 3 different slider libraries. You should use the base of the library and create a wrapper. Don't use 3 different date format libraries, use only one.\n\nIt also depends on project. There can be projects where you have to use what you are allowed to use.  \nSomething like a calendar can be so complex and advanced... It's a project inside a project.",

Otherwise I'm using it for boilerplate code which rarely needs comments, or just having it spit out a few examples of something I haven't used before, which I rarely use in production without significant modification, if at all, so again, no comments, just a good prompt. \n\nWith AI, I find it much easier to look at 10-50 lines at a time and make sure it doing ok rather than having to stare at a ton of lines all at once and try to redirect it after it's gotten way ahead of itself.\n\nIf you're using an in-ide agent I can see where the comments could help it continue on to fill out the function/file, but I just personally prefer to keep my AI on a short leash.\n\n\nPlus, I tend to work with a lot of aging code that needs to be refactored and it gets touchy.

ACs should cover: inputs (clicks, path parameters, query parameters, etc), authentication/authorization (which types of users can do this, what happens if it is not authorized), outputs (status codes, formats such as JSON/XML, schema), how to handle error states (bad inputs, server errors, etc.), validation, navigation (what happens after a user clicks a thing).

The lead can do this accurately; a junior dev probably can't, but repeating this process is part of the way they learn about the system and the organization.\n\n\nBy the time the story gets to the top of the backlog, if there isn't enough information to actually start the work, there should at least be enough breadcrumbs in it that a junior knows what to do to get that information.",

Don't be afraid to refer back to those tutorials.  With respect to googling, IMHO, trying to code without an internet connection is madness.  I myself often google the basics when I haven't used them in a while or to confirm I am remembering things correctly.  If you switch languages a lot, you might start using the wrong syntax and I have to check that from time to time.\n\nWhen watching tutorials, hopefully you're coding along with them and then trying to do something a bit different which isn't in the tutorial and adapting what you learned to your problem.  One little project that I would do using different web technologies was a little contact manager.  That's not a typical tutorial example, but it's not much more complicated than a lot of them.  \n\nPerhaps you could go into a little more detail about what you're trying to do.

The best books are often out of date in some ways, and although they are a great resource for \"How\" and \"Why\", you will also need an up-to-date source of information. I have been using w3schools, and although they may or may not be the best that can be found, my hope is that it will bridge the gap between the great books on the subject and the recent changes to the language. I know and use HTML and CSS pretty well, and I am to the point where I can look up the raw features of it to figure out how to do what I want (when it is something I have not done often or at all); I am sure there will come a point where I can get to where I do not need the book (or lessons) to figure out how to do something with the language. So...short answer, it is just part of learning. Do not feel fake or inferior. And, definitely, you learn by doing. Watching videos can be interesting, but they do not help me really learn. Whatever the language you are learning, get a compiler/IDE. Type the code you are learning and experiment with IT. In other words, make the code you think you are learning work in an environment separate from the one that is teaching you. And don't copy and paste. Type it out.  I use Code::Blocks and highly recommend it (it is free). Slight\\_Scarcity321 gives some good advice a little ways down this page.",

        "body": "The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.\n\nOn first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.\n\nThis idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. \n\nIn the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.\n\nHowever, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using \"Composition\" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. \n\nFor Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing \"ISpeaker` and there may be \"BipedRunner\" and \"QuadrupedRunner\" implementing \"IRunner\" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:\n\n```py\ncat =   Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())\ndog =   Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())\nhorse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())\n\ncat.speak()   # \"meow!\"\ndog.speak()   # \"wruff!\"\nhorse.speak() # \"neigh!\"\n\n```\n\nThis is what \"Composition over Inheritance\" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).\n\nA big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ). \n\nMaybe that helps a bit.",

My best learning experiences where when the lectures had streamlined content where all course assignments and exams were heavily or even completey based on those lectures. I always felt like I came away with something positive and felt a lot more skilled. Also, it depends on the professor but some will outright disregard any questions. And when so much rides on the assignments and with so little support and resources, you tend to focus on the lectures less and are scrambling for the assignments to the point where there's hardly any retention of what you were supposed to learn in the first place.

Languages like Python are 'higher level', meaning more of the low level detail is 'abstracted away' from the programmer. This comes with tradeoffs, for example: Not having to directly manage memory when using python means the programmer is *not able* to directly manage memory even if they wanted to. This makes Python more suitable to use cases like Data Analytics, where readability and development speed matter more than minute performance optimisations, whereas a language like C is more suited to applications which require a level of control over hardware resources, like Operating System or Embedded Systems applications where you need to use resources as efficiently as possible.",

By the end of your 3rd or 4th year (however the study program is for you) you'll have some preferences in terms of where you are planning to specialize in.\n\nYou can't niche down early when you do not know your options. Sure, you can decide \"I will become mobile app developer\" which is a valid path. But are you certain that this path is for you? Perhaps you'll do better in programming IoT devices? Just go by the curriculum, for now.\n\nLearn to learn. Right now you are doing your college/university studies. It is not any more high school where teachers would remind you to do your assignments and such. Now you have to learn how to live an independent life and make your own decisions. When I was doing my Bachelor studies then some of my course mates dropped out within the first two semesters. Some partied too much. Some had no self-discipline. Some found out that they picked a wrong field. etc. \n\nAbout skills more, then become proactive. Do not rely just on your courses. Participate in hackathons. Join a programming/robotics club. Work on hobby projects. Because by the time you graduate you'll have to compete with everybody else. And then you have to stand out somehow, to be hired.\n\nAnd, do not rely on an AI. Can happen that your client prohibits any and all AI usage where the data goes through third party cloud services. What will you do then? Oh, and do not try to hack your university's/college's systems. Some of my course mates got into problems when trying out stuff.\n\nIn terms of tech stacks then learn these things that are actually in demand in your area. Sure, the curriculum should already support that but if it does not do that then it is up to you to check different job offers and see what is required from developers, there.

From my experience and talking to professionals  degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.\n\nAs for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.\n\nRegarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.\n\nThe truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.\n\nPS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.\n\n\n\nNow specifically regarding some stuff you asked: \n\nYou should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot. Also, even if you end up going into like embedded, building a website will still make you a better and more well rounded programmer.",

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now?

We make useful software for our users.\n\nSo, when you're starting to get adept with some particular tech (in your case js and python) your next step is to use that tech to make somethihg useful. The whole creative process has more steps than just laying down lines of code. Planning it, packaging it, deploying it so others can use it, are just as important.\n\nSimple games are a good choice, because they're inherently useful: people play them for fun.  \n\nSure, you can learn another language. But, if you do a couple of projects first, you'll get more out of your effort to learn that new language.\n\nAlso, it has to be said, in your programming career you will probably need to learn new languages or othe major tech at least a dozen times. And that's a big effort. So, now, early on, your task is to learn the WHY and HOW of the effort of learning a new language. Doing projects helps with the WHY.\n\nWelcome to our great trade.",

In performance mode, you ignore all the mistakes you make since, well, you are performing and stopping at every mistake is just going to make everyone notice them and get them really annoyed.\n\nApplied to programming, you use as little help as possible during practice mode.

So put that site out of your mind completely.   You shouldn't even be considering library's like numpy until you have a good grasp of computer science and programming.\n\nIf you want to learn Computer Science and really understand programming you need to engage in the equivalent of a 4 year CS program.    If you are going to DIY this find a program online that starts out with C/C++ and learn how software actually works.  You need to stay with one of those C languages until you have successfully built and UNDERSTAND, at least a couple of data structures.   A good program at this point exposes you to other languages.\n\nFor now stay away from AI and Python.   They will both become extremely important in your future but first you have a lot to learn.",

I learn new things like anybody else, go on reddit or [awwwards.com](http://awwwards.com), find something cool or unique and hit up the good ole stack overflow or documentation to recreate. Of course, you can also go on job posting and look at their required stack and learn those too.\n\nDon't worry about forgetting stuff happens to me all the time, I google CSS all the time like whats + vs > vs \\~ selectors. As long as you know a decent amount or a vague idea you can always google it. JS wise, its pretty similar to any other programing lang. just in different synax and how the underlying feature works. But, overall its all about practicing without the tutorials (you can still google to help, like I google all the time and I worked at federal agency for frontend stuff).",

It's not like a full scale backend infrastructure, but for smaller web apps this is often enough, because most times all they need is a way to hide some stuff, like API keys, from the client, make a hand full of database queries and calculate a few things here and there. It's called a 'Backend for Frontend', because all it does is usually all you need as a Frontend Dev. \n\nIf you plan to only learn Javascript as a proper programming language, Node.js is a popular choice for backend development, if it gets more complicated than that. That's totally doable. For many things, expecially small to medium scale solo dev projects, you can totally get away with just JS, yes.\n\nAt some point this no longer scales very well, but you can always cross that bridge when you get there and notice JS is limiting you. You can't build a 'Facebook' scale Project on just JS.. But Facebook started with just PHP,  because that's what they knew how to write.\n\nBottom line is - yes you can build useful stuff with just JS. Sure.\nVSCode the IDE you are statistically likely using - is entirely written in JS.",

I'm more privy to JS so I'll focus on that. Dont let \"web based\" fool you, you can run everything locally too, but it'll do wonders for compatibility and simplicity \n\nYou can use JS and a browser for the entire gui, and JS again in the back end using NODE. You can use something like Electron for cross platform compatibility, and you can save your offline data as cookies or in the cache. Once you get back to data service, the data can sync, and then it'll be available on a server for all your devices. \n\nFor the quiz you can use something like socket.io for bidirectional communication between the server and the device\n\nYou have a lot of requirements here, and it would be prudent to be able to code everything in the same language (JS) I would start by learning basic browser JS since you have a foundation in html and css, then move on to your first server using express and node, and then learn how to utilize external packages like socket.io, then finally how to package them into standalone apps using electron. You may find that you need other things along the way like a database, but thats just another external package and another set of docs. \n\nYou can do all of this in python too it'll just be 50% more difficult than js, but python has better support for complex data and more and different external packages. I dont see any reason to recommend it for someone starting out, and you can always learn another language later \n\nYou're much better off getting good at a single thing than trying to code a bunch of things in different languages",

If you have 6 words in an array, and you want to insert a new word, you move over the words enough spaces to insert the new word in the target spot. What I'm struggling with is understanding the formula for it? There's this formula (0+1+2+⋯+n-1)/n=(n-1)/2 or this formula for array deletion: (n–1)/2 ≈ n/2. I don't know where these are coming from or how these are connected or how I'm supposed to use them. And there's this: Maximum number of comparisons = ⌊log\\_2⁡n ⌋+1 for binary search algorithm. \n\nYeah you're right, I'm not very fluent with programming either. All of this is pretty new to me but it's my second year and I'm falling behind but I'm still trying to catch up and learn. I have an assignment due in a week, and the semester just started so I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I've been relearning python since a few days ago but it will take a while to master it.",

You would find it on your 4th iteration and return true.\n\nLet's say you wanted to do binary search instead \n\nSo first step, you cut the array in half. N / 2 = 2.5, so we just pick index 2.\n\nThere's a 3 there, which isn't what we want. So we compare if it's higher or lower than 4.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 4, and we know the array is sorted, then we know that 4 is in the right half of the array\n\n[4 5]. Now, N = 2\n\nSo you cut the array in half again. N/2 = 1, and at index 1, there's the number 5. It's higher than 4, so we have to cut in half again\n\n[4]\n\nNow there's only one element, and it's the number we want, so we return true.\n\nYou will see that we had to cut the array in half only 3 times before we found it.\n\nBinary search has complexity O(log N) because the number of times we need to iterate with respect to the magnitude of the input (in this case, the number of elements in the array) is log (base 2) of N \n\nThe things that are important when it comes to big O runtime complexity is to\n\n1. Identify how you're measuring the input\n2. Draw out each step of the algorithm\n3. Determine the amount of steps you would have in the worst case.\n\nFor linear search, the worst case is having to check every element. So given N elements, you perform N iterations.\n\nIn the case of binary search, since you're cutting the number of elements to search in half every iteration, you only need search log(base 2) N times, plus the one if there are odd number of elements.",

Learn how different systems communicate and how we send requests and process requests. Basically, learn how the web works before coding anything. Move to coding then start with basic CRUD apps, then try it with a real database, then move to authentication and authorization. Learn about documenting your backend architecture and api's. Then you can move to advance topics like caching and database optimization. While doing all this make basic apps and try to get familiarized with Docker and Git.\n\nI may be missing some steps in between, but this is the gist of it. I am not that experienced, but this is how I started to learn it. You can dm me if you have confusion in something.",

If/Else statements are very powerful, but once you start chaining tons of them, it is always a good place to stop and ask if you can do it in a better way, whether that be with a match / switch case (some languages call them switch), or using a design pattern like a state machine.\n\nGood example of that would be a video game character with multiple states like crouching or jumping. Someone could string a dozen if/else statements, and check nested if/else statements inside those blocks... Or they could use a state machine.\n\nOn that note, I hope this [website](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) all about design patterns can be of use to you.\n\nHappy I could help, all the best and happy holidays!",

Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.\n\nLet the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.\n\nAs you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \\`ngrok\\` to  temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \\`ngrok\\` and your computer are running).\n\nNow that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.\n\nCloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.\n\nWhatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing. Take TODO and add subscriptions/payments, member management, calendar schedules, email/sms reminders, single-sign on, SaaS deployment (cloud), whatever else you can think of. If you just do frontend, touch every angle of it in your projects.\n\nThis is a possible roadmap for you that will keep you busy and hopefully motivated for a while. Once you can do this, you can pretty much build anything.\n\nStart small and keep adding small things to it.\n\nI hope this helps.",

        "body": "Picture yourself in the early 1980s. There is no internet. There barely are any knowledgeable people in your area. Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.\n\nAll you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.\n\nHow do you learn?\n\nThrough experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try  more and eventually succeed.\n\nYou won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.\n\nOnce you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.\n\nThe notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because \"why should we when everything is readily available?\". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)\n\nDiscipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.\n\nThe thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).\n\nOnce you understand how to \"think like a programmer\" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.\n\nMaybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015. Another recommendable site is [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here, you get challenges and have \"hints\" and guidance.\n\nAs usual with such posts (of which there are more than plenty), some Literature (aka *books*):\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nTo address your \"all coders do is just copy-paste\" statement: yes, we do copy paste, but not because we *could not do the job*, it's because of time constraints, trusted and tested solutions. Contrary to a beginner/learner, we can assess what a solution copied from the internet does, how it fits into our codebase, what side effects it has, etc. We could come up with our own solutions, but that would be less efficient in a professional setting than to resort to tested and trusted solutions.",

For small lists, arrays win by a mile.\n\nHowever, for large enough lists, the asymptotic runtime complexity will still dominate.\n\nIn other words, if the primary operations are inserting and deleting from arbitrary locations, then a LinkedList will be faster than an ArrayList for large enough lists.\n\nLast I checked, that cutoff is in the hundreds. Maybe it’s in the thousands now, but either way it certainly doesn’t require an array of millions for a LinkedList to be useful.",

This almost inevitably means the list isn't used that often, since you can't even search for values without reads quickly becoming the major operation, and so even worrying about it isn't worth it.\n\nOne example would be monitoring the lifetime of objects. Here you mostly care about the oldest and newest object, and whenever an object dies, you have a mutation. Any new object simply gets added to the end.\n\nBut even here, just a few necessary searches will kill any performance advantage you got, so you'd need to be very sure that your performance optimization holds, and will hold for a long time. And if you ever need to change something, you'll quickly have to swap out the linked list with a more powerful data structure anyway.\n\nSo even if you ever find a place where a linked list fits, you most likely will instead choose a tree, skip list or the like instead.",

It completely removes critical thinking in favor of quick answers that may or may not be wrong. I keep seeing all these \"10x\" improvement people and how they work so much faster only to realize they never cared about the code they wrote or the quality to begin with they just want results and output which is fine until those outputs result in security vulnerabilities, logic errors, tech debt etc.  \n\nPeople seem to forget humans wrote all the code that LLMs are trained on, code that has miles and miles of error prone code and bugs.

These are the enrollment statistics for universities in Ontario, which is the province where I'm from: [Statistics | Ontario Universities' Application Centre](https://www.ouac.on.ca/statistics/). If you look at the statistics by program group tab and you filter for 2024 in one box and 2025 in the other, you can see that there has been a noticeable drop off equal to approximately a 25% reduction not just in applications, but also in acceptances/confirmations for CS programs. Although these are only statistics for Ontario, I have no reason to believe that the same would not be happening elsewhere; I doubt there's anything special about these statistics compared to any others. And clearly, this shows that the cat is out of the bag regarding how CS is a more competitive field than it used to be, so there's no reason to suggest that enrollment won't keep decreasing for the foreseeable future.",

It has its uses, its not completely unusable and if you are creative you will find a way for it to do something its good at - but mostly its terrible at real engineering. \n\n\nI now interpret other developers talking about how helpful ai is for them to be a sort of self-report. The thing ai is best at is implementing things like functions with very strict input and output, and creating tests... which has literally never been the engineering bottleneck in my experience. The real work of an engineer is turning customer feedback or PO requests into a cohesive system that will solve a need. Even before ai, most of my coworkers didn't struggle with function implementation, some were even better than me at it... the thing they mostly struggle with is architecture and ownership, and ai appears to be *hurting* this more than it's helping.\n\n\nSo yeah, I feel pretty gaslit as well.",

I would never in a million years think to use Copilot of ChatGPT for a task.  I wouldn't even really consider those products to be coding tools compared to how useful Claude Code is.  But even a tool like Claude Code is only as good as the person directing it.  It's not a replacement for a junior, but it is a replacement for a few hours a day I might've wasted context switching between code bases. \n\nIf somebody is speaking broadly about AI, I kind of tune it out.  There's a big difference between what each tool is good at regardless of what the benchmark scores say.  I'd much rather use the things and figure out for myself if they work.

Good engineers can almost smell where a problem is coming from. And that's not about using the debugger tools well, it's about training your instincts. Good engineers can debug systems without seeing any of the code much less running it in a debugger.\n\nThere's lots of tools to help with diagnostics, but it's the process and the experience that really make the difference. Bad engineers have the same access to logs, metrics, tools, etc that good engineers have...and yet bad engineers often can *NEVER* find a problem that a good engineer will pinpoint in minutes.\n\nAnd \"debugging\" doesn't just stop at software: Once you develop the mindset and practices you end up applying it everywhere. After all, building software is really about *debugging people's problems* and patching them with software. Bad engineers write bad software because fundamentally they can't diagnose the problems users are having that they are hired to fix as a software developer.\n\nHow do you get there?  Have a talent for it helps a lot.  After that it's lots and lots and lots of debugging of everything, everywhere, all the time.",

Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things. Even a simple \"how to run this test\" can go a long way and is proof of what you did. \n\n\\- When you finsih something, give yourself credit and post it somewehre or mention it in standup. This is somethign many of us struggle with, giving ourselves credit. To get promoted you want the higher ups to know what you did and how you participated in that. \n\n\\- Take 10 minutes after standup to present anything or even show a doc. Again, you want to be recognizable. You want your boss to say \"OP had a good presentation post-standup that was really interesting\". \n\n\\- It's better to do 5 tasks and shwo your work than it is to do 10 tasks and keep quiet. This was my biggest issue. Id do tasks but never really wanted the praise or to present it so i kept quiet. My coworkers thought i wasnt doing much and in review seasons i didnt have much coworkers to sing my praises. \n\n\\- Dont be a passive engineer. A lot of engineers are good but are very passive. In stand up they dont really say they are stuck, they only say \"i continued working on X and investgiaging a small issue\". Nothing else. Nobody is going to help if you dont say \"im stuck\" and trust me engineers get more mad if you spend a week stuck on the same issue then if on day 1 you say \"im stuck\". Time is money. Reach out to coworkers and talk to them about issues. That conversation could lead you to getting close with a higher up engineer. If you as a junior can get a principal engineer to back you up, that goes a far way.",

From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. \n\nOne of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. \n\nThe other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. \n\nThe thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me. I’ve learned so much from starting my position that I don’t think I would be anywhere near where I am in knowledge and experience without either of them.",

There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated.

Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. \n\nI think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.\n\n1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. \n\n2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.\n\n3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.\n\n\nIt’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.\n\nI’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review. I’d be so excited to just get the feedback ‘Yo, you didn’t do a good job solving this LC problem. Or your architecture skills and thought process isn’t what we are looking for’. But it’s just like… no one even gives you a chance to interview if you don’t BS your resume with AI. Then those are the pool of people you can hire, and the quality of the hiring goes down.",

Location is a major factor.\n\nIn markets like New York or Silicon Valley, you have people who have sacrificed years of their lives to prep for demanding positions, so every role that gets posted has a ton of competition. When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.\n\nI've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \\~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.\n\nWe get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy. (clear rate for a fully passing solution is probably about 5% of all candidates that reach that stage).\n\nI really think unemployed engineers who are having trouble securing an offer for months have the wrong strategy. They should be taking up these 'easy' low paying jobs, moving temporarily, and then continuing to interview for their hotshot Big Tech and Silicon Valley roles. A six figure salary in a medium cost of living area is better than sitting around all day waiting for the next OA.",

The quality of peers has declined. Interview intensity has gone way up. There is the expectation now that ai just makes it all happen magically and that we will be eliminated soon anyways. Dollar is worth less. \n\nThere was a time you could be good at one part of the stack and be paid well. Now the expectation is your good at fe, be, observability, continuous integration, testing, deployment, wireframes, reqs & documentation, etc. It used to be if the codebase was a mess or you weren’t familiar with some framework they would cut you slack of train you but less so now. It used to be a few devs in a room working through stuff. Now everyone’s remote on different continents crammed into tiny noisy apartments. You’re still supposed to manage to mentor them.  Usually most of the team has already been outsourced so they really don’t have the same skin in the game and your heads on the chopping block. The interview used to focus on your degree, likability, location, and experience.  It went from white boarding to take home test and live coding exams to leet code with ai graders kidding your voice and eye movements. Not to mention how everything’s flooded now so getting noticed / not getting duped leading up to the interview view is harder. The expectation of 2x ai productivity doesn’t account for the quality of the ai, existing code, or clarity of instructions. Then there is pay. It’s held strong in a way and even grown faster than other industries but the dollar is worth under 1/3 as much as ten years ago in terms of shelter, transportation, healthcare, and food. Then there’s the increase in domestic cs degrees coming online and the over hiring in the covid market rally which went to layoffs then to ai hiring. \n\nI’ve had 6 jobs in ten years and everyone has laid us off or been bought out. Some were productive, some kept the companies software alive, others had no idea what they wanted. Can definitely make you tired. But that’s why it’s a job, right? Made some money.

Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being \"correct\".\n\nIn the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.\n\nWhat makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.\n\nLike if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company. But you wont be a senior at a company where scale matters and vice versa.\n\nYou could be a senior level expert at CUDA programming and then be junior at cloud stuff. Thats why again id put senority to yoe/overall exposer and it changes depending on the scope.",

Harden your alerts, metrics, and your tests and you will *reduce* the chances of an outage. In my experience I've categorized outages as unforced errors and just being unlucky.\n\nWas the system down because of an unforced error? Lead a technical review on it. Why did it get to that point? How? How can you prevent it from happening again and how can you apply this to OTHER cases in the future? Reduce unforced errors to 0.\n\nUnfortunately. there will be times that you will need to put out fires. That's part of the job. For example, [Log4Shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) was a week ruiner for many. AWS, Azure, etc. outages have caused fires at work.\n\nAlso fwiw if you're not really needed in these meetings, you can really just go to the concert and attend chats through your phone if you want.",

As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. \"Hey, what happens if...?\"\n\nSecond, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.\n\nHowever, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, \"How can I help?\" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.\n\nFinally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer. Recognizing this and knowing it is very important as you navigate office politics in the future.",

If it's generic or looks like AI slop that's an anti-signal.\n\n- Does the resume indicate a clear understanding of WHY the info they list is important or worth mentioning? I do not want a laundry list of every task a candidate has ever done, I want the highlights that indicate skillsets and ability.\n\n- Have they articulated previously done work that's similar to what we're looking for, or are they just regurgitating a tech stack? For strong candidates I don't care if they have exact tech stack matches, but sometimes more junior or otherwise weaker-signal candidates will get to a screen for having rare tech stack matches.\n\n- Do I recognize their university, prior companies, or anything else on their resume (e.g. notable open source contributions, math or programming competitions, publications at relevant venues)?\n\nAnd frankly at the end of the day I am wildly overloaded and am one person making a quick judgement.

At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \\~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \\~5 which we would invite to interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.\n\nIf you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.\n\nDo you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words \"for your kind consideration\"? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?\n\nWhy on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?\n\nFor what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.\n\nBut I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.\n\nAnd your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.\n\nAnd if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.\n\nAnd then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.\n\nBelieve me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",

Well, it's partly luck. Be very aware of little problems you have or others have and constantly ask, is there a digital solution for this problem?\n\nConstantly being aware and asking that question is part of it. The other part is throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks. You can be surprised what winds up working versus what you thought would work and was a great idea. What you are trying to do is find the outlier event in a large distribution - and that requires many, many trials until you hit it.\n\nYou'll never know if you don't test many innumerable ideas out in reality. The trick is to run these tests (as many as possible) without bankrupting your self and keeping the overhead low. One good principle to hold to is: \"what I think will work is irrelevant, what works is the only relevant thing\" - in other words, be REACTIVE and not PRO-ACTIVE. See if something might work - test it like a scientist with a hypothesis and then act based on objective observation. Good luck (you and the rest of us are going to need it...).\n\nAnd just accept that if you want a shot at success - you will have to endure many, many, endless trials that result in failure - until you hit the one that does not (hopefully).",

You have more time to yourself to plan your next move, or take some time for self-care.

Helpful for people who forget to track their work throughout the year.\n\n  3. Manager-side summarization - Some companies are experimenting with AI to help managers synthesize feedback from multiple sources.\n\nThe biggest shift I've noticed isn't AI doing the reviews—it's AI making it harder to hide behind vague statements. When you can generate specific examples easily, \"improved system performance\" without details looks lazier than it used to.",

You had a job for life and a nice pension for retirement.\n\nIn 1981 a new CEO came in. He cut any non profit part of the company. Every department was expect to fire the bottom 15%, no matter how they did compared to others. I think he removed the pensions, but not sure on this one. GE’s stock price soared.\n\nJack Welsh’s tenure at GE was the catalyst that set corporations to become what they are today. Also a CEO’s job is to increase share price.

The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.\n\nThis framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.\n\nIf the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.\n\n**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.\n\nThat’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.\n\nThis gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.\n\nIf your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management. That’s unfortunate, but it is a separate problem from how you should handle the situation with your coworker.",

Not sure if you are blaming yourself, and not sure if that thought will make you feel better or worse. \n\nWith that out of the way, a couple things to consider:\n\n- don’t accept any interview. You said that C++ position was a long shot. Was it just a waste of time and energy? Did it just make you feel down?\n- maybe it’s time to learn some stuff. If you know the Spring Framework, learning Spring Boot should be pretty easy. It’s supposed to make things easier. \n- more daunting, but if you learn React, you will hit more position requirements. I’m primarily backend, and I’ve been filtered out for not knowing React. \n\nLearning new stuff obviously requires effort. You might feel like you can’t. There’s only so much time in the day, so you have to pick and choose. ",

DevOps and CI/CD tooling are becoming titles, so if you're interested in maintaining software ecosystems you can take some courses on them. Likewise, React and VueJS have largely replaced vanilla jQuery. If you like web dev, pick either one up.

A resume that says \"I do everything\" isn't going to catch eyes the way that \"I'm your C++ expert\" can. Resumes are brochures of what you can do in the posting you apply for.

It helps to understand the difference between hard and soft interrupts, how registers work and why for example \"boolean\" data won't likely save any actual memory vs an int...or if it does why it's now slower than an int.\n\nIt's *always* beneficial to understand what is going on under the hood of the higher level constructs you're using.

For example, looking at latency of virus scanning for images. However, the cutoff is much more \"is this too slow at the scale we expect to matter\" instead of \"is this the absolute best option\". Also, we don't have free reign to choose whatever stack we want. There are languages that our developers are familiar with, ones for which we have tooling (e.g. Terraform modules), and for which we can easily collect metrics. I got in a bit of trouble for using Python for a cloud function script because it wasn't an \"approved language\". IMO, you can absolutely build something that would scale to 100m daily users in Python or Ruby (not that I would want to), as the language matters much less than the architecture and actual implementation. I think there is this idea that you need to use C or Rust to get the \"absolute best performance\", and that is probably true on a micro scale, but on a macro scale, you can just use a native extension and get the same performance boost without actually writing low-level code.",

It sounds like a couple smaller businesses and proprietorships I've seen around here. But you're saying it's a *median software* company. The only ones I'm aware of that meet that kind of description (near me) would be Revature and other WITCH companies. They keep devs benched on small projects, and try to get you placed with a client so they earn a cut of your salary and you get experience. Sometimes they'll exaggerate your skills to get a bigger salary cut.\n\n\nAre you working on a greenfield project that the company doesn't really need, but feels is a worthwhile gamble? Are you an intern or in training right now? Those are the contexts where I could understand assigning a solo dev at a company.

Either tech is a secondary focus, or you're isolated from the tech center of your company. I worked at a tech consulting company/digital agency, and they had someone on staff who helped the accounting team. After that person resigned, the company would ask random people for help on things. He didn't use version control.\n\nThis isn't normal, but I don't think it's completely unique, as you hear stories about people who have this experience. In the old days, teams were responsible for their own IT and work, and you'd have teams spring up like this all across departments, until they brought in someone to organize everything. I should probably say \"if\" rather than \"until.\" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. \n\nIs there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? \n\nI also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example. The tech leads did everything, and the people on the management side didn't do much work outside of call names during daily standups. They certainly didn't understand any of the work from a business perspective. There are all levels of bad companies out there.",

But I encourage you to apply for a relevant diploma or degree if you'd like better job security. Many government employers, companies with long-term contracts, and tech companies can afford to be selective. A related degree gives you more options, more offers, and helps keep you off the chopping block when a company needs easy staff to lay off. Since you've got a degree and some CS courses, you can potentially ladder that into a major and/or get transfer credits.\n\n\nAll that said, what's your non-STEM degree?

The _quality_ of your network trumps the _quantity_ of people in it.\n\nIt's possible, even likely, that these people aren't actually looking at your profile and saying \"oh, I should connect with them, I have a good opportunity for them.\" How do I know this? Because, by your own admission, they haven't actually reached out to speak to you. They may be using automated tools to just spam out connection requests to keyword hits.\n\nThese are low-quality connections for both you and the recruiters/HR people. The odds of these turning into mutually beneficial relationships are somewhere between zilch and nada.\n\nPut more thought into who you accept connections from, be more selective. I don't click Accept unless I've had a conversation with the person or they're connected with someone I know who can vouch for them. I also have my LinkedIn profile set such that no one can send me a connection request without first following me - adding that tiny barrier helps a lot. If I could require that a personalized message be included with the request, I'd flip that switch too.",

The thinking goes: if I can’t get a job as a SWE, I’ll just *drop down* a rung or two and get one of those jobs. \n\nWhile there is very significant skill overlap between various positions in software engineering and IT, it’s not really a hierarchy. There are people just like you who have trained and educated themselves for those jobs, and they’re struggling just as hard as you are because hiring in all tech jobs sucks equally right now. If you “drop down” to one of those jobs, you’re just another applicant, but you don’t necessarily even have the same qualifications as those other applicants. (I hear your question about getting some of those qualifications). \n\nLong story short, in my opinion, there’s no reason to believe that switching focus to IT jobs will lead to more job opportunities than in the field you have been preparing for in college.",

While it was honestly exhausting at times, within two months, I saw my portfolio go from just ideas to five fully functional projects.

The market for new grads has just been brutal, especially if you didn’t get a return offer lined up before graduating.\n\nGoing into IT is a totally reasonable move if you treat it as a bridge, not a dead end. GeekSquad + Network+ + cloud certs can absolutely move you toward DevOps or SRE if you keep one foot in software. Plenty of people have gone IT → sysadmin → DevOps once they could show scripting, automation, and cloud work.\n\nThe key is to not stop building or talking like an engineer. Keep shipping small projects, automate stuff at work if you can, write scripts, mess with CI/CD, cloud deployments, monitoring. That’s what makes the transition believable later. If you fully pivot away from coding for a few years, it’s harder to come back.\n\nAlso, you’re doing a lot right already. Hackathons, freelance, startup, networking, referrals, interviews. The lack of offers isn’t because you’re weak, it’s just timing and competition. IT can give you income, experience, and momentum while the market recovers.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned is that interviews reward people who can clearly explain what they’ve built and why. During interviews I’ve used StealthCoder to keep my thoughts structured on screen so I don’t undersell myself or blank, especially when my path isn’t “traditional.” That helps when you’re coming from IT or mixed backgrounds.\n\nShort answer: yes, IT can be a smart move if you’re intentional about it. Just don’t mentally give up on engineering if that’s what you actually want.",

One candidate, who I never spoke to, was deemed argumentative by an interviewer. He told his third-party recruiter he didn't think he was, and asked for clarification. A good portion of the team took this as him being argumentative again. I tried to argue their case, but honestly, the team was full of assholes. The director from HR had a huge ego and wanted to say anyone who had been laid off was laid off for a reason, and one of the interviewers wanted to lowball candidates, especially if they had been laid off. You can't really predict how people will act. \n\nJust be honest if they reach out and ask for clarification. If they ask, and they should if they discover an inconsistencies, you can say things changed and you were never asked. FWIW, I offered up that I had been laid off during my interview process. I was originally employed when contacted, but I got laid off along the way. An interviewer asked something where I could have glossed it over, but I decided to be honest about it. I'm not saying honesty is always the best policy. I certainly wish I had kept it to myself during salary negotiation, but they did give me more than I had originally asked for.",

It honestly felt like shouting into the void at times. However, after refining my approach and networking more effectively during that process, I saw improvement within about six weeks. My confidence grew as my skills advanced, from having zero industry contacts to connecting with several professionals who offered valuable insights, it made a significant difference.

That's a little tongue in cheek, but it's worth having some perspective: people that work mining coal a mile underground don't do it for fun, don't study coal mining as a hobby, and don't participate in miner meetups. We all need to keep some perspective on how lucky we are that there's even a question there.\n\nIn that vein:\n\n> I enjoyed going to the office, using my split keyboard, having triple monitor setup, cool desk decorations\n\nI don't mean this to be discouraging at all: but you need to get more out of things than that. Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying better tools and environment - but careers are long and tweaking your setup isn't going to keep you motivated beyond the next few months, let alone decades.\n\nBut all that said - you aren't entirely wrong. This is both a job and a career, and if you're not learning stuff or getting growth opportunities then that isn't good. You won't always have interesting things to build, but if you never get that then you're going to stagnate and that's where people run into trouble finding new jobs.\n\nYou should be able to work with your manager to identify some growth areas and find some tickets where you can learn something. That's a perfectly reasonable expectation. But the key is to focus on what you can learn and what new skills you can build: it being \"exciting\" doesn't really enter into it.",

Mind you, I started out working on build systems at FAANG, and it was very different than what it is today. The trick is to find platform teams that are hiring SWEs where you can build tools that take the pain of infrastructure off of the product teams.\n\nThere are a lot of DevOps/SRE roles that intersect this space and are 90% config-writing (infrastructure as code), but if you can get into writing custom Terraform modules and Kubernetes controllers you'll be highly sought after. I had a recruiter recently tell me that they pay their platform SWEs more than their backend or frontend SWEs because they're more specialized and harder to find. \n\nIt's not for everyone, but give it a solid try, you won't be boxing yourself in (at least this early in your career). I have specialized in this role for 10 years so I show up in searches for senior positions. Recruiters that find me for product teams will usually end up having the hiring manager reject my resume because I haven't worked on product for a decade. But I'm not pursuing those types of roles at this point anymore. I think you've got a ways before you're in that position. At your level it's normal to jump between domains to figure out what you like.",

We interviewed on campus in rented rooms.\n\nWhat matters is #1 work experience in the form of internship or co-op. #2 is university prestige so rankings but, again T30 vs T50 is fake. #1 or #2 in your state is fine.

I can guarantee they won't hire a senior or CTO until they get funding. \n\nAlso, good engineering practices cost money: licenses, infrastructure, etc.--not a lot of money, but they seem kind of short on money, which would be another good question to ask: if they can't even afford laptops, how will they afford AWS, etc.\n\nGood luck. I just want to make sure you approach this with hard realism: it's something to put on your resume, maybe you'll learn a few things. Anything else is like winning the lottery. Hell, I treat stock options at  funded startups that are hitting their milestones as lottery tickets. If you want my labor, I work for cash, not promises.

Fake check scam: https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_fake_check\n\n> The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.\n> \n> Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.\n> \n> When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam.

There's a disconnect in communication between that term and the general prestige behind the programs however. There's a difference of being a degree mill and having a high acceptance rate in order to farm as many average students as possible versus being a competitive program that is selective to get into.\n\nThe original comment is correct from what I've experienced, no one has really cared if it's research versus course based, and if they were looking specifically for research they would end up gatekeeping to the PhD level.",

Doesn't have to be a managerial role or have the word senior in the title. Individual contributors in technical support/escalations at bigger tech companies make really solid money. Over the long term you can still work on attaining a dev role since you know it will be harder to break into with no formal CS background or dev experience.",
