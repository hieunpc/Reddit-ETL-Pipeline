Some candidates tried inviting an AI \"note taker\" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \\*asked\\* if they could do so).\n\nWe then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.\n\nBut every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate \"You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?\"\n\nEvery single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.\n\nI can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",

Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.\n\nMost content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. \n\nAlso, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster. \n\nI’ve worked across multiple stacks as a consultant, and my approach has stayed the same: understand data, compute, movement, and modelling.

This is also a softskills problem. Sorry to break it to you but markets do not operate on merit alone. It's also who you know, who you get to know, and timing.

Everyone rushed pushing pipelines into production without proper models, processes, conventions and standards in place. Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. \n\nMy current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. \n\nWhen we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. \n\nThere's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times. ",

Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. \n\nData modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.\n\nNow this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. \n\nSo how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!\n\nIf anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source. ",

It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit.  I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may  like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions.  A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.\n\nI am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon.  I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now.  Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem).  A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers.  \n\nThe way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to).  So in the end it can only answer simple questions like \"tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months\".  Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy?  Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",

You will need to spend more time on a dev setup (e.g. unit tests are awfully slow without a spark connect server which you fire up each morning), but you also get some goodies such as Spark UI/History Server and a really powerful and stable API.\n\n\n- As you are using Delta, I would be cautious with duckdb. Afaict, write support is not yet there, and even for reads I had undocumented not-implemented errors bubble up from the internal c++ code (on1.41 if I remember correctly). The API there does not yet look super stable.\n\n\n- On the off chance that you are in a corporate environment where your development machines run windows, strongly prefer polars over spark.

All the cdc pipelines work great, and I haven't had any issues.\n\nI have to ask, how come you can't use mirroring for your on-prem sql?

There might be other tools (BI tools, proxies, etc) that have built in support for more popular platforms that won't work with MotherDuck out the box. None of these are particularly insurmountable, just costs you should be happy to take on in exchange for the experience you like. \n\n\n\nOne thing you might do to hedge is store data at rest in Iceberg on GCS and self host a catalog like \\[Lakekeeper\\](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/). Then your data is completely portable. If you for some reason determine you need to switch to Snowflake or Databricks, they can read data form this catalog and you don't have to move anything. Or you may even find out you want MotherDuck for most things but have specific use cases where another engine like Clickhouse is useful. This approach lets you separate the concerns of how the data is stored from what product(s) you use to query it.",

It is not a super complicated stack but it *is* work and creates an additional point of failure, especially with the networking and security side of it imo.   \n  \nMy recommendation is keep it as is if you love it since Motherduck appears to be a very affordable service, if you end up having to migrate later on it should not be a very heavy lift.

Then after that, become familiar with at least one major cloud provider. AWS, Azure, GCP. Be strategic here. I’ve noticed specific industries prefer one vs the others. \n\nYour data analyst background should have given you ample knowledge on how to create tables (ideally in sql, but I think understanding excel tables and pivot tables help too). Data exploration is an important skill, but understanding schemas and how they fit together is the crucial part. Your data analyst background should help with data modeling as well. Try to focus on roles that highlight these things in the job description. \n\nAlso be aware that there are different flavors of data engineers. Being analytics focused means you’re more on the business intelligence and dashboarding side. Highlight your storytelling and data vis exp. If you’re on the ML side, highlight how you productionize ML models and maintain workflows.",

The concepts transfer really well. S3 vs ADLS, Glue vs ADF, Redshift vs Synapse are different names, same ideas.

You don’t need to master both.\n\n\nAlso, product companies preferring AWS isn’t a hard rule, it’s just more common historically. Plenty of good teams care more about how you think than which cloud you used last.\n\n\nSo no, you don’t need to panic learn everything.

I did publish a few blogs, but mostly under the context of integration with compute engines, like [https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/](https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/) and [https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/) . For all the supported catalogs, you can basically use Lance side by side with your Iceberg datasets.\n\nBut I think you raised a great question - \"anyone actually cataloging their lance datasets? or is everyone just yolo-ing it\". I did these integrations because we do have real customers using them. But I do see a common trend that data engineers in enterprise corporations that have data lake, data warehouse or data lakehouse setups, and trying to integrate Lance for AI features tend to want catalog support. For the frontier labs AI engineers, they tend to just prefer having storage-only solution and yolo-ing it.\n\nTo bridge that gap, I also did one catalog within Lance, the Directory Namespace: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/) . It is basically a catalog living in a directory, backed by a Lance table, so everything still stays purely in storage. It is also compatible with just a plain directory of Lance tables, which is typically how people start using lance format, when they do pip install lancedb and create a table. \n\nIn general, most of the users I interact with treat embedding as a part of real data assets. You can definitely store multiple versions of embeddings generated by different models for different use cases or just compare their effectiveness and switch over time. That is actually one key use case for Lance, which is you start with a table with just a single column, maybe images or videos. You continue to do data evolution - add embedding columns, caption columns, feature columns over time, and they accumulate and become a very wide table. That becomes your entire multimodal data asset. Check out some case studies with for example Netflix [https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/](https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/), Runway: [https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/)",

They just think 'but this is what everyone else is using so I should use it'.\n\nThe annoying thing is, if you have good judgement and figure out the most appropriate tech to use, that can get in the way of upskilling if you settle on a simple, cheap but more mundane alternative.\n\nIf you want to learn some of the things you listed:\n- if you're using snowflake, why not just start using dbt + git to manage your SQL?\n- how is data getting into snowflake in the first place? If that looks quite manual at the moment, maybe try setting up airflow to schedule data extraction / load\n\nI think you could probably find opportunities to do things you want to - obviously not all of it but maybe have a think about what's possible",

Same with Airflow—just automating even one small pipeline can help you understand DAGs and scheduling.

It’s never happening, don’t try.\n\nMy advice: be practical and treat the old stuff like it’s cancer that needs to be cut out.\n\nDon’t try to document the mess you have. Instead build or fix things one piece at a time and document that as you go. Build in parallel, dual run against the old things, and when you know the old tables and batches are redundant, take them out back and shoot them in the head.\n\nAlso, forget AI. It knows when I’ve forgotten to close a print statement in my shitty code, but it doesn’t know architecture or systems design.\n\nIf you want to automate this, try the missing index reports.\n\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-missing-index-groups-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17\n\nBe wary, this reflects what queries are written and run (probably by the same useless engineers that made this mess) rather than the actual logic and definitions that matters. So a badly written query moving data no one needs will be boosted in the output ranking.

My career since graduating in 2019 has been built on Spark, and I absolutely love it, but it's going to be a bit complex to learn thoroughly unless you're already comfortable with Scala or Python. Snowflake (SF) would probably be much easier to learn as SF is more of a SQL-first paradigm; I'd recommend learning **Iceberg** in parallel to SF.\n\nMaybe look into experimenting with real time streaming solutions as well like (Kafka / SQS) + (Spark Streaming / Flink / Golang) to stream table changes (CDC) from an RDBMS (e.g. Postgres) into an Iceberg table that could be queried via Snowflake.\n\nAlso be sure to know when to use a row-based file format (e.g. Avro) and when to use column-based format (e.g. Parquet).\n\nFrom there you'll have a solid starting point in the SQL + Snowflake + Iceberg world and can branch out to the Spark + Databricks + Delta world if required or curious.",

Goes back to mainframe batch processing. If your metadata drives what runs and when, this fits.\n\n\"Pipeline Metadata Store\" is more modern, emphasizes you're tracking pipeline state rather than just \"jobs.\" Works well if you're in a dbt/Airflow world.\n\n\"Orchestration Control Tables\" if you want to be explicit that this layer is decoupled from your actual data models.\n\n\"Run Manifest\" is borrowed from dbt. Better if your metadata is more about \"what happened\" (observability) vs \"what should happen\" (control).\n\nI'd skip anything with \"connector\" unless it's actually handling source system connections. That term is overloaded now, half the modern data stack thinks connector = Fivetran/Airbyte-style ingestion.\n\nQuick side note: if you're manually querying these tables at job start to figure out dependencies and last-run timestamps, might be worth checking if your orchestrator exposes that natively through its metadata DB or API. Saves you from maintaining two sources of truth for job state..and a huge future headache.\n\nWhat orchestrator are you on?",

There is 0 gain from making it a snapshot and eating the storage and eventually processing speed. I wouldn't worry too much about what others think of how and where the data should work in theory. Theory rarely ever applies in the real world, the data and how you get it dictates what you do and in this field most cases, you have 0 control over the source of the data. Which means almost nothing operates like it should and you just have to get the data as accurate as possible, as efficiently as possible space, and processing wise.\n\n  \nTo me, Bronze always matches source, or at least as close to it as you can possibly get. If it doesn't, you are going to have a horrible time running down why things don't match up. Snapshotting like option A is really only good for if you need to see how things have changed over time, or doing day to day comparisons at the Bronze level and I'd rarely ever want to do that because that's honestly a waste of space and processing. \n\n  \nAs for Option C, I would avoid anything that makes data right after the fact and there's a point in time where non-dirty read data is inaccurate.

Sounds like you're a decent SWE doing DE stuff without formal DE & BI training.\n\nPython to gather API - 100% - but the way you do it, that data with that format at that time is lost forever.\n\nPython with API to a Datalake container, one folder per source, and subfolder per source API name. Store as JSON. Why? For SSoT and what if the supplier of that API goes out of business, changes their API in some way, that breaks your code? What if in your dataframe the tuple you extract as a table, you're not pulling all entites or all columns - then the business wants you to add those extra columns, retroactively from Day 1 you've been gathering. You're screwed - you don't have it anymore.\n\nSo E-L-T. Extract (Python + API), Load (into storage for 100% retrieval of 100% of that data), Transform (into a Staging layer, dedupe, business rule(s) for ingestion UpSert or Rejection, into the Bronze layer.\n\nSo Bronze has proper types and only valid data, Bronze can be destroyed (for a particular source) and recreated at any point in time in the future by rereading all the data in the Datalake and redoing the L & T of the ELT. \n\nStaging is usually truncate/load style, and uses Datalake functionality for ingestion - Python isn't needed here at all. Python only for reading from APIs and other distant sources, not for moving data around in the database.\n\nPython has another function - for ML - where Python does extensive transformations by reading Bronze & Silver (or even the raw Datalake data) to \"invent\" new data that is then fed back into a Staging layer.  For example, a customer \"rating\" based on criteria that can span multiple source systems for that customer.",

Remember to do Delete tracking, and other special cases, like Customer B buys out Customer A, what does the business want to do with the Customer A data? Merge or keep distinct, or both!",

Bq is a good fit at 150k orders/yr if you’re disciplined about partitioning/retention and don’t let Looker queries go wild, and Airbyte→BQ is a common pattern. Two quick pushes though: I wouldn’t drop line items entirely (you’ll want them for margin/returns/cohort/LTV and subscription analysis), but you can keep them in a separate table/partition and only join when needed; and I’d strongly consider adding a lightweight transform layer (dbt or even scheduled SQL) so your “business tables” (orders, customers, subscriptions, spend) are stable and not raw connector schemas.\n\nFor costs/lock-in: biggest surprise costs are usually (1) Looker exploring raw wide tables, (2) GA event data blowing up, and (3) Airbyte sync volume if you pull too much too often. oh yeah also get budgets/alerts in GCP day 1, partition/cluster core tables, and create curated views for Looker so analysts aren’t querying raw. Also, if you ever want less lock-in later, keeping transforms in dbt + storing raw exports (GCS) makes migrating much easier than relying on tool-specific modeling.",

It’s broad but Snowflake-specific: architecture, micro-partitions, cost/performance tradeoffs, security, time travel, data sharing. Not hard conceptually, but very “do you know how Snowflake actually works.”\n\nThe advanced certs are role-based rather than general:\n\n* Architect / Admin are very environment and governance-heavy\n* Data Engineer is focused on data movement, pipelines, performance tuning\n* Analyst / Data Scientist are narrower and more SQL / workflow oriented\n\nThey’re aimed at people with \\~2 years of real Snowflake experience, and honestly feel more like validation than learning tools.\n\nFor recruiter visibility, Core is the one most people recognize.

A few design things that usually matter more than model choicee would be like always ground generation on the actual schema + metrics layer, not just table names. Most failures come from the model guessing joins or columns, Add a validation step before execution (dry run, limits, blocked queries). Don’t let raw generated SQL hit prod blindly. Start narrow, Constrain what users can ask for (time ranges, metrics, dimensions) before going fully “chatty”. On the knowledge side, most teams I’ve seen keep it simple, Use RAG for business logic, definitions, metric semantics,Treat schema and relationships as structured input, not embeddings.GraphRAG helps when relationships are complex, but it adds a lot of operational overhead.Solr *can* work for retrieval, but it’s usually better as a search layer than a true graph store. If relationships matter a lot, a dedicated graph or just explicit schema metadata often ends up clearer and more reliable. and correctness and guardrails beat clever architecture early. If users don’t trust the numbers, they won’t use it, no matter how good the UX is",

You can find lot of information on Databricks Genie and its benchmarking results.\n\nIts a hard problem to solve especially around the biggest requirement which I see from analysts or power users, which is the need for quality and deterministic SQL code. This is where traditional BI does well, whereas LLMs could hallucinate.\n\nBest practices in Genie include using well curated metadata about each dataset, column definitions,  semantic understanding about the data etc. These become non negotiable with agent based solution, since that's the only context for AI.\n\nSomething like Genie being a tool in your arsenal will help your overall agentic solution.

You’re reacting to constraints like messy data, changing requirements, cost limits, and systems you didn’t choose. So the thinking becomes things like where this pipeline will actually break, what happens when volume doubles, what can fail safely and what cannot, and what’s expensive to recompute versus cheap to store. If you’re not on a DE project right now, the closest substitute is to simulate real pain. Take a public dataset and design ingestion, transformations, and reporting, then deliberately change assumptions like schema changes, late arriving data, backfills, or higher volume, and force yourself to optimize for cost and reliability instead of elegance. Books and blogs help with vocabulary, but most architectural thinking comes from asking what the simplest thing is that won’t hurt you later, then being wrong a few times. Reading postmortems and migration stories taught me more than polished tutorials ever did. You don’t really learn architecture in a vacuum, but you can train the mindset by constantly reasoning about constraints, failure modes, and long term impact",

Talk to few of the senior data engineers and they will give you better advise. \n\n2) Data Analytics degrees are cash cows and waste of time and money. You'd learn whole lot more if you were to build your own pipeline portfolio, load them on GitHub. Perhaps, look into bootcamps if that interest you at all. \n\n3) Data Analyst is generally an entry point into data field. Can scale up from there to senior DA roles or pivot into data engineering, data scientist, AI/ML, Data Architect, Solutions Architect roles. \n\n4) Don't leave your current role if the pay is good and career is stable. Job market right now is pretty harsh, will not make sense to leave a good paying job. \nTake full advantage of FAANG stocks, benefits and their free online courses taught by FAANG on coursera. Check with HR to see if transition is possible as an internal employee into tech, what would be the process. Find out data engineers internally on outlook, teams, slack and setup 1-on-1 with them, ask all kinds of questions about the skills needed, about their career path, etc. \n\n5) The most fundamental skill required for any data role is SQL, there's no shortcut to that and one cannot survive without knowing SQL at good level. \nFrom here skills will pivot based on the role. Ex: Data Engineers require strong data modeling, distributed systems (ex: Databricks, snowflake) storage and compute skills. Tools don't matter at all, focus on the core, basics, foundations as everything else is build on those.\nData Scientist: Strong Applied Math or Applied Stats skills, domain knowledge helps a lot.  \n\nFeel free to dm me if you want to talk more.",

Snowpipes can be triggered when a new file appears. Airflow deposits the file in the DL.\n\nThen a staging area (schema) that links to the landing area and allows hashing to eliminate dupes. No transformations here. All columns varchar. A reject schema for data that cannot fit into bronze due to an error. \n\nThen Medallion architecture for schemas bronze, silver, gold. \n\nBronze (column transformations to correct types) from the staging. Any data rows that do not conform go to reject schema. Also Bronze is a great place for SCD2 tables. \n\nSilver is new & inferred data that is valid but doesn’t exist in bronze. Like splitting customers by geographical zones based on their address. It can make sense for some silver tables to be SCD2, but that’s rare. \n\nFor geolocation you go get another single source of truth, stage it and bronze it. Then the silver combines two different bronze tables. The silver geolocation could be scd2 for tracking the moves that PK did. And so on. To meet all Gold requirements, for dimensions and facts.  \n\nGold is dimensional tables that Kimball and Snowflake are famous for. DIM and FACT. \n\nUsing Airflow for pushing the data in the Medallion layers is standard practice. \n\nTo go from BigQuery directly to Snowflake FACT, this is called a Proof Of Concept. Nothing wrong with that. Suggestion, put it in a Dev environment and build a Prod environment. \n\nDev & Prod (maybe UAT eventually) can simply be different database names, same Snowflake account, same Datalake account. \n\nYou do NOT want the PowerBI people doing their own “fill in the blanks“ that’s how you get data silos. They Will Do This !!!\n\nFor example (true life example) the PowerBI people will go get their own geolocation data from god knows where and make mistakes, so that Sales Dept will have X$ in one zone and Finance Dept will have Y$ in the same zone for the same time period, as each Dept will have a different PowerBI person. \n\nData must be centralized. For SSoT to work, and in every data row identity the source system for each PK. Maybe as part of your naming convention for the column. \n\nDon’t be afraid of typing long column names. Use acronyms when it makes sense. \n\nIf you haven’t already, take an online course on Medallion and Kimball architecture.",

(“EU data must stay in EU”, “India must stay in India”, etc.). “Each country in its own region” is usually not the real rule, it’s the vibe.\n\nIf data residency is actually required, then yeah: you can’t do Firebase → Bq → Snowflake US for everyone and call it compliant. The sane pattern is raw + PII stays in-region, and only aggregated/anonymous data can move cross-region (if allowed). Practically that means separate regional stacks (EU BigQuery dataset + EU Snowflake / or whatever) and your Airflow just orchestrates per-region configs. \n\nStart with 2 regions (EU + US), keep schemas identical, and create a “global” layer that’s aggregates only. Biggest footgun is mixing PII across borders and hoping to “fix later”, get the rule written down first, then architect.",

        "body": "Man, I feel your pain. Being the only data person at a startup is a trial by fire. Your founder is right to be concerned about regional compliance, it's a huge headache waiting to happen if you don't address it early. We had a similar situation at my company. We're a SaaS platform, and we started getting customers in the EU and APAC. Suddenly, we had to deal with GDPR, various data residency requirements, and a whole bunch of other fun stuff. Our initial setup was a mess data scattered across different databases and cloud services, no clear understanding of which customer data resided where, and absolutely zero auditability. It was a compliance nightmare. The initial thought was S3 and Iceberg like your mentor mentioned. That adds a ton of complexity in terms of infrastructure and data management. Imagine having to manage multiple S3 buckets and Iceberg catalogs, one for each region? Plus, you'd still need compute instances for processing, potentially Snowflake instances per region as you mentioned. The operational overhead alone would be insane, not to mention the cost. What we ultimately did was implement a virtual data platform that sits on top of our existing infrastructure. It basically created a unified view of all our data, regardless of where it was physically stored. The really cool part was that it automatically discovered relationships between different datasets and identified Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It even flagged data quality issues, like duplicate customer records with slightly different spellings. This would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. Once we had that unified view, we could easily define data policies based on region. So, for example, any data tagged as EU customer data automatically adheres to our GDPR compliance rules. The platform also provides a complete audit trail, so we can easily prove to regulators that we're compliant. And here's the thing that really saved our bacon: we built automated data pipelines using a no-code interface on top of all of this. Before, marketing and sales were constantly bugging the data team to pull reports, create custom dashboards, and integrate data from different sources. It was a huge time sink. Now, they can do most of that themselves with the no-code tools, freeing up the data team to focus on more strategic projects. It sounds like you are running into very similar problems. The company we used has a referral program, so I'm happy to connect you. Full disclosure, I get a little something if they end up helping you out. But honestly, it was such a game-changer for us that I'd recommend them even if I wasn't getting a kickback. They really helped us get our data under control and avoid a major compliance disaster. Happy to make an intro if you think it could be a fit.",

Since you've been working as a DE for a number of years and you're trying to over-employ (?!) I'll assume somewhere at the mid-level.  I'll note that I've primarily worked at startups so mid-level in my mind may have higher requirements or expectations than mid-level at MNCs.\n\nAt the mid level or senior level, I'd expect a DE to get assigned a few tickets at the beginning of a sprint and, during standup, note that they're looking for a new ticket if they're done with their existing work.  I'd also expect them to keep us abreast of any developments in their work so it doesn't fall behind, etc.\n\nFor ad hoc requests, if there does not exist a triage system (for example: if no one picks this up in 15 minutes, it's fair game for anyone and respond to the request) then I would recommend suggesting one.  If the style is \"whoever sees it first\" (like my job right now) then either the DEs must adapt to that style or communicate with one-another to enforce another style (like triage and sprint protectors or something); to ignore ad hoc requests or to require others to triage is putting extra work on the team --- and it seems like you've already been talked to about it, so it's possible that the team doesn't love that you don't pick up ad hoc stuff.  The big word here is _communication_, and it's extremely important to have team-wide communication open.\n\n\"Oh, but my job is so hard, and it's impossible to do XYZ...!\"  Yes, I know, there are a hundred thousand excuses for why any of us don't like our jobs and why it's impossible and why the workload is intolerable.  The reality of the situation is that you either adapt or fail to thrive.\n\n---\n\nAs I finished this, I saw this comment:\n\n> I had mentioned how things worked with me in the past and I thing it is really simple and clear if engineering lead or manager just informs me if they want to pick any issues up. Im thinking proactive would come eventually but not in a forced manner.\n\nI would never want to work with a mid-to-senior+ level DE who has this mindset.  How do you expect being proactive would come _eventually_ if you aren't practicing it at all and making your lead / manager do all the triage _for you_ (which gives them _more work_ to do)?\n\n\nEDIT: Apologies for being so blunt here: I've had a few coworkers in the last year with this mindset who made my job significantly more frustrating than it needed to be.  I want you to succeed in your company but it looks like you reply with a lot of excuses to well-meaning comments so I'm trying this approach.",

Also Data Science is in more demand is like a myth to me, cause, like almost every one is into AI and Data science and the competition’s really tough, and we need more experience. It’s not in demand for the freshers. But it’s a good earning field though. No one was placed from my university( it’s a good uni btw) for data science cause companies aren’t preferring freshers at all. And we need to be more involved and advance in all kinds of subjects like AI, Deep Learning and all. Mere Machine learning is not all useful these days.

Maintaining an change feed table is also useful to recreate older ones which you have deprecated.",

I assume *you* guys care what version is in the wild, same as any need for source control.\n\n  \nDepends what you're using, I guess.  As u/chronic4you  said, if you're using Delta Lake then versioning and metadata is part of it.  I can't comment on Iceberg, we don't use it.  We do use Delta Lake, and in my case, we wouldn't have differently-named versions knocking around in terms of production.  They just get replaced.  But we don't run parallel releases and stuff like that.  For capturing version metadata in Delta Lake, you could use custom commit messages when altering/replacing tables.\n\n  \nThis is kind of something I've been thinking about a bit, too.  The potential for drift between the DDL code that *is* source controlled and the object in the catalog that the DDL defines concerns me.  I don't really have a solution.\n\n\n\nIf you're using simple SQL tables for example, good luck to you.  Times past I've had various permutations of \"x\\_dev\", \"x\\_revision\", \"x\\_update\", and even \"x\\_new\" sitting in the database alongside the proper table.  Good times.",

It's great.\n\nWhere I work I use the MySQL v8 ODBC in a Windows server running MSSQL in prod, and push tables across the network truncate/load in a remote staging tables of a MySQL server (that the Wan IP addresses & ports are fixed and whitelisted for security). Once the load is completed, a stored proc is called remotely to signal the MySQL to process those staging tables.\n\nIt's an annoying process though, I would rather create flat files, push them somewhere, and an event triggered at the remote end (like a datalake container/folder) processes them. I could then make JSON data and send that, also based on events.\n\nIOW, JDBC/ODBC between servers is a \"work-around\" solution, and it's slow. Like 45 mins to send 2 gigs of data.\n\nHTH",

Generating high quality Q&A from 100k word documents with a 70B model is always going to be slow and expensive unless you constrain it hard\n\nWhat usually works in practice is breaking this into stages. First chunk aggressively not just by tokens but by semantic boundaries like sections or topics, otherwise reasoning quality falls off anyway. Then do cheap filtering or summarisation passes first, either with a smaller model or heuristics, to identify which chunks are even worth turning into Q&A. Only send the “interesting” chunks to a large model\n\nFor cost people often mix models like small or mid size models for chunking, summarising, and question generation, then a stronger model only for refining or validating a much smaller subset. Trying to run LLaMA-3 70B end to end on a million long documents will blow your budget no matter the platform\n\nAlso, be realistic about “challenging reasoning” because most synthetic Q&A pipelines degrade if you push for depth at scale. You usually get better results by generating simpler questions at scale, then curating or rewriting a smaller evaluation set manually or semi automatically.",

Are they fine at that point that the roll-up for ID=1 will change to the v6 value?\" -->** We have two sets of these gold fact tables.  One set will always be updated, so it will always get the v=6 record when it comes.  The fact table I was writing about in the post will remain at v=5.  Business reason comes from our Financial Controller.  When the data comes in, we expect that after X days after a reporting period, if there are no upstream data changes, we consider it official.  There is an audit requirement to keep a permanent record of this official data for that time period because this is the data that was reported.  There is a main gold fact table that will always be up to date and that's used for other purposes, but will always be accurate.\n\nWe are implementing 'write controls' on the gold layer partition to limit this, but it won't be perfect. We're also going to store the snapshot of this data that can never be written to outside of the gold layer.\n\n**\"I'd be more concerned that the record can be updated and they don't want you to propogate the data up through the layers.\" -->** Generally, yes.  But we have a pretty unique requirement here.  We are fully propagating to gold but also maintaining a separate snapshot that will keep that snapshot in time for reporting purposes.  (They need to report on what was reported at the time as one requirement even if what was reported used an older version of the same record).,",

When you're on the cutting edge, there is nothing to fall back on. Everything I could copy was just very basic stuff and I only ever really copied it from myself 1000 lines ago. It is only at this point that code really started to click and docs became incredibly useful.

While all of them have this idea that they're using AI \"as a tool\" that is \"no different than a calculator\" or \"no different than using stackoverflow\" it is fundamentally different and they don't have the knowledge to realize it. Even more, they will use AI to solve the basic questions, the ones that are DESIGNED TO BE EASY so that they can learn to work with these technologies, and then complain that the later exercises are too hard.

And each of those generates new questions, and you spend all your time in a frustrating cycle that generates facts but no wisdom until you get discouraged and quit.\n\nImagine trying to learn how to program by reading [the Wikipedia page for Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) and just following all the links to related articles. *\"Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.\"* Holy cow, there's five links to click on just there, **none** of them useful for someone who wants to start learning Python.\n\nThat's from the second section after the intro.

Just spend an hour creating a plan using nothing more than pen and paper. I would even suggest taking your plan to a senior developer and spending ten minutes discussing that plan with them.

        "body": "There's several reasons. The first being that everyone seems to thinks it's easy. It isn't. People dom't realize how mentally taxing it really is. \"How hard can it be? You jsut sit there typing, pushing buttons all day. A monkey could do it.\" ... Next up is the plethora of books that promise \"Zero to Hero\" in what ever language or \"Learn X in 24 hours!\" or what ever learn quick scheme flavor of the month that flooded the market in the late 90's and early 2000's... lots of people bought into that. I'll admit, I flipped through many of them - usually at the library, I tried not to buy them if I could help it - some were decent, but not many. Most were jsut fluff and not worth it. Those were quickly replaced with BootCamps and youTube videos promising the same. Which leads us back to point one... people thinking it's easy, when in fact it isn't. \n\nThe next problem people run into is that they vastly underestimate how big and vast programming really is. How many languages there are. And how complex those languages are. They become so overwhelmed, they don't know where to start. That leads to the inevitable posts of \"How do you experts memorize all this shit?\" ... hint: we don't. If I actually memorized everything I've come across throughout my 40+ years, my brain would melt. So I index stuff. I remember patterns. I memorize the important things, but for the most part, 90% of programming is pattern recognition and realizing \"wait a sec... I've seen this before... where was it....\" and digging up some old code, or googling some key words. Do it enough times, you stop having to do that, and it just becomes second nature. It becomes a habit. I wouldn't say memorized, but it becomes habitual.\n\nThat leads to the third mistake - underestimating the amount of time investment needed. I just ran across a post, I forget which subreddit it was in, but the poster was asking where he could find the best place to learn c the quickest because he has a test next week. What? Excuse me? No other context. So no indication of how much he needs to know, but still, you can't really learn a new language from nothing in a week. Maybe some basics, but still. At this point he's going need a chef because he's cooked. \n\nAnd the last point - using the wrong approach. Youtube videos. Sigh. YTV are fine for shyort quick intro or quick how-tos, but you need (or should) already have an understanding or a background in what you're learning. It shouldn't be a place to learn programming from ground up. That said, I am aware of a FEW youtubers that have produced excellent quality tutorials, they are the exception, the outliers. Most YTV tend to fall more into the \"you need to have some knowledge or background\" in advance before starting. People get frustrated with that. What they really need is a well laid out, \"start here at Point A, progress to Point B, Then C, end at Point Z\" progressive lesson. Something structured. There's a lot of those available online, many for free too. Some are more rigid and structured than others, some a bit more flexible. But the point is they are laid out in a \"before you can run a marathon, you have to learn how to crawl first. But you also need to learn to also stand too before walking.\" \n\n  \nAll of this contribute to people's various frustrations of learning to code/program at various points, and to various degrees. I know I've struggled with some of these pain points over the years too. I'm sure most of us have to some degree. But we're still here. That's because we stuck with it and overcame it somehow. Sometimes it's because we just brute forced it, sometimes it's because after a while it \"just clicked\".",

        "body": "I'm going to go out on a limb and argue this: It's not programming, it's the way school taught you how you should learn. \n\nSchool education is built on spiral patterns and a tonne of scaffolding. Both of these together make the natural position of learners so that it is clear what they should do to solve a given problem, so if they don't know what to do the assumption is that it is your fault. When in reality, learning is complicated, messy, and difficult. \n\nI'll give you an example. In maths, let's say that we are learning how to move variables around an equation. We provide the proof, completed worked examples, worked examples that are partially solved with hints, partially solved worked examples without hints, simple problems that are basically worked examples without hints, and some problems that can be breadcrumbed through multiple worked examples above. The end result is that you probably can go from start to bottom without encountering any trouble. Teachers might make questions that are tricky, compound, or both, but you've probably encountered *everything* before. \n\nThe problem is that you've never learned how to synthesise something new (to you), and that's what you are trying to do here. \n\nI'll give you an example. You might have learned how to make an object. You might have even learned how to assign a variable to an object.  But when you have to make your own simple data structure that stores a bunch of data like an array, but can dynamically add and remove stuff without empty spaces or resizing arrays ... well, all of the steps to smash your face into designing or inventing a linked list are really, fuffing, hard.\n\nSo, what happens is that learners sit there and go: \"Man, I feel that fancy maths is easier than this because I always know what I'm doing,\" because they've hit a problem that could have a dozen or more possible solutions. Instead of simply accepting that they don't know and starting problem-solving, they just feel bad.\n\nI'm also going to extend a programmer's olive branch: I've been programming for twenty years. I'm not bad at it. I've built all sorts of complicated systems in multiple languages. Yet, every single day I'll be coding something, and I'll mutter to myself \"holy fuff I'm stupid\" because I couldn't solve some problem. I also couldn't tell you how long I have smashed my face into problems trying to understand how to build it, only to discover that once I learned the underlying systems, it was actually pretty simple (after I did a lot of work to learn new stuff). \n\nThis is natural. In fact, I often wonder if you don't feel like this regularly, you probably aren't programming. \n\nedit: Lastly, I've been learning how to write novels. Not really to do anything with, but just to tell stories. I'm constantly frustrated at how hard it is to express what is in my brain in words. It has been a year, and I've learned heaps, but I'm still not good at it. Sometimes I forget that just because I am good at programming, networking, writing formal documentation, and teaching, it doesn't mean I will, or even should, automatically be good at other things like creative writing. \n\nSo, be kind to yourself.",

You one day realise 'wait a minute i would like a simple website about my new bakery that im opening up' so you do just that. \n\nYou make multiple games and you realise that manually writing physics is a pain for each game so you decide one common code that handles this physics for you and call it the 'game engine', the name is all fancy but at the end of the day its just a bunch of code doing physics.\n\nYou find it difficult at the moment because you're not starting bottom up, you don't start with a basic necessity in your life that needs to be solved and work from there. You start with knowing zero programming as you mention in your second and blindly just copy paste tutorials which are more complex and use stuff that you do not have the prerequisites for. \n\nYou think you got far because you copy pasted the tutorials but the truth is you have to accept that you know very little about programming and start writing simpler programs until you get the basics right.\n\nCodeforces / Leetcode / <insert similar sites) is meant for two kinds of people - Folks who just enjoy puzzle coding and folks who are into competitive programming / want to pass interviews at companies where leetcode is asked\n\nI don't think you are at the stage where you enjoy programming so much that you should be getting into the hobby of puzzle coding? The problems there are deliberately difficult on purpose because its meant to be competitive and you need to go in having practiced a huge bunch of algorithmic ideas and topics. Its like you wanting to take a leisurely walk to get fit but accidentally ending up signing up for the local extreme parkour club.

The work has become more enjoyable over time - not because of obsession, but because I've gotten better at it and avoided stagnation.\n\nThe key has been continuous variation. Initially, I learned the essentials: variables, conditionals, loops, and basic control flow. When BASIC felt too restrictive, I moved to Pascal and C++, which introduced new challenges like pointers and object-oriented programming. After a brief period with Perl (which I didn't enjoy), I transitioned into web development with PHP and JavaScript. JS proved interesting because of its prototype-based inheritance model - a completely different approach from classical OOP.\n\nThe pattern isn't obsession - it's sustained engagement through novelty. Each language shift brought fresh problems to solve and different paradigms to master. I didn't chase the same dopamine hit of early discovery; instead, I built deeper expertise while regularly introducing new complexity. The \"addiction\" you remember might have been beginner's excitement from rapid skill acquisition. That specific feeling doesn't return, but it's replaced by something more durable: the satisfaction of solving increasingly sophisticated problems with accumulated knowledge. You don't need to recapture obsession - you need new challenges that match your current skill level.",

You've taken two entire years of classes in a CS program. The only thing you've learned is basic C++. You didn't learn any of the other things that are normally taught in the first two years like patterns, web development, databases, intro to security, or general theory. Of course, programs can vary. I haven't seen a single one that's like \"C++ 101 and nothing else lmao.\"\n\nSecondly, you had to pass those classes to be going into your third year. So you passed a C++ class. You certainly had to build basic programs. You were able to follow guidelines, design by the prescribed principles, and received a passing grade. You also took an OOP class and passed it. Now you can't make your own basic programs at home. This does not make sense.\n\nThirdly, you're just figuring this out after 2 years. You paid money to be bullied and ridiculed for 2 years. You didn't go to your counselor or program director to ask if this was normal. You just dealt with the abuse, passed your classes, then immediately forgot what you learned. This is not believable.\n\nOf course, you could be telling the truth. Maybe you have an undiagnosed learning disability. Maybe you ended up at a particularly cruel CS program that only teaches C++.

Part 1 would be a preparation for the exam done at home with whatever tools they want (ai, colleague,...) and they could take any code they would have done  to part 2 (which was the actual part cut from Internet).\n\nThe first part had exercises centered around getting every child from a node in a tree (and going deeper till getting the last).\n\nThe first exercice from the second part was going up the tree till the first node was found and then, the exam was basically going down the tree either from top or from a specific node with the eventual join here and there on another table.\n\nAll that to say : if you understood your code from the first part, second part should have been no problem at all.  \ngoing up a tree being so close to going down but a lot less complicated to implement - It's a sole loop.   \nAnd once done with going down and up, every other exercise could be done with some copy past from your own code\n\nWhen the result was in, most of the student had the first part nailed in tight.  \nBut some would have no idea at all about what was what (one exercice asked to check the depth of the tree and one of the student thought that just taking the node.parentId was the answer. Not to throw shade at the guy (I'm pretty sure he's one of the smarter) but he clearly didn't understand the first part that was, most likely, generated (or copy pasted from a student. But since I checked every file before allowing them to bring them to part 2, I have some idea.)\n\nIn essence, ai didn't write bad code. That's not the point.\n\nThe point is, they used it in a way that didn't make them grow their understanding of what they were doing.\n\nThat's the part I'm really critical when in comes to ai use in learning...

Many tutorials make it really easy to work within a certain paradigm, but the paradigm falls apart as soon as you apply it to a real world example with real world requirements.\n\n> Is it just based on the number of years you work on building software or simply the environment where you can get feedback from top tier engineers?\n\nI've been mostly working on my own, even as a Junior and never had a Senior who would teach me good programming practices. For me it's been mostly about reflecting about my work, about **why** things become difficult and how I could avoid these traps. I started to watch many different talks from software conferences on youtube and while many of those talks are about fixing symptoms of problems instead of identifying problems, there are some that help you understand why you end up having certain problems. \n\nSo you need both, a number of years of experience to reflect on, and actually reflect on the experience. \n\nAlso, in any case: do not listen to people saying things like \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\". They likely have no idea what they are talking about and they don't know what that quote actually refers to. Usually these people think that they lose about 5-15% performance when they follow their programming paradigm and think that's an acceptable price, but they actually lose at least factor 30, in many cases even factor 1000 performance (Yes, things taking 2 seconds when they could be done in 0.002 seconds).\n\nA good way of structuring your code will also give you good performance as a free benefit.",

You know what to do. \n\n\nStudy the things you don't do well. And then find more. There's so much at some point you've got to focus on a domain, then work on the unfun parts of that. Good luck.",

Everyone feels this way at one time or another, even those who doesn't appear so.\n2. Also, instead of giving in, to feelings of being an imposter, actively identify and address the weaknesses you've already identified, and do something about them.\n3. E.g. Note down terms you don't understand and learn/clarify them for yourself.  Ask here. Or research on the internet.  Or start a conversation with Claude or ChatGPT and say \"I am a programmer and I ran across the concept/term of 'dependency injection' \\[for example\\] the other day.  I don't know what this is. Write me a short treatise on this subject including references so I can get up to speed. Include examples and exercises.\" (for example.)\n4. You also observed you do nothing outside of work.  Well, that's a hint/tell: Start doing something outside of work then!  (\"Doctor it hurts when I do \\*this\\*\"  Doctor: \"Well stop doing it then!.\" You get my drift.)\n5. For example, start answering questions on a programming site, or try to.  Sometimes you'd have to do some research in order to answer. From doing this, you will learn.\n6. Try sites like: [exercism.com](http://exercism.com), [codingame.com](http://codingame.com), [codewars.com](http://codewars.com), etc\n7. One final point: AI is no magic bullet.  The presence of AI is going to increase the demand for competent engineers that can also be AI whisperers.  You can get ahead of the curve by incorporating and learning and developing the art and science of making effective use of AI in your current job context.  As time goes on, I expect this skill might be more important that your naked skills, important though they remain too. (You cannot effectively use AI in anger if you cannot properly judge and evaluate an AI's output. So your human intelligence + experience is essential for the effective use of AI.)\n\nThe software industry is wide and deep, give yourself time.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  Read Peter Norvig [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).  I have been in industry for more than 25 years now and not a day goes by that I don't learn something.

I worked in C and C++ professionally until 2013, when I switched to Java with a spring in my step and a song in my heart. So when I say I disagree with Mr Spolsky, it’s not because I’m defensive about not knowing C or pointers.\n\nI guess if you want to contribute to the Linux kernel, it’s got to be C and you need to understand pointers like you understand your native language. Ditto drivers. But 99.9% of programmers aren’t getting that deep in the weeds with things. Even in 2005, they weren’t. People can’t come out of undergrad knowing everything. You’ve got to pick what’s important to get started.\n\nAlso C is hard in a lot of stupid, picky ways that have nothing to do with intelligence. Mostly it’s not portable the way a lot of modern languages are. Programs that compile and run fine in one environment won’t in another because the libraries are in a different directory, or you’re using different compilers, or different versions of the compiler, or different levels of optimization (it shouldn’t matter, but I’ve seen cases where it does.) Or all kinds of stupid crap. \n\nThis was already a serious obstacle to collaboration and knowledge-sharing in 2005. It’s gotten way worse as more knowledge is shared online. It’s why Java was such a hit—the intermediate bytecode step meant that it works the same everywhere.

As you say, you need to know the fundamentals of programming, but you'll acquire them during development. If you don't start at some point, you'll feel like you're in an endless learning loop: you learn the basics but never apply them to the real world. Obviously, depending on the complexity of the website, you'll need more or less knowledge, and you have to be sure that the resources and skills you possess are sufficient to reach the goal. But this part relies primarily on research and patience.\n\n\nBasically, what I would do if I wanted to prepare to create a project is to create a sketch. It could be a diagram, a text document, or both. I write a brief outline of the idea I have in mind, then a list of the workflow, resources, and basic knowledge I need.\n\n\nOnce I have this, I start working on gathering resources and coding. The first thing I do in a web application is the design. I establish the typography, icons, brand colors, and that sort of thing. Functionality is what I do after I have all of that in place.\n\n\nKeep in mind that you can never know for sure what your project needs at the beginning. You should try to prepare to start as soon as possible; don't waste time or energy trying to have everything under control from the start, because it's pointless. You'll learn to program by programming.\n\n\nEstablish a work plan by setting short- and medium-term goals and adjust them as you go. If something blocks you, move on to something else, and at some point, you'll find what you need to unblock what you were creating.",

What I really lacked was some sort of project to put all that together and the knowledge to break that down into the necessary steps. After all sorts of tutorials on YouTube and Udemy that didn't really have any good projects to walk through, I found a great tutorial from Tim Corey that built an actual app. It was an app that you would use to track a 3v3 basketball tournament for your office. What clicked the most about his approach was going through the planning phase of what the application needed to do. It needs to register players, register teams, and assign players to teams. It needs to keep track of who paid the $10 entry fee for the current tournament, it needs to track the bracket and match ups for the current tournament, etc. \n\nThe code was done in such a way that it would be platform agnostic, meaning you could build it as a desktop app that saved the data to both a text file and a database or it could run as a web app on your phone and connect to a cloud database or something like that. \n\nThat's the kind of tutorial I needed, and it sounds like you need more hands on learning with the planning part. I knew the syntax for all the loops, how to create functions and call them later, etc., but I never knew how to sit down with a blank project in the text editor and start building something. That tutorial did a great job showing how to go from an idea of what you want to make to breaking that idea up into smaller steps. It also did a good job of identifying what you needed for the MVP (minimally viable product--the bare minimum features to be a functioning app) vs what were \"nice to haves\" that could be added in future phases. \n\nI ended up abandoning the whole C# thing when I got a job as a data analyst several years ago. I've gotten by with just SQL so far, but I'm getting ready to start a peer mentorship with one of the folks on my team to learn python and predictive modeling now that I have a project that would benefit from it.

If you go beyond that the code will become a lot harder to read and maintain.\n\n> where responsibilities should realistically live\n\nCode that is executed together should be closely together. See [Locality of Behaviour](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)\n\n> how to keep things readable without over-engineering\n\nYou need to set the encapsulation boundaries the right way. If your compile time hierarchy of encapsulation matches the domain model, you will have a hard time managing all the different interactions and variations. An example for that would be an inheritance hierarchy where each class implements its own behaviour (Vehicle -> Car -> Truck / Bus; Vehicle -> Train -> ...; Vehicle -> Bycicle -> ElektroBike; Vehicle -> ??? -> MotorBike; ...)\n\nInstead, start with separating your data from your logic and keep your data in simple arrays. E.g. a List of Orders, a List of Products, a List of Deliveries, A List of Customer Account. This can be an exact match to how you design your database btw.. Also, have only 1 ID across **all** types of Entities. This will allow you to combine the Components at Runtime easily.\n\nThen write functions (not methods) that operate on those lists. One function may check whether your are going to be out of stock for any product and create a new order for your supplier. Another function may go over the recent orders by your customers and create an aggregated report of what has been ordered and how much. And so on.\n\nThink about your logic as systems or laws of nature. Similar to how gravity affects the trajectory of a ball thrown up, instead of the ball gravitating itself back to earth.\n\nYou will see that a lot of stuff that is challenging right now will become trivial.\n\nGood luck!",

When you’re starting on a project, you need code that you can bring other people in on. You need to be able to talk about it, debug it, and write tests for it.\n\nBuild time into your long-term plans for refactoring.

I actually chose to build an app that manages patient data, which I will hopefully use at work, and like I said i got overwhelmed when I realized the number of gaps I needed to fill, but what you said, \"figure out what you need to learn to get closer to that goal\" is reasonable now that I think about it i just need to fill in the specific gaps for now and advance from there. Again, thank you, that was helpful :)",

Especially if you transition: Python - Python+PyGame - Godot + GDScript you're going in the right direction.\n\nOne thing to understand: it's not the *programming language* that makes a good programmer. It's what they can do with the language, how they can analyze and break down problems and create step-by-step solutions for the individual sub-problems that then can be implemented in a programming language, that makes a good programmer.\n\nThe people of old didn't have too many choices (I was there - learnt programming in the first half of the 1980s). So, BASIC was the common entry. C, PASCAL, and Assembly usually were the successor languages.",

        "body": "I grew up back then and frankly unless you where insanely rich, the only thing available where computers running on Z80 or 6502 chips.   Great chips but all you easily had for programming was the built in BASIC.    By the time I got to college, almost 10 years later the college was teaching with Modula 2 at the introductory level.  Note the phrase \"teaching with\", if you are learning to program the language is really a tool to learn concepts.   By the time one would finish the full program a student would have been exposed to at least 3 mandatory languages.\n\nPeople often ask why?   The answer is pretty simple out in the real world you may end up working with a number of languages.   The problem with BASIC is there is very little real world use of BASIC anymore, even gaming has gone to Lua for scripting.\n\nNow what do I suggest for beginners, that is easy C or C++ for the equivalent of the first 3-4 semesters of a Computer Science program.   Why low level languages?    This is again simple, you can be forced to building data structures at a low level.   Personally I See languages like Python as damaging to the development of good programmers as it hands user modern concepts and unfortunately most programs designed around Python don't dive into how things work.   The other reason is that properly done, by mandating the command line for the first few programs (2 semester equivalents) you also learn how compilers and linkers work, at the user level anyways.   The command line is important because there are Python programmers out there that can't even create a directory at the command line.   So I'm not a big fan of people learning programming with Python.\n\nHowever I really believe that most programmers need to learn Python at some point but properly educated that will be a piece of cake.   The reality is Python has been relative simple for a scripting language.   At some point a programmer will also have to learn the languages suitable for the platform at hand.   The problem is platform languages are a moving target, you need a good understanding of the basics of computer science to adapt to what is new.   Languages like RUST or Swift are literally works in progress, it is a continuous learning challenge to remain effective with these languages.",

The JVM starts out in a \"bytecode interpreter\" mode, and only switches to JIT compilation when it detects that a certain piece of code is heavily used. This warmup process actually *improves* startup time, because it can start running code right away instead of waiting for everything to be compiled to machine code.",

        "body": "What you are describing is commonly called *tutorial hell*, the frustrating cycle of trying different introductory tutorials but never feeling like you actually learn *how to create your own programs from scratch.*\n\nAt this point, people usually give you two pieces of bad advice: \"Work on your own projects\" and \"Contribute to open source projects\". Well, not *bad* but not without caveats.\n\nWorking on your own project is definitely a good idea, but beginners aren't in a place to know what sized project to take on. Especially because these days beginners might think, \"I want to make an AI\" or \"I want to make my own Instagram\" or \"I want to make Minecraft\" are good projects. If you pick a project that's too large, you'll spend two months on it, not finish, and then be left even more frustrated.\n\nThe solution is to **pick small projects**. You might not know what counts as \"small\", so I wrote [a free book with 81 small Python programs](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/). They all use text for output, including small ASCII art when needed. This may seem old-school, but the benefit is that every language has `print()` so you can use these projects even if you're not using Python, and there's no graphics libraries to install and configure on your computer.\n\nMy definition of \"small\" is roughly \"under a couple hundred lines of code.\"\n\nIf you work on your own projects, make a list of *negative* features: things your project *won't* do. It's too easy to let \"it would be cool if...\" expand your scope into something you'll never finish. (Every programmer who started making a game by first making their own 3D graphics library is guilty of this. It's a great for a learning experience, sure, but my money is that the game will never be released.)\n\nThere's no one moment where everything \"clicks\" but rather a series of small clicks. Finishing a dozen tiny projects is far more fulfilling and keeps you going than one half-finished giant project.\n\n\"Contribute to open source projects\" is not good advice; you do need to have some level of experience making complete software applications to meaningfully contribute, or find someone in the project to mentor you. Open source projects would love to mentor someone who will contribute in the future, but it's hard to trust that the person they invest time into will actually stick around.\n\nI tell people to write their own blog posts or tutorials of what they've learned, because that process spotlights any gaps in your understanding. (Writing programming books certainly does that for me.) Post it somewhere online under a pseudonym where it will have zero readers, but *do* post it: this forces you to finish it. I have a hundred files in my blog drafts folder and they aren't doing s*** for me.\n\nI'm going to get off Reddit and go write up this advice into a blog post now.",

Learn Flutter basics (2-3 weeks)\n2. Build a simple app with local storage (todo app, notes app)\n3. Add Firebase for auth + database\n4. **Publish it** \\- even if it's simple\n5.

C++23 IS THE latest standard - C++26 will go to final vote to ratify in March this year.\n\nC++11 is old and was incomplete even then. They missed shit like `std::make_unique` - which had to be added in C++14, the `chrono` didn't finish until C++17, which is when we also got `filesystem` and `variant`, and finally type punning was defined. We didn't get library support for type punning until C++20, which is when we also got the `ranges` library - a god damn revolution in implementing algorithms. C++23 gives us `#embeded` to bring us to parity with C, type-safe formatter strings, UTF-8 support, and more container types. Starting with C++11 also leaves almost all of `constexpr` on the table.\n\n1) Install the latest compiler package from your vendor of choice.\n\n2) Always direct it to use the latest ISO-strict standard it supports. The compiler will default to an earlier and non-standard tolerant mode. When C++26 is ratified, it'll be a following software update that suddenly you'll get the new features.\n\n3) Keep learning C++. We all learn variables, functions, loops, conditions, pointers, user defined types... You're still going to slog through all the basics. There's no point in limiting yourself to a specific standard in this journey. You'll arrive to the latest standard when you're ready for it and it's ready for you.\n\n4) It takes time for compiler vendors to catch up. Microsoft with MSVC is still scrambling to implement C++23 features. All the vendors are struggling with modules. Don't be surprised when stuff is missing. It's not actually a big deal. But keeping up with software updates means you get to capitalize on their latest additions day-of. C++26 also comes with some changes that are worth being there.\n\n5) Most teaching materials are going to teach you the same basics. For the most part, the rules of C++ have never changed since before the C++98 standard... Except when it does. And that's the thing about fixing on a specific standard - there are very standard version specific rules you don't want to get bogged down on. Template deduction, initializers, `auto`, constexpr, move semantics... A lot of that gets nuanced changes over versions, and there's always breaking changes between spec versions. I think it was C++14 that finally said you can't specialize standard library template functions, and fuck, I had a code base predicated on that.\n\nUltimately, the differences between the specs MOSTLY won't really matter until you get through the introductory materials. C++26 does change that a little bit - because it's going to require catching the use of uninitialized variables, which was formerly undefined behavior. That's going to send ripples all the way back to the beginning of learning C++.",

The important thing is to check that the written documentation or learning material is written for at least C++14 or preferably higher. Learning C++ is a long journey where the really advanced stuff takes years to even start with. The later language versions modify and add progressively more advanced features. The language is old and has lots of traps and strange quirks. Every solution has at least 3 different ways to write it and each C++ version makes them easier (usually) to write. So teaching from a modern source is quite important.",

If you are learning on your own your goals should be to obtain the same level of understanding.\n\nHere is the thing, you don't know what languages will be in demand by the time you are good enough in any one language to even apply for a job.   If you learn well you should be able to adapt to what ever language a project requires.\n\nFrankly I don't see C++ as a good language to develop apps in as it has been eclipsed by more modern languages.   What it is though is a very good language to teach the principles of programming.   So is it a decent place to start, yes with one qualification, the program you follow should have at its goal teaching you from the ground up.    \n\nAt some point while going through a decent program, you should start to invest time in learning another language and hopefully seeing how the technology transfers from one language to another.   If you have the goal of a specific platform like MacOS then start to learn Swift.   \n\nAt some point you should also pick up Python, however if you do it right Python will be a no brainer.   In fact you will have a better understanding of how Python works if you have followed a CS program and actually did some data structure development, memory management and the like in C++.

It places restrictions on the object which can be used to ensure you don't do things you shouldn't with it, and can be used to refer to automatically allocated objects.\n\nYou can pass a unique_ptr, the implication being that ownership is handed to the callee. Or const unique_ptr, meaning the callee can use and modify the object, but not move ownership to something else.\n\nYou can pass by shared_ptr, ownership is shared and lifetime managed by the pointer. I rarely used these. There are also weak_ptrs but I've not yet had to use them.\n\nSometimes it's perfectly valid to just pass a copy too.\n\nI try to avoid using raw pointers in c++ unless forced to, e.g. using a posix or third party C API, and if given one, I'll try and wrap them in a unique_ptr with custom deleter where and as soon as possible, so I don't forget to clean them up.

Why don’t you stop and go learn about something you feel good about? Do you like programming? Do you like the idea of programming? I’m not judging here — just looking for the other side of your story.\n\n2. A lot of programming involves not knowing the answer. Very often, things don’t work the way you think they should and you have to figure out why. You have to be very open to the idea that you might be wrong, because accepting that is often the key to finding the answer you’re looking for. You have to be okay with feeling frustrated for long periods, and you have to be persistent. Being good at programming is less a matter of knowing all the things and more a matter of being good at figuring out what you don’t know on an hourly basis. If those kinds of feelings make you uncomfortable or unhappy, programming may infeed not be a great career choice.\n\n3. The thing that hooks a lot of people is making stuff work. Seeing your program work exactly the way you want it to feels like an amazing combination of magic and certainty: it’s inspiring even though you know exactly how and why it works. It’s probably the same feeling someone gets when they fire up an engine for the first time after months of rebuilding work. If you’ve never experienced that, you might want to hang in there until you’ve built a few things to see whether you enjoy that part — it might make the rest worthwhile.",

Now, I'm trying to apply to other companies, but I'm scared of the coding assessments. Back in 2025, whenever I applied elsewhere, I would receive LeetCode-style assessments before even getting an interview. I lost hope immediately and didn’t continue with my applications.\n\nRight now, I’m using freeCodeCamp, but I struggled with one of the CSS labs, so I decided to take a break. I also started The Odin Project this new year, and I’m trying to learn it slowly.\n\nSince last week, I’ve been studying DSA because it feels like the only way to get hired in this job market. I try to code on my own first, but I get stuck—especially when there are nested loops. My brain just can’t comprehend the logic. I understand bubble sort and selection sort, but I can’t code them without looking at examples. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future; maybe if I keep learning, I’ll get better. The Odin Project says I need to practice a growth mindset, but studying DSA is so hard that it makes me wonder if I chose the wrong degree.\n\nI didn't choose my degree, my mother wanted me to take it, and I don't really know what I wanted to take before, so I just went with it.\n\nBack in college, I almost failed college algebra and my DSA subject, but I still managed to graduate on time. For algebra, the only reason I struggled was because I didn’t have eyeglasses. By the time I got them, it was already too late to catch up since I couldn’t see what the professor was teaching. For DSA, I didn’t really understand coding and syntax at first. I only started learning properly in my second year.\n\nMaybe I just got lucky before, because my first two jobs only required math assessments and quiz-style tests. If they had required coding assessments, I’m sure I would have failed and not gotten the job.\n\nI wish you the best OP, please know that you are not struggling alone.",

There is no other way to stand out.\n\nLike, put yourself into the recruiter/employer/interviewer's shoes. Why should he hire YOU over a guy who has a degree to show? A person with a degree can prove that he has knowledge and experience in things on a certain level. Otherwise he would not pass the tests, would not pass the exams, and would not get his thesis defended. Yes, one can graduate with the lowest passing grades and one can graduate cum laude, and there is a difference between a degree holder and a degree holder, but even these lowest passing grades usually show that the person at least is introduced to a number of topics relevant to the field and has passed these courses.\n\nAlso, during your degree studies you will get connections from your course mates, from your professors, perhaps from the computer club you are joining, etc. Everybody of them can later on help you with finding a job. I got recommended to my first workplace by my course mate. Which connections you'll be using when studying on your own?\n\nYes, universities/colleges differ. I have seen people telling how they learnt nothing really during their studies. I have read how in India the studies are mostly theoretical and people are unable to produce a code that compiles. But where I live, the studies were very practice heavy. We actually learnt stuff relevant for the field. We built thesis projects that were taken into an actual use by people. So, universities differ.\n\nBut, assuming you will get lucky with your university then that is any times better than trying to study on your own. When you are studying on your own your picks on what to study and what not to study, these picks are subjective not objective. You do not know what you do not know. You learn what interests you and you leave what seems boring. Yet in a university professors teach you what you have to know. Even when you think it is irrelevant, too difficult, or boring.\n\nYes, a degree alone will not get you hired. Your knowledge, skills, experience you gained during your studies, your projects you built, that gets you hired. But that is what usually comes when doing degree studies.\n\nGoing back to what I told about hiring then having a degree will make you have much better chances in being called to the interview. Without a degree the HR person can just skip your application. And, from your post it is clear you do not have a clear idea about which projects to build. That does not compete with people who build hobby projects and that using these when it's done.\n\nSo, if possible, go for a degree.",

You have made a good choice (generally, but see my next paragraph) on naming things, which many beginners suck at. \n\nMy main criticism would be the name of the function `generate_board()` - I don't think that's an accurate description of what it does. The board is already \"generated\" and present in the `board` array. This function just *displays* it, so I think a name such as `display_board()` would be more accurate.\n\nThere are many areas for improvement once you learn more and gain more experience, though. \n\nFor example, your `check_winner()` function could be split up to make it shorter and more readable, e.g. create a function `bool is_tie()` which encapsulates the tie determination and returns true or false appropriately, then call that from `check_winner()`.\n\nYou could try separating the game logic from the input/output. By doing that you make it easier to change how the game looks (such as making a GUI version, where the logic is the same, but the display mechanism  is entirely different). \n\nFor example instead of `check_winner()` printing the result, it could return a value that indicates the state of the game.

Avoid global variables\n\nRight now board, playing, size\\_of\\_board are all global. This works but doesn't scale. Pass them as parameters instead:\n\nvoid check\\_winner(std::string board\\[\\], bool& playing);\n\n2. Use char instead of std::string for single characters\n\nstd::string for \"x\" and \"o\" is overkill:\n\nconst char X = 'x';\n\nconst char O = 'o';\n\nconst char SPACE = ' ';\n\nchar board\\[9\\] = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};\n\nMore memory efficient and faster comparisons.\n\n3. Use std::array instead of C-style array\n\n\\#include <array>\n\nstd::array<char, 9> board = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};\n\nThen you get board.size() instead of the sizeof trick.\n\n4. Tie detection bug\n\nYour tie check breaks early if it finds a SPACE, but that's wrong - game isn't a tie if there are empty spaces. Should be:\n\nbool is\\_full = true;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {\n\nif (board\\[i\\] == SPACE) {\n\nis\\_full = false;\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif (is\\_full) {\n\n// it's a tie\n\n}\n\n\n\n5. Use ternary for turn switching\n\ncurrent\\_turn = (current\\_turn == X) ? O : X;\n\n6. Consider an enum for players\n\nenum class Player { X, O, None };\n\nPrevents invalid states and makes code clearer.\n\n7. Magic numbers\n\n3 and 9 appear everywhere. Define them:\n\nconstexpr int BOARD\\_SIZE = 9;\n\nconstexpr int ROW\\_SIZE = 3;\n\nOverall solid for a beginner. The logic is correct (except tie check), code is readable, and you handled input edge cases. Next steps would be wrapping this in a class and adding a simple AI opponent.\n\nKeep building!",

What you can do is to have functions that don't touch IO at all, and just take parameters and return values. For example, `generate_board` returns a board object (or sets a global variable for now, if you haven't learnt classes yet). `set_cell(x, y, state)` sets the value in the cell, `check_winner` returns the winner. Then you'll have a method called `render_board` that renders the board on to the screen. \n\nSeparating your program into various parts helps in testing (later), and also you'll be able to easily change parts of your program without breaking the other. For example, you can use the same tic tac toe logic, but instead use a GUI window.",

That's your answer.\n2. **Ask \"what might change?\"** If yes → avoid Singleton, use the second approach If no → Singleton is simpler, go with it\n   * Will you ever have 2 keyboards? (multiplayer local co-op?)\n   * Will you need to mock input for testing/replays?\n   * Will input devices be added/removed at runtime?\n3. **Set a time limit** I give myself 30 minutes to decide. After that, I pick one and move on. Bad choice? I'll refactor later. Most \"wrong\" decisions cost way less time than endless deliberation.\n\n**My take on your specific case:**\n\nSingleton for input is fine for a hobby engine. Big engines avoid it for testability and flexibility, but you're not building Unreal. The simpler mental model of `Keyboard::Get()` is worth it.\n\n**The real skill isn't picking the \"best\" design - it's getting comfortable refactoring when requirements change.**\n\nShip something.

Gonna study a bit and write some garbage code? Use git. Gonna write your million dollars app tonight? Use git. Hell, are you Uni and taking classes? Use Git. This may shock the non devs incthe room, but git doesnt just work for code, nodes you write in a text file can be habdled the same way. New devs hate git, but eventually you'll have used it so much if yiu use it all the time that that feeling would be like an artist wqtching new artists hate using a pencile. \n\nDont take any shortcuts because its annoying, itll become second nature if you use it every single day, touch typing and keeping your fingers on the home row was probably annoying when you learned how to type, now you dont even think about it, and people who type with their pointer fingers look crazy to you simply because you have built the muscle memory needed to use a skill that makes you better at typing without even trying. Git isnt gonna get in your way at all once its second nature, and if you dont use it youre just hurting yourself. But just like how you can learn to type by playing games online, you can passively get better at git by using it when you decide to learn Rust or build a game or write a novel. Dont think of it as some big deal that you need to treat as its own lesson plan and practice over and over again, think of it as salt you add to every meal from now on",

Last night I had an interesting dinner conversation with a friend who I consider a genius in tech and business, and he believes the cost of software dev will approach zero as current advances in AI are continually eclipsed by improved models.  Another friend tells me the latest Claude  code is unbelievably good.  Having AI as your learning partner is going to remove so many friction points.  Spend some time learning how to get the most from AI and you’ll be running faster than if you first try to learn one syntax and formal language.  \n\nExample:  my dinner conversation friend likes to make boardgames for himself and friends.  He recently made it in his todo list to a really interesting one where people cooperatively roll dice to try to beat a timer, with a difficulty scaling and hero exhaustion mechanic so the longer some heroes play the more tired they get, causing late rounds of the game to be more challenging.  He needed to build some simulation software to play thousands of rounds of the game in order to derive the right numbers to use as timer values for easy, intermediate, and hard modes.  He started by using AI chatbots to “write by prompt” a python program (he chose python for familiarity) \n\nHe had written about 30 txt files describing the game,!the dice, the heroes, the colors, the map, the paths of forking decisions to move from point to point on the map, the win conditions and on and on.  They were his personal notes, and he hadn’t shown them to any LLMs yet.  \n\nThen he opened the folder in Cursor.  The AI agent read all the files, and a whole list of notes to self and future todo items written in his personal notes.  Then it proceeded to upgrade and expand his simulation script into a ful featured and useful tool.  He has used it to simulate around 200,000 rounds of the game, and even had AI wrote an evaluative controller which would make adjustments to the difficulty levels until simulated games reach a desired success/fail percentage (ie. hard mode should fail 65% of the time on level 1, scaling to 80% fail rate for level 7)\n\nHe opened his laptop and we told AI to rewrite the entire thing in Rust, which completed flawlessly in about two minutes.  Thousands of lines of python translated to rust trivially.   Then we thought of a stumper: build it in Lisp…  it succeeded in another minute or two. \n\nGet conversational with AI … if you want to learn a formal language in depth,  study the very well written code it outputs.",

What helps me is to think about one thing at a time. Thinking about \"mindset\" is too vague. I keep things practical and tangible. Here's how I think through projects:\n\n# My Project Planning Process\n\n1. **I figure out who the project is for.** Who's going to use it? Even if it's just me.\n2. **I figure out what the user wants or needs to do.** I write statements like \"As a User, I can do \\_\\_\\_ so that \\_\\_\\_.\" Basically I'm figuring out what the user wants to do and why.\n3. **From there I usually start getting ideas for pages and what will be on the page.** I write them down. I draw some rough sketches. I mean actually write with pen and paper. You don't have to but I find that stepping away from screens for this preliminary planning helps me think better.\n4. **I like to take those sketches and bring them to full mockups.** I don't know that it's necessary, but it helps me to not have to think about styling and layout when I'm writing code. You could also use AI tools to make these mockups.\n5. **Then I get to building the project.** I try to follow TDD (Test Driven Development) and scaffold things out. I try to procrastinate the implementation details as much as possible. That way I can answer those questions about how to structure the project and everything one at a time",

A lot of beginners think you are supposed to plan the whole thing upfront, but most projects get figured out by building a tiny slice first, then iterating.\n\nTry this: write down the one thing your app must do end to end, even if it is ugly. Build that as a “walking skeleton” with hardcoded data and the simplest logic you can. Once it works, replace one hardcoded piece at a time with the real component, like real input, real storage, real validation. For structure, start with folders by feature or by page, not by “future architecture.” Your first goal is something that runs, not something that is perfect.",

You had fast access and slow access memory.\n\nOne example was drum memory. At the most basic, there is a [write][erase][read] head over a spinning magnetic drum track. You had to wait for your data to sweep under the read head to get it - however long that took. This was a destructive process, because then the head passed under a magnet. This data was either written a moment later at the read head, or a write was scheduled to intercede the passive loop.\n\nThey then put a smaller, faster access loop over just a few degrees of the track, and had a larger, slower loop for the rest of the track, and this would take a couple sets of heads to pull off.\n\nBut this tech got faster still, and this is the one you can mimic - they used coils of wire, and sent modulated signals down it. Again with the feedback loop - if you wanted a piece of data, you had to wait for it to come around. If you wanted to persist that data, you had to immediately write it back on the wire. If you wanted to change it, you had to intercede the passive loop. You could add more storage with a longer wire, you could get lower latency with a shorter wire.\n\nSo that's what you can do - send data to an echo server, one on the furthest computer on the opposite, most remote destination to you on Earth or as ambitious as the DSN, and the data is stored ostensibly in the transmission itself. Want some data? You'll have to wait for that data to get back to you. Want to persist it? You'll have to send it back out. Want to change it? You get your chance as it's coming back to you and it's time to send again.\n\nCall it a time sequence data cache.\n\n---\n\nIf that doesn't quite fit the bill, then google \"fountain codes\", and implement your own bit-torrent-like protocol.",

        "body": "> My question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?\n\nYes. Basically, what you should do is weigh the importance of having applications that can:\n\n1. Horizontally scale, and\n2. Tolerate/self-heal from outages \n\n...much more strongly then you normally would for personal projects.\n\nUsually, we ignore reliability for personal projects. But if you're trying to practice distributed systems, it makes sense to make it your main focus, even if there isn't really a need for it.\n\n> Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.\n\nI think it'll be possible for you to pick up a solid basic understanding of these tools -- enough for you to get an understanding of their strengths/weaknesses, and when to use them.\n\nPicking up a truly in-depth understanding may be harder. Usually, that deeper intuition comes only after either dedicated study or after spending an extended amount of time using the tool in production, seeing first-hand the limitations and quirks of that tool.\n\n> If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n1. Deliberately give your app very small amounts of cpu/mem, and/or deliberately add in sleep statements and such into your app to forcibly handicap your app so it can handle only 3 QPS or something. This means even modest amounts of traffic will cause a naive app to start becoming overloaded, which in turn gives you multiple opportunities to practice building support for horizontally scaling.\n2. Look into setting up automatic horizontal autoscaling of some sort, to automate downsizing your application when you're not currently stress-testing it.\n3. Alternatively, if your app is inherently expensive to run, just completely tear it down every time you're finished for the day. To reduce tedium, look into using terraform or something to automate the setup and teardown.\n4. Eventually, consider using something like Kubernetes to run everything. This will obviously take a lot more effort -- but doing it does mean you can test locally by setting up Kubernetes on your local machine, using VMs to simulate running on a fleet of machines. \n\nAside from simulating traffic, also be sure to do chaos testing of some sort, where you randomly kill your machines to simulate unexpected hardware failures and/or temporarily network blackhole them to confirm your application as a whole can tolerate it, not lose user data, not enter an inconsistent state, etc.\n\n> Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.\n\nYeah -- I'd say it's overkill in general. In production, state is the enemy: the moment something is stateful, you have to worry about keeping it backed up/replicated in some way so you can tolerate unexpected hardware/network failure, which in turn often places constraints on how you can scale, etc...\n\nThis is why DDIA spends so much time talking about databases and such -- figuring out how to manage state is by far the hardest part of designing and maintaining a distributed system.\n\nSo for a prod system, it behooves us to go out of our way to design our architecture to keep as many of our components stateless as possible. (Stateless == they may maintain a local cache, but it'd be perfectly fine and safe to abruptly nuke a replica at any time.)\n\nBut for a toy project, I think your instinct is correct. Now is the best time to play around with different technologies, even when they're not needed. This may end up causing your overall architecture to be more complex then needed, but I think that's perfectly acceptable if your goal is to become comfortable with different cloud/distributed-systems building blocks.",

Do you have a sort of mental checklist that a project needs to qualify for before doing so, or is it more just a second nature kind of thing?\n\n\nI know you may never need a microservice as it might introduce more complexity than it's worth, for example, but I'm wondering when you are like \"yeah okay, we need a microservice here\".\n\n\nExample from my experience of when to decouple was, and I know this super small fry, I added a lambda to run some puppeteer code to generate PDFs on AWS as we ran into some strange IIS worker processor quirk where the chrome process was executed twice when running this on Node/Nest. Spent about 2 days trying to figure it out until I went the AWS option instead. This came with the benefit of not having a heavy dependency like puppeteer in our bundle, although it does come with the cost of vendor lock-in to a feature, which I'm okay with in this case since there's a daily S3 cleanup and the function is used 10 times a day most, so cost is non existent.\n\n\nAlso thanks again, this really has been invaluable feedback/input, I wish I could upvote you more than once!",

If you are using arrows or lines or pseudo-syntax (that does not compile), it is up to you. The point of pseudocode is to convey the idea of the process/method. I will give an example:\n\n1) if [boy.name](http://boy.name) starts with Ü -> the boy is most likely from Europe. if [boy.name](http://boy.name) starts with Ф -> the boy is most likely from Greek or Russia.\n\nYou can look at it and instantly understand that you are checking the name of a boy and based on how the letter looks like, you are assuming where he is from. Because different countries use different alphabets and different letters. I can claim that what I wrote are two \"if\" sentences. Perhaps part of a \"switch\" statement. But no way what I wrote compiles or runs in any programming language. It is a pseudocode. Understandable to a human but not runnable by a machine.\n\n2)public static String getFamilyName(some person) {\n\nname = getNameFromDatabase(some person)\n\nfamilyName = splitTheName(name)\n\nreturn familyName\n\n}\n\nIt is more code-looking pseudocode. It even uses a little bit Java syntax. But will it compile? No. Will it work like this? No. Will it tell what happens? Absolutely.\n\nYou can see that a method gets some person as an input. Then you retrieve his name from a database. And then you split the name and return the last part of it. The flow is understandable. How you are accessing the database? Not important. Will it work with names like Alfonso Maria de Borbon y Borbon? No. It assumes the person to have only first and last name. But will it give the idea of the process? Definitely.\n\nBy an idea a pseudocode is something that even a non-IT person can read and understand. Free from language-specific and syntax-specific things.\n\nBut why the first option is answer to the question you asked, that got answered by others.",

Once I realized that, writing recursive functions became easier for me.\n\nThat seems obvious now, but the professor who first taught recursion to me didn't hammer that concept into me, probably because he thought it was already intuitive and obvious.  (It wasn't to me.)\n\nAnd writing the rest of the recursive function (the non-base case part) takes a *leap of faith*:  You have to believe that the recursive function you call from inside your function will return what you want.  Once you decide what you want for it to return, you have to work with that output.  And after that, you will have to make sure the internals of your recursive function returns exactly what you want it to return when you called it.  (Sorry is this is very abstract, but recursion is a very abstract concept.)\n\nAnd you may have noticed that reading already-written code is often more difficult to read and understand than writing new code (even if you're the one who wrote the code in the first place!).  This is especially true with recursive code, so when you're calling the function recursively, add comments to explain that you're doing so, preferably with some explanation as to what the recursive call is doing, in contrast to the current call.",

Very easy.\n\nBut how would you do it recursively?\n\nYou could break down the process into two steps\n\n1. If there's only one number, then we return that number. This is the base case, and where the recursion returns\n2. otherwise, we return the first number plus the sum of the remaining subset of numbers\n\nBased on this definition, we can write each of the following inputs as such\n\n* sum(\\[1,2,3,4,5\\]) = 1 + sum(\\[2,3,4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[2,3,4,5\\]) = 2 + sum(\\[3,4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[3,4,5\\]) = 3 + sum(\\[4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[4,5\\]) = 4 + sum(\\[5\\])\n* sum(\\[5\\]) = 5\n\nNow if you look at sum(\\[4,5\\]) and you sub in the value of sum(\\[5\\]) you will see that it is equal to 4 + 5 = 9\n\nAnd then for sum(\\[3,4,5\\]) you can sub in the value of sum(\\[4,5\\]) with 9, which gives 3 + 9 = 12\n\nThe key to solving recursion is to identify how you can repeat the algorithm on a subset of the input so that when you solve a smaller problem, that solution can be used to solve the larger problem.\n\nThe same applies to node-based structures. Every tree has a root and a bunch of children attached to that root. children also has its own sub-tree with the child as the root, and a bunch of children.\n\nSo you can create a recursive algorithm where you pick a root and recurse on the children, until you reach a leaf node which is a tree with no children.",

        "body": "Recursion is a challenge for almost everyone. It's not made easier by the fact that there are very few examples that are both (a) intuitive and (b) more easily done with recursion than iteration. This means you either get examples you don't understand or examples where you don't see the point of recursion.\n\nLet's think about computing the height of a tree. The height of a tree is the longest distance from the root to a leaf node (we'll assume that a tree with just one node is height 1 and a tree that isn't there at all has height 0).\n\nSuppose you want to compute the height of a tree. Imagine I tell you that the height of the left branch is 7 and the height of the right branch is 4 (how? I'm magic. I just know these things). Can you tell me what the height of the whole tree is? If you think about the definition, the longest path to a leaf node is going to involve going either left or right from the root. If you go left (that's one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf *from that point* is 7 (because I told you). If you go right (also one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf is 4 (again, I told you). So the longest path from the root is `1 + max(7, 4)` which is 8.\n\nThis solution, unfortunately, involves a magic step, where you ask me what the height of the left and right subtrees are and you use those results to determine the height of the overall tree. Wouldn't it be great if you had a function that would tell you the height of a tree so that you could use it to determine the height of another tree?\n\nYou do. It's this function we are talking about. We just change this:\n\n    func height(tree)\n      return 1 + max(ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.left),\n                     ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.right))\n\nto\n\n    func height(tree)\n      return 1 + max(height(tree.left),\n                     height(tree.right))\n\n\nThere is one thing missing from this, which every recursive function needs: a way to stop. There has to be some state (we call it the \"base case\") that you can work out immediately, without doing any other steps. This should be the smallest possible example. How about the empty tree? Not a tree with just one node, but a tree has no nodes at all. We'll say it has height 0.\n\n    func height(tree)\n      if empty(tree) return 0\n      return 1 + max(height(tree.left),\n                     height(tree.right))",

They’re loyal at their jobs, keep their heads down, and just want to do deep, meaningful technical work. On the flip side, a lot of the fake people I’ve seen spend more time crafting LinkedIn posts than actually improving their skills or doing real engineering work, and they all seem to have some hidden agenda.\n\nI literally saw a dude interview for big tech just so he could create content and attract more juniors to pay for his coaching side hustle.

While I was employed, I was not making Bay Area level money to survive long term. \n\nThe biggest downside was that I had to pay all relocation costs myself. And obviously a huge risk if a job never came to fruition. \n\nThe neutral, moving here didn't suddenly bring in a bunch more opportunities. It wasn't like I had a bunch of recruiters suddenly knocking on my doors once I put Bay Area in my location. I was still cold applying and everything like that. \n\nThe biggest upside came once I passed the interview and moved on to team matching. At the time, I was reading a bunch of discussion boards where people were sitting in team matching for upwards of 8 months. Some people even needing to reapply because their time expired before getting a match. I had my first call with a hiring manager 3 days after being told I passed the interview. And the two days in between were the weekend. I had a job offer in hand by the end of that day. \n\nI have zero doubts in my mind they pulled my resume first, because I was already in the area and can start working more quickly for them. Truly, I also think being an American citizen helped in that too, because it again meant quicker to writing code for them. They didn't need to do any Visa sponsorship or anything like that.",

I'd only focus on roles that are in your old tech stack, that are in office, and require 0-3 years of experience.\n\nI'd also highly recommend the OMSCS at Georgia tech. It costs 8k and has a great course catalog. It'll give you a hard reset and gives you an opportunity to apply to internships alongside applying to full-time roles. \n\nAs for your resume, you need to look at Jake's resume, it's a standardized template. Have gemini distill your experience and format it to fit in Jake's resume. I feel like gemini has the best creative and visual model so it'd be the best for this use case. There are other standardized resume templates, I'm not positive Jake's resume is still the most recommended so do your research. I remember his resume template being referenced all the time a few years ago.\n\nUse a mock interview platform to find where your weaknesses are (idk what they are, I think pramp is one?). Pay for it and utilize it as much as necessary. \n\nOnce you fine-tune your ability to conduct interviews, grind leetcode for 3-4 months, 30 to 60 mins a day with one day off a week. Use neetcode.io. No excuses. Stretch it to 6 months if you want to target highly paid roles at tech companies. \n\nTake whatever salary you can get, even if it's 60k it doesn't matter. You need to get back into the market, rebuild your marketability. After a year or two you can focus on more desirable roles. \n\nSeriously you can do this, I don't care how bad the market is 2.5 years is unacceptable. You're unfocused and undisciplined. No offense. Be hungry and tenacious. \n\nGood luck man, I believe in you.",

Around 2023, the job market was still pretty demanding to fill software engineering roles. You really need do everything in your power to stand out nowadays. I’m sure you’re applying to jobs frequently like many others and I’m sorry to take the tough love approach, but you need to try harder.\n\nSome advice I can share however is looking for production support(L2 or L3) roles. These roles have a lower barrier of entry and you work adjacent to software engineers to resolve production issues. Not the most exciting job, but can lead to something better with time by having some dialogue with managers about your skillset if openings become available internally.\n\nAlso as some others have said, your resume could definitely use some refactoring.

He is acting guilty because he knows he is in the wrong.\n\n>Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back.\n\nIf they ever call you to work for them again, make sure you just join as a contractor as a side gig and upcharge them way more than what you were paid before. They view you as a number and disposable and don't ever think otherwise.",

She starts Jan 26.\n\nTBH, the search was MUCH easier than expected given what we see in this sub. Maybe 25 applications. 5 initial interviews. Three second interviews. One technical --> Offer. One of the other orgs also reached out since she accepted the offer. This was an easier job search than her last one post-layoff in 2023, much harder than the one in 2020 when everything was going crazy, and easier than her new grad search in 2017-2018, though at the time she was looking at a pretty narrow set of cities where I could continue my unrelated career, too.\n\nSome relevant factoids:\n\n* She was employed (albeit at a pathetic pay rate after a 2023 layoff) beforehand.\n* 4.5yoe as a SWE with 3yoe as an SDET or QA prior.\n* MS in CS from a so-so state school. Unrelated BS.\n* After a handful of general applications that didn't produce even a \"no,\" she hyper-focused on job postings involving GIS experience as either a \"must\" or \"nice\" to have. She had this experience first from a previous career as a wildlife tech and more recently has 3yoe doing something similar as a SWE in her current soon-to-end job.\n* The pay in her new job is by no means silicon valley, but she's very much interested in quality of life and stability vs the brass ring. She wants the Lenovo and not the Macbook, so to speak.\n* She will be building flood prediction and mitigation software for a huge civil engineering company. Her current role is for an environmental consulting company building a land use planning and ecological footprint reduction app for corporate clients.\n* 80% increase in monetary compensation, drastically better benefits, fully remote.",

Some people say that having a conversation about the weather or your favorite soda or how Metroid Prime 4 is kind of cheeks is superficial, but what those people don't get is that it's all part of the social dance where you're feeling people out, implicitly saying you're open to friendship, sharing a laugh, etc. Like it or not, you are correct that avoiding this can make somebody come off as a bit cold. *What* is being said is relatively unimportant, assuming you don't say anything offensive (so table politics, religion, social issues, etc).\n\nI struggled socially a bit in my late teens, I just worried too much about what other people would think of me if I said something wrong or stupid.

Startups are about much more, including marketing, sales, networking, and LUCK.\n\nSecond: The market is currently really bad for any and all software related jobs, in fact it's worse for developers and designers, I feel like. You're not the only one with no replies, even if you are senior level.\n\nThird: Isn't engineering what you love? Are you as good and passionate about anything else than this? If your financial situation isn't super tight, you should really pour your heart and soul into your next startup, whether it's something you've tried before or something brand new. It might take months, maybe years, but if this is what you want to do, you have to approach it as something you love and not something you're nervous it will fail. If your financial situation is tight, then you make ends meet with jobs perhaps unrelated to software, but you keep working on a product you have in mind on the side. If coding, programming and software development is what makes you happy, you should do it regardless of income potential.\n\nYou seem confused about one important thing: you meld successful career/income with engineering. I think you should shift your mindset - if development is truly what you enjoy, do it regardless of success and income. Nowadays, those who succeed as engineers are both talented and lucky. So the most important thing to do is to continue developing software while networking, applying for jobs and/or trying a new startup. I know the latter might not seem very appealing to you, but it's the only way to sustain income while continuing to do what you love.",

        "body": "First off, I'm really sorry to hear about your role being eliminated—that's a tough spot after 11 years, especially with the added pressure of relocation. It sounds like you're weighing two solid but very different paths, and that's a stressful decision.\n\nGiven your situation, here are a few thoughts that might help:\n\n1. \\*\\*Assess the internal role beyond the travel.\\*\\* A tech lead manager position with direct reports and higher comp is a significant growth opportunity. If the exciting industry aligns with your long-term goals, the travel might be a worthwhile trade-off. However, consider the practical impact on your life in Florida—would it be sustainable? Sometimes a role that accelerates your career can open doors faster than a job search.\n\n2. \\*\\*If you lean toward taking the severance and job hunting,\\*\\* don't let the current market scare you into a rushed decision. With six months of salary plus savings, you have a generous runway. The key is to use that time strategically. Since you're not targeting FAANG, you can focus on companies where Leetcode isn't the sole gatekeeper.\n\n3. \\*\\*Your resume will be crucial.\\*\\* With your SRE experience, you have a strong foundation in reliability, automation, and likely cross-functional collaboration. Instead of a generic resume, tailor it to highlight pain points you've solved—think outages you prevented, cost savings from automation, or improvements in deployment frequency. Companies hire for problems they need solved, not just a list of skills.\n\n4. \\*\\*Research companies deeply.\\*\\* Look beyond job boards. Find companies in industries you're passionate about, then dig into their engineering blogs, Glassdoor reviews, or recent news. What challenges are they facing? Maybe they're scaling infrastructure or dealing with legacy system reliability. Your SRE background could directly address those pains.\n\n5. \\*\\*Transferable skills are your friend.\\*\\* Even if you move into a management role internally or externally, skills like incident management, capacity planning, and mentoring junior engineers are highly valuable. Frame your experience around outcomes—for example, \"Reduced system downtime by X%\" or \"Led post-mortems that improved team response time.\"\n\nIf you do decide to job hunt, I built a tool called Resonant that helps job seekers research company pain points and match them to their resume skills—it's designed for situations exactly like this, where standing out requires more than just keywords. You can check it out at resonant.iamdelrio.com. It's free and might help you",

I assume that as soon as you knock the rust off in 3-6 months, you will leave for a Senior role with Senior pay. It’s too risky to hire you.\n​The Better Strategy:\nInstead of lowering your title, lower the company tier temporarily.\n​Avoid Big Tech/Startups for now. Their interview loops are brutal on 'rusty' candidates.\n​Target 'Boring' Industries. Look for Mid/Senior Data Engineer roles at insurance firms, hospitals, regional banks, or manufacturing companies.\n​The interview bar is often lower (less LeetCode, more practical SQL/Python).\n​The pace is slower, allowing you to re-learn on the job.\n​Rust ≠ Junior. You still know how data pipelines work; you just forgot the syntax. That comes back in 2 weeks. Do not reset your career clock because of a temporary confidence dip.",

Some fields others here have mentioned include nursing, teaching, business (MBA), law, medicine, or some form of engineering. Some of these are harder than CS, but offer stronger career outlooks and better job security.

And don't expect AI to \"create new tech jobs\" either, they're not going to be junior jobs.\n\nI'm sorry, I know I'm sounding pretty negative right now, but I don't want to give anyone a false sense of hope or security.

If you're reasonable, learn quickly and ask for feedback from more experienced developers you can grow quickly on this field. Throughout my career I saw plenty of frontend/backend devs outright refuse any deviation from their core responsibilities and always felt like they are shutting the door to widening their scope and potentially grow.",

My advice would be to dip you toes in backend. Be full stack. If you're getting blocked by backend bs, build some solutions to those problems. If they're good, you become the product owner/go to and then you really can't get replaced. I have a friend who had similar issues working for a large real estate company and left. within a couple months of leaving, he was offered nearly triple his TC to work as a contactor and maintain the systems he built. I'm trying to do something at my current company; large healthcare servicer, so we're probably dealing with a lot of the same issues you are.\n\nIf that's not your thing, build stuff you're interested in. Doesn't matter what it is or if it's related to your current role at all. Just build something interesting to you so you're motivated to dive deep and and really learn the low level nitty gritty. When that gets boring, try building something else. If it doesn't get boring, maybe you can build something really high quality and useful, and now you run your own company, definitely not replaceable.",

Fwiw, a common pattern at 24 YOE is heavy coding with a lighter system design screen to gauge how you reason and communicate. I’d split time roughly 70 coding, 30 design. For coding, rotate through a focused set like Grind75, but keep a redo log of anything you miss and practice explaining Big O out loud. I’ll pull a few prompts from the IQB interview question bank, then do timed mocks with Beyz coding assistant to keep answers tight. For design, sketch small features end to end and talk tradeoffs clearly so your thinking shows even if the scope is modest.",

Telling them you really want to do SWE signals that you will be unhappy in the role they are hiring for.\n​The Role itself (Red Flag): You mentioned 'hardware troubleshooting.' Be very careful here. True SRE is software engineering applied to infrastructure (coding in Python/Go, writing Terraform, managing scale). It is a great foundation for becoming a Backend Engineer or System Architect later.\n​The Risk: If the role is actually just IT Support/SysAdmin disguised with an SRE title (which the 'hardware' part suggests), it will be hard to pivot back to SWE later because you won't be pushing code.\n​Strategy: Apply for the SRE role as is. In the interview, ask: 'What percentage of my time will be spent writing code vs. manual troubleshooting?' If the coding is <30%, keep looking.",

The point about big companies having low response rates due to volume and internal changes is spot-on—it’s easy to take that personally when it’s often not about you.\n\nOne thing I’d add for anyone feeling stuck: when you’re applying to startups or smaller companies, try to research their specific pain points. Look at their recent blog posts, product updates, or even customer reviews. If you can subtly align your resume bullets with challenges they’re likely facing (e.g., “improved scalability” for a growing startup, “reduced latency” for a real-time app), it makes your application feel less generic and more like a solution.\n\nThat shift from “here’s what I did” to “here’s how I can solve your problem” is what helped me stand out when I was job searching. In fact, I built a tool called Resonant (resonant.iamdelrio.com) to help with exactly that—it analyzes company signals and suggests which of your skills to highlight. But even without a tool, just spending 10 minutes per company to tailor your resume’s top bullet points can dramatically boost your response rate.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience—it’s a solid reminder that persistence and a targeted approach pay off.",

It’s just a great experience imo.\n\nThere’s no guarantee that you’ll learn anything new at a different job or be given any autonomy to work on fun stuff that actually interests you. \n\nNot saying don’t do it but I’d really think about it.

Instead of telling them you're 5/10 with azure skills and google your way through it, reframe it as having proficiency and experience with azure (give examples), noting that you're skilled at googling and quickly learning anything unfamiliar you come across. My coworker got hired after having an incredibly embellished resume and overselling every single one of his skills. It made him seem like he was the most qualified candidate even though he probably wasn't and he got the job. Now, 2 years later, he's still doing great at the company. I understand wanting to be completely candid, but unfortunately, interviewers aren't looking for transparency, they are looking for the most qualified and competent candidate. You are probably losing these job opportunities to people like him.\n\nBest of luck!",

Eventually, you're gonna need to interview, and a lot of the good jobs out there will have this as part of their interview steps. Might as well start learning.   \nIn addition to it preparing you for interviews, I have the maybe unpopular opinion that studying these things can make you a better developer. It builds muscle memory in your language of choice, and forces you to think about solving problems in certain ways.",

There are a lot of ways to do this besides LLMs. For example removing code review would deliver software faster but it’s also just stupid. \n\nLLMs are not the first time I’ve seen someone try to push speed as the primary metric (hi management) but I’m guessing it will end just as badly. I don’t think LLMs will go away, you certainly can’t ban them, but we’re going to need to renegotiate our relationship with them.\n\nI’m hearing about developers putting out slop right now, and it’s getting caught, but there is no movement from management to PIP or fire those people who keep slopping. They feel like they’re discouraging AI use if they punish someone for creating garbage with LLMs. That’s going to have to change.",

Agentic coding proved to be a suitable tool for this type of task. It has its downsides and no one can stop you from reviewing and refactoring the code it generated - at least, it's what I always do.",

In my experience, even the most clamped-down and rigorous code base requires some amount of effort to ramp up and extend. A 400k salary does well to incentivize source code spelunking whether it's stacked with bricks or spaghetti\n\n2. You are not your code. You are not your company. Code is an orchestrator and software are tools that automate or pave some new process to enable business. The end goal is not maintainability, it's money. I think you should focus on writing the minimally maintainable code to generate the most amount of business impact - potentially this could lead to extremely disciplined design before you type a single line, but it could also just as well lead to hacking something together -> ship it -> collect your merit -> get a comp bump and switch context.",

It's similar to Dev Associate. As I understand, Dev Associate is harder (deeper, vs wider). I couldn't tell you if SAA is impressive on it's own, or if both are worth it. Many people do SAA then do Dev. I felt that just getting Dev, the harder, more important one, done on it's own was enough. SAA is still tough too I imagine (2 vs 3 months basically?). \n\nI can only speak to my own experience and say I went from 0 interviews to weekly with the Dev Associate. Did I get more interviews because I had Dev over SAA? I don't know.\n\nSAA and Dev Associate are both good. Which, or both, I couldn't tell you 100%, but I went with Dev because I've heard it's more relevant to a web dev/full stack/SWE role.\n\nCouldn't speak on IT but I know IT is hard to break into too these days.\n\nI had very basic AWS experience before hand, basically deploying a couple websites on EC2 and some user permissions for a company. The stuff these certs go over are solutions for very large scale applications, thing basic simple websites don't usually need. It helped but wasn't huge.\n\nI'd say just pass the test to get the cert, you won't fully understand the material yet, but the first step of learning is just get the basic knowledge down.
