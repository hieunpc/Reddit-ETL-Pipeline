I ask chatGPT to write scripts, read logs, research solutions, etc. THIS is the new iteration of software engineering and by extension data engineering. If you’re not using AI at your job, you’re falling behind.  \n  \nHaving said that, I’m still up to date on technology, I still read documentation, and I review every single line of code chatGPT writes without exception. If I don’t understand what it’s doing, I research it. If I’m skeptical on what the script does, it does not make it into prod. No exceptions.  \n  \nA word of caution, we had someone on our team write a script with AI and run it without reviewing. They deleted a bunch of data from the database without knowing. We had back ups, but there was data that went missing. When asked about the obviously ChatGPT written script they could not explain what it did or why.",

About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.\n\nIts not always about \"saving\" time for me but rather its about doing things the \"better\" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the future\n\nI know what I've said above is not related to \"AI on top of broken data stack\", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.\n\nBy fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to \"slap AI on top of our data\" as in:\n\n\\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\\_xyz contain data from source\\_abc? how often does table\\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\n\n\\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like \"what was our prediction accuracy last week?\" \"how did model A perform vs model B last year?\"\n\nI think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the \"self-service\" utopia we've always dreamt about.",

        "body": "The meta for llms changes every week, so don't get two freaked out about it.  \n\nBusiness context is usually captured with either RAG or graphs.  RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data.  Basically look at how Neo4j works.  They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have.  That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like.  Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant.  \n\nYou can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that.  But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else.  AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen).  Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create \"tools\" for the LLM to use based on the context.  Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call.  \n\nIt's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the \"best\" approach changes almost weekly.  It's still very early in AI development so I guess I would say don't freak out about learning one thing as it will likely change, but definitely do get into working with AI is future work will depending on it.  It's not going away.",

We’ve seen many thousands of companies use Postgres and ClickHouse to build their data stacks, and the adoption is growing very fast. The idea behind this Postgres offering is to bring them even closer together and make that integration as effortless as possible for developers. :)\n\nWith regard to integration, the vision behind our CDC capabilities is to offer a much more native experience, something you can’t get from other services and addresses problems around standard CDC. Additionally, the `pg_clickhouse` extension will be native to this service and maintained by ClickHouse, and will act as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical workloads. We plan to invest heavily in this area to make application migration as seamless as possible.\n\nApart from all of this, the Postgres we are offering is NVMe-backed, which is very fast and comes enterprise-grade guarantees. We are building this in partnership with a world-class Postgres team at Ubicloud who were ex-Citus, Heroku, Microsoft Postgres.\n\nThis launch was a primer, stay tuned for a more very soon! :)",

As long as everything was simple with a single region and incoming product, and a few people had been working on it and had direct experience with how everything was done, then the 'quirks' were kept to a minimum and everyone knew them.\n\nThen as new team members got onboarded things got harder. People had to be taught all the quirks of which role to use when creating a glue job vs an interactive notebook, they had to be shown the magic command boilerplate to get glue catalog and iceberg tables working, they needed to know the bucket that was set up for output for Athena queries. With more people working not everyone could be across everyone else's work, so people weren't familiar with how various custom jobs and scripts had been made, and because each job was its own mini vertical stack there was a lot of repeated components in infrastructure, policies, ci/cd scripts.\n\nAs new use cases came on that didn't fit the mould new ways of doing things had to be added. Kinesis and firehose come in, airflow orchestration gets tasked for some small transforms while others go to glue jobs. Someone wants a warehouse/database to query, so redshift is added. Exports to third party processors are needed as are imports, so more buckets, more permissions. API ingestions are needed so in come lambda functions, with each one coded and deployed differently because nobody can see what everyone else is doing.\n\nThen finally users need access to data, and the team just isn't set up for it. There is no central catalog with everything, it is spread out across half a dozen services, and the only way to know where anything is or goes is to dig through the code. That 'worked' for the DE team, since they were the ones doing the digging, but there was no effective way to give access to everything. Every request for data took days or weeks to finalise, and often required more pipelines to move it to where it could be accessed.\n\nWe're moving to Databricks soon. It gives a unified UI for DE and other teams to access the data, you get sql endpoints, you can run basic compute on single-node 'clusters', it has orchestration built in, it gives you a somewhat easier way to manage permissions, and it works for both running your own compute and giving data access. Instead of a mishmash of technologies that don't make a unified platform, you get a consistent experience.\n\nYou'll just have to pay extra since it is doing a good portion of that unification work for you.\n\nIf you had a hundred DE type roles it might be more cost effective to stick with base aws services, and have a dedicated team focused on dx, standards, and productivity, to cut out the managed compute cost. But if you're just 3 people, you're probably not there.",

I’m part of a company where we chose to build our Lakehouse 5 years ago on AWS.\nWe have an amazing solution with around 10 platform engineers, 50 engineers working on the platform and 20k end users.\n\nWe recently did a full analysis of total cost (cloud costs and payroll) of using Databricks vs our Platform and we are definitely much much more cost effective.\n\nThat said, it required great leadership and product vision and it works because we’re a big company with specific needs that were not answered by Databricks at the time - for example when Iceberg was first out we went all in meanwhile Databricks kept saying it wasn’t their priority and pushed delta lake.\n\nNow I would say Databricks is so easy to get into and has improved so much over the years… if we had to start now I think Databricks would be the go to",

I have experience with spark, orchestration, A.I. Agents, etc. \n\nDatabricks can do everything you listed. It is not the best in each category. Airflow is a superior orchestration tool than Databricks Workflows, for example. However Databricks provides tools in all categories that are more than good enough.\n\nI find myself surprised how easy most things are. I usually  do a POC with a G.U.I. first.  Then reimplement with code, checking against the G.U.I. POC as I go. There is a G.U I. for Databricks Workflows and A.I. Agents. In general, everything seems to be as easy as possible, with good default settings. \n\nThe advantage of having good enough tools in broad categories that all integrate well with each other makes life easy.\n\nMeasured against AWS, Databricks is more expensive. Your company can either pay more for compute ( go with Databricks) or pay more to expand the team with specialized people (AWS). Expensive compute is cheaper than expensive specialists.\n\nPlus Databricks is moving to everything runs on serverless. In practice, I would say 80% to 90% of prod code runs on serverless. I see this improving with time.\n\nClosing remark. Databricks is a thought leader. They have made many open source software that everything else is compared to. (Spark, MLflow, DeltaLake,...). Databricks competitors run Databricks open source software. Agent bricks hosts 20+ LLMs out of the box. I don't know what the future holds, but I bet Databricks drives it.",

We used all of the technologies you listed except data tone and only a bit of lake formation. Then we wanted to have a business facing data catalogue with lineage and there wasn’t much available in AWS. As of 2026 I would argue that is still the case. For data catalogue we used OpenMetadata. For hosting we used EKS btw.\n\nLong story short it takes a lot of development effort to put all of these technologies together and to maintain it. It works well once done and it is scalable. \n\nBut if I would do it again I would use Databricks in 2026. Gets you started quickly. Downside will be cost as you have to pay for DBUs on top off AWS cost.  Arguably you would need less data developers which could pay for the additional cost.  I know this is a bit off a sticking point nobody wants to think about. But if you plan to use your devs to build the AWS solution then you already covered the dev cost. If you go with Databricks you may need less data devs, assuming that some part of their time is currently used for infrastructure work. If the new AWS architecture would need more devs than the argument would be that Databricks would allow you to operate with the current number of devs.\n\nIf you decide to go with databricks use an open source table format like iceberg to reduce vendor locking. Also bear in mind, databricks can support all of the requirements you listed, but is not best in class for all of them like BI, orchestration, gen ai etc. the core is around spark and related services.",

You need to be able to help the business architect solutions to data problems. Furthermore if you are not knowledgeable on architecture design you probably won’t land a senior role at all. Those who stand out the most to me are knowledgeable on modern tools but more specifically the value they provide. Those who standout the least cannot explain how to design a data solution. I think it’s a highly rewarding field with opportunity for growth but you have to be ready to work hard, especially when it comes to continuous learning.",

The trick is not trying to learn “everything.” You don’t need mastery of every tool you need a solid mental model of how data flows end to end. Once that clicks, new tech becomes variations on the same ideas, not brand new worlds. Your PM/BA background is actually a plus. Understanding requirements, tradeoffs, and why pipelines exist is something a lot of younger DEs struggle with. Focus on building a couple of boring, real pipelines and ignore the noise. Feeling overwhelmed doesn’t mean you’re behind it usually means you’re learning the right things",

Then either data factory or airflow or other orchestration tools, data warehousing ie oltp vs olap concepts in the cloud and ultimately some basic networking so that you can for example make data factory actually be able to read from a VM hosted SQL Server. so tl;dr - SQL -> Python -> Cloud, but obviously for Python/Cloud, learn only the concepts that are relevant to data analytics/engineering.

Best-practice in terms of this kind of thing is to know the trade-offs), implement observability from day 1 (that can be writing logs and checking them daily in cloudwatch at the start).\n\nNote that MANY of your trade-offs and architectural decisions will depend on what kind of requirements are required downstream. In fact, the very first thing you need to map is who are the data consumers and what are their needs - mind you that more often than not the end-users have very vague requirements (it is often a big part of the job to translate vague business requirements into technical choices - also, often what they want is different than what they need). If applicable to your case: also talk to upstream stakeholders (feks, in my company, the data is generated by services written by developers, so I have to sync with them to understand what is doable or not in terms of data serving/latency)\n\nEDIT: also, if you are not super familiar with AWS, dont underestimate how much time you'll spend implementing things there :D\n\n(I'm in a similar position, where I wear the architect, tech lead and engineer hat at the same time - and oh, Iam also brazilian ;) )",

LLMs may seem reasonable, especially for a one time match, but I guess I would want to see it in action compared to other approaches.

They isolate DAGs per batch, manage lineage, and prevent silent exits due to metadata growth. If you stick with batch loops, you need a mechanism to restart the Spark context periodically and checkpoint and clear lineage aggressively, but that is more fragile. Tools like dataflint can also help flag where your plan or metadata is growing across iterations so you can catch it before it silently exits. Structured streaming gives predictable long running behavior and scales better on YARN for production workloads.",

Unless it's highly critical and you are allowed to maintain a live copy of production in test environment, the test data is inevitably less complete. The smart and efficient solution is to have a proper analysis of the different cases existing in production, and use them to build your test data, ideally by the upstream team that is responsible for this data. Consider that it cannot be complete, try to make it good enough. Don't think you can predict all future use cases, the solution for those is proper error logging, monitoring and alerting, so you can react fast when they will happen.\n\n> In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing.\n\nTeams should be free to have their team-only development environment were they can break everything, but there should be another test environment that is relatively stable to allow downstream usage of data like you need. I think you need to talk about having such a stable test environment with the engineering management, in my experience it was mostly called \"staging\". It's not supposed to be a copy of \"production\", and it's better if it is not for information security, but it should be a good simulation of production cases to test the code edge cases (as I described above).\n\nIn our case, our dev environment is our local laptops. We have hand crafted test files crafted to represent the different cases, and we are able to run full flows locally with either our tools running locally or mocking. Local allows to iterate much faster than if you have to deploy and rely on non-local tools. The unit tests and full flow tests are automated to be able to run in CICD or on request on PRs if they are too slow for systematic run. \n\nThen there is the company's staging environment that is fed by upstream teams with simulated data representative of production, and the same code and tools as production. There we can run our code in the same tool environment as production. \n\n> Upstream tables aren’t versioned\n\nWhat does this mean? If the code that creates/alter these tables is not versioned, that's pretty bad. The process needs to go through a proper CICD. Or do you mean there's no number you can track to know if the table schema changed?\n\n> schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?\n\nUpstream table changes need to be communicated. This is not negotiable for platform stability and needs to be taken to engineering management. They need to establish a proper channel, for example: ticket (with PR links), documentation page, announcement in dedicated channel, regular meetings to plan changes and exceptional meetings for emergencies. A team should only be allowed to deploy such change once the communication process has been respected and the reception by downstream teams has been confirmed.  \nThis also means the upstream team is responsible for updating staging so it matches the change and you can properly test it in staging.",

There are some rare scenarios where it doesn't happen all the time - like the upstream system *never* changes, or is run by the exact same team doing the ETL work.  But in almost all other cases it's a complete mess.\n\nPlus there's other bad cases like where the upstream system adds a new column, you're using a solution that provides some schema evolution capabilities like Fivetran, so your ETL process just silently ingests the new column - but that new column isn't actually used by anything - and it now has 50% of your costs allocated to it from a different column everyone is using.\n\n> What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?\n\nData contracts & publishing domain objects:\n\n   * Upstream system publishes a \"domain object\" any time any field within the domain changes.  A domain is a higher-level abstraction like user, customer, invoice, supplier, etc.  And the domain object is typically a denormalized collection of related info.\n   * The domain object could be published to a messaging system, which could get ingested directly, or simply redirect messages into a file on say s3.  Or maybe the upstream system just writes all pending domain objects to s3 every 5-15 minutes.\n   * And the domain object is locked down with a data contract.  This contract is kept in version control, and both the source & target teams can use it to validate all data being sent & received.  I prefer jsonschema for this, and use it to identify columns, their types, as well as info like min/max values, min/max string length, null rules, enumerated values, regex formats, etc, etc, etc.",

Are you querying a subset of staging and/or production data (possibly sanitized) to cover edge cases, or is it a fully manufactured dev dataset/table that you run queries against?\n\nIt's a small file included in the Git repo, something like 3 to 10 records. We use either JSON (easy to edit manually) or AVRO (Kafka source), depending on the source of the flow we are testing. If the test flow's source is a table, the source file is turned into the table format we use first by the test logic.  \nUsually, data comes from staging since we already have representative but fake data there that is safe to keep in Git. It is potentially manually modified to add some cases that we need to test.\n\n> Also, just to confirm my understanding around environments: staging is what you always reference in test (and possibly dev, depending on your answer above), correct? \n\n1. When a team member submits a PR, it is required for them to prove that their change works in staging, typically sharing a successful flow run with the different run modes (normal scheduled run, backfill, or whatever specific parameter). That's really the minimum that should be expected for any change affecting flows.  \n2. For any function that does not rely on integration with external tools, we require the very classic unit tests. Those take a few ms each, so they are always triggered in our CI tool whenever a commit is pushed.\n3. A bit more recently, we have been adding \"local flow tests\" that can be run locally on our laptop and in the CI tool. This means we can validate that the flow logic works locally, and we are able to use a local debugger, which is pretty amazing for ETL work. We can also run it on request with a comment during the PR review; the results are written in the commit status on Github. We don't run those automatically at every commit push because they have quite some overhead to set up a local flow environment (especially Spark's overhead); they take something like 30 to 90 s for each flow. This was a lot of work to create, but it is now extremely valuable. \n\n\n> If that’s the case, then in theory our “test” environment should fail, and alert us, whenever there’s a schema change that isn’t properly communicated. Is that the right way to think about it?\n\nFor the tests to fail due to a schema change, the test data needs to have changed accordingly. For local tests, your team controls the test data, so it cannot have changed if you didn't know.  \n\nWhere it should fail is during the staging run, if the upstream team has correctly updated the data they are responsible for in staging and actually ran their change in staging. So, it still relies on the upstream team doing its job properly, which requires engineering management to enforce it if they are not doing it by themselves.\n\nIf it failed in staging, you can check how the data changed and modify your local test data to cover the new situation. But, you shouldn't have to find it by yourself like this; the chances to miss the changes even if it is in staging are still too high, for example, if it only affects a small subset of records.\n\nSo again, the most important solution is that there should be a mandatory communication channel for them to announce the change and collect the confirmation of the downstream teams. At minimum, something like a Slack message where downstream teams are pinged. With this information you can at minimum make sure your staging run goes through the change. If you have a local test, you can then directly modify your local test data and comfortably check on your laptop with a debugger what the consequence is for your flow. \n\nIdeally, there is the data contract system mentioned by others. Every schema is versioned in Git; it serves as the reference for every dependent project, and any change needs to be approved by the downstream teams in the PR. But I think very few companies have this level of maturity; even in my current company, where it is already very high considering the quality of testing I have described above, it is only partially implemented.\n\n> - Upstream Staging -> Our Dev/Test\n> - Upstream Prod -> Our Prod\n\nThe staging environment is supposed to be shared by all teams that have dependencies, so the integration of the different projects can be tested just like in production, except the data is a simulation. The only difference in terms of code is that staging may have the newer version of the code that is being tested. So it should be like this:\n\n- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects\n- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects\n\nLocal testing is a separate environment that is defined in your Git repositories, so you wouldn't expect the upstream team to modify it, just like you wouldn't expect them to change the code you own. \n\n- Local test environment (only your teams): your test data (possibly based on staging upstream data) -> Your project -> your data\n- Staging environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects\n- Production environment (all teams): Upstream projects -> upstream data -> Your project -> your data -> downstream projects\n\n\nYour company could have another shared testing environment before staging. I can imagine a \"testing\" environment being for unstable testing; expect things to break regularly because teams will test early versions, and \"staging\" for stable testing; things should not break too much so you can test in production-like conditions.  \nIn our case, our local/staging/production is covering what we need, so I wouldn't see the point of having a 4th environment.",

Your Python service pulls data from the carpark API and publishes events as they arrive. From there, you usually want some kind of streaming or messaging layer to decouple ingestion from processing, so bursts or failures don’t break everything. Next comes processing, where you clean the data, handle duplicates or late events, and compute whatever metrics you care about (occupancy, availability trends, etc.). This can be done in near-real-time or small micro-batches depending on complexity. The processed output then lands in a store that’s optimized for querying or visualization, which your frontend reads from. The key ideas to focus on early are idempotency, schema consistency, and what “real time” actually means for your use case (seconds vs minutes). Start simple, get something end to end working, then layer in streaming frameworks, windowing, and fault tolerance once you understand the flow",

Instead of raw CSVs or SQL dumps, have your script convert the data into Parquet files; this format is compressed, schema-enforced, and significantly faster for ML frameworks to load than standard text files. Once the script validates and saves the file to your central storage, it should write a record to a \"Manifest\" table in your SQL server. This record includes the file path, a unique version ID, a checksum to prevent corruption, and the results of your quality tests. The ML team then simply queries this SQL table to find the URI of the latest \"Verified\" dataset, eliminating the need for email threads and manual downloads.\nThis setup transforms your manual 70GB bottleneck into a robust, versioned data pipeline that maintains the SWE standards of your core application.",

ETL Pipeline: Ingest data from public APIs (maybe weather, finance, or social media), clean and transform it, and store it in a cloud database. Visualize results or build a simple dashboard to display insights.\n2. Data Warehouse Project: Set up a mini data warehouse using open source tools (like PostgreSQL, DuckDB, or even cloud warehouses if allowed by your school). Populate it with multiple sources and practice schema design, partitioning, and basic analytics queries.\n3. Batch vs Stream: Compare batch ETL (e.g., with Airflow or Prefect) and simple streaming (Kafka or just a basic pub/sub) on a dataset. Even if you use sample scripts, explaining the trade-offs is valuable.\n4. End-to-End Analytics: Choose a topic (like campus resource usage or student performance if you can get anonymized data), gather, clean, and enrich the data, and display it in a lightweight front-end. This gives you a taste of the full stack.\n\nDon’t worry about building something massive; depth of understanding matters more than shiny complexity. If your team isn’t super technical, you might look into tools that let you build simple frontends for your data without writing a whole web app from scratch; it’s a nice touch to showcase your processed data to non-technical folks.\n\nBest of luck on your capstone!",

Add some basic data quality checks and maybe a simple dashboard or query layer on top so people can actually use it. What matters more than fancy tech is showing you understand core DE ideas ingestion, transformations, data modeling, reliability, and documentation.

While books & courses are great, practical experience will teach you better than any of those. I'd suggest just look into your current company and see how data engineering is applied there. Consume your DEs' entire docs to get ideas or get shadowing sessions. This is what I did to transition, I just reviewed what I already know from experience. If you can transfer internally, that would be better.\n\nUnderstand your ETL/ELT pipelines like how data moves from point A to B (from source system up to the analytics layer) in your company. Learn how & why certain tools are being used in the system, their trade-offs in terms of scalability, costs, reliability, their impact, etc. Software engineering plus systems analysis & design concepts help a lot like SDLC & Agile methodologies for example.\n\nIf you're proficient with SQL and be able to explain different situations such as knowing when to use subquery vs CTE, view vs materialized view, handling duplicate records, optimizing queries etc. then you're more or less good to go. Knowledge of Python/PySpark helps a lot as well. Understand and differentiate between a data warehouse, data mart, data lake, data lakehouse, dim vs fact tables, normalization vs denormalization, file formats (csv, tsv, parquet, avro), etc. Knowledge of cloud also helps.

You can probably guess what part is killing performance looking at the types of joins (broadcast joins are fast vs big fact to fact table joins will be slower, sometimes range joins can be slow if they're not optimized, etc), knowing your data and how it's being joined will be super helpful too.",

If you know it great, otherwise learn it. Im migrating people from oracle to Databricks and git / branching is a big big change for them.\n\n\nI am a DE for about 10 years now.  I only know Azure.

A lot of people who get bored in senior analyst roles feel that same shift, less enjoyment from “telling the story” and more from building the systems and models that make everything work. If you enjoy data modeling, Python, and building tools that reduce friction for others, that’s already a big piece of modern DE work. Many DE roles today are less about pure infra and more about enabling analytics at scale, which fits your background well. You’re not starting from zero, you’re just moving closer to the plumbing. On the ITIL / process side yes, it’s more structured, and that can be frustrating at first. The upside is fewer fire drills and clearer ownership the downside is slower change and more ceremony. People coming from “fast and loose” teams usually struggle with pace more than the work itself, but most adapt once they see the stability benefits. As for frustrations, you’ve already named most of them unclear requirements, data quality issues, tribal knowledge, and legacy decisions you inherit. The flip side is that fixing those things is often exactly what makes the job satisfying. If building and improving systems is what energises you right now, the secondment sounds like a low-risk way to test whether DE clicks long term",

If you want to keep it free, there are open source ones used by actual companies like Apache Airflow. You can use this on the open data sources mentioned. \n\nI’ve been through many DE and DE role adjacent interviews, and SQL almost always comes up. Know some technicals like order of execution in a SQL query, CTE’s, Window functions. I have never been asked any python technicals (have done a few OA’s though that are typical leetcode style, but these were not the norm), aside from Spark concepts.\n\nWhen you scour job postings, you’ll see a company can be entirely on Azure, AWS, Databricks, Snowflake, etc. But I also see a lot of postings that are Airflow, DBT + Snowflake for example. Airflow and DBT are free and you can use a local RDBMS instead of a cloud DW for a project to teach you ETL concepts and data orchestration, warehousing, modeling.\n\nGet good at one stack and apply for jobs that use those. Before your resume gets to a human, an ATS will scan for all the relevant key words in your resume with the JD. I have only worked with Azure & Databricks so I immediately stop reading a JD when it’s asking for AWS or Snowflake. In your resume, emphasize the results per experience (ex. optimized X by Y%) first, responsibilities second. I think you can definitely give your many different roles to chatgpt and ask it to reframe those roles to be more DE-specific.\n\nAs for certs, I have noticed consulting roles seem to value those more than product company roles. If you’re fine with spending money, a Databricks DE associate cert, AWS DE, etc could make you stand out more as an entry level candidate. If you want to work with the cloud, AWS is more commonly used over Azure and GCP. Having worked in consulting before, the certs are how the firm pitches you to clients and gets you staffed (and therefore make money off of you).\n\nLastly, use Linkedin and have all the relevant DE skills and experiences on your profile. It’s a lot easier for recruiters to find you first instead of the other way around. \n\nGood luck and I’m happy to answer any more questions you may have!",

We had this sprawling CRM system that had been customized over the years by like 5 different consultants none of whom seemed to talk to each other. Marketing was using one set of IDs for customers sales had another and finance was just throwing their hands up in the air. Trying to get a single reliable customer view was a nightmare. We spent weeks just trying to map out the different entities and how they related to each other. It felt like unraveling a giant knotted ball of yarn. And then of course once we thought we had it figured out someone would drop a bomb like Oh yeah that table We stopped using that three years ago but nobody told anyone. The worst part was the constant requests for data pulls. Sales would want a list of customers with X Y and Z marketing needed a segment with A B and C and the data team was stuck writing custom SQL queries all day long. It was completely unsustainable and we never got to work on anything strategic. What finally saved us was this virtual data platform we implemented. The thing that impressed us most was its ability to automatically discover all these hidden relationships between entities that would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. The AI engine identified and resolved data quality issues too duplicate entries mismatched data types the whole nine yards. We didnt have to move or duplicate any data either which was a huge plus for security and compliance. Then once the data was unified we started building no-code ETL processes to push cleansed data to the different systems and to our data warehouse. That part really freed up our data team. Instead of constantly fulfilling ad-hoc requests we could focus on building actual data products and analytics. Seriously the reduction in headaches alone was worth the cost. I know it sounds like Im selling you something here and I kinda am. The company that makes the platform has a referral program and yeah Id get a kickback if you ended up using them. But honestly based on what youve described I genuinely think it could solve your problems. Id be happy to make an introduction if you want to explore it further no pressure either way. Just let me know if you think a connection would be helpful.",

Great culture and exactly what you want from your data team right? Right? \n\nI'm dying for business to wake up and realize why we took time to build data warehouse that actually follow the rules. Those \"let's just do x for now\" always bite you in the ass. It seems today's strategy is to limp things along until the business is fed up enough to wait for an entire redesign. Then the tech team and manager are replaced and you don't even fix all the tech debt because the people aware of it left! Tech debt NEEDS to be tracked and talked about regularly. Where I'm at they pushed anyone technical out of those discussions and it's only been band and worse. The consulting team they brought in pointed the finger at the data/tech team, promoted mid level managers with no tech background into those leadership positions (now they have to lean on the consultants for EVERYTHING AND EVERY DECISION! So much wasted money and time but theres no one technical to explain anything, even WHY things are as messy as they are. \n\nI saw this happening and tried to get my boss to understand what was happening. Instead he fought her about design differences instead of division of responsibilities. The consultant got 2 years to work with the analysts (who from my outside perspective were much further behind the engineers) while pointing fingers at the engineers/data. He needed to be bringing up all of the things the analysts and the business side need to do to make teams like this successful.",

For actual looping use either (1) do the loop in a driver notebook or (2) keep ADF as the orchestrator and just trigger Databricks jobs. So no, you don’t have to write everything in notebooks, but the foreach part is usually code or external orchestration.\n\nIf you redesign, the main win is fewer tiny jobs and fewer cluster spin-ups. One job run that reads the control table and processes a batch is usually cheaper and faster than 200 little runs. Also, if you are ingesting lots of files, people often go auto loader or DLT to cut orchestration overhead.\n\nAlso lol at being told six hours ago, classic.",

If everything is ultimately staying in Azure, I’m not sure the Athena layer is pulling its weight unless you really need to query AWS data in place. In most setups I’ve seen, ingestion is kept dumb, pull raw data from AWS, Oracle, SharePoint, etc. straight into ADLS and do all the SQL/transform logic downstream in Azure. Athena adds another engine, catalog, and permission model to maintain. So yes landing the data first and querying it later is usually the cleaner pattern. I’d focus on making ingestion reliable and replayable, then worry about schemas and cost logic after",

It’s meant for serving low-latency app workloads while still integrating with the lakehouse for analytics. You dont need it for most DE use cases unless you’re mixing transactional apps and analytics tightly. Lakeflow is basically Databricks opinionated pipeline layer. It wraps ingestion, transformations, orchestration, and governance together (Delta Live Tables, auto ingest, quality checks, lineage). It’s not a new storage layer, it’s about how data moves and is managed.

The big mindset shift is that schemas tell you how tables relate, but they don’t tell you how data changes. Streams only show what Snowflake sees as new or updated rows since the last run, so if the source system quietly edits an old record, you’ll never see that unless you deliberately go back and reprocess it. That’s why a lot of pipelines use a lookback window (reloading the last N days every run) or just full refresh smaller tables. If the source doesn’t give you a reliable “last updated” field or CDC feed, you kind of have to assume old data can change and design around that. For tables without dates, truncating by time doesn’t really make sense. Those usually get merged by a stable business key, or fully rebuilt if they’re small enough. The “forked” tables usually follow the lifecycle of the parent record, not the ingestion date. In general, when you’re trying to understand ingestion, I’d ask “how does this data change in the source system?” rather than “how do these tables join.” Once you answer that, the truncate vs merge decisions start to feel a lot more obvious",

From the outside it looks less like “networking is unimportant” and more like Fabric being designed as a very opinionated SaaS first, and an Azure-native platform second. MPEs feel awkward because they’re basically abstracting VNET concepts into something Fabric can control end to end. That gives Microsoft tighter isolation, simpler UX for less technical users, and easier multi-tenant guarantees, but it also means every new resource type needs explicit support. That doesn’t scale well for power users who expect networking to just work like it does in Synapse or Databricks. The slow rollout of MPE types is probably a mix of security review, product prioritization, and yes, commercial incentives. Fabric clearly pushes “bring data into OneLake” patterns first, and anything that bypasses that path feels like a second-class citizen. Whether that’s intentional cost pressure or just product focus, the effect is the same for customers. I don’t think it’s a lack of technical capability so much as Fabric still deciding who it’s really for. Right now it feels optimized for managed ingestion and analytics inside the ecosystem, not for complex private networking scenarios. Until that changes, Fabric is hard to recommend as a full replacement for Synapse/Databricks if deep network control is a requirement. Curious if others have found workarounds or just accepted this as a current limitation",

And presenting it as being ready for use, even when customers can't connect to basic HTTP/REST services.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is when they position it to replace PaaS offerings like Azure Analysis Services, Azure Synapse and HDInsight.  They are choking the life out of those commonly used PaaS platforms and making customers migrate - long before their new platform is mature or stable .  It is frightening that they are so convinced their customers want to abondon PaaS for an expensive and inflexible SaaS.   Or maybe they are just so focused on higher margins, that they don't care what their customers want.  IMO, not being able to connect to a resource is a big red flag to a PaaS user.

From there you also need to export each referenced job, crawler, and trigger using `GetJob`, `GetCrawler`, and `GetTrigger`. In the target account, you recreate the workflow with `CreateWorkflow`, then recreate jobs, crawlers, and triggers so the DAG lines back up. This works well for a one-time move, but you still have to fix account specific things like IAM role ARNs, KMS keys, S3 bucket names, connections, and any hard coded account IDs in job arguments.\n\nThe cleaner long-term approach is to turn the workflow into infrastructure as code. Glue workflows and triggers are supported in both CloudFormation and Terraform. Once modeled, you can deploy the same definition to another account with only variable changes for account specific resources. This avoids ever doing a manual rebuild again and is what most teams settle on after the first migration.\n\nIn practice, if this is a one-off accident recovery, scripting against the Glue APIs is usually fastest. If you expect multiple environments or future moves, converting the workflow to CloudFormation or Terraform is the better investment.",

CBR and .zip files and loads the images in sequence, a manga/comic reader, but I was loading all the images into memory and never cleaning it, each comic you'd open it'd add around 100mb of memory to the app's consumption in the task manager, and it'd only be freed when you closed the app, the fact that the app only had 1 page and to switch to reading mode I'd simply hide the main page UI should tell you enough, I'll probably make a better one, one day...",

You are right that this is a way to become senior - I'm quite good at this - but I am really very bad at standing up a new system from scratch. I'm way too far down the spectrum of pragmatism (do whatever works and move on to the next thing), way too focused on using stuff that already exists (libraries and tools), way too risk-averse. And way too slow. A typical day for me changes one or a few lines of code. I understand the implications of the change deeply,  but when there's a file header that needs a thousand lines of new code added from scratch, I'm not your guy. I never was, never needed to be.",

Otherwise, once you're in the field, experience alone will take you as far as you want to go.\n\nThe key sentence is \"once you're in the field.\"\n\nEdit: Guess I should clarify, when OP says \"educational foundations\", I take it to mean \"learned in a college classroom.\" When I say \"experience alone,\" I include picking up a textbook or non-credit course (ie., MOOCs, for example) to fill in the gaps *as needed, as in, learning just enough on your own to deliver the MVP.*",

Then move on to one with API key auth and do the same, then move on to one that has OAuth and do it again. \n\nOnce you've done that go to [https://restful-api.dev/](https://restful-api.dev/) \\- try creating a record with a POST method, take the ID from the response and GET it. Once you can GET it, try to PATCH and PUT it, then ultimately DELETE it. You can practice this loop.\n\nREST API docs will make much more sense to you at this point when you actually understand auth and what the verbs are for. This knowledge is directly translatable to GraphQL queries and mutations, there are many guides, this is a decent one to see the difference between RESTful GET requests and GraphQL queries [https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-from-rest-to-graphql) \n\nAPIs are typically intuitive because we have common conventions, but you have to actually understand those conventions first.

You're 21. You don't have to have everything figured out. I'm almost 40, and I have a bunch of different skills, but I still don't have my shit figured out, either.

Go is great, but most Go teams expect you to already understand backend basics like HTTP, databases, concurrency, deployment, and system design. Junior Go roles do exist, but they are noticeably fewer and more competitive than junior Java or general backend roles. Since you already have Java experience through Selenium, learning Java backend first is often the more pragmatic move. You can reuse the language, focus on Spring Boot, REST APIs, databases, and production concepts, and become employable faster. Once you understand backend fundamentals, picking up Go later becomes much easier and much more attractive to employers. Many people successfully transition from Java backend into Go, but far fewer do it the other way around as their first backend job.",

Then all kinds of financial troubles as well, that the countries are facing. The job market is harsh, right now. Juniors are struggling to find a job. Mid-levels and Seniors are trying to stick to their current place. But even then having sometimes be put on hold (e.g. an unpaid leave) or having be let go, completely. Because there is no job to offer to them. Non-IT companies, our clients, they are also counting their pennies and not allocating that much money into new development = less job for developers. Unemployed mid-levels are more desperate and sometimes targeting Junior roles. And companies are less willing to hire a Senior over a mid-level because that would mean higher salary expectations by the developer.\n\nStick to your current place, if you can.

They experimented. They tried. They failed. They tried something different and eventually, they succeeded.\n\nMost tutorials don't actually \"teach\". They pre-chew and serve. They don't make the learner do the work and *think*. You won't learn much if the entire code is presented to you. You will only learn if someone *guides* you but you have to do the thinking and work. This distinguishes a top quality *course* from just another *\"how to create X\"* *tutorial*.\n\nOnce one has the foundation laid, e.g. through some proper *course*, it is time to throw away the training wheels and to start trying, doing things on their own. Use the documentation, use specific targeted articles, blogs, or even tutorials - but not the \"how to create X\" ones, rather some short, narrow, targeted tutorials that only cover some aspect of your project, e.g. if you want to do something with a SQLite database in Python, check for a quick tutorial (there are excellent ones) that teach you exactly that - how to connect to a database, how to create tables, how to query fields, etc.\n\nChanging your way how you approach tutorials also can help: When a concept, part is introduced, try to do it on your own first. Do not look at the presented code. Write it yourself. Play around, experiment. Once you have done it and it works or if all else fails, look at the code. Work at *predicting* what the presented code will be.",

HTB is a bit more \"try harder\" with its labs, while THM is very beginner friendly. Offensive ctfs are typically compromising a machine going from a user/service account > to root/admin account, these could be windows machines, Active Directory machines, Linux servers, web servers, even cloud environments. Great for building the hacker mindset. Defensive ctfs are all about investigation and recreating attackers steps uncovering their moves. Understanding log sources and how to properly investigate an incident. Network security operates more on the defensive side, but I know plenty of security engineers who have a base offensive skill set. You got to remember, almost everything in tech generally is connected to each other. So even your web development project with python is incredibly relevant to web security and bug bounty. Possibilities are endless if security is where you are aiming. Join the Hack the Box community if cyber interests you.",

        "body": "> For people with more experience, did debugging eventually become easier or less stressful?\n\nThere's no one trajectory for it. Some bugs are fairly trivial to detect and fix, others can take months or years.\n\nThe important thing is that this does not fully hinge on a given programmers debugging skills. Bugs only become easy to detect and fix when\n\n* the programmer is somewhat good at debugging and familiar with the codebase,\n* the code has been written in a way that facilitates easy debugging,\n* the infrastructure has been set up in a way that facilitates easy debugging,\n* the programmer has tools available that facilitate debugging.\n\nPeople can have different preferences for how to go about achieving these things, but they're likely to involve stuff like\n\n* [Good error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/index.html#common-message-styles)\n* Observability setups (logging, metrics, tracing)\n* Access to actual debuggers\n* Tests (both unit tests and integration tests)\n* Automated builds and common integration & testing infrastructure (to eliminate the \"it works on my machine\" situations)\n* Linters / rule engines that prevent certain code from being merged\n* Static typing and a [reliable type system](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (there are some people who swear by dynamic typing, but Typescript is gaining ground over Javascript, and it's pretty common now to have type hints and typechecking for Python too, and apparently PHP)\n* Various code architecting styles, though preferences there _really_ vary, but see e.g. \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" and \"parse, don't validate\"\n\nI.e. a lot of the work we do is done to make debugging easier, and avoid bugs reaching production in the first place.\n\nBut depending on situation and the technology involved some bugs can still be pretty hard to figure out. There's [a talk from CppCon 2017 by Louis Brandy, _Curiously recurring C++ bugs at Facebook_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkgszkPnV8g) that has a lot of examples of stuff that can stump professionals. (And they're specifically _C++_ bugs. Lots of companies are switching to Rust, and those bugs aren't present in Rust, and probably not in most other languages either.)",

You get better by implementing with mentors. You start with an established curriculum like AP CS A/B and then go do a four year BS degree somewhere recognized that can get you a coop/internship placement and has alumni hiring for positions when you graduate. If you do less than that, you won't have the group project experience and advanced topic fundamentals to hit the ground running. You'll be competing with offshore code monkeys we can staff during US or EU business hours for under $20/hr loaded cost rate (salary, benefits, support staff, equipment, building, everything). And now, you'll be competing with Claude. May as well wait tables at that point. \n\nAt 19 years old, the best advice anyone can give you is to go to university and do an engineering or CS program. You don't have to go to MIT or Cambridge or IIT etc. If you have a four year state technical school whose program is well respected and that has a strong internship placement office, that's fine. Hiring managers nearby probably graduated from that program and will recognize the credential. Especially with AI, your goal is to be solid enough to do the job without AI so you can manage AI as though it were a junior developer. I get customer hires and sometimes staff hires that came out of these six month bootcamps and it's tedious. I'm essentially their TA/professor for what they would have learned in their first big sophomore year project practicum to say nothing of the next two years of courses. And they'll be hamstrung because no one's going to ever make them build a simple database server or webserver or memory allocation method and they'll never really understand how that works. Go do the full program and be better.",

The world has seen enough todo task tracker apps uploaded to github please for the love of god if youre building on now save the electricity and close that codebase and never look back after you've built one. \n\nKeep building though, it is the single best way to improve. But stop googking projects for beginners and finding the same top 10 list of things we've all built a million times before, and build something you want. You like games and cant remember loops or how to right conditions? Make a text based rpg in the terminal. Feel like you need to practice working with apis? Forget the weather apps weve all done, go play with the nasa api and put cool pictures of space on your screen. Building a website is boring, but building a shitpost of a website full of memes or inside jokes only you understand is fun. \n\n\nYou can practice and learn without wanting to die, this doesnt have to always seems like homework. And if youre building something that you're interested in than even the frustrating boring parts won't seem all that boring. People do this job for fun without being paid, think about why that might be so, there has to be a reason for some of them, at least for some of the projects they've built.",

When I first started programming i wasnt doing it to get a job or anything, so i didnt care about \"learning programming\", i just learned the bare minimum i needed to build what I wanted to build. Looking back, lot of what I made were built horribly with bad practices (I didnt take the time to learn \"good practices\"), but thats fine because I still learned a lot from them and they didnt need to be perfect.",

See what clubs, job positions, research positions etc. are available, ask around about what opportunities they provide and that will allow to choose a niche that you will have a good chance of gaining a career in. \n\nAlso see what companies show up to your university career fairs. If there a lot of defense companies for example, focus on learning skills that defense companies want.",

Moving the window one step only changes a single data point. To make the list sorted again you only need to move this specific point to the correct place. \n\nGoing a bit further into potential optimizations you can also notice that if the point that's dropping out of the window (`op`) and the point that enters the window (`np`) are both larger or smaller than the current median, the median won't change and you can just replace `op` with `np` without resorting the list. Another observation is that if `op` and `np` are on different sides of the median, you don't actually have to resort everything to rebalance both sides because the balance can be easily restored by moving one element to the correct side:\n\n* `op` < median < `np`: move the smallest element to the right the median to the left of the median; this element is now also the largest element of the left. The new median lies between this element and the new smallest element on the right side.\n\n* `op` > median > `np`: Find the biggest element on the left side and move it to the right; it's now the smallest element on the right.\n\nBy using those observations and moving from fully sorting the window to simply partitioning it you should be able to make updating it much cheaper because you no longer have to shift all elements between `op` and `np` to either the left of the right.",

Python's standard library is 1000x better.\n\n2: There tends to be a lot of asynchronous activity, which is a can of worms and makes subtle bugs.\n\n3: Some of the syntax is just weird, like ===.\n\nMy advice is to work on programs that you will actually want to use, and keep trying to have fun with it. Think of programming as a creative medium, and don't be afraid to write small and/or weird programs. Not everything needs to be a showcase project. Don't be afraid to tackle concepts that confuse you.  Getting a *good* book and reading it always helps.\n\nRemember that for every \"good\" program you have used, the person who made it had written hundreds of crappy programs before it.

Your intuition to start with something like Ren'Py is a good idea. I'd also recommend Game Maker since it's even easier to get started with something fun/playable (though it uses a slightly weird programming language that's not useful anywhere else).

So we need to break that problem down.\n\nWhen the program isn't doing what you expect, put a 'print (whatever\\_variable)' followed by an 'exit' and run the program again.  See what the variable looks like at that point.  If it is what you expect it to be, then move the 'debug' statements down one line and see if the program is doing what you expect on the next line.  At what point the program's output diverges from what you think it should be doing, that is the point that is worth studying closer.\n\nThen just consider that little piece of program code and look up syntax and research what the command does until you understand it, and fix the issue, and move on to the next line.\n\nWork it out like that.  You need to understand how the 'wires' connect together, so to speak, before you get to the real fun part, of connecting bigger components together like graphics and saving files and using networking and such.  Just take it slow and give yourself some patience to look at the small problems.\n\nIt's like math class.  There is a reason that math classes spend awhile on the fundamentals.

That way, we didn't have to deal with re-pointing nameservers, changing billing, or other nonsense (usually, biggest issue was stuck caches).\n\nThe clients that didn't have an existing host service I would recommend use the host I had been using who - at the time - had good rates, solid customer service team.

They set up the payments, I didn't want to get involved with that.\n\nWhen working on sites my contract broke the project estimate into a series of phases. Work on each phase wouldn't begin until a down payment was received, and I wouldn't start on a subsequent phase until the previous phase had been paid in full.

You can even add default methods and inherit those as well.   \nYou can extend classes and by that inherit state, but that's rarely a good idea, so just don't do it. \n\nI don't know what exactly is not clear to you. Maybe the problem is that you try to \"translate\" your code. It's probably better to not just translate it line by line but to think about what objects there will be and how they communicate. Calling a method is how that works in OOP. And they can have side effects. \n\nThere are books. Some of them are bad many are outdated. The problem is mostly that they spend a lot of time on inheritance of state because it's so problematic. That chapter has to be in the book, but it should just be about what you prevent as much as possible. And beginners think because there's so much about it in the book it  must be important. \n\nYou probably need a type for each expression in your syntax tree. You could use an abstract class as a base that has a field for the token(s) from the tokenizer. But you really don't need this. Just design each class as a final class and it's a lot simpler.  Use \"record\" instead of \"class\" for immutable types. \"permits\" on your types when you know the subtypes.",

Start small with a dataset where you have pairs like (root, modern name) and ignore multi-step history at first. Once that works, you can add intermediate forms as extra training examples or as a multi-stage pipeline.\n\nThe hardest part will be the dataset, not the model. Etymology data is messy and sparse, and “multiple steps through history” is basically asking for aligned sequences across languages and time. I would prototype with whatever clean pairs you can get, then iterate. If you can make a dumb version that produces plausible names, you will be 90 percent of the way there.",

Python or JS could work for very simple \"retro\" style games, but you won't get very far making a modern game title in them. For that you usually pick Unity or Unreal, so that means C# or C++.\n\nAs far as C++ being difficult to learn, that's somewhat true, but Unreal Engine does simplify it a bit by being opinionated. They have a way of doing things. And it has libraries that handle the hard stuff like memory management for you.\n\nTake a look at Unity if C# is more your speed. It's a lot \"cleaner\" than C++ IMO. But Unity games can't really match the rendering quality and performance of Unreal.",

I'd recommend a i7/Ryzen 7 and 32 GB of RAM if you can find something within your budget for futureproofing and more hardware demanding projects\n\nI also wouldn't go for any of the cheap burst SKU laptops/budget laptops because manufacturers tend to cheap out on build quality and/or components like RAM or the SSD, so they tend to fail/break sooner than something that you'd spend a little more money on\n\nAs for the manufacturer, I think Lenovo and Asus are pretty good for Windows machines. I'm not a huge fan of Macs because everything is soldered on, but if you prefer Mac/want to build apps for iOS and MacOS, i would go that route instead.

In this case, you should install Windows and you can use WSL for the your programming activity.\n\nI like the University of Helsinki MOOC platform, it's very hands-on and force you to set up your own programming environment: [https://www.mooc.fi/en/courses/](https://www.mooc.fi/en/courses/)\n\nThey have intro to programming in Python (new curriculum) and in Java (old curriculum). I've done the Java course, it's a great introduction with a lot of programming exercises. \n\nYou can also google the Harvard CS50 online program: [https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)\n\nIt's a very popular course, I heard a lot of good things about it.",

Understand how to download, setup, and use 3rd party libraries within your project. This can indeed be non-trivial, especially given the relative immaturity/messiness of C++'s packaging ecosystem compared to other programming languages.

But if you plan on writing C++ professionally, it's something you must become familiar with, for better or for worse.\n\nNote that:\n\n1. Pretty much no employer will let you use an online IDE. It's pretty questionable from a security standpoint (if you use a free editor) or a cost standpoint (if the company pays for it). The overwhelming expectation is that you use a local editor of some sort.\n2. Most employers (and open-source projects) will already have the project set up, and have a recommended workflow. In practice, this _can_ save you the hassle of figuring out how to wire everything up from scratch.\n3. That said, employers will still expect you to be familiar with how to use the toolchain of your primary programming language, especially to complete basic tasks such as setting up and using a new library.

You already have the beginning and size, and here you're decrementing that in addition to incrementing the pointer. Offsetting into an array vs moving a pointer into it is a very old debate that I'm not convinced was ever *particularly* important as long as memory access happens the same (e.g. moving linearly through memory despite multidimensional subscripting, same as pinter increment).",

Even for a multi-dimensional array that is guaranteed to be contiguous, an array is a higher order type than raw machine memory, with semantics that are enforced by the COMPILER, not the machine. You violate bounds and aliasing rules, which the compiler doesn't check for you - because it correctly ASSUMES you're writing well defined behavior and you wouldn't intentionally violate the language rules you're personally responsible for.

It also asks for an unnecessary addition on every loop iteration. The compiler will probably optimize that out, but textually you're expressing something different from what you actually mean. Your loop should EITHER go until the pointer reaches some limiting address value, OR until some count is reached. For what you're doing, choose the count by comparing N to zero.\n\n\n* The variable names are unhelpful. What is N? By convention it looks like the array size, but it only means that at the start of the loop. It's actually the number of items remaining to be visited. And what is A? It's not the address of an array A, it's the address of an element of that array.\n\n\n* The empty initialization of the for loop means you're expressly designing this code to leave artifacts available for the rest of the block. Sometimes that's useful, but not here. Those artifacts are A, pointing just past the last element of the array, and N, which will by definition be zero.

        "body": "TLDR: The reality is most starting out heavily lack basic DSA or basic language functionality like stacks, heaps, and virtual space. There are countless things to learn but overall I recommend advancing in DSA and don't feel rushed to know everything. Take your time deeply understanding the simple stuff. Ask questions where things are assumed and seem obvious. If you can really feel what's going on it will stick better. If you're going to Leetcode try to stay in a particular topic for a while and avoid spreading your learning too thin across many different challenges back to back.\n\nI was in and out of university for a while and in between completed Coding Dojo Full Stack Development (don't recommend), made a bunch of projects and eventually a successful app on iOS and Android. You might already know many of these topics but this is what I find useful.\n\nWhat I learned is that anything.js (edit I mean most .js solutions, not literally a project called anything.js lol) React, Angular, etc. these full stack web frameworks are constantly changing and new trendy APIs are always coming. Many new APIs are made when someone has some slight problem with the existing options. The right way to use them imo is to know the good general fundamentals like CRUD, validations, DB servers and back end controllers for them, MVC structures, dynamic pages and templates and when you come across some new API you must use that's the only time to get into the specifics and spend time on it - when you need to.\n\nLeetcode is good with the right mindset. You can spend too much time on topics that don't improve your skills that much or focusing on the difficulty more than what you're actually learning. Every programmer should strive to be solid in DSA. Focus on things like arrays, binary trees, string modification and linked lists. Take your time to know the little things well. Ask AI for small learning project ideas and when you don't know something syntax or language specific don't ask AI but check the documentation because there you will be surprised at when else you come across or multiple examples of using a function. Try to solve the Skyline problem. The skill level rating shouldn't get in the way of what you want to learn. If knowing how to solve that problem advances you then just take your time on it and try to have solid knowledge in the small steps. If you learn how every little part of a single problem takes all day when you could've done a bunch of random ones to feel more comfortable in the language, it's fine because the former will stick with you.\n\nMaybe do a simple learning project in hash maps, or make a multi multi level index database with JSON files and JS and see how you can optimize it. Take a JSON file with test data and make a function that splits it to 3 files where the first is an index, and the next two is part A and B. See how you can modify the function to take number of files/splits and how to split them. For learning I try to keep my attention in the same realm for a while so don't jump around too much or do a project that spreads your attention thin.\n\nThose skills will follow you everywhere you go but a new JS API probably won't help you with much else.\n\nKnow the topics that are needed but programmers starting out struggle with or are frequently missed either by curriculum or not needing it in a specific language:\n\n\\- What is a stack and heap?\n\n\\- What is a virtualized address?\n\n\\- Asymmetric vs symmetric encryption, passkey generation, basic structure of encrypting and decrypting data and how to ensure you're doing it safely.\n\n\\- When to use structured SQL data or NoSQL. What are the pros and cons? You can use both in an app so what do you want strict and what should be flexible?\n\n\\- Allocation for data types.\n\nRelating to networking I don't know what fundamental work is needed I haven't dealt with that much yet, but less low level topics are solutions that reduce data redundancy, but also latency which can fight redundancy, and the size of transfers all while keeping security which can also fight latency for users. We are producing and sharing data in a rapidly growing rate as the corporate world wants everything cloud based and as AI does what it do. Any little changes to make an app function just as fast and secure but with less data being transferred or stored is very valuable. AI companies will be considering things like Azure Cosmos DB or something equivalent/better. I won't comment much on AI I don't know where that is going.",

It needs to be followed by a character that indicates which operation to do.\n\nFor instance, `\\033[1;4H` moves the cursor to row 1 and column 4, but `\\033[1;4m` sets formatting modes 1 and 4 (bold and underline).\n\nSince you're only specifying the parameters and not the operation, whichever character comes next will be interpreted as part of the same escape sequence, and the terminal will try to perform that operation.\n\nSo if you enter a string that begins with the letter `H` then it will be centered except for the missing first letter. If you enter a string beginning with anything else, all bets are off. The behavior depends on what letter it starts with and how your particular terminal emulator handles invalid escape sequences.\n\nSee here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Control_Sequence_Introducer_commands",

If you don't apply what you've recently learned then you're not really thinking for yourself and you are just simply going through the FreeCode Camp modules. I would also say that if you're just strictly using FreeCode Camp's modules, you are forced to use their version of an IDE. You may not get the full complete effect if you had your own code editor and you are going through them from that vantage point. It does not show you how to set up your own servers and it just gives you feedback based upon what you type on your screen through the web browser. \n\nHere is an article https://www.precodecamp.com/blog/is-free-code-camp-effective-study-reveals-gaps-in-web-development-training/",

Yes, it is possible to use AI plugins and such, but by default the thing that we understand as an \"AI\" is not turned on. Yes, the IDE tells if you have syntax errors and code smell (bad coding practices) and is context aware in terms of indexing existing code and libraries but besides that it does not behave like a ChatGPT or such.\n\nYes, you might have to figure it out how to use WebStorm (or any other Jetbrains tool) on your own as in the course they might tell how to do the exercises in Visual Studio Code, but other than difference between tools, the coding part is still the same.\n\nAnd I do recommend to switch over to Linux. As a beginner there is not much difference between Windows and Linux, but on a more advanced level Linux is more user-friendly for software developers. In Windows you have to get stuff working with WSL and not always it works. In Linux things work out of the box.",

You can start now. \n\n\nTarget companies that automatically give OAs, start-ups, and small local ones. It might help if you speak in person, reach out to them somehow, or curate quick projects related to them. \n\n\nContinue your learning as you dedicate that time. If you don't want to learn for free, attempt to build things that can generate revenue, freelance, get a contracting gig, make the jump to open source, or offer your services to spruce up small local company sites. Otherwise, get used to building for fun as your skills improve. Carpenters don't get better by simply working for cash. They build a lot of things. You're a builder/maintainer now. \n\n\nTarget skills related to the job type you're looking for. You might want to search for \"essential skills for getting a fullstack job\" and see how you size up. What you suggested as a learning path isn't what I see hiring managers focus on. \n\n\nYour easiest path might be from actual connections, so don't be afraid of tech meetups and stuff. Be enthusiastic about what you build and learn instead of handing a resume and begging for a job. ",

Your rank in Codeforce is not building real life apps, real life services, etc.\n\nYou told you made projects with MERN stack. Did you come up with an idea on your own or did you follow a tutorial?\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that actual ability to build real projects, that matters. Codeforce and Leetcode do not matter. Yes, some interviews ask from you Leetcode problems but other than that, you won't need Leetcode in the real life.\n\nI'd say that have a decent portfolio with projects that either you, your family, your friends or somebody else is using in their daily life. That will give you an advantage. Yes, you having a degree is already a good sign. Not going to ignore that. Now, you are competing with other degree holders. And that is where you have to figure out how will you stand out.\n\nAnd Typescript is based on Javascript. When you are developing stuff with Typescript you are using Javascript. When you are writing stuff in Typescript then during the compilation process it compiles to a regular Javascript. You can't say that nobody is using Javascript.\n\nNow, should you stick to a MERN stack or you should pick something else? Decide it based on your local job market. Are the companies using Node.js? If most companies require Java or PHP then already your MERN stack starts falling apart. What about using Oracle instead of MongoDB? Or using Angular instead of React? Decide your stack based on local market not based on what online tutorials are teaching you.",

Linux without a display server is still capable of drawing on a screen. Just try installing raspberry pi os lite and then plugging it into a monitor, you will still get output.\n\n- So I want to learn how to make linux system calls and learn C by working through two advanced books, culminating in a project where I make a simple game that only uses direct system calls and writes directly to the screens frame buffer, pixel by pixel, for output.",

That said, I still stand by my comment that if you think you are \"up for it\", then \"go for it\".\n\nThis is more of a \"being on the same page\" when we are talking about system calls.\n\nBack in the day, when I did assembler programming on MS-DOS systems, system calls was pretty much the only option available. I also had to do this on some proprietary operating systems such as TMX (which was an NCR proprietary OS running on M68K CPUs).\n\nIt was a PIA. Back then, in MS-DOS, the interface was pretty straightforward, but tedious.\n\nSystem calls are pretty basic as you are directly invoking functions that the underlying operating system supports - for example, openning, reading, writing and other file operations. Or, forking the current process and replacing the image with a new image (fork and execute). Terminate this process and other \"basic\" operations.\n\nIn DOS, you setup the parameters in various CPU registers and invoked a software interrupt (INT 0x21 if memory serves).\n\nLinux is very similar.\n\nIf running on Intel hardware, there is a special instruction `syscall` (added in Pentium class CPUs I believe) that is used in place of the INT 0x21, but you still have to set up the CPU registers.\n\nPerhaps have a look at this: https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/linux-constants/syscalls/#x86_64-64-bit\n\nThe CPU registers that need to be set are listed at the head of the table,\n\nNote that there are no \"graphics\" system calls - I don't know how this would work, I imagine it is some sort of IPC between your process and a kernel driver which manages the display hardware. IPC could include any combination of:\n\n* Shared memory (shmget, shmat ...).\n* Semaphores (semget, semop, semctl),\n* Message Queues (msgget, msgsnd, msgrcv...).\n* Pipes (pipe, mkfifo, open, read, write...)\n* Signals which operate like interrupts (kill, signal, sigaction...)\n\nand possibly others. But the same thing would apply, there would be some mechanism (defined by the driver) that defines how parameters are supplied and functions invoked.\n\nIf you want to learn system calls (and the above is what you are talking about), you might try doing some basic File I/O using the system calls, perhaps some IPC between two processes that you create (and thus know the protocol being used for them talk to each other) - perhaps a simple command interpreter that can accept commands, fork and exec a sub process.",

Even front desk staff can usually answer that without needing manager approval. If getting access to a real hotel is hard, some people survey multiple sources (small local hotels, internships, or even detailed hotel websites + booking flows) and document it as “observational survey data.” The key is showing your entities came from real processes, not whether the dataset is perfect.

        "body": "Hahaha. I think that's the one thing every programmer should know better than the typical \"Hello World\" example that always starts language guides. In my case, I usually try to debug in parts to see how far it works correctly and then check everything related to the point where the error seems to start to see what the cause might be. If necessary, and as a last resort, I usually use an AI to debug the code snippets; I usually use ChatGPT or Claude in those situations, and even though I know it's safe, I always give them portions of code in temporary chats for fear of data leaks. Of course, AIs work automatically, so it's rare that anyone would see that; it's more of a bit of my own paranoia.",

If you simply don't know what tool exists for something you want to do (like a keyword, a module, an IDE, or whatever), just Google it or ask someone.

        "body": "In addition to what others have said, you need to realize that coding as a \"class\" and hobby by the nature of how it works forces every new concept and lesson to be cumulative even if your school isnt testing you that way\n\nWhat I mean, is that during week one you learn variables and data types and have a test on those. Week 2 you may learn how functions work and be you'll be tested on functions AND variables and data types even if its not on the test because you'll be writing functions with variables in them. So when Week 20 rolls around, you are expected to have a baseline of everything that came before it because those concepts are used to do other things. \n\n\nIt may sound stressful, but if you're struggling with new information and not knowing how to start, then like a lot of beginners you likely lack that foundation of skills. Its easy to learn something new, but if youre also only kinda comfortable with the concepts youve learned so far, you arent learning just a new thing. Youre learning a new thing AND still learning the concepts your class has moved past. \n\n\nYou likely need practice, repetition is how experienced programmers can type code out quickly. When I need a loop, I dont think about the syntax at all, Ive just typed out a million of them incorrectly and it's muscle memory. So for me, if Im being taught something that assumes I need a loop, I wont be spending any mental energy on the syntax of a loop or any other concept, my entire brain is focused on the new concept. Coding is hard for new programmers, but if you feel you're getting overwhelmed, id implore you to consider looking backwards and not forwards, because you may not be hitting a wall due to the new concepts being tough, but rather because you're attempting to learn the new concepts while the old concepts are still being mastered. And if you feel thats the case, build things, use those things and repeat them over and over again until they're muscle memory. \n\n\nYou're a CS student, so it probably irks you when you see people typing with their pointer finger. But if you think back, you probably were annoyed learning to properly touch type and keep your hands in the correct position. But now you dont even think twice about typing, your brain thinks of a word and your hands do the motion required. The same process happens with coding, you just dont have years of experience like you have with typing.",

I’m not saying that was the reason why he chose me to put on Focus, but I will say I really only got to “know” him after I came back and after he already decided to put me on Focus. I also messaged my outgoing manager and he said he gave me a strong (although maybe not exceptional) rating before he left, so it seemed weird that my new manager randomly chose me to put on focus. My new manager told me in our 1:1 that he had to choose someone to put in Focus or he would be the one getting rated poorly (lol).\n\nAfter I found out I was put on Focus, I really put in the effort to work hard and finish my project on time and deliver. This was back around 2023 when the market was very uncertain. For my new manager’s credit, he told me about halfway through my focus that he saw how hard I was working and he was pulling me out no matter what. “I’m telling leadership we need to take [my_name] out no matter what”. Our relationship was much better by then and we actually became pretty good friends after. He actually did yank me out of focus and I got strong ratings every time after that.\n\nSo… no, focus is not a death sentence. Sometimes your manager’s hands are tied and you have to work with them. But it is definitely possible to make it out!",

Those three together put you ahead of the majority of people complaining on this sub. Layoffs in this climate are also not frowned upon so I wouldn't worry about your 5 month stint too much.\n\nThe market is not great but it's also q1 and nearing the beginning of some companies fiscal year so you're in a better spot now hiring wise than if this happened in November.\n\nThat being said as someone (now 8-9 yoe) also in the nyc area that was laid off at the beginning of 2025 and in 2023 and had 3-5 offers each time in <3 months for solid comp (no prior faang or really big name experience), I would say your situation is definitely not insurmountable.\n\nIf you need a little time for your mental health take it now, imo no longer than a week and I wouldn't travel or go on vacation unless it's to visit family. You don't want to distract yourself you want to decompress emotionally and let your new reality settle in, low stimulus time.\n\nOnce you're ready to start hunting then you update your linkedin and get your resume together. Take your time but don't take too long, you can always update it more as you apply. \n\nStart sending out apps, I would aim for at least 50 a week. Personally I never did the tailor the resume per application and fuck that cover letter shit, but at the same time apply for places where you're a reasonable fit. Apply for startups, big tech, and everything in between. At this point you just want to pump the numbers, get your feet wet, and collect data.\n\nTrack all your job apps in a spreadsheet listing out what platform you applied, what version of your resume you applied with (if you modify it), and if you were rejected or not. This will help you tailor your strategy and give you success rates to A/B test approaches against. I had about a 5-10% callback rate on cold apps and a 20% callback rate on recruiter DMs/inmail (moved past the screening round). This is a pretty solid ratio to have in today's climate.\n\nAlso start connecting with a ton of tech recruiters and if you see a job with a good fit DM the recruiter directly with a short message, the job link, and your resume.\n\nAim to spend half your day doing leetcode /system design and the other half on job apps. Always be interview ready and at the beginning take every interview you can get even if it's something you would never accept just to build your confidence.\n\nThe big thing is to always rethink your approach and try tweaking different strategies to see what gets better results. It's a shitty position to be in but it's one that you can turn into a positive growth experience if you handle it well.\n\nKeep your head up and work hard! Also stay the fuck off of reddit, you do not need this negative shit filling up your head! Good luck!",

Most of this sub is about software dev jobs specifically (though that's admittedly a bit narrower than \"CS careers\"), yet \"plant\" and \"facility\" are words that bring up some very non-traditional settings. You probably would need to clarify more, as this sounds like it might not be the kinda situation most people here are familiar with. An environment with stricter regulations on changes may explain some of what you're experiencing, but will also make a lot of feedback you'd receive invalid.\n\nBut really, this is much more of a conversation for your manager. Your manager should be connecting you with projects as well as backlog work for when bigger projects are stalled. My experience is that there's usually massive backlogs of work to be done, so the idea of there being nothing to do is pretty wild to me. And I've been the sole remote worker from a team of in-person folks before. Being in a different location does change things a little, but it shouldn't make you a ghost. There should still be tons of interactions with your team, such as by dialing into standups, team Slack, code reviews, etc. But I'm coming from the position of a perhaps more typical office job and this sounds like it's something different.",

There's no way I'm letting it review code that is involved in the trunk of the system, but if it's linting/best practice code changes then I will let it make the PR and I'll review it quick.

When I brought up (nicely) some of these points and wrote them with my human brain and human thoughts (as he requested me to do), he replied with some generic GPT answer. It was clear it was GPT because I copied my comment into GPT with the prompt: \"Write a response to this\" and it spit out some of the exact same sentences and bizarre words. \n\nSo yes, AI has affected my job in the sense that now I am a slop reviewer, and it is showing me who the braindead people are who rely on slop generators to get their work done.

        "body": "Preface: I'm currently a remote SDE at Netflix, but I'm only one opinion, others might have different views obviously.\n\nFirst let me point out two facts:\n\n1. Getting a call != getting the job.  You are getting the cart in front of the horse a bit, so I'd highly recommend you not get too excited.  It is very hard to get an offer from Netflix, I've seen jobs stay open for 6+ months waiting for the perfect candidate to come through.  Also, if anyone is ahead of you in the pipeline and they accept an offer, Netflix will immediately cancel all interviews with anyone currently in the hiring pipeline.  I'm not telling you this to get you down, I've just seen too many folks surprised and disappointed by this.\n2. Lets be honest, if you get an offer you are going to take the job.  It doesn't really matter what I say after this.\n\nTo answer your actual questions:\n\n>What's the catch?\n\nThere's no catch.  Its a good company to work for, but the keeper test is a real thing.  You need to do good work to stay employed.  There are people who definitely coast, but that's not common.\n\n>Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day?\n\nNo.  I suppose if you were the type of person who wants to go from Engineering Manager to Senior Director or something I'm betting it's a journey only to be successfully traveled with a lot of in-office ass kissing.\n\n>How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus?\n\nI would say to get the idea of \"pay growth\" out of your mind.  First of all, based on you saying you were at a financial company, I'm guessing that your pay will probably double when coming to Netflix.  Given that, if it doesn't grow from there, would that be terrible?  Netflix has terms/acronyms for how they do or don't increase pay, I won't bother spelling them all out.  The TL;DR is if pay in the industry goes up across the board, then Netflix pay will go up.  If it doesn't go up or it goes down (like it has for the past 3 years), Netflix pay will stay the same.  You will never get a pay cut at least, but you also won't get a pay raise.  In the 2018-2021 timeline people were getting huge raises each year.  For the past 3 years, pay has been flat.\n\n>How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year?\n\nThey honor it.  I don't take a lot of time off, but that's a personal choice, but there are people on my team taking 30 days off per year easily.  We don't really keep track honestly, there's no place to click some button to take time off.  I just tell my manager my plans and then set my self as out-of-office on my google calendar and slack and that's about it.\n\n>How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it well\n\nAFAIK they do.  There was someone in my greater org gone for nearly a year after their baby was born.\n\n>What do you think about the health insurance they offer?\n\nIt's fine, pretty standard.  The HSA plan is usually the clear winner.\n\n>Are there any signs of remote roles becoming fully in-person anytime soon?\n\nNo, not at all.  My org is almost entirely remote.  The only rumor I've heard was from the Ads org requiring in-office, but that team is almost all ex-Meta and ex-Amazon, so who knows what those nerds are up to.",

Some intern managers are great, some are just mediocre, but this is unusually bad.\n\nThat said, this is an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation, so here's my advice:\n\nFirst, do the work you're assigned, no matter how stupid or boring it sounds. Finish copying the data to Excel, email it to your manager and ask for more.\n\nIf you get more, do it as professionally as you possibly can, even if it seems boring and stupid. Part of the experience of working at a company is that sometimes you have to do boring, stupid work. Doing it well is necessary for success.\n\nHowever, for the rest of your time, you should have two goals:\n\n1. Make yourself useful\n\n2. Learn as much as you can\n\nYou're in an amazing position right now. You have access to a whole company full of professionals, and almost no responsibilities.\n\nThis is a fantastic opportunity, if you want to take advantage of it.\n\nWho cares what department you're in? Start meeting people in different departments. Tell them you're an intern on the Data Analytics team but you're not very busy and you'd like to help.\n\nIt won't be hard to find someone who has some work for you.\n\nI don't recommend keeping it a secret! Tell your manager you did all of your Excel work, and that you met someone in another department who gave you a task. I highly doubt your manager will care.\n\nAnd of course, your goal is to learn something. Find people who are actually good at their jobs (unlike your manager) and are interested in teaching you how they do them.\n\nHaving your manager give you a good review at the end of your internship is nice, but it isn't the only good outcome. Any other employee who ends up impressed with you at the end of the internship could end up being a great resource. When you apply to future jobs and give a reference, you don't have to give your manager - give some other senior employee who liked you. And make contacts with as many people as you can, and when you're graduating, contact all of them to ask for referrals.",

Take a look at the comments, you’re gonna see some people saying it’s unusual… And then some people saying it’s normal.\n\nAt the end of the day, I feel like it’s 50-50, and beyond that the real question is… What are you gonna do about it?\n\nIf you don’t feel like you have work… The answer is the same. Ask somebody to give you something to do. But here’s the thing… The best thing you could possibly do is make the best of the opportunity you have. As long as you do that, you’ll leave on positive terms and be able to ask for letters of recommendation in the future. That’s your end goal.\n\nSo here are some ideas… Ask someone what is the most important codebase for you to investigate? What are some fundamental principles that you can look up, if you’re interested doing that person’s job? What is a problem that the company currently has that could provide value for the company if it was solved?\n\nBe sure to let people know that they can answer this in a very high-level, simple way if they don’t have a lot of time. Let them know that you’re not trying to interfere with their daily work… But more so, you’re trying to find some things to dig into and research independently. After a while if you’re at a good internship position, they’re going to give you some more useful work… but if you’re at a bad place, this is going to be all you get. Either way, though, if you take this approach, everyone will know that you tried, and you would have documented evidence that you asked C questions and got Y answers. Document everything (your questions, the answers, and the research/work you did), and write up report from your internship. Save it somewhere. Memorize a 30 second breakdown of what you did. If you do this, it won’t matter if you have three bad internships. You will seem more prepared, and experienced, than 90% of all candidates for other jobs. The real skill to legitimately learn and to genuinely get jobs is to:\n\n1. Do your best, genuinely.\n2. Document what you did, at every place on your résumé.\n3. Create a logical and truthful story about what you learned..\n4. Always learn, at every position, even if you’re learning about what not to do (pay special attention to proactively investigating how you can provide value… and managing yourself in a way that provides value to the company).\n\nYou can do all of this systematically no matter what anyone else does. You don’t have to be a genius, and you don’t have to become a rockstar. All you have to do is to provide documentation that you work hard and are willing to reasonably spend your paid time, focusing on providing value for the people that pay you (if at all possible).\n\nThe worst thing you should say about the company is, “Even though I had very little guidance, I was able to spend company time improving documentation [something you were told was important] and learning about [something you proactively researched]”\n\nYou should always be looking for how this internship can provide value for you. If someone helps you provide value for the company, great! But if no one is giving you work to do, make sure you get what you need from that opportunity. This could impact how much money you make (10k-20k+ a year)… or it could impact if you get a good entry-level position.\n\nI purposely did not respond in a way that had anything to do with, how to make the company act differently. Because this is something you cannot control… You should focus on how you can behave in a way that would set you up for success no matter how the company behaves. You want to optimize for the best future for yourself.",

It was fun but I sucked so bad that they laid me off 5 months in!  \n  \nFrom July 2024 until October 2025 I worked my butt off teaching myself how to code. I worked a few small contracts, contributed to open source, and made a ton of friends in tech by going to local meetups and occasional conferences (got in for free either through volunteering or finding people who were giving away tickets). This past October I landed an offer and have been working as a full time SWE.\n\nThe market absolutely sucks and it took me over a year just to find a role but the main thing I did was stay in community to help encourage me when I felt like throwing in the towel.

I see people telling you tot need to apply to 1000-1500 jobs. That’s not quite accurate. There’s some randomness to it all. The more you apply, the more you have a chance for finding something that aligns with you. But it’s not a guarantee, and some people luck out and find something sooner. \n- People are really bad with perspective. There’s nothing wrong with what you wrote about yourself, but there’s an issue of scale and perspective. How do you compare to all the other people currently looking? There’s no way to answer that, but it can be hard to stand out from the crowd. There will be a lot of people with similar backgrounds, better backgrounds, and worse backgrounds. You can’t control much except making yourself a better candidate and trying to give yourself as many opportunities as possible. \n\nAnyway, you have to just understand that rejection is a part of life, and it’s a part of the job search process. That’s easier said than done. \n\nRegarding false certainty, that’s just part of life. There is just a lot of uncertainty in life. If you’re a sports fan, there’s uncertainty in the outcome of a game. There’s what likely will happen, but no guarantee. Some don’t watch because of anxiety. Others watch and let the result really impact them, and others watch and move on with their lives. You could probably do fine in a lot of roles at a lot of companies. So can a lot of other people.",

Went from working at a minimum wage dev sweatshop to making almost 300k in a few years. Unfortunately those boom days are gone, but it is still not impossible.\n\nMy first recommendation is find a dev sweatshop and see if you can break in this way. You’ll get bent on the hours and make about the minimum wages, but it may open some doors for you.\n\nI also got a friend who is (hopefully) still in process of breaking in last year from working as a dev in startup, also making minimum wage in a vhcol area. His work experience was also horrid with years of wastes, but he made some very interesting projects that I believe impressed the startup folks to giving him a shot.\n\nNo sugarcoating but it is a lot of hard work, grit, and luck. Be willing to do anything and move anywhere, even at a minimum wage.. personally I had gave it all a go with a hard one year deadline of make it or try something else.\n\nGood luck",

What you need is visible proof you can ship, like a real app or something, so that website idea could be cool, if you actually do it.  \n  \nI think realistically your best options are SWE-adjacent roles (QA automation, DevOps junior roles, support/production engineering, data analysis with SQL and dashboards), government or university tech jobs, or small freelance or contract work.   \n  \nAs for the gap, don't hide it, just acknowledge it, explain it without drama, and then immediately talk about recent work that proves you can actually be taken seriously and be trusted, not someone literally did nothing for years.  \n  \nI know I'm being kind of mean, but I really do think you got this IF you start today and work seriously for a year.

You’re also building a stronger connection to your team by acting as their go-to, this will help down the road when you find yourself looking for another job. \n\nRe: boss being too busy. I was once in the exact same position and looking back I was filled with hate, frustration, stress and resentment for him. Now? I was probably 90% of the problem. Everything was new to me and the moment a project would come across my desk I’d reach out to him and expect him to have an answer. This still cringes me out to this day. \n\nHere’s what I’ve learned now: Their job isn’t to just hand you the answer it’s to mentor you. Are you doing everything on your part to make it easier for him to give you the help you need? [This](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/asking-right-questions/) is a great resource to make sure you’re asking questions the right way. Chances are he wants you to at least try to solution something on your own otherwise you’re not strengthening your own problem solving skills.\n\nOne last note is that at least this is the worst it’ll ever be. Work will get easier no matter what so long as you’re actually learning while building these projects out. You’ll get faster, enjoy the work more, etc…",

This also goes for job titles: junior software engineer roles will have a considerably higher lower limit to their salary range than an IT support role generally.  I’ve known people from my undergraduate institution that have published multiple papers and done multiple internships as well as people who did basically just their coursework.  This is the biggest toss up though, since I’ve seen people from both cohorts accept offers in the $50k-$60k range as well as the $100k+ range fresh after graduating.  To put it plainly, a good lower limit is a bit more than what you need to live off of.  I say that because your experience is what will get you a higher salary in a few years when you apply for another job, and as a fresh grad it’s not always in your best interest to be picky.

It could be a number of things, but from what I've heard from some people who burnt out and similar to you, they just slowly stopped caring anymore. It's usually 1 of 2 things, either you had clear goals in life and are finding yourself not getting closer to them, or you were constantly under some ethereal pressure to always deliver and been told what you were doing mattered -- but it really didn't.\n\nIn the first case, it usually manifests in the form of a midlife crisis i.e. realizing you're not where you want to be and your life's almost over, which you sound young enough and are on a decent trajectory (gf + social circle/gym) to not be applicable to.\n\nThe second case is clear overworking, I'm talking like 70-100 hours a week for years which doesn't seem like your case.\n\nThen lastly, there's also a sort of mix of the two in high-achieving younger folk I've noticed in recent years. Those who were mostly successful in life and then landed great gigs out of uni, constantly being told they're delivering mission critical things and are a part of something bigger. After a few years, you start to realize, if you took some PTO, missed some deliverables or just straight stopped working for more than 1 hour a day like yourself, nothing really bad happens. Work moves on, your company and coworkers move on, and really nothing you do is that critical to the business. For most, this is OK, but if you made it a part of your personality for the past 5-20 years of your life, then it could cause this divergence/burnout you're experiencing.\n\nPersonally speaking, I was never really an early overachiever but knew a few in the Bay Area who skyrocketed their schooling/careers really fast and burnt out hard. I don't really have advice but it seemed like those who went through it had to soul search for a long time to get out of it (some became NEETs or worked in unrelated jobs for a few years), or just switched and coasted at a smaller company until they shifted their perspective or found something they cared about.",

Consider discussing your responsibilities, expectations, or a potential transfer to a less demanding team with your manager. Prioritize the preservation of your energy, not solely your time. Additionally, therapy can be highly beneficial in addressing this type of burnout.\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable to desire a less demanding lifestyle.

But the reality is that no matter how wonderful software engineering is, it's a job which someone pays you for, and that comes with pressures and trade-offs to meet them.\n\n\nIf it helps: anecdotally, my work has become far more interesting and far less monotonous as I've gotten more senior. When I was a junior, I was handed a lot of \"boring\" jobs too (documentation, bug fixing, maintenance, adding tests). That's not a mark of disrespect; it's just that in terms of cost efficiency and skill set, it makes sense to push the senior people into working the more complex problems, so boring tasks get handed down. It's all part of the process, and you'll come out better for it. In not too long, it'll be you handing those tasks over to juniors.\n\n\nAs for advice: during the boring time in my career, I did a lot of side hobby project stuff in my spare time to satisfy that intellectual stimulation. And that overall was really good for my development since it meant I got some exposure to concepts and fields outside my main job. Maybe this is good time for you for that too?",

It had a few questions I had to write single lines of code to solve for something and it just needed to work to move on.Nothing daunting. But what stuck out was the fill in the blank portions. Essentially what looked like a Java class  with single words missing throughout it. Except it was kind of gibberish. Some Keywords and imported libraries I never heard of. At first I was panicking thinking \"shit am I supposed to know all these obscure things? I've never seen these nor have any idea what they're used for \".  But then after reading through the lines you were just supposed to rationale how things worked.  Like a type for a variable is blank but you can see the method setting it is returning Foo. And then the last blank was some class that  was the only import not used yet. Some were more challenging. But it seemed more practical like when you're actually walking through code trying to mentally put together how everything works. Idk if this is more common than I'm aware of but in the past I've always had miserable overly complex live coding assements usually with some ass hat who keeps telling me to talk him through what I'm doing when I'm trying to mentally work through it. As though waiting 20 minutes until I've actually finished to talk through my solution is just unfathomable.",

The goal is to reduce the amount of time they have to have their paid engineers spend with shit candidates so any filter to eliminate the incapable is good in their eyes. That's the reason companies are doing this. I don't think it's a particularly good solution, but the rationale makes sense in our field given the utter lack of a unified exam and licensing system like other professions and engineering fields have.\n\nDoes it make sense that we have to go through multiple full day onsite interviews with multiple different companies whenever we do interviewing rounds?  No, it's terrible for us as candidates. What I want is one trusted testing organization where I can do a 6 hour interview on site once or every X years and have every company accept the results.

Platforms like Twill or Hired tend to work better for mid-level folks since you're not competing with 500 other applicants on the same posting.\n\nStart grinding leetcode again like now though.

Anyone who says the job market is fine is smoking something, but there are still some companies hiring, and I'd wager that new year new budgets new headcount is a thing.\n\nWhere I've seen hiring is in the startup world. Big companies are all up their own ass about AI this and that, but the startup world still needs actual people.\n\nI'd say the same is true for some defense companies because their pockets are typically so deep that they will still hire people to build stuff.\n\nAs for answers to your questions, I don't have any specifics, sorry. As for projects, I've put together some projects that had practical use and would be worth talking about. \n\nOne idea was a file conversion script that could take medical imaging files (from ultrasounds, MRI, CT scans, etc.) and convert them into something actually usable by a normal person like a jpg/png. That took some thinking, but it's a good learning experience. Motivation for this one was personal experience in how godawful most of those systems are and how inconvenient it is for you, the patient, to see your own images.\n\nAnother idea, albeit small, was to implement some of the common file compression algorithms and essentially make my own version of WinZip. There are a few \"easy\" ways to do it, but there are some way fancier methods out there that I found worth exploring.",

Maybe build something that showcases streaming data processing with Pub/Sub and Dataflow - like a real-time analytics dashboard for crypto prices or weather data, something you can demo live during interviews. 8-12 weeks is tight but doable if you split time between leetcode (maybe 30%), system design focused on data pipelines (40%), and building that one solid project (30%).

Doing some tinkering with AWS and getting familiar with their primitives would probably be one of the most impactful things you can do to increase your value in the job market, since it'll naturally open you up to lots more companies/stacks.\n\nSome thoughts inline for your other questions:\n\n> If you took a break or had a gap, what helped you come back and get hired?\n\nGet your story straight. Ideally, both your internal story (for yourself, what you wanted out of it, what you ended up getting) as well as your public story.\n\nBut if you can only do one, get the public story *concise* and have the elevator pitch ready to deliver when the inevitable question comes up in the interview. You want 1-2 polished sentences about why you took the time off, what you accomplished, and how you're thinking about your return to full-time work.\n\nPractice telling the story, over and over, until it sounds natural.\n\n> Should I focus on DE roles again or pivot to backend/SWE?\n\nRemember that you also need to like the job you end up getting. ;) It's okay to focus, especially initially.\n\nIf you do end up going for general backend/SWE roles, make sure to have different version(s) of your resume for those roles.\n\n> What’s a realistic plan for the next 8–12 weeks that actually improves interview outcomes?\n\nOne underrated tool is mock interviews. Hire paid, experienced mock interviewers that actually have work and interview experience at the kinds of companies you want to join.\n\nSchedule at least one mock interview every couple weeks. That way, you're getting *real* feedback every couple weeks with specific guidance on what to work on.\n\nFor me, right before my real interview, I also then loaded up one last wave of mock interviews to get in a bunch more practice.\n\nIt gets expensive, but you should be able to make back everything (and more) with your signing bonus.\n\n> What do recruiters/hiring managers in India care about most when they see a 6 month gap?\n\nOops... my advice is from experience in the US. Adjust accordingly. :)\n\n> Any suggestions for 1–2 “resume-worthy” projects that are actually useful (not a toy) and can be finished quickly?\n\nPaying for a training or a course certificate *from an actual credible source* can be a nice bullet point. It shows you're willing to invest in yourself, literally, and it shows you can learn on your own.\n\nGood luck! And don't beat yourself up about taking a break. It's *very* common. Professional athletes prioritize their rest days and rest weeks. It's totally okay for you to take care of yourself and prioritize rest in the same way.",

BUT if you're losing your coding skills from stress/burnout, it might actually be worth it just to have structure and forced learning time. plus the internship angle is smart - some companies have way lower bars for interns than junior hires which is backwards but whatever.\n\nhonestly though, skip the mass applying thing for a bit. you're burning yourself out and it's not working anyway. spend like 2 weeks just coding again - build something you actually want to use, not a todo app. then start reaching out to actual humans instead of application black holes.\n\nalso try some of the referral-based platforms like Wellfound or Twill where you're not competing with 1000 other resumes in a pile. the bar is still high but at least someone looks at your stuff.\n\nthe coding skills thing is real though - if you feel rusty, you probably are. fix that first before you interview anywhere good.",

When it comes to Front End work items on our board in DevOps, I am usually the one that gets handed these types of tickets since front end work is pretty much straightforward and self explanatory. \n\n“Self-sufficient, don’t need handholding” — I’ve noticed probably within the past 4 months that for this portion I am starting to be more self sufficient, but occasionally I do need support or guidance getting through the work item. For instance, I had to edit a table (database migration for C#) on one of our database tables for an application that we are in the midst of building and kind of got lost. I had to nudge one of our lead developers for some assistance, but I still occasionally do need help with more difficult problems that I sometimes run into. \n\n“Can own features end-to-end” — for this specific point, this is NOT true with me. If you really do own features end to end I expect these to be more front end feature work items, but not back end stuff. I struggle with back end work items immensely. Correct me if I am wrong please!!!\n\n“Collaborate with other teams on system design and write ADRs” — At my company, we really don’t have “ADRs”. Sure we understand the things we work on, but my company is so small that having things like this does not really benefit us. For bigger companies I could definitely see the benefit of this. My coworker who has been doing Software Engineering for 15 years wrote up the architecture design documents and database schema for a new application we are releasing soon about 6 months ago. He knew EXACTLY how to get it done, how long it would take, and how hard it would be. That’s something I totally expect from someone with that much experience. \n\nIt also depends heavily on the work place you are at. Especially what you work on, how difficult it is, and if you are learning new things. \n\nI would say that from what you said in your post and comparing where I am at, we are probably in a similar spot. Now I don’t know how much you make, but I expect the next job you get (hopefully for me too) you will make substantially more. \n\nWhat I would work on for improving your knowledge is maybe look at more back end specific problems. I am currently working on a full stack application that calls a local database and uses REST to grab information from said database. I had a coworker who moved on to bigger and better things that told me back end development is where the big money is at. If you can understand that more, you will do great!",

And all my friends who stayed put, were turning into degenerates, getting hit hard by the opiate crisis, drinking, partying, etc. All the friends I respected moved to cool cities, were enjoying their life. I made a bad choice.\n\nI remember being alone in my apartment after college missing the chaos of my roommates and crying because I was so bored and lonely and nothing felt right. The girl I loved was still in school and she cheated one me, I had a lot of decision paralysis on what I could even do on my free time. Nothing felt good.\n\nSo I researched \"Best cities to live in your 20s\" (this was 2015 mind you) and Denver popped up. I love outdoor activites, and wanted a city center where I could make friends. I wanted a fresh start. Most importantly, I did have an uncle who lived in a suburb there, and 1 single friend I could hangout with. It wasn't much, but it was enough of a safety net for me to take the leap.\n\nI changed my linkedin and resume address to say Denver.\n\nI got picked up by a recruiter, and they flew me out to a job in Denver for an interview. The culture was warm and chill, in a cool place, laid back, not overly corporate.  It had plenty of other fresh grads, I could hangout with them.  Beers in the fridge. End at 3:30 on friday and have some beers with my coworkers on other teams. I took a pay hit. Man I miss those days of pre-covid.\n\nOffice cultures vary dramatically from office to office. Sounds like you have a shitty one.\n\nAnd it was so chill I'm still there today, even though I did switch teams. I also found my wife in this city.\n\nEveryone has different needs. Hopefully my story helps.\n\nSadly it's a lot harder to land new jobs than it was in 2015. I'm currently shocked by this. But maybe you can investigate a similar approach that I took.\n\nEDITED a bit to add more context",

I'd like to get back soon though. \n\nThis all depends on your circumstances, if you have friends and family to fall back on, you don't mind selling your home or moving, whether you have a family of your own that depends on you etc. \n\nWhen I was laid off a few years back I went into panic mode and landed plenty of interviews, I knew one manager who could tell I was a bit stressed. He interviewed me and offered me a position with no questions asked. I worked at that job for six months and learned it really wasn't for me and we parted ways. \n\nI took a step back and realized I had plenty of money in savings and also realized I didn't really want to work at that moment. I don't recommend just taking any job out of desperation if you can avoid it. I'm using my time off to relax, reflect, and become an even better developer.\n\nI feel for people with families and quality of life that needs to be maintained, I feel for people who go through this with a mortgage or health issues (I personally had to get on Medicaid when I lost my insurance). In those cases take whatever is on the table until something better comes along. I had interviews lined up within weeks when I was in panic mode. Now that I'm calm I can pick and choose roles that interest me. \n\nJust one thing to mention though about mental health, software development is a rapidly changing, confusing, and mentally taxing field. Going through a layoff in this field takes a toll on everyone, doesn't matter who you are. Try to stay positive and realize it's not your fault, you're just modernizing. You're not useless or undervalued, and you don't lack skill. You will make a comeback in this field. Take the high salary they'll give you in your next position and make sure to save enough for the inevitable rainy day, do this until you're six feet under or computers cease to exist.",

Microsoft took some plain TS but I saw more positions for CI and FS.\n\nAlso not sure where you want to end up, but if you go to the east coast it’s not too hard to find a company willing to pay over $200k with a FS and couple years of experience.",

I might've had a task like \"make bulk purchase orders from sales orders\" or something like that, and before I could even *begin* to think about creating a button to automate that, I'd be thinking \"what was a purchase order again? Who receives that and who gives that? Does that go from vendor to company? Or company to customer? What's the significance of this in the business process?\"\n\nThe loops, conditional statements, SQL and variable fields were the easier parts of the job. But understanding why I'm doing what I'm doing was hard, and it made completing a task a much more monumental task than for the average business-knowledgeable person. And part of the job was scoping business requirements of clients, and providing advice for how to improve how they do things to have better utilization of the software product. 💀 So you can imagine how tough that was, when I have a surface-level \"i just Googled this term\" knowledge base. \n\nI remember my manager training me on how to set up a customer portal or a web form and in my head I'm thinking \"what are these? What is the point of these?\" My manager wouldn't cover that preliminary background knowledge, but would be covering how to implement it. I'd be too afraid to ask \"why?\" directly because I didn't want my manager to think negatively of me. I'd try to broach the topic by dancing around it with tangential questions, but I think my manager picked up on it and gave me feedback that I was asking too many common sense questions. 😢\n\n>I've been an engineer for over 10 years from minimum wage at start-ups to $400k at big tech. I don't know what those things are either.\n\n  \nOh wow, so I guess it isn't necessary as a software engineer? My mom has been telling me to avoid client-facing jobs and do software jobs that are just me talking with people *within* the company. Maybe that's the move for me... but maybe one day I'd like to try being in a client-facing technical role (like Solutions Engineer) one day. Out of curiosity have you worked for a company that was in a business-related industry? Like Stripe, Paypal, Shopify, Salesforce etc? Does it hold you back there? I thought you'd need to know more about the business concepts to create new features or product changes for those kinds of companies.",

I billed them $500+ USD for this but not before giving them an estimate and plan. \n\nSo OP, it’s criminal that your assessment is not paid. And as others have mentioned, even if you’ve done it, it’s not guaranteed that they will read, test and give feedback. And it will break you mentally after learning and building something so intensively just to get ghosted. \n\nFYI, I did pass mine and got an offer, as well as feedback after the assessment. Which is the best case scenario, paid intense work, feedback + offer. Also for context, this assessment is requested after 3 rounds of interviews.\n\nI do not recommend you taking the assessment because you’re technically not in the interview loop yet, and your worse case scenario is unpaid intense work (and not sure if you’ve done it properly since it’s your first time), no offer + no feedback.

They're also the ones who can keep your name around for future consideration if you don't get hired, which _you very much want_. Most people I knew at Google failed their first hiring attempt but were contacted again later because their names were on file and passed later rounds.\n\n\nNot all of them are great.

How is a language a skill, then you list all the rest of it and I can’t tell if you’ve just copied a list of buzzwords online. How skilled are you at using any of that? What’s your level of exposure and proficiency in all of that? \n\nfinally, it’s best practice where I am to put your most recent job first then old jobs afterwards. So you’re supposed to lead with your most current experience which should obviously be your strongest experience ie they can see a sense of progression from where you are now vs before. Instead I’m not seeing any progression on your CV, you’ve actually added more bullets on your oldest job than your newest job? That makes me think your newest job is a downgrade as you’re not working on things worth writing about. \n\nPlus you’re listing a bunch of tasks but I can’t see where you added value or what you did well or anything that makes you better than another candidate. Even in your education you’ve given no context as to what you actually studied- not all degree programs cover the same content. What did u study that specifically is relevant to the job?

Does this prevent me from completing my work?\n2. Has this person maligned or impugned me personally and directly?\n3. Has this person's actions impeded the project in an objectively measurable way?\n\nIf the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you need to speak to your manager. And if you are going to assert #3, then you better have the goods. Otherwise, if the answer is no, then you need to focus on your own work find ways to accept and deal with the fact that other engineers will do things and behave in ways that you don't like.",

You should think of college as your part time job and what you do outside of it as your main job to really bolster your chances to get a job once you graduate.\n\nIf it sounds like a lot it's because it is, but it's a lot easier than being unemployed for 2+ years after graduating which is what's starting to become standard.

You're likely to get probed about it so it's best to be prepared. Technical-wise, focus on LeetCode mediums and understand the time/space complexity like the back of your hand. For implementation rounds, practice writing clean, testable code quickly; it personally helped me to time myelf while coding to sort of simulate what I'd encounter during interviews. I also recommend checking out [company-specific interview guides](https://www.interviewquery.com/companies), since some companies focus more on certain rounds like system design while others are more holistic with how they review your performance. Good luck!",

        "body": "Part of my job is mentoring the Team and Tech leads that report to me. A couple of them are 15+ years my senior, and just ended up \"stuck\" at that level. Both of these guys are very smart, great developers, and good mentors to the Junior and Senior engineers on their teams. Their problem is the same thing I've seen skilled developers fall prey to over and over again throughout my career: lack of understanding of the business impact of their job.\n\nYou likely have seen this as you've done Product Owner/Manager roles, so you're already ahead of the game. At the end of the day, though, lots of developers don't want to think about what they are doing in the context of the business, either because they just want to focus on the how and not the why, or because they are afraid of dealing with something that isn't as clean and clear-cut as solving a technical problem. Both of these Leads at my company have these sentiments, despite them understanding that they need to do more.\n\nThe thing that helped me advance in my career and make sure never to stagnate, was to develop the business skills that helped me understand just how my work as a developer directly impacted the business. It helped me understand what to focus on, how to prioritize work that got the most impact internally and externally, and how to communicate critical needs to business stakeholders, especially in the form of long term support in favor of building tons of shiny new features as fast as possible.\n\nThose skills have proven to be transferable in a way that mastery of a specific language or framework simply haven't. I was stuck as a JavaScript dev for the first 8 years of my career, despite moving into a Team Lead role, because I wasn't focusing on the business problems as a whole and instead acted as the tool used to implement a solution someone else came up with. It was in this role that I started to be exposed to the larger discussions around what we were building, and why, which helped me realize that if I added my own voice to the conversation, I could influence what was happening and be seen as much more valuable than a simple code monkey.\n\nThis helped me pivot to other languages and frameworks, including hopping from entirely Node/Vue.js as my stack to .NET/React with no real experience in either. I could understand the business reasons for why decisions were being made, which convinced my soon to be boss to hire me and take the chance that I could get up to speed on their stack in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nNow that I am in management, I use those skills constantly, but I still actively try to code in my spare time. For this, AI has been immensely helpful! I use Claude Code daily, whether its for doing the bulk of the super basic coding that I'd probably have done with snippets anyways while I handle the complex business logic, or having it explain the codebases I have access to but don't work in and still need to help make technical decisions for. I basically treat Claude as a pocket engineer who never needs to sleep, gets way too eager and excited and sometimes needs to be reigned in, but is still clever and helpful. I've used it to help me build fully custom applications specific to my company, Claude API cloud agents that help my engineers debug their work completely autonomously, and basically just manage my day to day work life.\n\nAll of this is to say that you can still work on the things you are good at, enjoy doing, and still be a coveted asset companies would fight to have. Embrace AI as a way to level up the skills you already have and fill in the gaps you're missing. If you use it as a crutch while you're learning the strategic thinking required to lead a technology company, even if you have no desire to be a CTO/CEO, you'll be able to navigate this new AI powered world while still doing what you love. You don't have to go into management to influence the direction of a company either. Prove your ability to think tactically and with an understanding of the business' goals, and you'll have no problems finding a job well into the future.",

This is obviously easier if you are part of an organization with a product team, but there are always stakeholders in every project. Instead of sitting back and being assigned work, ask why that decision was made. Play the junior card and your desire to learn, you'd be surprised just how many people get excited to explain why they have made a decision. Ask to shadow the discussion with stakeholders, then debrief with the other members of your team. \n\nIts important to remember that this is going to be extra work outside of your normal responsibilities, so you still need to get all of your work done or else you can lose peoples' trust. But the skill of learning from people more experienced and rapidly absorbing new knowledge is critical to succeeding long term as a software developer.\n\nAlso, use AI as a coach. Even if you aren't allowed to use AI at work, you can still generally get away with telling it roughly the feature/functionality/application you and your team are building, the context of your company, and relevant tech stacks, then have it explain what it thinks are the likely business decisions. Then take that to the people involved in deciding the work that's been done and explain \"your thoughts\" and see how they line up. If you are allowed to use AI at work, instead of using it as a fancy auto-complete try to use it as a pair programming coach and have it explain why decisions and patterns may have been used. All this needs to be done with a healthy understanding that the AI very likely could be wrong, but at least it gives you a jumping off point to go confirm with somene who knows.",

At a more senior level, you should have the knowledge and skills to be able to look at an abstract problem and implement a robust solution. The key here is that often times engineers with those skills still act like more junior devs, simply taking orders and doing things how they are always done at the company. \n\nThis is where you can approach these discussions from your side. Instead of simply taking orders, insert yourself into stakeholder discussions and talk through what they are looking for and give options on how to build what they want. You'll have to come prepared with the ability to explain what you want to implement at a level that less/non-technical people can understand. But if you keep showing up with good solutions on how to implement what people want, and can deliver on that implementation, you'll start to get invited to more and more of these discussions. \n\nAlso, use AI to brainstorm and propose new design patterns for features. There's always the caveat that AI can very likely be wrong, but its a good jumping off point. Since you're new to it, just treat it like a conversation with another developer. Tell the agent when its wrong or has made a mistake and constantly give it new context. Ask it how you can improve the information you're giving it to help it come up with better answers. I am constantly getting better at working with AI agents, because I just throw problems at it and see what works. It seems kind of silly to think of it as a skill, but you really do get better working with them simply by putting in the time. I pay for the $100/month Claude Max plan and find it incredibly worth it, because I can have an idea and blitz my way through a rough implementation and decide if its worth pursuing, while also getting better at working with the agent, all in my personal time. At work, I am lucky enough to have the budget to spend a fairly sizable amount of money on Claude API tokens, primarily because I have proven the value of it to my boss, but I wouldn't have gotten there if I hadn't been experimenting on fun personal projects like my homelab server, custom websites and webapps for little hobby projects, and a healthy chunk of home automation.\n\nAs far as resources go, one of the best books I was introduced to by a college professor of mine is called The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. It may be about building a startup, but the skills are extremely transferable to existing companies. Every single business needs to spend resources efficiently to survive, and understanding where you can deliver value the most is key to success. \n\nAlso, I very recently discovered Lenny's Newsletter, which is a site with an enormous amount of content around Product development, Engineering, and how leaders in the AI space use AI to run their businesses and professional lives. I've just started digging into it, but its been really eye opening on how I have just been scratching the surface of using AI, and I already have several fully custom AI tools in use that I build explicitly to help me manage my teams at work.",
