Maybe a simple always on RPC service is a better fit here. Extremely simple, totally reasonable for thousands of requests per day.

You run models and try to get insights. It is very often the case though that the data either doesn't show what you would like, or it kind of does, but with pretty low certainty. Even more often the data is so bad that you couldn't really draw any conclusions from it.\n\nThis puts you in a bind. You have to go explain your conclusions to the sales guys and they can't work with 'it sort of shows X, but also kind of Y'. They need to sell a product and they will. So they'll massage your conclusions in ways that you might even not agree with. Or you'll be pressured to massage the data, which I've been asked to do. I always covered my ass with emails although I luckily never needed them.\n\nAs a Data Engineer on the other hand, there is no discussion. Either the data is in the required spot in the required form or it isn't. At the end of the day, your product is finished and whether or not someone can actually do anything with it downstream is not your concern. It's a very liberating feeling and it means I have barely any stress related to work.\n\nI'm not the only person I've encountered who feels similarly and I've even met a few Data Scientists who made a similar switch later in their career for similar reasons.\n\nAnother saving grace is that Data Scientists are a dime in a dozen nowadays. With the AI boom everyone and their cat tried to get some certification somewhere and the quality varies wildly. Data engineering isn't as sexy and there's much fewer people in the field I have the impression. I started before the AI boom, so having seniority at this point in time is very helpful as well.",

I naturally gravitated towards technical specifications and engineering solutions.  I was interested in maths, but having done some statistics courses, it wasn’t a mountain I wanted to climb.\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t over think it.  People swap between DS and DE all the time.  A large company will probably help you transition, pay for training etc because they know there is a great deal of synergy between these teams.  ie.  DE’s will productionise DS models so knowing both sides isn’t a waste of time.\n\nWhere I currently work, DS is seen as a ‘luxury’.  They will increase headcount when times are good, and conversely, DS’s are the first people out the door when times are bad.  This is because they generally work on ‘optimisations’, I guess just like how you would pause remodelling your house if you lost your job and didn’t have income coming in.  DE on the other hand is much more stable.  They need people to keep existing pipelines running, even if new things aren’t being built.  It was how I ended up in DE, I was made redundant as a DS but told I could stay on if I switched teams.  I thought I’d do this while I searched for a new DS position, but I found my proclivities more suited to DE, so never left and never thought about switching back.\n\nGenerally the people who make the best DE’s have done Computer Science or Engineering degrees that involve data transfers like Telecoms.  The people who make the best DS’s have done Science or Mathematics degrees.  Maybe start out in the field where your degree gives you the best foundations?  Otherwise it will be an uphill struggle to get timely promotions.  Make a start and see how you go.",

Currently I'm the only data engineer in a data science team so my work revolves around data science. \n\nBiggest difference :\n- Data science requires creativity. Lot of A/B tests to see what works and what does not. Something could sound efficient on paper but not as much in business. Experimentation is important in data science.\n\n- Less focus on infrastructure as a data scientist. ML ops or data ops takes care of it most times.\n\n- Accuracy is important in data engineering. Data needs to be ingested and modelled accurately otherwise the data is doubted. Data quality and data sanity are important. Work and what pipelines to design is very much defined by requirements and business. There isn't experimentation.",

If it generates enough business value that you'd carry on (perhaps putting in place a migration plan) - then it's probably fine as a choice. If you're so cost sensitive that a small rise in costs would cause problems, then it's probably not the right choice.\n\nGenerally being heavily invested into Snowflake doesn't concern me too much. Most of the transformation logic is SQL. Unlike say python, or a lot of proprietary solutions SQL code written today will still be good in 20 years time. There aren't any libraries to end up unmaintained. If you *really* need to you can port to another database technology and most of your transformations will port over perfectly. You might need to spin up a solution for tasks, and change your ingestion methodology, but all that business logic will be fine still.\n\nUnless you go completely open source, and want to take on board the substantial overhead with doing that, I'd say it's pretty good value. Vendor lock in mainly comes from the fact that it's really good, rather than vendor lock in from being proprietary. Very little of it is highly proprietary unlike a lot of other ETL methodologies.\n\nWhy aren't you at least using internal stages? There's far less overhead in using COPY INTO vs INSERT unless you're inserting a trivial amount of data. External stages and pipes even less overhead and cost.",

Databricks has this AI-powered coding assistant called Databricks Assistant which can help your data analysts with SQL or Python syntax should they need it.\n\nIf any of your software devs (or data scientist turned software engineer) are required to build web applications, there is Databricks Apps to let you build a web app based on popular frameworks like Flask/Streamlit or even NodeJS. Lakebase can also help if you need low-latency OLTP database for your web app.\n\nYou can also open up Databricks to your business users, business stakeholders, or C-level to let them ask questions about data using Genie or to let them view dashboards. If those business users accessing Databricks directly, you can minimize the array of menu down using an access control called Permissions.

        "body": "SCD2 is built into the table schema, the code base is based on Merge or UpSert + delete tracking.\n\nI suggest you look at \"Timestamp\" column type if available on your platform, or look into MD5() function which is quite universal, to do \"hashing\" of data, and use a staging layer.\n\nWhen you design properly a SCD2 table in a bronze layer, and have a staging layer in a \"raw\" layer (you should always have a staging layer!) - then a SQL view with the hashed values (the PK columns, the entire data row) then SCD2 becomes a breeze to do. Breeze because you compare two tables, you have one PK column and one HashDIFF column (or TimeStamp from a source DB) that tells you easily what to do.\n\nOften it is deletion tracking the most difficult - because if you get differential data, how do you know what no longer exists in source? In such cases you need an extra pipeline logic just for delete tracking. Mentioning as this is often overlooked and it comes back to bite you at the end.\n\nFor example, you load new data (from a full source or differential source) truncate/load into a staging table. Make a view to create all the extra columns you need, like using MD5() in the view. Use the staging view to do the UpSerts or Merge based on your bronze layer SCD2 historical table and the staging. \n\nFor delete tracking sometimes you need a new pipeline to get a full from source but only the PK column(s), not all the columns, so the file is smaller and the process is quicker. I use a different staging table, a different pipeline, just for this. Or if you are lucky, you can get CDC from source DB and then you have 100% of all changes. If only we had this all the time.\n\nSo basically you read the same data twice, the first time the data are usually files in a datalake or a file share, but it could also be a remote database that you ODBC / OleDB into to run a query. This is usually for on-prem, but I have used ODBC + MySQL remote DBs to gather info, it works really well, and no ELT/ETL tool required - it's all SQL in a stored proc.\n\nSome people create in the staging table all the extra fields to manage for SCD2 and the tool they use to consume the raw data into staging, adds the values to the extra fields, row-by-row. I do NOT like this method, as it puts intelligence inside the ELT/ETL tool making it difficult to manage. An ELT/ETL tool should be simple, just do mapping, Lift & Shift, ideally never fail - just get the data to staging table(s) and let the next level deal with issues. CSV is hell on earth, I use the BLOB technique on foreign CSV files and parse with SQL.\n\nFWIW, this topic (SCD2, 3, 4, hybrid...) is taught in actual classes world wide, maybe look into taking some basic ETL/ELT & BI courses, at least Udemy. My first SCD2 table I did back in 1998 - just to give you an idea on how old this logic is, the actual invention I don't know who - but probably Kimball in the 90's. I had a great database teacher that was ahead of  his time.",

        "body": "Hi I work with Pydantic and dataclasses everyday and I think I can explain this well.\n\nPydantic - mostly used when there is any input/output that needs to be validated, a good example is let's say I want to integrate with some external service, if I have to call their endpoints with any specific payload Pydantic makes sure that my outgoing data to that service will always have these fields and I can write custom rules for a Pydantic class to enforce certain conditions. Same works for if any service decides to call my endpoints, I can stop any processing to happen if request data to my endpoint is wrong.\n\nDataclasses - used mainly for internal data transfer. An example for this is, let's say after my Pydantic validation occurs I now want to move around the fields I can set them in a dataclasses and move them around with pass by value/ reference. Now I can do this with Pydantic also but why I shouldn't. Pydantic does have an overhead when it parses the field this is very small but I've hit cases when it matters (Pydantic v2 is faster). Dataclasses are faster when I've already validated the data internal transfer is faster and makes more sense to use a dataclass when I just need to move and play around with the data. \n\nAdditional point database updates I would make a data access layer which would be validated against the schema. I use SQL alchemy here for the models some people use Pydantic here too, optional honestly. This way it makes it easier to unit test too when you abstract everything and loosely coupled. \n\nHope it clears things up!!",

I don’t mean to be rude, just being honest. I’m also really tired and about to go to sleep so. \n\nFrom I can tell, you definitely can, and sometimes want to, use pydantic to load in your api data. It will not only parse and validate it, but it can standardize your field naming too. You can do a lot of cool things with it, like use a TypeAdapter for places where you need different structures that come out of the same API. That being said, I do view it more as an OLTP type tool, it *feels* more row based. For DE tasks, I would reach for DuckDB or polars to read in the API or json data and flatten it. Really depends on your use case and data volume\n\nAs for landing your raw data and then processing it, that’s a valid way to do it IMO. Land your API responses as JSON and then process with whatever tool you pick.",

The first thing I prototype is the semantic model with a few top level KPIs and whatever is the minimum that allows them to engage with that. Usually connecting the semantic model to Excel does the trick, otherwise a bare-bones dashboard that displays just an auditable view of the KPI.\n\n\nIt's tempting to skip the data work and go straight to the dashboarding because it feels more agile to get the bells and whistles delivered, but ultimately it costs more in rework and burned credibility and clarity that it saves. It might feel heavy and unrealistic to do the modelling early, but that's because you're caught in the sugar rush of delivering good-looking, quick, but ultimately poor solutions.",

Every vendor rode that wave, and the race became who can make it easiest to build a report, but that optimizes for a symptom, not the root problem. As more people build reports, each new question gets answered by creating yet another dashboard or a slightly different metric variant, doesn't matter which tool you use because most analytics systems are designed in this way that makes duplication almost inevitable, and it's a ticking bomb because over time the whole thing collapses under its own weight.\n\nI’ve been in both setups. In one org, I basically churned out reports on request, where speed was the currency. Stakeholders loved it and tbh it made things easier when it came time to ask for a promotion because output was highly visible. But as the organization grew, the same metrics started showing different numbers across dashboards and eventually we had to go back and pay down the debt we’d accumulated. in my current org, we do the opposite where we lock metric definitions early and invest heavily in the semantic layer. This also means we have to define business logic as code and build composable metrics early on so new questions build on existing definitions instead of spawning new dashboards, new models, and new forks of truth. We also document everything btw. \n\nThis approach is much slower (and I kinda hate it sometimes), and it’s hard to get buy-in unless the company has a certain level of maturity. Governance is hard to sell when the benefits are mostly “nothing breaks” and “people argue less.” You’ll get challenged on why it takes longer, especially by stakeholders who just want a chart for next week. But long term it’s the only approach I’ve seen that consistently reduces confusion and rebuilds trust because it makes reuse the default and makes metric drift harder to happen. So it does pay off, but it takes time and in my case, a thoughtful, forward-looking boss to make it happen.",

Find that date, and show them the issues from the old data; and if you can show how much it is costing to process and keep that data, it gets easier to convince them to archive and start working towards data destruction.\n\nThe company having a data retention policy helps too, as you can tie in to the definitions there.  Even better if it is regulated data with mandated destruction timelines.\n\nBut, you have to know your numbers, and understand their needs and requirements enough to make that proposal.\n\nHonestly, old data is so seldom used that by the time data is more than 2-3 years old, (most industries, not all) only aggregates ever get used, and even those drop off quickly after 5-7 years.

Not a big deal for a small/solo project, but at scale it can introduce unintended changes if upstream schemas evolve (new columns, renamed columns, type changes) and can impact downstream models silently.\n* Your models appear to be **full refreshes** (not incremental), meaning tables are recreated on each `dbt run`. In that setup you generally don’t need: `now() as last_updated`   to track row creation/update date This information is already available through **Clickhouse** **system table** called `system.parts`.\n\nOverall: not a complete end-to-end project yet (missing orchestrator and probably lots of other bricks !), but the foundation and structure are solid, nice work setting this up !",

        "body": "After doing this for literally decades I have to say I'm a complete convert to doing as much of this work upfront via Data Contracts as possible:\n\n   * Data Contracts can define required vs optional columns, their types, their formats (ex: phone numbers with dashes), their min/max values, their min/max string lengths, their enumerated values, and their NULL rules.  That contract can be stored in a JSON structure and shared with your upstream source - and then be the basis for their testing and yours.  Nothing else will provide as much DQ guarantees as this.  And it can be a simple library call to hand over a row/file/table to a utility for checking.\n   * Anomaly-detection is also valuable to do prior to transformation:  does your input always have 10 million rows and suddenly you only have 65?  Regardless of whether the rows are formatted correctly, you probably have a partial file.  Or how about if one of those columns is historically NULL 1% of the time, and that's ok, but now it's NULL 100% of the time.  Something has changed...\n\nI like doing the above because each of these can typically work with raw data, can catch a ton of problems pre-transform, and isn't much work.  Then once you get into the transforms you'll need to do more of the above, but in that case it'll be for items you couldn't check with raw data - like joins that fail because there's suddenly no matching rows, etc.",

I'm assuming when you say pipeline, that you are talking about a data ingestion that gets incorporated into your larger existing analytical system. That matches my experience with the schema + CSV issues you are describing.\n\nEverything looking fine on the surface but more subtle, complex assumptions about the data being broken post pipeline deployment is something I've run into often. I've had varying degrees of success in trying to proactively identify issues like this. There are a few things that worked for me, particularly when the data source is an external partner. My experience is also in smaller companies where end to end analytics is entirely my responsibility and there is limited support from other colleagues. With that in mind, this kind of validation is imo a balance between getting the pipeline into production quickly and making issue identification and maintenance as easy as possible.\n\n**Before building anything / requirements and assumption refinement:**\n\n* Get all info about the data source you can\n * Ask for data dictionaries and/or entity relationship diagrams -> only commonly seen these available in finance but solves 99% of these problems before they happen\n * Figure out all your critical assumptions and ask about them explicitly (primary keys, important relationships, etc.)\n* Identify key internal stakeholder(s) that have the business context to clarify expectations\n * Who can be your point of contact for escalating + investigating issues down the line\n * Identify what aspects of the data being ingested are critical to *your own* business' processes\n     * Primary keys and most likely a subset of columns/fields rather than everything\n         * That a field exists, is an enum of X possible options, etc.\n     * Things that if your assumption about the data become wrong or broken, then the data becomes unusable or detrimental to the business\n\n**While building:**\n\n* Codify your critical assumptions\n * If these are broken pipeline FAILS -> clear alert that mentions you as pipeline owner and your internal stakeholder with a clear business-centric message\n * Subset of critical fields that must have some characteristics\n* Quarantine/identify your non-critical assumptions\n * Should NOT fail the pipeline so that business critical data can still flow\n * More of a nice to have\n * If a non-necessary or unused field starts breaking assumptions -> alert that mentions only you as pipeline owner with clear technical context, allows you to create a backlog task which can be prioritized appropriately \n\nThere's plenty you could do to abstract and reuse a lot of this functionality in whatever your ingestion/orchestration tool you are using but personally I have been unsuccessful in advocating for this internally.\n\nI am making plenty of assumptions about the latency requirements, criticality of the data to your business, and that you have some kind of semi-mature ingestion framework with alerting capabilities. This also assumes your destination tables are pre-defined with the pipeline and you aren't using some kind of lakehouse pattern which I have less experience with. There are definitely tons of options for approaches to this so I'm curious what others have to say.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss more specific tools here but tried to keep it relatively high level and already wrote an essay. Hope this helps!",

If the data is \"invalid\" by your criteria, can you drop it on the floor? If so, maybe you can validate it at parse time. But typically you try not to do that.\n\nSchema drift can be tough to solve without a lot of other metadata you need to either derive by profiling the data, OR having users or your system declare it in absolute terms. Both are tough and have complexity in it that may not be obvious to the users of that data. \n\nA pattern I've seen that did okay was to take anything that didn't fit into our target schema, we just threw it into an additional column called `invalid`. From there we can at least write some additional SQL that looks for any records that contain something within `invalid`.\n\nAt the very least this would provide you (or whoever is using your ingested data) the knowledge that _something has changed_, without knowing exactly what. Which in our case, is usually more than enough info to address what schema drift has taken place.",

But from there what I had to do was have the SDK attached to the API and both the API & SDK just share the same DB instance and pass the code instance around. But if I couldn't do this, one thing I could do is create an http wrapper to allow for outside requests to hit the DB (sort of like a lightweight API around the DB server) with all the same auth and stuff of course. But... this gets impractical sometimes. Again this only works for one instance though, it's not practical for multiple instances. So beyond that it may be worth exploring other options as others have mentioned. But just my thoughts though.",

And if there's no one who knows how to design/build/manage a BI layer, it's also bound to get messy over time.\n\nThe thing is, if you only have bad reports, that's what the business will make decisions on. That and whatever they can come up with on their spreadsheets and side/shadow controls. I have no way to say I'd this is a minor issue or a huge risk, it may well be that the BI Eng who was laid off got enough working that the core operation is covered, and you'd only miss some opportunities. There are so many ways that BI can generate value, and so many ways it can be useless that it's impossible to say what your case is.\n\nYou do have the right gut feeling, but there's little hope of fixing the issue(s) without proper ownership and knowledge. From what you described, it looks like you don't even have someone who knows how to get BI requirements right. For example, if someone comes asking for a report on how many cars and how much spaghetti, you don't throw it as a ticket into the backlog - you ask about the decisions they're making, how the relationships between these things work, what's the desired outcome, how they'll use the information, along with frequency, level of detail, quality and possibly what other questions (at least what data domains) we're talking about. After that, you have to determine where this data is (and it might not be anywhere), how to source it, how to structure it for the specific kind(s) of analysis and decision they want to make, and then you have to figure out how that relates to the rest of the data model you already have. And then you may be able to build something.\n\nEven skipping half of what I described, you can't escape some of it, and you need to know what you're doing. You also need ownership from the business, because this will need to be operated and maintained, and that comes with a cost. If there's no ownership, maybe on one wants that cost.\n\nBasically, start by finding someone who can explain why this matters, and then see if they can put enough value on it to justify the DE position. Just remember that, if you start asking questions, people may assume you're taking ownership. If you think that's a career move or a problem, I also don't know for sure.",

Then redesign just that slice into a small constellation: 1 fact, a few dimensions, and a clear SCD strategy. Ship and validate that before touching the rest.\n\n\n\nI’ve used dbt plus views in Snowflake and, in another shop, Fabric Warehouse with Power BI and DreamFactory to expose the cleaned model as read-only APIs for app teams, but the big win was always the same: shrink the blast radius and refactor one subject area at a time, never the whole estate in one go.",

Run the job only if the last modified timestamp is within a prefixed duration like CURRENT\\_DATE()-7 or so whatever based on business cases.  e,g, INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.TABLES etc\n2. Use the INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.TABLES to either limit scanning to particular partitions ( if datetime columns are present). E.g. if upstream did not update in the last 3 days you are good scanning only the last known updated partition instead of full deals.\n3. See a way is the test scripts can be written in a better way. Maybe instead of scanning the entire table scan last paritions etc . Can you avoid hourly and just run it once per day ? E..g if the ingestion is not happening hourly there is no point running them hourly etc. understand the data better and workflow. \n4. Better awareness among the org and your peer group to cross check parameters, timings, query writing. E.g I know a lot queries are just copied pasted from the UI ( which are always written in a quick fix way as exploration) and then they are pasted as such without realizing the downstream consequences.",

The issue is picking a reliable “did data change?” signal that scales and doesn’t miss late-arriving/backfill data. What do you typically gate off?

Move data through them with ETL (or ELT).\n\n-I had to model my data using the Kimble method for my curated version (dimensions and facts). It definitely helps with Power BI reporting. There are lots of resources for this online.\n\n- Consider how your API works. When you call it, what does it give you back? Is it a full data set, or do you pass it a date and it just gives you back a smaller set of data? Which columns in that API call do you need and which are definitely not useful to your business (don't get rid of them in raw in case the business wants them in future, but think about if they are needed in cleansed). I was able to use watermarks to record when the pipeline last ran. I can pass that watermark to my API so it only gives me the data that has been inserted or updated  since then. That's handy because you process a much smaller data set.\n\n-Think about what happens if your pipeline fails at each stage. Draw it out on paper if you have to, think about why parts could fail and how you would fix them or deal with the next pipeline run.\n\n- Spend some time thinking how your pipeline will handle deleted data. If someone deleted a record from November in your CRM, how does it need to be handled in your reporting? Does the business still expect to see it in the reporting or are they happy it should be removed. I use MERGE to handle these in SparkSQL.\n\n- How often does the business want your pipeline to run, and at what time?",

I assume an ML Engineer codes ML / Analytics program this correct? **Trying to understanding where line that the Data Engineer comes up to, and then an ML Engineer role does the tasks of model creation?** Because when I read some of the threads, it is implied the Data Engineer is also coding the ML part - talking about optimising the query on Spark etc. Is optimising of query to be done by ML Engineer for training models and analytics? Or are they referring to optimising data transformation queries written by Data Engineers that is done prior to model build etc.\n\n It would really help to define  the boundary of the Data Engineer and the tasks and technologies used to accomplish the tasks in that boundary prior to model creation and training.\n\nThank you again for the reply.",

If you are receiving full snapshots you do conditional inserts on hashdiff by key so that you don't write the same data twice. That combined with compressible formats means you only keep actual changed data, which means it isn't sized much larger than SCD2.\n\n> Also, using always the timestamps doesn't force you to run an analytical function over the partition sorted by date to obtain the latest record ?\n\nIf you used only the raw vault to query then it would, yes. But part of the BV batch is running logic like those window functions to find the latest version(s) by key to create derived tables.\n\nOn each batch you can take your fresh raw vault data and determine how it would splice into your current SCD2 history, and update that table. The SCD2 table could materialise all the data, or it could be just the keys pointing back to a specific row in the raw vault. Just the keys can work if you need to save space, as doing an inner join still allows predicate pushdown into the raw vault data unlike with filters on window function ordering.",

Then you need machinery to feed all these tables unnecessarily, and pay for all that compute work. It is just not a framework that is optimized for the cloud native tech. It is pointless in that sense. Also, lots of data engineers you hire will ask to leave the project after 6 months for the amount of endless work that the framework demands. All that under the escuse of it being very robust and adaptable to business logic. Well lots argue that is rather preferable having work maintaining simple models that need to be adapted a bit here and there once in a while than having work on a weekly basis for creating tables all in the same way. It is robotic work that nobody likes to do. Data Vaults advantages can be achieved with much easier to maintain frameworks.",

Yes, passthrough had some limitations, but it also allowed you to mount storage without baked-in creds, rely on hyperscaler storage security model, and have multiple engines respect a single security model (think what Fabric OneLake aims to achieve today). For many of us, the model was clean, elegant and worked extremely well because it encouraged an *open* Lakehouse.\n\nWhile Unity Catalog solved some real governance problems, it conveniently became the ONLY path forward for a growing set of feature. There were real tradeoffs made between openness and control, and Databricks obviously chose the latter. Call it “enterprise readiness” all you want, but customer lock-in and monetisation were the primary part of the equation.\n\nThe irony is that Snowflake, once held up as the closed/proprietary villain, is now, in MANY practical ways, the more open platform.",

Newer data processing framework or libraries are simpler to use and more scalable without a cluster. \n\nTHE RACE TO THE BOTTOM:\nThe big data journey started with Hadoop and then Spark came along. Both technologies require clusters of computers with a lot of setup and maintenance. So Hadoop had it moment but mostly disappeared. It wasn’t the right technology for most of the need for enterprises, unless you are Google. Then cloud data warehouse (redshift, snowflake) became popular, but pretty quickly companies had to pay more than they wanted for pretty simple data processing in most parts. But snowflake at least offered a managed service that took away the infrastructure management away from users. A lot of companies still using snowflake for their BI needs and even analytics. Fast forward to data lakehouse architectures. Now we can do the same than in snowflake on files in s3. The clear winner out of this phase was Databricks due to their integrated approach covering end-to-end processing needs. Compared to other approaches it is simpler and managed. Cost of Databricks is cheaper than data warehouses, but we still pay a premium for compute. Now the datalakehouse evolves with on-process DBs like duckdb that offer same performance with much simpler compute for most use cases. This phase is work in progress and lead by DuckDB. But it promises lower cost at similar performance and simpler data stack compared to the 15 year old spark technology. But no end to end platform yet.\n\nData stack is evolving. Throughout the journey performance is increasing slightly or remain the same as the price is of data processing is getting cheaper.",

That brings in other dimensions:\n\n**Standardisation and skills**  \nUsing one platform for most workloads simplifies hiring, onboarding, and design decisions. Running DuckDB *and* Databricks or Snowflake already means duplicated mental models, tooling, and operational overhead. Spark skills are also far easier to source today than DuckDB-specific expertise.\n\n**Usability across roles**  \nA data platform isn’t just for DEs. Analysts, analytics engineers, QA, data scientists, and software engineers all need access. Most don’t want to reason about Python internals or query-level optimisation. Platforms like Databricks and Snowflake work because they provide a shared abstraction layer with escape hatches when needed.\n\n**Operations and integration**  \nA “simple VM running DuckDB” isn’t simple in production. You still own OS patching, security hardening, monitoring, backups, scaling, incident response, and integration with IAM, logging, and alerting. That operational load is labour-intensive and expensive.\n\n**Compliance and risk management**  \nEnterprise systems must comply with GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC2, BCBS, etc. Using a certified platform drastically reduces audit scope. Saying “the platform is ISO27001-compliant, we only audit our data logic” is far cheaper than proving compliance for bespoke VM setups.\n\n**Support and continuity**  \nAt scale, systems fail in non-obvious ways. Having access to vendor engineers who understand the internals matters. Enterprises also care about platform longevity; they expect core infrastructure investments to last 5-10 years, not depend on a small ecosystem or a few experts.\n\nOther concerns I’m deliberately not expanding on here include cost attribution, blast-radius reduction, workload isolation and concurrency control, data governance (lineage, column- and row-level security), and long-term exit costs.\n\nBy the way, I think DuckDB is excellent technology, that's not really the problem here because the question isn’t whether it’s fast or cheap in isolation, but whether it minimises risk, effort, and cost at the organisational level.",

But even then, after you have your prototype running, you should build a relational database based on your MongoDB database.\n\nI was led astray. I was one of those naive newbies. I chose MongoDB for my project. At first, I liked it: when I needed to add a field to an object, I add it in my code and it just worked. It felt like magic at first.\n\nBut after a while, I found out any query more complex than a basic join is a nightmare. Unreadable mess. Absolute degeneracy. My code was full of 100+ lines long unreadable queries decorated with comments like \n\n    // no way in hell this is the correct way to write this, but it works so DON'T TOUCH IT\n\nI thought \"surely I am missing something. Surely there's a way to write the queries more nicely. Surely with more practice, it will get more readable\". But after a while, I realized this was not happening.\n\nAnd the indexing. If you don't have properly set up indexes, the costs skyrocket. And you don't get any sort of warning that the database is manually searching through the millions of entries, checking them one by one for a match, multiple times per query. And even if you have indexes that by all means should have been used, sometimes they just don't get used, without any apparent reason. Optimizing queries is hell.\n\nAt one point, I had to bite the bullet. I knew I could not keep it at this state much longer. It took me 2 months of tedious work, rewriting everything to Postgres, migrating all the data that accumulated over time. It sucked. But the relief of finally deleting the wasteland that my MongoDB has become was like getting that really bad tooth that has been decaying for 5 years finally pulled. It was awesome.\n\nJust use Postgres. If you are working with data of undefined structure, just use JSONB.\n\nAnd to show you a concrete example, here's a query from my codebase back when it used MongoDB (yes, all this is a single query). Don't try to understand it. Just marvel at it. \n\n    // sorry.

Somebody else controls it. Example is a web scraper - you’re not in charge of the website you are scraping. Schema-less is a big thing here because it lets you store “anything” in the DB. Also, NoSQL is much more beginner-friendly, which is why you see it so much in courses and tutorials.\nOf course, it has some great horizontal scalability features and a lot of other stuff, but that's not important for beginners in this field (at least, not yet).\n\n2. If I have complete control over my object model, I would always use a relationship database since I’m already familiar with SQL. Also, if I have a lot of data to process (like GBs or TBs), I’ll avoid MongoDB or any NoSQL database.\n\n3. It's usually a great choice. It lets you shift your focus to the app and its logic, spending less time on data structures, schemas, etc. In real life, at some point, you'll need to learn SQL because it’s much more common than NoSQL, but for personal projects and learning Mongo, it's a great start. \nMongoDB and Atlas created one of the best developer experiences I have seen",

If you are running a multi billion dollar corp, it doesn't matter either, because you can have a small priesthood building patch after patch on top of whatever DB to provide a useful abstraction hiding the cruft. Problems only happen in the middle: Where you can't afford to hire the specialists to, in practice, invent a data layer for you, yet you cannot just run everything from, say, even a small sqlite file.\n\nThere was a time I'd have told you to run Mongo whenever you were tempted to use Dynamo, because Dynamo's costs were an absolute nightmare to deal with, especially if you didn't have absolutely perfect primary keys with unform usage patterns.

I will say that it scales very well; a cluster of Mongo instances is very malleable, instances can be added, removed and scaled at will without any downtime. Also, since it's schemaless, there's hardly ever any downtime for anything like schema migrations or the like.\n\nThis comes at quite a cost though. You need to _really_ understand its eventually-consistent model to write code that may be prone to race conditions, where you'd just use locks and/or transactions in other databases. You'll also need to understand its failure modes in edge cases; for example how _exactly_ the retry behaviour of the driver is in case a server instance happens to disappear mid-transaction, and when the application needs to catch that and retry itself.\n\nEven if it's schemaless, for most regular applications, you still need a schema. If the database doesn't enforce it, your app layer needs to enforce it. If you don't, you'll end up with _a lot_ of uncertain code all over the place and a lot of `if..else` trying to compensate for vague schemas. Ask me how I know, it's hardly maintainable after a while.\n\nFor most regular apps which need a relational data store, I would not recommend Mongo. At least not as the primary database. It can be useful for storing a large pool of unrelated, fairly unstructured data which is mostly accessed individually instead of serving aggregate queries. Spontaneously I could imagine YouTube storing data about its videos in Mongo; they're mostly accessed individually, each document can sprout various metadata, most documents are accessed fairly infrequently, and there's _loads_ of them.",

I can teach a toddler to write letters, doesn't mean the toddler can write words. And it doesn't mean the toddler can write a syntactically right and meaningful sentence.\n\nWriting is easy. You just put letters one after another. Learning the words is harder, you have to know the words. Making a meaningful sentence is very hard.\n\nIt requires you to have an idea to express, then choose the right words, in the right orders, with the right nuances to get your listener to understand you.\n\nThis is all about code here. Learning \"for\", \"if\", \"while\", \"switch\", \"function\", \"null\"... All those keywords that have a specific meaning. You know most of them.\n\nI guess that if I asked you to write a loop over an array you could achieve it. The issue comes with complexity.\n\nYou don't know what to express and even if you know what to express, you aren't experienced enough to know how to express it if the complexity rises.\n\nFrom my point of view, if my take makes sense to you, you'll have to work through that. It took me 2 years to get that mindset. It takes more or less time for different people depending on where they start and how efficient their learning process is. You need more time, more practice.\n\nMake projects, complex ones. Do some more DSA. Work the problems in your brain, try your solution on the computer, get the result, fix and restart the process. Look on the internet for information and solutions, but don't copy directly, understand and inject the solution in your code, try it, see it, feel it, deeply.\n\nOn another note: feeling dumber than you thought. \n\nI don't think you are stupid, but I don't know you. It's relative to what you think and expect here. I think you just had a revelation on the Dunning Kruger effect. Feels like science, not sure it is, but the intuition is pretty on point IMO. \n\nThe less experienced in something, the more confident you are in it. \n\nYou hit the reality check. And you placed yourself on \"the mountain of stupidity\". But it doesn't mean you are stupid, it's just a biased view. Something we all do. Don't blame yourself. Being aware of that make you smarter than a lot of people. Use this to understand where you stand more than trying to blame yourself.",

Programs are long term projects.  The goals the project has on day one will not be the same goals the project has 1 year in.  New things happen, assumptions on what is important might change, and you need a cycle to manage this reality.  Waterfall strategy only works short term, agile strategy is what separates success stories from failures long term.  This is, again, something that comes with experience.\n\nAs far as what technologies survive long term?  Well, bash and linux scripting, javascript (specifically async), sql (on the administration and optimization side), and react state as a design pattern I feel are all key.  Linux in particular hasn't changed much since I learned the basics 20 years ago.\n\nGood ideas will persist and better ideas will replace them over time.  This is just how it goes.

        "body": "source: Professional Programmer since 1990\n\nHere are some skills which, in my experience, help keep people in demand. These are all skills one can learn, hone and master if you want.\n\n\n6. Learn the basics. Understand how computers works, how software works. For instance, what is actually happening when a line of code calls an api function and gets a result? Become familiar with general architectural principles/patterns to help know when to apply what, and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different tools and frameworks. For instance, understand why certain architectures, languages and frameworks exist, and their pros/cons. Why does C matter in some cases, while in others Python or R might be a better choice? When should you use third-party libraries and frameworks, and when should you not take on extra dependencies? This leads to the next item. \n\n5. Moving comfortably between deep debugging and a wider perspective and knowing when to dive in, when to zoom out, and how to switch quickly between the two.\n\n6. Scoping problems quickly. Recognising when you have enough information to act, and when you need to pause and go andlearn more.\n\n1. Be good at delivery. Being able to get things done and helping manage your work well.  If people can trust you to get things done, they are more likely to want you on their team. Everyone takes time to get better at estimation.  Practice getting better by reflecting on why sometimes things took longer/shorter and where you might need to plan better. \n\n2. Knowing when to move fast and accept trade-offs, and when to slow down and lift quality. Knowing  to trade off quality, reliability, (all the 'ilities') etc \n\n2. Always be learning. Stay curious about new ideas and whether they make things better or worse. Spending regular time getting hands-on with new technology, techniques, processes and engineering practices matters. There is endless information out there, so be selective, but genuinely interested. Whatever your preferred medium for learning is, make sure you get a good spectrum of quality info\n\n3. Being able to step out of the code and talk to senior leaders about risks, benefits and costs. This means understanding the bigger picture well enough to help them make decisions that affect the organisation, without getting lost in detail. You have to be genuinely interested in their problems to really understand them. They will appreciate it generally.\n\n4. Bringing technical and non-technical people together to solve problems, both day to day and long term. Knowing who to involve and when is a very great skill. This can be applied whether you're in an org or working in your business for others \n\n\n7. Being a heavyweight engineer. Someone with N years of deep experience and judgement, not the same year repeated N times.\n\n8. Be good at spotting trends and patterns early and calling them out so plans can be adjusted in time. This applies at every level, from yourself and peers, all the way to the big bosses.\n\n9. Being a decent person. Don't be the twat that thinks they know everything and treats others with disdain. Even if you do know more, you should treat people with respect. Some will be dicks who don't return the favour, but most people I've found just want to do good work and get on in lif. If you treat them with decency, they are far more likely to help you achieve your goals. \n\n10.  Be a producer. Most people are consumers of stuff. If you go out of your way to be a producer. This could be as simple as taking time to share your knowledge with others, or even speaking up in discussions, even to ask questions. You'll be more noticed and more likely to be in their mind when people want to get something done. Often this leads directly to getting better work and with it more impactful rewards.  \n\n\nThis is a bit of a haphazard list. And you'll see that I've not listed any particular tech. It took me a long time to transition from being quiet and technical to being more interested in the bigger picture and interacting with others more. I really wish I had this list when I was a junior.  Overall, this transition, I feel, has made my software engineering much better.",

        "body": "I'm gonna tell you something that took me way too long to figure out and honestly still pisses me off that nobody just said it to me directly when I was your age.\n\nStop building shit to impress other programmers. Start building shit that actual people need.\n\nYou're seventeen, and coded for like 6 years? Cool. I was similar. And I wasted years, like genuinely wasted them building technically complicated garbage that nobody used. I'd make elaborate systems with clean architecture and clever algorithms and other developers would be like \"wow nice\" and I felt smart. But you know what? That's just jerking off. Nobody outside of programmer circles gave a shit because none of it solved actual problems.\n\nThe real turning point isn't learning another framework or getting better at leetcode or whatever (ofc that's important too at some point). It's when you stop asking \"what's a hard technical challenge I can tackle\" and start asking \"who around me has an annoying problem I could maybe fix\". And I mean really asking. Not imagining problems, not building solutions looking for problems, actually talking to real humans about real annoying shit in their lives.\n\nI wish I'd done at seventeen instead of building my tenth todo app with a new fancy tech stack. Go find someone, it can be your parents, a teacher, local business owner, literally anyone, and ask them what repetitive annoying thing they deal with. Then build the dumbest, simplest possible thing that makes that less annoying. Not elegant. Not impressive to other devs. Just useful.\n\nFor an Example, my friend used to manually copy-paste data from emails into spreadsheets for her work every morning. Took her like 45 minutes. I could've built a script that parsed those emails and dumped it into a CSV in literally an afternoon. But I didn't, because that wasn't \"interesting\" to me. I was too busy implementing a custom database engine for a project nobody would ever use because I wanted to understand B-trees. See the problem? She had a real problem that cost her actual time every single day. I had the skills to fix it in hours. But I never even asked because I was focused on impressing myself and other programmers.\n\nThis will humble you hard. All that clean code and design patterns everyone is proud of... Nobody cares when they can't figure out how to log in. The clever optimization doesn't matter when they just need a button that exports to Excel because that's what their boss wants. \n\nYou know what's funny? Even Linus Torvalds had to learn this lesson. When he built Git, he didn't start by designing the perfect distributed version control system architecture. He started because he was pissed off at BitKeeper and needed something that worked for the Linux kernel workflow, specifically handling huge numbers of patches from contributors he didn't fully trust. Git's internals are actually kind of ugly if you look at them. It's basically a content-addressable filesystem with some scripting on top. But it solved the actual problem he had, which was managing kernel development. All the elegant design came later after people were already using it. He built for the problem, not for the architecture. That's why Git won and all those \"better designed\" version control systems nobody remembers lost.\n\nOr another time, built an inventory system with proper relational database design, normalized tables, foreign keys, the works. User wanted to bulk-edit 50 items at once. Couldn't do it because I'd built individual edit pages and never thought about bulk operations. They just stopped using it and went back to Excel where they could edit multiple rows. My database design was objectively better than Excel. But Excel let them do their actual job faster, so Excel won.\n\nYou'll realize pretty quick that like 80% of what you thought was important is completely irrelevant and all the boring stuff you ignored is what actually matters. Authentication, error messages that actually tell you what went wrong, handling edge cases like what if they upload a file that's too big, making sure it works on their old laptop with Chrome from 2019, having an undo button, that's the stuff that makes or breaks whether someone actually uses your thing.\n\nThis field is packed with people who started young. I've met self-taught developers who picked it up at 25 and they're way better than me at a lot of things because they focused on solving problems instead of collecting technical skills like they're achievements in a video game. There's a guy I used to work with who switched from being a chef at 28, learned to code at a bootcamp, and he's one of the best developers I know. Why? Because he spent 10 years in restaurants learning how to handle stress, communicate with difficult people, and deliver under pressure. Those skills transferred. His code isn't always the prettiest but he ships things that work and people actually **want** to use them.\n\n[continuation in the replies]",

You don't need algebra, calculus, etc unless you're working on software that uses that stuff.)\n* \"Am I learning the right language?\" (Learn Python to start. But if you're learning something else, that's fine.)\n* \"Do I need to get a new, more powerful computer to learn to code?\" (Absolutely not. The cheapest desktop or laptop is more than enough.)\n* \"I want to learn a second language at the same time but I've heard that's bad.\" (It's fine. You can learn more than one thing at a time. There's no actual research or studies that state that learning.)\n* \"I feel like I always have to look stuff up. I can't memorize everything.\" (That's fine. Everyone is constantly looking stuff up.)\n* \"I heard X is slow.\" (That's not really a concern for your needs, and probably isn't even true in the first place anyway.)",

It's the darkest now it has ever been, but I think this will now change. \n\nThere will absolutely be a correction in headcount I think. We have over-attracted through the crazy times of the dot com bubble and subsequent aftershocks and the industry became the goto for everybody who wanted a comfortable office job but didn't really know what else to do. The industry accepted it because there was enough grunt work to do and people could be absorbed but this is coming to a very sudden end. The internet business landscape is now \\*much\\* more clear, it's not being pumped full of money like it was for the first quarter of this century. In fact, most of the money that was made in that process is now going into AI development, but they already have the barons in place there. It's not the same free-for-all the early internet was, so a recession is happening now. I think we probably all need to take a moment to mourn the fact that our \"golden age\" is coming to a close. It's still, and will probably remain a respected and well compensated profession, but not the wilds it has been. \n\nIn the interview you did absolutely the right thing. I've interviewed quite a bit and the second you presented your, \"You know, I think you'll be able to get a better impression of what I can do if I show you this....\", I think you're getting very close to a yes from me for almost this alone. If, afterwards, I feel like I do have a better impression that I might have got with my own questions, and that impression is of somebody who will do a good job, then welcome to the team. I can't tell you it will land with \\*every\\* interviewer, but the goal of the meeting is to figure out if a person joining the team is for the mutual benefit, if the interviewee can legitimately help us to mutually achieve that given what they know and I don't, then, yes please.

A Native app (Swift/Kotlin) outpaces Cross-platform (React/Flutter) or WebView because it has direct hardware access. Performance suffers when developers clog the Main Thread with heavy tasks (like parsing JSON) instead of offloading them to Background Threads, causing UI stutters. Finally, optimized apps use Local Caching to show content instantly, whereas laggy apps force the UI to wait for the network and re-render everything from scratch, draining both battery and data. I usually see a big difference between a native application and a Cross-platform, and even more so I see how poorly WebView works.",

If your goal is to build better mental models, that pain is useful.\n\nThe main downside is cognitive load, you can end up spending a lot of time fighting the borrow checker before you have a feel for what \"good\" looks like. Some people get more mileage by doing a short pass in C first to see the sharp edges directly, then Rust feels like a structured way to avoid them. Others prefer Go for fundamentals around concurrency and simplicity, but it will not push you as hard on memory and invariants.\n\nScope wise, I would pick tiny programs with one learning objective each and a hard ceiling on features. Stuff like a simple log parser with a strict state machine, a tiny key value store in memory, a CLI that does one thing well, or a toy HTTP server. If you catch yourself designing frameworks, stop and write tests for behavior instead. That is usually the point where \"learning\" quietly turns into \"architecture as procrastination.\"",

Small, constrained programs are exactly where those concepts stop being abstract.\n\nRust is good for this, but only if you treat the friction as the lesson and not something to fight. Ownership, borrowing, and error handling will slow you down, and that’s the point. It forces you to think about state, lifetimes, and failure modes up front instead of papering over them. That maps well to how real systems break.\n\nThat said, Rust is not the only way to get there. If you ever feel like you’re spending more time appeasing the compiler than reasoning about the problem, stepping sideways into something like Go or even plain C for a bit can help. Different languages surface the same fundamentals from different angles. There’s value in contrast.\n\nThe biggest trap to avoid is “exploration creep.” Pick problems that are almost boring. A tiny file indexer. A toy key value store. A CLI that parses input, mutates state, and fails in predictable ways. Stop the moment it works. Do not add features. The learning comes from finishing and reflecting, not from polishing.\n\nYou’re already thinking about this the right way. If you keep the scope tight and finish things, the language choice matters far less than the discipline you’re building.",

At one point I had a pretty long commute on the bus, so I got a laptop and started working every day.  That’s when my skills went from “I sort of understand” to “I can actually make things that are helpful”.\n\nSecond : There are lots of different options for learning: books, coding websites, YouTube, paid tutorials.  They all have their pros and cons, but ultimately none of them will teach you.. you have to teach yourself.  I wouldn’t worry about finding the perfect resources.  The goal should be to learn enough to take the training wheels off and start building things on your own.\n\nThird :  It sounds like you have tried a bunch of things already.  Different languages, web, etc.. I started out in a similar way.  I just wanted to “learn programming”..  I was making progres, but it was a bit scattered.  I eventually started creating some workflow helper tools in Maya for a particular project. They ended up being used by the whole team, and I started spending a lot of my time adding features and improvements. This focus on one language (python) and one purpose made a big difference.\n\nI’m sure there are lots of ways to do it, this is just what helped me.  Good luck!",

        "body": "The best source for learning OOP is learning Smalltalk. Squeak is a modern Windows implementation. Don't go crazy learning the language like you're going to make a career of it - if you're fast at picking up syntax, you'll probably do the most learning in just a few hours. Smalltalk is a single-paradigm, OOP language. It is **THE** OOP language most modern OOP has derived from.\n\nThe principles of OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; but these principles (idioms) don't *MAKE* OOP, they each exist in nearly every other programming paradigm - imperative programming has all of these idioms. These principles *FALL OUT* of OOP as a natural consequence.\n\nOOP is the paradigm of message passing. I don't move your arms for you - nor do I COMMAND you to open your umbrella, I just have to tell you it's raining. You have autonomy and agency to do whatever is appropriate in response. You could ignore me, you could open your umbrella, you could tell me to buzz off, you could call the police.\n\nObjects are a black box that can send and receive messages. In C++, standard streams are the de facto message passing interface, and you have to integrate some of it's interfaces into your implementation - for us, we have implementation level control over the details. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level feature built right in, which is convenient, which was conventional for the 50s and 60s, but Bjarne took certain issue with that - hence he made C++ the way it is.\n\nAn object is implemented in terms of state and functions. Your state is typically member fields and objects. Encapsulation *isn't* about tightly coupling functions with **DATA**, it's about classes modeling behaviors by enforcing invariants in member state. Data is bulky and dumb - data doesn't DO stuff. State is an implementation detail. A car has an engine, and so the throttle has to pass a message to the carburetor to accelerate. An engine has an RPM, which is just a number. In C++, you'd mix these types and concepts, in Smalltalk even numbers are objects.\n\nSmalltalk is very dynamic and has no type safety. You can ask an integer to capitalize itself; at runtime, it can either ignore the message, or respond with a `:dontknowmessage`, or defer to an exception handler. C++ allows for type safety - another reason Bjarne invented C++, but there's a fair amount of syntax to go with it.\n\nVery few multi-paradigm languages get OOP correct. The 1990s were TERRIBLE for OOP. Eternal September came in 1993 - when more people entered comp-sci than the industry as a whole could absorb and mentor them; OOP was oversimplified to the point of being wrong, but the egotistical blind were confidently leading the blind, who couldn't have known better.\n\nAs a result, you get \"C with Classes\", which is what I'd call most all of it - even in Python. It's actually a strictly imperative style that doesn't have an OOP bone in its body. Getters and setters are a consequence of the C type system, and are often seen in frameworks - but if you're not writing in C, if you're not writing a framework, they're an anti-pattern. Classes model behaviors and enforce invariants - a car can accelerate, turn, stop and start... They can't get make, get model, get year. The car doesn't use those properties to implement it's behavior. Those properties can be associated with the car in a map or table.\n\nThere are many kinds of polymorphism, and late binding (virtual functions) are just one of them. Javascript has this in spades since you can just ASSIGN additional functions to instances - they are not strictly bound to a prototype. There are several kinds of static and dynamic polymorphisms - function overloading, type erasure, multi-dispatch, overlapping types, indirection...\n\nThen inheritance principally models IS-A aggregation or HAS-A composition. There are other types, like C++ has LIKE-A. While neat, inheritance is often misunderstood and misapplied - for everything you might think you want to use it for, presume you're wrong, first.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a book on the subject, the seminal tome is `A Theory of Objects (Monographs in Computer Science)`. Good luck meeting anyone who has ever heard of it, let alone read it. When I tell you you'll likely never meet a developer who has the first clue what OOP is, I mean it. This is our industry's singularly biggest Dunning-Kruger.\n\nNote that Java has no de facto message passing interface. Not like Smalltalk. Not like C++. Many languages, like ECMAScript, Java, and C# are so fundamentally wrong about OOP they'll tell you that function calls ARE message passing. Absolutely insane. If that were the case, then Assembly is a first-class OOP language.",

You have a choice: be a dummy like everyone else and call everything Object Oriented - making the term meaningless, or actually understand what it is.\n\nI'm warning you that almost everything you're ever going to hear about OOP is wrong. You'll be told that OOP is:\n\n    public class car {\n      private int speed;\n\n      public int getSpeed() { return speed; }\n      public void setSpeed(int speed) { this.speed = speed; }\n    }\n\nAnd this is wrong. But everyone SAYS this is right. There is nothing OOP about this code whatsoever. The principles don't make the paradigm, the paradigm makes the principles. In Java, you need to make messages and a mechanism for passing them between objects.\n\nYou can create objects in Java, but Java isn't inherently Object Oriented. Having objects isn't enough. Fuckin' C has objects - it's explicitly in the language standard, but no one thinks of C as Object Oriented.\n\nI want you to have a chance of understanding what OOP is.\n\nYou won't understand OOP until you study Smalltalk and original materials from the OOP era before the late 90s disaster. You cannot understand the technology without understanding the history.",

In my country, some of the best paying and hardest to fill dev roles are for COBOL developers because COBOL is the ancient backbone of a lot of finance and government systems. \n\nWhat you learn to build is also probably more important than the language itself (although these are often related). For instance, python developers are in demand because of the boom in machine learning and AI, if you learn python but don't develop skills in machine learning or AI you're going to find relatively fewer jobs available to you.",

We also covered asymptotic and amortized algorithmic complexity etc \n\nI didn’t google or use AI (lol this course was in 2006) and figured it out on my own just form understanding. Maybe you googled and used AI a lot in college and didn’t learn?",

It’s a coding challenge in December where the creator releases one puzzle a day like an advent calendar, although this year he only did 12 days. \n\nEach day you’re given a Christmas themed puzzle to solve and some input data and you have to write a code to solve it in a language of your choice. The puzzles get progressively harder as you go. The first few days are usually fairly simple list comprehension style but as you get further you have to use DFS, regexes, Dijkstras, interpreting JSONs etc. So it’s a fun way to practice DSA with a bit more of a story than Leetcode. \n\nAs an example one of the puzzles from 2024 you’re given input data which is a large grid of #’s and .s plus one ^ . The ^ is the start postion of a guard. The guard walks in the direction she’s pointing until she hits an # when she turns right. You have to work out how many unique cells the guard visits before leaving the room.\n\nThe challenge goes back to 2015 and you can play all of the old puzzles for free so I find it a really fun way to practice. Once I’ve solved a puzzle I look at how other people have solved it in other languages and find ways I can improve my code.",

One was floundered by a novice professor who could barely describe half of what we were learning. The other was a 20 year tenured dinosaur using the same slides he'd been using since the 2000s, mumbling his way along while we were left to decode the remains.\n\nIn both cases, algorithms were only touched on to a theoretical capacity in lecture - only word problems appeared in ungraded work which nobody did because the graded stuff took priority. In neither case was the learning experience long lasting. In both cases it was the same procedure: Survive the semester and try to prep for the next batch of courses.\n\nBeyond those courses, our projects rarely required algorithm work. The closest I've ever come was implementing A\\* pathfinding for a turn-based tactics game I made for a game programming course. Best course in my 4 years here. Besides that it's largely been 4 years of half-assedly displaying a false-understanding of concepts, rather than actually using them.\n\nThis is why side projects are important for CS students.",

        "body": "You just finished your first semester. I'd say that for now look into different courses/paths your university is going to introduce you into. We can throw at you all kinds of tech stacks but what if you pick DevOps over web application development? Or you pick mobile app development over IoT/embedded programming? Perhaps you go for telecom technologies instead?\n\nYou having finished your first semester is a bit early to make you pick a path and target one or another company. Unless you clearly know what you want to do.\n\nAlso, your break is going to be what, 1 month or less? It will not be enough to go over all the different paths one might recommend to you.\n\nI'd say that if you haven't done yet, then learn to use Git. It will be used regardless in which field you'll be working at. Learn to make pull/merge requests, learn to make feature branches, etc. That knowledge will be needed also in your coming semesters. Try it out with some hobby project (whichever medium: mobile app, a script outputting to a terminal, a website, etc.)\n\nThen, you do can map the different technologies that are used by companies in your area. Search by \"junior developer\" or \"junior engineer\" or \"junior software developer\" or such. Yes, you are targeting internship but you'll be working with some tech stack. Even when it comes to very simple tasks they give to interns. You can make a list for mobile app development, a list for web application development, a list for IoT/embedded/hardware programming, etc. Might be that some of the technologies you will learn during your courses. But definitely can be that you might have to learn something on your own or they will teach you during the internship.\n\nAnother thing that you can do is mapping down all the different companies that are taking interns in first place. You can learn all the different programming languages, but when you have no company to apply to then perhaps you are picking a technology that has no internships in your area. For example you might be learning Python or Java but if companies in your area are taking only interns to embedded programming then you'll need C and C++ instead. So, make a solid plan first before you start picking programming languages, frameworks, etc.\n\nYou can also look into companies that are hosting open door days, hosting tech talks, etc. Yes, these are not internship events but if you are social enough, you might find internship via connections you make in these events.\n\nMore realistic approach (instead of looking for internship via tech talk events) is looking if your university has a programming/robotics club. And then join that. These clubs will introduce you into different interesting projects, into different club organized events (but also company visits), and you'll get connections.\n\nThis is what you realistically can do during your break. You'll have much clearer idea of your options when you start actually applying for internships. Whereas your course mates will be in your current shoes, looking aimlessly for internship offers, not knowing what to do.\n\nSure, it helps if you have a hobby project and you have it in Github and perhaps even hosted somewhere or running on some device (depending of its nature). Then a company will see that you can actually work on a project.\n\nBesides an ability to work on a project you also should improve your group work skills / soft skills. This is why I suggested to join some programming related extracurricular activity club in your university. Software development is a group work, usually. Yeah, there is freelancing but you are not targeting it as an intern. An intern must be able to work in a team. I have had different bad experiences with new hires who just do not function in a team. Sure, you can have all kinds of technical skills but if you do not function in a team then it will harm your own progress, it will make you a blocker when it comes to handling tasks, etc. A good intern is somebody who is proactive, shows an interest towards learning, is willing to work in a team, is a good listener, etc.",

Hell, I didn't even start a votech until 25.\n\nOne thing I can suggest to you is to take a step back from programing, and use something like [draw.io](http://draw.io) to map everything out. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you can get a good idea of what's where. Then the implementation is going to be easier, and you can see right off the bat what you can trim. \n\nIt's also a good exercise in mapping out your edge cases. When you are building something that moves and interacts with the world your primary focus is on not missing a single edge case because people can be hurt and property can be destroyed. Ya dig? Your project isn't likely there yet.\n\nI keep several things. A note book, my phone, a couple docs. Then when I'm going through stuff, I make sure I didn't miss these edge cases I noted down everywhere. I generally deal with industrial systems, particularly utilities like ammonia refrigeration, steam boilers, large electrical power systems, large pump systems, etc. So it's not as important for you.\n\nOnce you have a solid map and the data laid out, what you can/can't do will make more sense I'm sure. Just the fact that you say \"I'm not sure if I'm good enough to do that\" is the first step - you are making sure you are working within your limits, but not afraid to push them. That's wise. Please update us on your progress.",

And I have basic knowledge of their hardware. You have the right idea, but keep in mind that Waymo AND Zoox already have the entire map of the city already loaded into their system, plus information that's not on the map, like updated lane markers, where are the pullover zones, and so on. Mapping is only used to \"validate\" areas of the map that doesn't match what they already \"knew\" about the area. They do NOT do autonomous mapping. In a new city, they have safety drivers go down each block to do the initial mapping. They also have GPS as backup, and for Google, Streetview as another backup for 3D AR mapping. \n\nYour little bot does NOT have any of these secondary / tertiary locator means in the school interior. So you can be inspired by Google / Waymo, but you cannot copy their approach because you don't have their hardware nor their secondary / tertiary nav data. (You may be able to code workarounds by adding QR codes or RFID beacons to door frames or fixed distances, and use those to help your bot locate itself, but that's up to you)",

At some point, the users of those tools will need to call on C for more applications, and at some point, the existing ones are going to break and need updating.\n\nAs for you personally, my advice is to get good at both C and a high-level language, and to try out some of the more standard uses of it. E.g. use TinkerCAD for free in your browser to see if embedded systems, microcontrollers, arduino etc. might be for you.",

When you apply with only knowing C, the non-technical HR recruiter will probably gloss over your resume. It's a shame because a technical manager would see you know C and realize \"hey this person knows a low level language and it's easier for them to probably adapt to and learn Java because they already know a lot of coding fundamentals\"\n\nThe thing about learning C is not just learning the language, you are learning invaluable skills for programming itself, skills which are often missing for devs who only learned say Python. When I took organic chemistry, the professor said you'll almost never need any of this knowledge outside of a lab, but what the skills you learn from this course will be beneficial - critical thinking, problem solving, how to tackle multifaceted problems in different ways. Learning C is kinda like that, you're learning skills that most programmers never bothered to learn, skills which are highly desirable to managers if they know them.\n\nSo my advice is keep learning C and keep progressing. If you wanna get a job, maybe learn Rust or Golang because those are hot new languages that are getting a lot of buzz from employers. And if you wanna learn a high level language then go with Java or C#",

Being able to turn an idea into something working without depending on others gives you a lot of speed and clarity early on.\n\nRegarding Rails vs full-stack JavaScript, it really comes down to focus. Rails is great for learning how a product is put together on the backend and lets you ship quickly because it’s very structured and opinionated. JavaScript can feel messier at first, but using the same language for both frontend and backend is powerful if your goal is to build products on your own and understand the whole stack.\n\nIn practice, the language matters less than finishing projects. While building theORQL, what helped the most wasn’t choosing the “perfect” stack, but learning how to build, break things, debug, and iterate quickly. Those skills transfer no matter what you use.",

It's best read as more of a historic classic; someone wanting to actually learn C in-depth in 2025 should look for a more modern resource, with modern C standards, modern library expectations, modern expectations for compiler flags (like ASAN, or [the openSSF recommendations](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html)) etc.\n\nA lot has happened in the world of C in the four decades-ish since the release of K&R.",

You can build stuff that really resonates with audience. In fact, any experience you have managed to get in your life will be helpful in one way or another. \n\nDont worry , just try things out. Dont let \"math\" stop you....even if you code smth and it fails, it is a step in the right direction - learn from it. \n\nBlessings !",

It wouldn’t make sense to read the whole documentation from front to back before you open your text editor. Similarly, you wouldn’t want to implement a brand new project each time you completed a new section of their docs; that’d be too many projects.\n\nYour best bet is to have a loose idea as for you want to build, and then implement the things you learn as you go. And ofc you will learn stuff you don’t need, but you can try those things out and then leave them behind.\n\n*disclaimer*: if you are fairly comfortable with the material you’re trying to learn (if you are already familiar with it or similar tech) then you may actually just read their documentation and not need to implement to practice.",

Maybe there’s buggy internal tools that need fixing or something that is unreasonably slow and needs optimization. Anything that you don’t know how to do, but doesn’t seem impossible.",

If you don't need dynamic content, just go down a static site generation route with astro, eleventy, nuxt, next.js/nextra etc and deploy it for no money with github pages, cloud flair pages, or vercel or other similar services.\n\nFor desktop applications, it depends what exactly you want to do. If you want to make a productivity app, chat app or monitoring dashboard for instance, electron is a good choice because you are already familiar with JS/HTML/CSS and its got a well supported ecosystem. If you want it to be lighter weight but stick with javascript, you can use NodeGUI/ReactGUI, although theres less plugins and a smaller community. If it's anything where you need performance or deeper access to windows APIs, it's probably got to be C# or occasionally C++.

You’re seeing the finished city, not the dirt roads that came first.\n\nPeople who contribute to those projects usually didn’t wake up one day understanding the whole thing. They fixed one bug. Then another. Then a small refactor. Over time, patterns repeat and the codebase stops feeling magical and starts feeling human. Messy, opinionated, sometimes wrong.\n\nAt 2–3 years in, the most important skill isn’t raw knowledge. It’s learning how to read unfamiliar code without panicking, trace behavior, and change one thing without breaking five others. That skill compounds quietly and doesn’t feel impressive day to day.\n\nIf you want to get there faster, stop measuring yourself against the entire repo. Pick one narrow area and live there for a while. Tests. Error handling. Docs. A single module. Depth beats breadth early.\n\nFeeling small in front of big systems usually means you’re looking at the right things. Most people avoid that discomfort.

If ypu want a good pattern here is a good one KISS. Keep it simple, stupid - it means what you do, do it as straightforward as you can. \n\nA good example is what redux do. In react if you have a state, and need to share it between few components you need to pass it as props through they common parent, but it is a bit hard and really unobvious, so redux was made so you have a common state where you can reach in for the data to a singleton.\n\nThis solution is better because it simplifies something that is used often and that isunobvious to do.",

Because I used to have the same questions when starting out years ago.\n\nDicts and classes are different, but both can be made to do similar things (ie composing objects from scalar types).\n\nThe difference is that, in most languages, classes provide neat abstraction features, like inheritance and methods, and greater control about how you can use it.\n\nClasses can be defined, shaped, and optimized however you like, while dictionaries will just be dictionaries which is optimized for doing 1 thing that is O(1) access time with acceptable storage for the key space.\n\nOn optimizations, let’s say you’re modeling a square rectangles. With class, you can just define it as having 2 fields like this\n\n{ width: int, height: int }\n\nEvery instance of this rectangle object will cost you 2 ints of memory space. If the int is 64 bit, then your rectangle is just 8+8=16 bytes each, and 10 rectangles will cost you 160 bytes.\n\nIf you instead wish to use a hash map/dictionary to represent the rectangle with int width and height, that dictionary is probably using much more space than just 2 ints because how hash maps are implemented. If you have multiple such rectangles, it’ll waste more space pretty quickly due to having to initialize mostly empty map to store 2 values. Every insert incur further work as the program needs to hash and potentially resize the haystack or change hash function to fit more keys.\n\nAnother thing to think about is a dictionary is just a hash map, so its access time is slower than just field access (it has to compute the hash value of the key, whereas with class, the location of the field value within the object is already known).\n\nOh and another thing is with dict/map, you don’t know if you’re gonna have a value at that key unless, you know, you access it. This happens at runtime. With classes, it’s a compile error if you’re accessing the field that does not exist.\n\nLast thing is maintainability and DX - with maps, if you decide to change the “key” you’ve been using pervasively like class fields, you’re gonna have to change all occurrences of those string keys. Whereas with classes, your LSP might support renaming that field with just a press on F2. This is very useful when the codebase is huge.\n\nUse maps to store values when each key is considered sibling or equivalent to each other, e.g. mapping post codes to region names. Think of it like dynamic lists/arrays, but with key access instead of index access.\n\nUse classes to encapsulate more complex objects that you want to extend with methods and your own initialization rules, etc.\n\nI’m sure you’ll get it the more complex your program becomes.",

Languages that impose strong typing can't usually get away this kind of thing.\n\n> for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class?\n\nThis is based on context.  There are a few tuple syntax options.  There is also a dynamic type which is pretty close to duck typing.  Your basic typed options are struct, class and record.  A record is a class with a lot of sugar and what I'll reach for initially.\n\n> c# the statement is so complex\n\nA code example would be good here.\n\n> I read that classes are faster in execution.\n\nDepends.  Strong types allow for a lot of optimization.  However, in the end, you're running functions against data.\n\n> need for all the explicit type declarations\n\nDepends on where you want to fail.  Using type declaration allow for a lot of issues to be caught at compile time.

Everything is basically just a dictionary essentially (every object you can just ref properties by saying obj[“prop”]). \n\nTo the point that some people want the flexibility of dynamic programming but will actually go to the effort of invoking the Rosslyn code generator to verify property names at compile time to get the benefits of both worlds. Like if you’re consuming a json file in a data dictionary you can use this feature to compile time verify property names and so forth. \n\nPersonally I hate any form of loose typing bc it’s a ticking time bomb if not for you, another developer.

        "body": "So I think you are misinterpreting what a class is; a class is a language-based concept that allows you to create custom data structures that also have behavior (or member functions) attached to it.  This allows you to make ANY data structure that you want that follows the rules of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.  Classes allow a language to be called object oriented, since in object oriented programming, the focus is on creating more and more of these data structures which when declared in code are called objects, hence object oriented programming.\n\nA dictionary is a data structure.  So you can for instance create your own dictionary class implementation, though I’m sure one exists in the C# STL. \n\nSo two completely different things essentially; a class/object is a programmer-implemented data structure with associated behavior(s) attached which follows the 4 laws of Object Oriented Programming, and a dictionary is a data structure that if you really wanted to you could implement that.\n\n\nAs for your second question, explicit type declarations are very important in the programming world because they essentially allow one to know at all times a general idea of how many bytes/chunks of memory a variable is taking up, as well as help with avoiding implicit type conversions which can cause a lot of issues.  You won’t see this come up much as a beginner but the second you start working on anything that’s a bit complex, you will see why this is a big deal.  This was something that I struggled with when I started in JavaScript, as the dynamically interpreted types would lead to really odd behavior at unexpected times. \n\nThis becomes more apparent the further you get towards the hardware; python is built upon a great deal of layers to emulate natural language to its best ability, whereas in C/assembly you are dealing with extremely explicit operations that having a byte offset could cause the entire program/system to crash.  To give even more explicit control for this reason, you will later see C/C++ users will use even more strict types like uint_32 and long long or even stranger looking types to someone who has never used lower level programming languages.  Also, tbh, it just helps with readability, being able to know exactly what each type is defined as.\n\nAs far as running a script, anything dealing with Windows is gonna be a pain in the ass (I’m an arch Linux user if u can’t tell by my windows cynicism) but it’s what u gotta do since C# is .NET.  But essentially all the stuff u did in VS is just for programmer ease of mind, but really thats just an automation tool.  Hell if you want to just open up a terminal and run a script real fast all you gotta do is type \n\ndotnet run [name of program].cs \n\nAnd it will run it.  VS generates a ton of metadata files to help with the building process which is why it’s a pain in the butt to set up but once you do it will make it a little faster.\n\nAnyways do you have any other questions? I hope I explained well, I use a great deal of Java but I’m mostly a C/C++ developer so much different domain but still same concepts",

Why don’t we put everything in 1 file or 1 folder and have automatic access to code written in other files?\n\nTLDR: it’s for organizing large codebase. We can separate different concerns with namespaces.\n\nIf you have organized folders for other computer files/works, why not source code?\n\nYou probably don’t feel the need to modularize your code into modules/namespaces because your program is not yet complex enough.\n\nImagine if we work at Google, with millions of lines of code. And now you want to name something specific to some implementation, maybe you want to implement search result for a TV. There’s a very high chance the name “SearchResult” is probably used somewhere in there. Without namespaces, we must come up with new names every time we want something different, like “SearchResultMobile”, “SearchResultMobileWeb”, “SearchResultTV”, and so on\n\nWith namespaces, each names or symbols are confined to only have meaning in its namespace, so you can have mobile.SearchResult, mobile_web.SearchResult, and tv.SearchResult instead. All code relating to TV implementation will live in the namespace “tv”, not cluttering other namespaces.\n\nNamespaces help separate concerns, and the “import” part is explicit - you have to define wht and where you want to bring symbols outside of our namespace (eg folder, in Go) into scope, to avoid you running/compiling code accidentally (which might be malicious or just bugs).\n\nMy example might not be good, but at least it demonstrates the point.\n\nMy tips: Whenever you are asking why programmers do stuff the way they do, imagine you have to work with big ass codebase (100k LoC++) with incompetent coworkers, and maintain that code for years, then you’ll understand why.",

I don't feel that way after almost ten years as a professional dev.\n\n\nI think it's because the imperative nature of most mainstream languages will have you rewriting the same for loops over and over again. Object oriented programming promised that you could reuse code but that never really paid off and so a lot of people are feeling disillusioned with the promises of programming.\n\n\nI think Haskell gives you a much better way of actually reusing code. The way it does it is by using algebra on the type level. I very much enjoy the process of figuring out the types first and then the implementation often comes naturally from that. It's much closer to math or pure logic than imperative programming.\n\n\nI haven't tried too many other functional languages so I can't speak for them. I did try F# and it felt like a bastardized version of C# which I'm already not very fond of after working with it for three years.\n\n\nAll of this is rather subjective but there seems to be a broad agreement when it comes to Haskell that it's very elegant and has a very steep learning curve.\n\n\nIf you have a strong math/logic background and you're looking to enjoy the process of writing code rather then enjoying running the program then I think Haskell is for you.\n\n\nWith that said I'm not sure if modelling physics is the best way to enjoy functional programming.",

Something that lets you visualize stuff like the vertices, lines, bodies, variables, etc. Do not debug by guessing whats happening.\n\n-start small, make you engine by breaking it down into its smallest parts and making sure each small part works and connects easily to the rest of the code (like legos). Using assertions helps but im not sure the general opinion on assertions.\n\n-dont be against looking at the industry standard solutions. For example, if you are dealing with colision detection, trying to make your own version instead of just looking up the already existing algorithms (aabb, gjk, sat) is most likely going to take you longer and give you a worst result. The algorithms that already exist where created by really smart people with a lot of math and programming knowledge and, unless your use case is really strange, its probably better than anything most people could come up with.\n\nLastly, seriously, this is a humongous task, you should only make a physics engine if you either\n\n-find it fun\n-want to learn\n-your use case truly cant use any existing engine",

Knowing what to write and build is important. If you give either to an unpredictable AI… what is left?\n\nAnd no, AIs (plural, it’s not a singular thing) can’t build much - let alone “anything.” They require a lot of handholding, create bad code, keep adding instead of fixing or modifying, have no idea how to do a lot of things and so on.\n\nAnyone saying they can do “anything” or “a lot” is always doing basic menial copypastable CRUD stuff etc. Stuff that has been done myriads of times so the LLMs can just vomit it out. And nothing wrong with that work. There’s a lot of it. But the problem is those people often don’t realize there’s different kind of work.\n\nFor me LLMs mostly never produce anything working.

At one point I deleted about 80% of the entire code base without any change to functionality! AI cannot reason! It can only fake reasoning. A more appropriate denomination for the technology would be pseudo intelligence! It generates a lot of slop and then takes that slop as input to generate even more slop! It takes human experience to know what is efficient and what is not. AI can still be a useful tool but you still have to learn how to drive it!",

You build skill and code you can rejse this way, which again speeds up things.\nThis stage, the only use of AI should be to get things explained, so you can try to implement it. Later on you start using it for all the boilerplating, so you can focus on the actual task, but never to write everything. This is the point where you start to feel productive. \n\nI'm a backend dev and architect, so might be someone to better say. But i would say yes, fullstack is still very relevant, but it will probably shift to something where you get you basic layouts and again boilerplating for a site generated, and then you spend time writing the code, that requires more domain specific knowlegde, which AI's have no clue about.\n\nAnd in any case, just learning about an area will get you ahead of someone just prompting away for the same result, because you can read it and apply it elsewhere. So if fullstack dies to AI, you can look to backend, where vibecoders are screwed. 😊",

I’ve previously hired people with CIS or MIS degrees, Math, Music, EE, and CE. For those of you wondering, music is math-based and very logic-oriented, these folks make excellent developers if they’re interested in learning. Today, companies (especially larger ones) tend to look mostly for CS majors.",

        "body": "Great initiative. Learning structure early prevents \"spaghetti code\" later. Here is the standard approach for small-to-medium projects:\n\n1. The Gold Standard Structure\n\nAdopt the src layout. It keeps your actual code separate from configs and tests.\n\n    project_name/\n    ├── .gitignore          # Ignore venv, __pycache__, .env\n    ├── README.md           # Documentation\n    ├── requirements.txt    # Dependencies\n    ├── src/\n    │   ├── __init__.py\n    │   ├── main.py         # Entry point\n    │   ├── config.py       # Settings\n    │   └── utils.py        # Helper functions\n    └── tests/              # Test files mirroring src structure\n    \n\n**2. When to Split into Modules**\n\n* **The Scroll Rule:** If you find yourself scrolling up and down constantly to find a function, split the file.\n* **Cognitive Load:** If a file handles Database logic *and* UI logic, split them. Keep files focused on one \"domain\" (e.g., [`database.py`](http://database.py), `api.py`).\n* **Reusability:** If you need a function in two different scripts, move it to a shared `utils` module.\n\n**3. Patterns to Learn Early**\n\n* **The Entry Guard:** Always wrap your execution logic. This prevents code from running if you import the file elsewhere. Pythonif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == \"\\_\\_main\\_\\_\":     main() \n* **Virtual Environments:** Never install libraries globally. Always use `venv` (or `poetry`/`uv`) for every project.\n* **Type Hinting:** Start using standard type hints (e.g., `def greet(name: str) -> str:`). It acts as self-documentation and helps IDEs catch errors.\n\nGood luck!",

While they are trying to help people, the company was still run in a way that I didn't find that great as an employee.  They sell candidates on the idea that their work is going to help sick people and how it is a privilege for you do be working there.\n\nIt's such a privilege that you should take 20% - 30% below market to work there.  That money you leave on the table is said to be reinvested back in to the company, but it really just goes in to the CEO's theoretical pockets.\n\nYou would think that you can at latest create great devices for patients to use with rich features and so forth.  The reality is you meet bare minimum FDA standards for a safe product and go no further.  The problem at the companies I worked for is that you were not selling to the end user.\n\nYou are making money from insurance companies on things like disposable components that you change each treatment. A dialysis machine is expensive and the vast majority of people on dialysis are paying for it with insurance and not out of pocket.  That means investing on making a really nice UX is not any priority.\n\nAt the companies I worked at they don't make extra money investing a lot of time and effort on a well thought out UX, weather that is the UI or the physical device. From what I saw you give them the bare minimum and call it done.  All the time and money is really in the patient safety aspects of the device.\n\nAs long as you don't kill people having them need to click some extra buttons to start their treatment or wait a little longer for treatments to complete is ok, because when you have kidney failure the choices are using the device or die while you wait for a kidney transplant.\n\nThis could just be the companies I have worked at and not what other companies do.  And the old idea that shitty companies won't make money and go out of business wasn't my experience.  These companies have been around since the early 80's and making money hand over first.\n\nAll of the devices were designed in a way to require constant payments from insurance companies through components that needed to be replaced periodically, if not after each treatment.  Oh and who makes these components with custom connections that only fit our devices?  Oh we do, so buy them from us!\n\nYes after 20 years or something like that when the patent experiences it is a free for everybody to use, but at that point the company has already released other medical devices, with new patents, and different special connections.  So it's just a constant cycle of making money.\n\nSo are these companies evil?  No, no directly.  Though I don't think they are making the best product they can for the end user either.",

        "body": "I dropped out of school in Jan 2000 as I was offered stock options for AutoDesk’s web start up. The first crash happened 2 months later. I’ve worked steadily since then in the industry. \n\nThe **2000** one was wildly different because we didn’t communicate well on a global scale at that point. Prior to the crash, I heard stories of people making it rich in tech, but generally tech wasn’t all that well respected. The average person wasn’t using the internet for a ton. My out of college salary was 38k if I remember correctly. The prediction was the options I got would be worth 350k, which was more money than I’d ever dreamed of. (Spoiler: They were worth 0). \n\nThe crash happened, the company failed, people were laid off. That part was similar to now. Everyone was just waiting for it to be their turn, comparing themselves to their peers. Fearful. \n\nI eventually took a job working for the government for 34k. Getting a job was hard. There was a fear that this internet thing was just a fad and we’d struggle to get pretty mediocre pay. Still, I wasn’t super nervous. I got into it for engineering and if all I did was write C++ Windows apps forever, that was fine at the time. For me, things started returning to normal in \\~2004 when my original company had been sold and asked me to come back for 63k / year. I took the job and worked there until 2012.\n\nBy the **2006** crash I felt more like a mid level engineer. The *economy* felt bad, but in my corner of the world it felt like everyone knew tech was the future. Things were still optimistic for me. There were still layoff fears, but we didn’t really have any and my company was pretty stable. \n\nWhat feels different to me this time? It’s been an employees market for a long time and that’s changing. I know so many people who have made more than your average doctors do. Hell, I do and I’m a college dropout. It feels to me like this could be a huge realignment if it continues. \n\nHow long do I think it will last? My personal, uneducated guess is that companies will shift back to wanting engineers. At some point they’ll realize the tools can multiply their productivity (Not replace it) and at that point they’ll want more people and produce more faster. I think this will come in the next 2-3 years likely? At the same time, I think some damage here has been done. You need a job more than it needs you and I think it could take a long time for that to shift back completely (If it ever does). I don’t actually thing we’ll see the boom at the level of \\~2018. Or at least I won’t. Maybe you will!\n\nIn the early 2000s I saw a ton of people who got into software to “Get rich quickly”. They took an online course and called themselves web developers because they could “Save as HTML” in word. A lot of them shifted real estate agents or other jobs. I think we’ll see the bottom of the industry drop out like that again. \n\nWhat helped me survive? Uh. I’m a hard worker. Probably a bit of a boomer take (I’m Gen X), but I’ve always been very professional. I saw so much shit that I wouldn’t pull during the late 2010 boom era. Don’t get entitled. Don’t be a pain in your bosses butt. \n\nEntitled things: Complaining about a company offering only vegetarian food on certain days of the week. Someone had a hissy fit at my company when they told employees they could no longer take home entire boxes of Snickers after work.

By the time I finished four years later in 2005 (with no PhD), the job market was somewhat better. It was not hot but more places were hiring. I got an offer to work in big tech on well known but old school software. It was pretty good for what I needed then. Salaries were way lower than now, especially when it came to stocks. I think my initial grant was like $5k over 4 years. \n\nLater, the job market improved A LOT. I got raises but eventually jumped to newer, better paying companies.\n\nThe Great Recession in 2008 was very different. Tech was hit but it was short lived. Maybe a year? All my friends in other industries got laid off and the bad job market dragged on. In tech, mobile phones juiced a huge run up in software that roughly correlated with the rise of the iPhone once it had apps.",

For careers that last decades, expect to do several different things.\n\nAdditionally, being capable of working at \"the edge\" is a skill in and of itself: high conceptual fluidity, creativity, curiosity, et cetera. The folks working on an emerging field like AI will probably be the same folks working on the next thing, and whatever that is it will require people to be adaptable and self-learning engineers.\n\nAll that said, nobody knows what's going to happen next. AI is certainly a powerful tool for software that won't go away, but if the bubble pops know one knows how that will affect the field. We might see a hiring boost, since companies will finally realize they won't be automating engineers away, or we could see even more money drain out of the ecosystem.\n\nIdk, \"no one knows the future\" is sort of the fun thing about this field.

The problem of leetcode grinding is it takes a shitload of hours, if you do get good at it, most eople just memorize how to solve questions inetead of learning why an answer is better.\n\nYou likely wont see the same questions in an interview and if you do, they will ask you to solve it differently and add restrictions to it so that you do critical thinking. At 4 YOE I got into FAANG by just doing a DSA study guide. I didnt even spend hours on leetcode i just did a few questions a day. Barely could get past a medium without struggling. At 7 YOE i got into a big tech company with the same study guide. \n\nWhat sucks is google has removed that study guide, but it linked many videos of Cracking the coding interview author who explaind each DSA in a pretty simple way. \n\nJob interviews, they dont care if you get the question right they only care about how your mind works when you get stuck. How you work through a problem. And talk out loud.",

This includes making it easier for authorizing officials to approve the use of AI in high-consequence development. Things move more slowly in the defense space, and with good reason: there's a lot of well-warranted concerns about agentic AI, for instance. That being said, the major AI firms are working closely with government partners to secure FedRAMP approval and the like. In the meantime, I know people who are concerned about not getting exposure to new tech in their job, and you're not alone in that.\n\nAnyway, I'll tell you what my manager told me, which is that your career development is ultimately your responsibility. It's very easy to feel like you're stagnating if you're not intentional about professional development. That's true no matter where you work and no matter what stage you're at in your career. \n\nIf I were you, I would have an earnest conversation with your manager to identify opportunities for you to develop your skills further. And by skills, I mean that very holistically; it's not just about learning specific technologies, but also soft skills like leadership and other complementary talents. For example, I'm looking into taking a statistics course since that's something that comes up often in my work. I also have set a performance goal to read at least two articles on relevant topics each week. Regardless of whether you plan to change careers, you can be cultivating a transferrable skill set; if you don't, these anxieties are likely to follow you wherever you go.",

You know you're being perceived, so you become self conscious, much like in a real interview.\n\nThough I note it won't be pleasant for the first few trials, I suspect it would cause adaptation to this problem, and work like gangbusters. Like you'd specifically intend to work through verbalizing algorithm complexity analysis in front of an audience on Twitch to practice working thru the issue in a similar state. You can modify the idea but the core is to be live streaming solutions, in front of an audience of at least one person (max ten maybe), who you know or don't know. \n\nAs a separate point, I suggest that there's multiple ways to approach becoming more comfortable, less nervous\\*, and cognitively smooth during  interviews. Could even work to just approach some programmers you know IRL and ask them, \"hey can I spend forty minutes explaining complexity analysis to you with examples over coffee? I'll pay for it.\" And then focus on being calm and collected throughout.",

I’m not sure what “full stack direction” means, but it seems like you’re primarily a frontend dev, which typically doesn’t pay as well. The vast majority of companies will not be using a JS framework for a backend because the language is not robust enough for large scale backend development.

My general approach, was to focus first on my own skills (the masters), then focus on the job skills (becoming tech lead), then finally optimize for hiring skills (LC + Systems Design + Behavioral). If you just focus on the interview skills, it's going to be difficult to really come across as an experienced engineer without the projects and wins on the job to back it up.\n\nHere's how I did it:  \n1. Take jobs at increasingly larger or better paying companies. You might not go \"small\" -> \"big tech\" in one jump, but push your limits and apply to scale-up companies with solid VC funding and lots of ex-big-tech employees.  \n2. Take every leadership opportunity you can, especially those unpaid \"tech lead\" or \"team lead\" spots. You're paycheck doesn't reflect the extra responsibility, but you're experience will be considerably better, and that should come across in interviews.  \n3. If you don't have a CS degree, go get your masters. This will accelerate how fast you grow as a junior/mid level engineer, and get you the technical profeciency to be a senior much faster. Plus, for a self-taught guy like me, it removes any sort of education difference.  \n4. Continue learning. Read books, work on projects, do whatever, just keep learning.",

Most people in tech would not make it in either of those, especially not HVAC. You can't be soft in those jobs like you can be in tech. And then are you really sure you want to take those 13 years of experience and basically flush it down the toilet? Because that's effectively what you'd be doing at that point. Basically no going back to tech if you go that route.\n- In regards to starting a business, you really should think long and hard about some of the problems you've encountered at work in the past and see if there are missing tools that you could work on. Doesn't have to be complex or fancy, just has to have no real or good solution currently. I'd put this variant way way higher than career switch if I were you.\n- What's your education? If you are some other engineering degree (electrical, mechanical, etc) you could probably look into more hardware focused companies and get more luck there. The job search for SWEs is different in those industries in some ways.\n- Sounds to me like you really need to do a deep postmortem analysis on your last failed interview and either grind LC much harder or get some help figuring out behavioral/system design questions...\n- From my recent experience with small companies, they aren't as rigorous with their interview process, so if you really do want a job sooner rather than later you might want to expand the search to those companies as well. Check yc for some of those companies, plenty posting jobs on LinkedIn as well. They come with some downsides obviously but beggars can't be choosers.",

Usually it's called \"real time programming\" or High performance computing (HPC). It involves supercomputer or regular computer to solves problem or process immense amount of data. Or it could be low latency code. Anything that is not web based usually will be subject to a tighter ressources allocation and thus performance being more important. Think of something mass produced, throwing 50$ more for better ram because you produced shit code and the price of the product is around 50$... It's just not acceptable.\n\n\nA real life example:\nSicentific computing is usually very computing heavy for things like simulations or lots of dimensional processing (think RGBs processing but on 280++ channels instead of just 3). These sometimes have tight performance requirements such as processing before another data package is generated. \n\n\nMy job is essentially that. I take bleeding edge reasearch code in python made by physicist and optimize the shit out of it so it takes little to no time to process. Initially the processing time was 18h ++ per dataset and now it's down to sub 2h making it so that we process faster than we acquire. This means it's processed in real time and you can have the results immediately which is neat for aviation decision, threat detection and all stuff highly critical.\n\n\nUsually it will require you to work with people of other domain which is very fun I think. You become good at physics, geospatial and other math heavy domain which makes leetcode feels even more stupid (because the time/space complexity is not all you look for in performance computing and usually one of the easiest thing to optimize). \n\n\nOverall, it's a very rewarding field as you may be recruted for satellites, geospatial, lots of physics project that are bleeding edge, quantum computing, etc. ",

If you’re an engineer at heart, your best bet would be to market your experience elsewhere but keep your job. A long vacation may be what you need to at least stave off burnout for a little while longer while you do it.\n\nBut burnout, contrary to popular belief, comes from a sense of a lack of control over one’s situation, not simply just the overwhelming workload you’re tasked with. In other words, a vacation will not save you on its own, no matter how awesome it is.\n\nMy advice would be to get 1:1s with the senior engineers on your team (NOT anyone on the management track.. yet). They should be on your side. Explain the challenges you’re facing and whether they have any advice for you. Best case is they identify that you’re being overworked and will help you manage upward. If you’re a high performer with a boss that won’t look out for you, it’s common that they will just assign more and more work for you without taking into account your workload. Managing upward comes with your growth as an engineer.",

At best, only small subsets our department work on the same project at the same time, and there can be a lot of siloing.\n\nOn the other hand, we do our best to cultivate a robust team culture of our own. We frequently share insights with one another (including at regular, roundtable department meetings),  do all sorts of bonding activities, try to ensure our bench is at least 2-deep on any topic, and we have a manager who thinks strategically about how we develop our staff and which projects we engage with. Even when our junior staff are going off on their own, we ensure they're never truly alone.\n\nAnyway, I would encourage you to speak with your manager about your concerns and what you can do to ensure you are learning/growing/thriving, not getting burnt out, and so on. You need to be managing up, helping your manager better serve you. Meanwhile, as others have said, you should have earnest conversations with the senior engineers on your team.",

It’s actually a lot of fun, did it back in college for a course and I thought it was neat. \n\nThat was C++ so part of the learning experience was learning how to clear out the memory when the instances of your DS went out of scope and called their destructors, also operator overloads were neat for things like linked lists so you could use them the same way you’d use arrays, but ofc that’s not a feature of Java.\n\nThen we used those DS in our own custom library to implement algorithms that demonstrated useful things you could do with them. \n\nI remember implementing wanting LL, DLL, Binary tree, self balancing binary tree, hashmap, graph, and a few other things but it definitely gave me a different perspective on programming. Obviously common sort algorithms etc. \n\nJust have fun with it",

YMMV because I don't work in ... lets say finance, with a bunch of finance bros who think they're super important all the time. I also work exclusively with Americans.",

I ended taking a job for a cloud db provider after I graduated, and for 2 years studied up on database implementation (red book), and operation systems (OSTEP) through a reading group.\n\nWhen I was hired for big tech 2 years ago, I ended up on a SWE team using AI for cost savings efforts (automate jobs, lol). The AI stuff is a good fit for me, but if the hype train ends for me I'll gladly go back to systems software.\n\nOverall, I think OMSCS was a big help, and even though I study on my own, the hours aren't close to OMSCS.

If you want to grind hard for FAANG, do it, but do it for yourself, not because you saw someone else did. $135k is a good amount of money, especially if not in a HCOL area. If you're maxing out your 401k and Roth every year, you're in an incredibly privileged position financially compared to most of the country. If you find yourself low on money to do the things you want, then looking for a higher paying job is a perfectly valid thing to do. If it's just because of FOMO though and you're happy in life, there's so many ways to spend your time in this world that grinding hard for FAANG may not be worth it for you.",

If no, what do you need to do to move to the next level? \n\nAs a side note, you can't really compare salaries at a 1:1 level. If you live in a lower cost of living area, 135k for a senior engineer makes total sense. If you're comparing that to what people are making in Seattle, you'll be disappointed but their cost of living is considerably higher. The median rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in Seattle is more than my mortgage for my 3 bedroom corner lot home. There's also the matter of hours worked. If you're in a job with a stable 40 hours, you might make less per year than someone working 60-80 hour weeks but ultimately more per hour.",

For one, very surprised to not see Chip Huyen's Designing ML systems book on the preparation side. I would strongly recommend that as a must-read. It focuses on the entire ML development lifecycle. I also think a lot of people overlook the fundamentals of stats, linear algebra, etc. These are especially important for measuring model performance. It's great if you can talk about system design, but I always expect candidates to be able to talk about if a model makes sense for a use case in the design round before we get into whiteboarding.\n\nAlso, outside of MAANG I actually see a lot more system design and knowledge questions than actually coding questions outside of maybe a leetcode easy for basic competency, so depending on the role you are targeting I would de-prioritize coding in favor of system design and model fundamentals. \n\nBest of luck finding and landing an MLE role",

The problem right now is that there is no strong signal you can do a job someone is actually paying for. Degrees get you past HR, but projects get you hired only if they look like real work. Generic advice like \"learn a new tech stack\", or \"biuld apps\" don't easily map to real business problems or existing teams.\n\nThat said, I'd recommend doing the following:  \n1. Focus on one of those areas (iOS, dbs, cyber).  \n2. Do projects that directly replicate an existing job function. Not a cool app, but stuff that maps directly to job skills.  \n3. Write them up like professional work.\n\nYou're not too late, but the market isn't going to meet you halfway, you have to make yourself legible as someone who can do the work. That's going to be challening, but the first task is to figure out what exactly the work even is. Use job postings, complaints, and look at the work juniors are assigned, and build a small system into a project that does that.",

It sounds to me like you are thinking in terms of android apps that are front-ends (effectively, websites). Thus, your logical conclusion is that to gain 'more depth' and employability, you should develop expertise in all parts of the application (i.e., backend).\n\nI want to challenge that point of view, and emphasize a few job-niches where smartphone apps really leverage the local computing power of a Snapdragon-level processor. In these cases, the app is not only a *part* of the project, it is *integral*. The android expertise you have is incredibly valuable for this use case.\n\nTake [ATAK-Civ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ) for example. It is a micro-ecosystem of apps and plugins that are used as tools for first-responding and security. Companies develop ATAK plugins using standard android tools, to do things like build software controllers for drones within ATAK, or stream health data from smartwatches of field operatives.\n\nAlternatively, Android (the operating system) is used by some companies for their own non-smartphone products. I recently interviewed with a company that builds treadmills. The treadmills use stock android for their OS and applications to serve standard functionality to their users and control hardware.\n\nThese are small companies, sure. There are hurdles to finding these, especially since you're not in the US. You will have to do research to find such companies. And they may pay less than a large company like the one you're at, because the scale of the revenue they generate is going to be intrinsically smaller (the other side of that coin is that the revenue is shared with fewer individuals, so you may actually get paid pretty well anyway). But they are working on *cool shit,* and they want experts in the tools to help them do so.\n\nSource: I am one of those guys working on cool shit",

My 2 cents:\n\n\nThe startup will make you better at building things quickly, give you access to way more interesting problems, and also allow you to have more responsibility than you ever would at big tech. \n\n\nThe tradeoff is that it’s the wild west. Coding best practices, well-scoped projects, clear roadmaps, internal tooling, may be minimal or nonexistent. That’s not inherently bad, and it can make shipping much easier, but there is less support in ensuring you’re writing good code, so it can very much be a sink-or-swim environment. \n\n\nI have learned much more in less time at my startup than I had at my previous big tech job, but my big tech job was very important in teaching me what large-scale corporate software development looks like: what guardrails are important, what good docs and code look like, how to navigate corporate politics, etc. I also think unfortunately brand name does matter and it was helpful to get my foot in the door when I started looking for jobs, but that can be overshadowed by building cool stuff.\n\n\nSo my main advice is to do your best to learn best practices in software development, and actively look for someone who is experienced and can mentor you.",

I recommend if you are aligned for Certification then IIT/IISc/IIIT brand are ok. I am not very keep on certification because in interviews your practical learning experience matters.

You build a camaraderie with the other workers, feeling like it's you guys vs the customers and the asshole regional manager which makes for a nice break from office politics and drama, too. \n\nWhen I wrapped up that work-cation and got back into software dev I felt like I had new life breathed into me. Despite my skills being a bit rusty I came back overall much better than I was before the burnout, mentally a lot sharper. Over the following 7 years I was able to nearly triple my pre-burnout salary.\n\nDuring the work-cation time you could also do some kind of side project that you always wanted to do like game dev, some AI project, whatever cool thing. It'll keep your skills sharpened and you can actually enjoy using your skills for yourself for a bit. Put the results on your github, and then you'll have a leg to stand on for the resume gap.",

I always ask if I can pair (or at least) shadow another engineer when I join a new team. Or start with non-functional changes like updating documentation. Hope your next internship goes well.",

GPA helped a bit, internships helped a lot, but neither was perfect or required for everyone.\n\nInterviews were usually basic coding, problem solving, and a lot of behavioral questions. This was true even a few years ago and still is now..\n\nYou’re not cooked. You’re just anxious because you care and have responsibilities. If you start preparing early, build a few solid projects, and apply consistently, you’ll be in a good spot..",
