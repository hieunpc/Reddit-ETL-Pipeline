They could focus on just doing platform work, or just building data products with a predefined set of tools.

Understand distributed computing and the Spark framework, so you can compute large datasets across many machines. Understand CICD with git and Jenkins. Understand the fundamentals of GenAI and know what it’s good at (summarizing and analyzing large text or logs / finding patterns in data points, deciding next steps in ambiguous situation, generating boilerplate code) and know what it’s not good at (it often will produce incorrect code and may hallucinate so always triple check its work, and does not need to be used to do things that are deterministic - I see a lot of overkill with GenAI which wastes money and time). \n\nOnce you have the foundation, you can adapt to any tool.",

Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:\n\n1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider \"how would this perform on millions of rows?\" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.\n\n2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.\n\n3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think \"how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?\"\n\n4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.\n\n5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like:\n  ​Detecting duplicate orders\n  ​Calculating running totals/moving averages\n  ​Handling NULL values and edge cases\n  ​Transforming nested/JSON data\n\n​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: \"I’m using a CTE here for readability\" or \"This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…\"\n\n​Good luck!",

I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.\n\nInsurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.\n\nI was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \\~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.\n\nNot sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024.

        "body": "I prefer to build streaming first.  It's not about the speed for me.  \n\nFirst, it's about control and localizing failure.  To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV.  That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled.  Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran.  If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements.  I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle.  It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.\n\nSecond, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another.  You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining.  If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead.  Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead.  I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do.  If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.\n\nLastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.  Mostly stateless operations with pipes in between.  Streaming tooling seems to map to this mental model better for me.",

Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.\n\nThey all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).\n\nNoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.\n\nWarehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",

You are on-site 100% of the time.  I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey.  Made me give up all of my hobbies post work.  Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6).  Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic\n* Labs are often in shitty locations.  Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time.  Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat\n* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works.  In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained.  Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.\n* No windows can be quite common in buildings.  Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)\n* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for.  Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older\n* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh).  I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD\n* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech.  You can't google and hit the right answer easily.  You really have to know what you are asking the internet.  Even then, the answers are likely not widely published.  People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers\n* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension.  For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions.  I have never seen that figure in IT\n\nLife as a DE:\n\n* Work from home is an option.  If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled\n* A much lower barrier to entry.  The idea you \"need\" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks.  DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is.  It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree\n* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close.  If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back.  I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc.  You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable\n* General working is a lot easier.  Synthesis of a product can take a long time.  A long one is multiple days if not weeks.  You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE\n* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful.  The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or \"has to\" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)\n* Zero manual labour.  Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is.  So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot.  Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl\n* Salaries are way higher on average.  After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industry\n\nSo what I'm saying is life is relative.  If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.  As somebody coming in from the other way in, it's definitely greener within the IT industry.",

We've had a long hiring phase and let me tell you what I've seen from interviewing:\n\n\\- Most larger companies get \\~1000 CVs in a day. Most of them are trash tbf, but recrutiers won't take much time to scan your resume. Make sure it's easy to read. Make sure there is impressive stuff in there. Look at your CV and compare yourself with 1000 random people. Is there any way you can change something to make it better than your competitors?\n\n\\- THEN work on the technical details. You'll most likely have some of these 3 interviews: SQL/Python, Data Modeling, Data Architecture/System Design. If it's not a startup they'll most likely ask you concepts and not directly questions related to a platform like AWS. So understand frameworks: Orchestration, Deployment, Quality Testing, Monitoring etc. You can learn those directly with Airflow, dbt etc. or even build it by yourself in Python. Cool project to show btw.\n\n\\- At any seniority, people suck at SQL. At least for an Analytics Engineering role, this should be your best mastered skill. JOINs, GROUP BYs, Aggregations are the most basic skills. People failed so frequently on rolling averages, knowing when to use a window function and when not, how to filter by year or month, not knowing anything about how queries execute etc. I still can't believe I've rejected \\~70% in a simple SQL round. Here's your first spot to shine.\n\n\\- Be a cool person. If we had a laugh and I'm between reject and pass, you'll likely pass.\n\n\\- For Data Architecture questions, learn tradeoffs: Correctness vs Latency, Storage vs Compute, Reliability vs Velocity, Efficiency vs Capabilities, Cap Theorem etc. When to use what + example use cases.\n\n\\- For Data Modeling its the same answer: Ingestion Layer (Event Logs, Snapshots) -> Facts (out of events)/Dimensions (out of snapshots) -> Aggregations/Data Marts -> KPIs. Understand what happens in every step. This is a usual dbt workflow, learn it by just moving some messy tables to create a final cool KPI.\n\n\\- If you want to add a personal project: Have a URL, let me click it and let me be able to explore it and think \"cool\". I won't ever use your project. But having something I could use already would make you stand out by a lot because you prooved you can deploy stuff.",

That works actually, better than what I was expecting.\n\nWhere these frameworks usually die is when people try to stretch them into solving the hard 20% - business logic, weird timestamps, broken upstream APIs, one-off edge cases,. At that point you are building a DSL inside YAML, and nobody wants to debug YAML on friday.\n\nThe happy middle ground is metadtaa drives ingestion and standard bronze/silver handling. Anythign complex gets real python module with tests. Configs stay declarative so cannot do programming in configs (which is good).\n\nFunny enough, I’d love to open source what we built but cororate legal treats sharing code like i am smuggling beer.\n\nSo yeah - do it as long as you are focusing on the repeatable 80% boring stuff. Good luck!",

If they all come from csv or txt, that makes it a lot more feasible. If it comes via API, well that is much more difficult to normalize as authentication, pagination rules, etc can be so different.

I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-\n\n1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. \n2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. \n3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. \n\nStart with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. \n\nMicrosoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. \n\nOne thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you. So figure out how to make it your puppet, you will win. \n\nYou WILL have an aha moment after 2-3 months and it will kick in. You will feel like you have a new superpower and feel like you have new energy. Every engineer I work with internally and externally has this moment if they break through the initial inertia - but it’s exhausting for those who have been grinding for years. \n\nYou got this!",

The fundamentals are still the same, so once you are able to figure out what the parallels are between the old and new tools you'll be in good shape.\n\nLearning Python is highly recommended, with maybe Go or TypeScript as a backup language. Learning how to use Pandas and later PySpark will help too. Data pipelines are now typically coded by hand in a programming language, or else configured in a tool like DLT or Bruin (ingestion tools) along with other tools like DBT for transformation. Definitely not impossible to transition, but be aware that it's a very different world than ODI, DataSphere, Cognos, Talend, or Informatica.",

Then they wanted reports to be made on them and didn't have anyone available so did that (Data analyst stuff) Then they needed more and to encorporate that (Back to DE). Its less about job title at a certain point if you find the ebb and flow and can learn tools to do what the business needs. I did that for 2 years before I considered my self good enough to be called a professional and not a junior. Maybe you move faster than that. Also Migrating from an old system to a new system is a part of the cycle. Snowflake and Fabric are current generation cloud tech, so you are getting a free education on how to use them, take advantage of it!\n\nAsk yourself, How would you build this whole system? What does the whole system look like? Data engineering isn't just ETL, its a big part of it but the data modeling and being able to serve the overall system is the important part. Do you understand the whole system?\n\nTimeline to understand when to move is kind of irrelavent. Actually understanding and being able to apply those skills is when you make a move. You don't just set that to arbitrary 6/12/24 month timelines. When you gain the capability and understanding thats when you can think about moving to the next thing. There is always a next thing.\n\n  \nBack when I started there was only MSQL 2000 and Crystal reports or SSRS. Now there are 50 different technologies to do the same with python , Java, or C#. So tools have gotten more sophisticated. Pick a path, learn that path, maybe use claude code/Code assistant of choice to help you build one, then read and understand how its built. Look up tutorials from youtube and compare that to your solution. Read the libraries and documentation that make it work. Then go from there. \n\nBuild a whole program that takes in data to do something useful. Kaggle has a bunch of examples for this.   \n  \nThe only way to get better is to build things.",

FP&A in my experience is awful because you get a bunch of excel jockeys who think that because they can maintain a rats nest of insane excel macros and formulas that they know how to “do data engineering”. \n\nI’m obviously generalizing, but in working in data for almost 10 years, this has been my experience working with several marketing/Finance teams across several companies",

They should know your roadmap/sprint board/whatever, so they don't think you're sitting on your asses and do nothing.  \n\\- If they have recurring issues, create a ticket, let them follow it. Whenever they try to blame, ask them to tell their lead to discuss with your data lead to prioritize it. If your lead declines, they won't annoy you because they know why they don't get it.  \n\\- Block urgent ad-hoc requests. Every request has to be a ticket with a clear description + impact + what happens if they don't have it within the next <time period>. With the last question a lot of urgent things will not be urgent anymore. Most of the time it's just a blocker they want to get rid off asap.   \n\\- Sometimes they actually don't have the data to do their jobs. Can you provide an interim solution by pulling raw data without implementing it into your data model? So they can run simple queries.\n\nKnow your people, try to be seen as an overworked ally who wants to unblock them.

        "body": "I work in Marketing Operations, and I find the challenges I deal with day-to-day are underestimated by management.\n\n1. I often find that I don’t have the data to do what is being asked of me. Most commonly, this happens when there is a campaign where the target audience is brand new. I cannot tell you how many times I find myself caught in email chains with compliance and legal where their segmentation criteria requirements specify data points that the company does not even have and has no way of obtaining in a timely or reasonable way. Many times, I will point this out to my superiors who will just ignore me and leave me to figure it out on my own because they have no idea what to do. This literally happened to me last quarter. 🤪 \n\nI work closely with the team that does operational comms, and it is similarly stressful because they do not always know what list criteria they will need or when. They often deal with Sudoku like puzzles where they have to build lists with pieces of information, from multiple applications and then find a method to validate the results.\n\nEven coordinating sends becomes challenging because of how dynamic the production process is. Multiple rounds of revisions means delayed approval which can push past the expected send date, causing sending conflicts that now have to be sorted out with multiple teams that often believe their message should be priority.\n\n2. Yes. “Everything is a fire.” 🔥 Things break unexpectedly all the time, and we are constantly conducting an orchestra in front of a live audience. Marketing comes to you complaining of “bad” data, but keep in mind that often we are fielding complaints from our stakeholders, triggering the inquiry. (FWIW Typically, I only flag anomalies after multiple observations or complaints. I also do some initial investigating on my end, like reviewing audit and sync error logs to rule out the obvious.)\n\nSuccessfully capturing UTM parameters is kind of like walking a tightrope if you have a bloated tech stack and duplicate records. Yes, collection CAN be the issue, but I’m 15 years into a career as an IC in digital marketing now, and I mostly pull my hair out from poor data practices upstream in the CRM (e.g; users deleting emails and creating a new record, duplicates merged where UTMs aren’t preserved, poor field level security or outdated/inappropriate user permissions, etc.) I’ve had an experience just in the last few years where the internal IT team decided to pull Marketing’s access to the native UTM fields (after 8+ years of having access) because a newer and more senior product hire had this as a requirement. It broke all of the UTM tracking from the website and some other applications, and I had to spend a year arguing with them to get it fixed 🙄\n\nThe practices I see in Salesforce in the last 5 years truly feel like a major regression from the ways that I learned to manage data and technology early on in my career. I worked for leaders that mentored me in [customer driven enterprise architecture](https://blog.opengroup.org/2021/01/28/providing-customer-driven-value-with-a-togaf-based-enterprise-architecture/). It feels like it’s become a foreign concept with what I see now. For example, I have worked for multiple orgs that will spend a good month if not more in between December and January completely caught up in territories, sales compensation and incentives, performance reviews and bonuses, etc. Entire calendars are blocked off and dedicated completely to the sales process and sales experience. I’ve seen how entire companies are stalled as they wait for decisions to be made. \n\nLastly, sometimes we work for people that will use their authority to put pressure on us or our managers to force us to do things we know are stupid. 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️ It’s riskier to say this if you work remotely, but when I worked in person, it’s the kind of thing I absolutely would’ve acknowledged in a whisper 🤫",

        "body": "Hi, a few things to consider.\n\n\\- Data Talks Zoom Camp uses GCP, whereas Data Engineering by Joe Reis uses AWS. Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in.  \n\\- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest.  \n\\- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn.  \n\\- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either.  \n\\- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc.  \n\\- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project. For the Deep Learning one, you can keep paying and extending as long as needed.\n\nOverall, I tried to finish Zoomcamp multiple times and was distracted, but I am in the final module of the Deep Learning course.",

Some of the others are less so, but overall it's pretty solid.  \n\nI'm half way through Joe Reis's Deeplearning and I'm torn on whether to finish it or not.  A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering).  It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side.  \n\nHis class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.\n\nPersonally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses.  And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.\n\nLastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some.  One year used Airflow for their orchestration, the next used Dagster and they might be using another one now.  Most orchestration tools are similar, so getting the basics done and then being familiar with other tools is a good thing.",

Not trivial to set up but at least gets you a unified format across the estate.\n\nCurious about your 80/20 caching strategy for common lineage paths.

Performance is better but not much. \n\nIt’s honestly been a very janky product. Random bugs, successful runs that silently failed, sporadic OOM errors when there is 64gb of memory available, and the list goes on. Shoot we are on azure and abctl would randomly crap out because of a missing AWS env var.

This is why popular HubSpot connectors in the marketplace, like HubSpot<>Salesforce don’t make multiple passes to retrieve internal ids on newly created records, because they were already messaged back in the same transaction that created them. My recommended IpaaS vendors for performance are Boomi or MuleSoft, which do true transactional bi-directional sync w/ record level error handling and use triggered polling instead of schedules",

My two issues are:  \n\\- Where and how to store the attribute account\\_code x service (which has a 1:N relationship): 3NF, Denormalized, Bridge Table, i2b2 model...  \n\\- How to join this information for reporting (e.g. at the SQL level as a table, as a view, or at the reporting level with Tableau Custom SQL or functions)\n\nAll of the models listed have a single pre-joined table other than A.  B connects each account code to the service, but then the aggregation has to be done at the reporting level (in this case, Tableau). I'm sensing that you'd recommend D (denormalized), in which in the service table, there's a column with the grouped account codes (e.g. Service B - 1-3101, 1-3102, 1-3140) and there's a bridge table that connect these groups with the individual account codes. But I'd appreciate if you could detail a bit more.\n\nThanks again!",

        "body": "Couple things from someone who was in a very similar “I like cloud + data but entry level feels impossible” spot:\n\nFirst, your background is actually a plus. Biomedical + CS + interest in AWS is a really solid combo for any company doing healthcare / medtech / clinical analytics. You’re not “just another CS grad” and you should lean into that in your branding.\n\nJob search stuff:\n\nYou’re not going to win by only applying through LinkedIn / Indeed. Use them to find roles, but assume most of your “wins” will come from:\n- Direct company career pages (especially mid‑sized boring‑sounding companies, not just the big names)\n- Alumni network from your undergrad and your MS program\n- Local meetups / online meetups (data engineering, cloud, healthcare analytics)\n\nOn LinkedIn specifically:\nSearch for “data engineer”, filter by Experience → Entry level / Associate, and also try “analytics engineer” and “data analyst” with SQL + Python + cloud. A lot of “data engineer” work is hiding under those titles and is more friendly to juniors.\n\nThen for roles you like:\nCheck who works there as a data engineer / analytics engineer / dev on LinkedIn. Add them with a short note like:\n“Hey, saw you work on X at Y. I’m a biomedical eng + CS grad student getting into data engineering (SQL/Python/AWS, a few personal projects). Would love to ask 2–3 quick questions about how you got started there if you have time.”\nYou’re not asking for a job, you’re asking for info. Some % of those chats naturally turn into referrals.\n\nTargeting-wise, with your background I’d look at:\nHealth tech startups, EHR vendors, medical device companies, hospital systems, insurers, pharma / biotech. They all have messy data and love someone who actually understands the domain.\n\nAlso, consider “bridge” roles:\nData analyst, BI dev, “reporting engineer,” even some backend roles with a data flavor. If they let you work with SQL, warehouses, ETL, and AWS, that’s a path into a pure DE title later. First job title matters less than “I have 1–2 years of real data work on my resume.”\n\nProjects:\nMake 2–3 small but real projects that scream “I can do data engineering” and “I know healthcare”.\nExample: pull some public health dataset, build a basic pipeline:\ningest → clean → store → query → simple dashboard.\nPut it on GitHub, write a 1‑page README that explains the problem, tech stack, and what you did. This is gold in interviews.\n\nIf you want to play with realistic internal‑tool type stuff: spin up a small web UI on top of that data so someone non‑technical could view / edit it. Tools like uibakery / Retool / Appsmith are handy for this, because you can show “I know how to wire APIs + DB + UI together” without spending months learning frontend. That’s closer to what a lot of internal data teams actually do.\n\nMindset part:\nThe “no light at the end of the tunnel” feeling is super normal. Most people don’t talk about the 200 ignored applications, just the 1 offer. If you’re sending out apps into a void with no feedback, shift some of that time into:\n- Reaching out to humans\n- Tightening 1–2 standout projects\n- Practicing SQL + basic data modeling + simple dbt / Airflow patterns so you crush technical screens\n\nYou’re not incapable. The market is just noisy and bad at surfacing juniors. Your combo of domain + CS + cloud interest is good. If you keep iterating on outreach + projects and stay flexible on titles, you’ll get a crack at it.",

Courses are an introduction to a topic.  Not a complete solution.  You do not do a course and become a complete programmer in the same way graduating with a medicine degree makes you ready to carry out complex, life threatening surgery.\n\nA common misconception is that all you need is a course.  Personally, I did an online courses.  I did a few actually.  6-8 months later, I got my first DE role with no experience whatsoever.  Without any further detail, this makes getting into DE sound really fucking easy.\n\nWhat isn't included is all of the work outside of those courses.  I was literally writing code, watching videos, reading blogs, writing stuff down, and generally thinking about programming for 60-70 hours per week every week for around 6 months.  And when I say writing code, I wasn't following tutorials.  I was googling the fuck out of the internet on how to try and do what I wanted to do.  As you can tell, that's a lot more than 70-90 hours.\n\nOn top of that, what's also not mentioned is my career before being in DE involved interpreting data on pretty much a daily basis.  Sometimes, stuff which you can't even measure, test, or see.  This makes working with data which travels between two places quite straightforward relative to somebody who hasn't had the same background as me.\n\n>I need to know so I know if I'm simply wasting my time. If they are nice additions that reflect skill, but at the end of the day, not enough on their own, and businesses really want a college degree.\n\nI'd be lying if I said a university degree doesn't make your life easier.  Of course it does.\n\nThat being said, you are only wasting your time if you think the course is \"enough\".  There are lot of soft skills which you can't really measure and they are a lot more valuable than the degree itself.  You have the massive benefit of not being time gated with what and how you learn which is balanced against not having a traditional degree.\n\nMy recommendation is work very heavily on your soft skills.  How you come across, how you analyse problems, present findings, and ultimately implement solutions will take you somewhere.  How long it will take, I can't possibly say.",

I am sure recruiting practices and circumstances are vastly different.\n\nI assume recruiters are going to weed out non college grads unless you have something going for you. Like internship experience at a decent or good company. So unless you have something that stands out from the typical compsci college grad, why shouldnt a recruit pick the college grad over someone that went through workshops and training courses?",

We are using polars and this means that for management tasks we have to use delta-rs, which is a package I like. But we tried Iceberg first, and hated pyiceberg package so much we decided on DeltaLake. Spark works with everything but is a truck of an engine. If you would be only processing gigabytes or low terabytes daily it's probably overkill. Stuff like AWS glue and similar are quite expensive for what they are (IMO)",

While we could build many narrow tools, that doesn’t scale well. Instead, we want a read-only, normalized analytics DB that’s simple for an LLM to reason about with SQL.\n\nOur main Postgres DB is very OLTP-oriented (lots of JSONB), and cleaning that up in-place isn’t feasible right now. So this analytics DB would be periodically synced (batch/CDC), disposable, and used only by the LLM.\n\nOn joins: we plan to pre-materialize join and window-heavy tables, so the LLM isn’t doing complex joins at query time.\n\nlmk your thoughts.",

Also for a reasonable amount of data, you can easily run into limits with what can easily fit into memory with Python.

For da ad hoc querying from api and then analyzing data in notebook, Pandas (or better these days to future proof yourself, Polars) is more likely to be a go to. It is a discreet analysis engine. It is great for flattening api json to tables quickly, it is modular so you can do step wise analysis, it is very quick to export from.\n\nBut for proper oltp or olap based de pipeline dev with traceability and db centric design, sql will be your bread and butter much of the time. \n\nI have moved from da to de and have been using more and more duckdb as my sql engine lately. It is olap so it doesn't have schema registration reqs as ready to enforce, but it can lazy process parquet from s3 VERY efficiently without significant memory required. The thing about pandas is that all ops are in memory, which is fine if your dataset is less than your available system RAM, but when you work with larger data or cloud based flows (and associated costs) limiting memory dependency is an important optimization. Polars also can help with this because it has lazy loading ops.\n\nAt this point for data collection i pull from api and collect as polars then pass to duck to write raw data as partitioned parquet. If I can do transformations in duck I do it all in duck directly querying the parquet. If there is something messy that I have difficulty doing in duck, I will do what I can with duck and then take it back to polars for lazy in memory vector ops. If I need to quickly inspect data I use pandas converted tables because I am more well versed on pandas. I also use pandas where iteration line by line is necessary (like api lookup). Ultimately I will typically then write processed flattened consumable data as partitioned parquet. Then depending on case I use duck to query for analysis myself, or I serve flattened data as csv somewhere that it can be consumed by end usage app like power bi.",

Then I got hired and went through an onboarding program at work, became a junior developer, then promoted to software developer, etc.\n\nOnly in the last 1-2 years or so did I start coding with the assistance of AI. Furthermore, I just started learning React to learn the front-end of software development.\n\nAI tools like Copilot have dramatically increased my ability to learn AND to catch my own errors faster.\n\nPage not working? I can reason with Claude and say: “Here’s what I’m trying to do on lines 100-115 within this component. I’ve tried x, y, and z but it’s still not loading properly.”\n\nThen Claude will run its magic, offer me several solutions and most importantly explain *why* it gave those answers. Then the lightbulb goes off for me. It’s like having a teacher in my back pocket.\n\nI *could* spend 2 hours trying to solve a problem. But I like the happy medium approach: bang my head against the problem for 15-20 minutes and if I still can’t get past it, then I ask Copilot for help. \n\nIt still gives me a chance to use my brain, yet I don’t spend all my time chasing down useless tutorials and outdated answers from 3 years ago.\n\nThe key to learning with AI isn’t to just get the answer. It’s to understand *why* it’s giving you the answer in the first place. Then the next time you encounter the same problem you know what to do. Or should at least conceptually know how to get past it.",

Students don't ask the teacher to just write the code for them; so why would you ask an LLM to do so?\n\nPart of learning off searching other people's answers is their answer might not be 1:1 with your problem and you may still have to figure out how to apply their solutions/thought processes. It just helps you problem solve all the more.\n\nAnd during the journey of actually searching and learning you're way more likely to discover solid resources for learning, while an LLM will *always* want you coming back to it.

It helped me. \n\n```\nWhen (and only when) the user is asking a technical / software-engineering-related question (coding, debugging, architecture, tooling, infra, performance, data, etc.), follow the Technical Coaching Policy below. For non-technical questions, respond normally.\n\n<TECHNICAL COACHING POLICY>\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE (highest priority)\nMaximise the user’s learning through their own thinking and decisions. Be a force multiplier for skill and clarity—never a replacement for reasoning. Success is defined by the user understanding and being able to do it themselves.\n\nOPERATING MODES (stateful; affects technical questions only)\n- COACH mode (default): You guide and scaffold; you do not deliver full solutions.\n- DIRECT mode: You may answer normally (including complete solutions/code).\n\nMODE SWITCH COMMANDS\n- Switch to DIRECT mode when the user’s most recent message contains: FORCE_ANSWER\n- Switch to COACH mode when the user’s most recent message contains: RESET_COACH\n- If both appear in the same message, the command that appears last (latest position in the message text) wins.\n- Treat these as literal, case-sensitive substrings.\n- When a mode switch happens, do NOT require the user to restate their question. Proceed to answer the same message in the newly selected mode (ignoring the command text as part of the “question”).\n\nSCOPE: WHAT TO COACH VS WHAT TO ANSWER DIRECTLY (in COACH mode)\n- Coaching rules apply to: debugging, implementation, architecture, system design, algorithm choice, performance work, refactors, “why is this failing?”, “how do I build X?”.\n- Direct answers are allowed for pure reference/lookup: syntax, flags, API names, definitions, small factual recall (act like a fast search engine). Optionally add a brief pointer to context only if helpful.\n\nCOACH MODE RULES (default)\n1) Do NOT provide end-to-end solutions.\n   - No complete working code that solves the user’s specific task.\n   - No “recipe” that substitutes for the user’s key reasoning.\n   - No copy-paste “fixed version” of their program.\n\n2) Keep the user driving the process.\n   Prefer questions first, but you may steer (measuredly).\n   - Clarify: goal, constraints, environment, expected vs actual, what they tried, minimal reproduction.\n   - Ask for evidence: exact errors, logs, inputs, versions, failing tests, timing, stack traces.\n   - Help them form and test hypotheses: “If X were true, we’d observe Y—can you check?”\n\n3) Provide high-leverage guidance.\n   - Offer mental models, tradeoffs, and “what to look up” keywords.\n   - Suggest divide-and-conquer debugging: reduce the case, bisect changes, isolate dependencies, add instrumentation, check invariants, write a targeted test, compare known-good vs failing paths.\n   - You may validate/invalidate hypotheses with brief reasoning and a concrete verification step.\n\n4) Code policy (allowed, but cautious)\n   - Small snippets are allowed only as scaffolding: illustrative examples, minimal patterns, function signatures, partial skeletons, pseudocode, TODO holes.\n   - Snippets must not be the full solution to the user’s stated problem.\n   - Escalate snippet specificity only when necessary and only after the user has attempted steps and reported back.\n\n5) Progressive disclosure (escalation)\n   - Start with the minimum effective hint(s) + 1–3 concrete next checks.\n   - If the user returns with results, escalate: more targeted questions, sharper hypotheses, slightly more concrete skeletons—still no full solution in COACH mode.\n\n6) Communication style\n   - Be concise and actionable.\n   - Prefer a short plan + next step(s) + what to report back.\n   - Do not restate these policies unless asked; just operate this way.\n\nDIRECT MODE RULES\n- Answer the user normally and directly, including complete implementations if requested.\n- Still ask clarifying questions if required for correctness.\n- Remain in DIRECT mode until the user sends a message containing RESET_COACH.\n\n\n</TECHNICAL COACHING POLICY>\n```",

You will first need to obtain a solid Java foundation before even attempting Algorithms. Both CS50 and CS50p are roughly at the same level of courses - both are *introductory* courses.

There, [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) or [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org) would be the appropriate starter points.\n\nNand2Tetris is a fantastic foundation course that *can* help you get a deeper understanding, but mainly will help if you want to go into *embedded* development (think SoC - System on a Chip or IoT - Internet of Things).",

That book is a product of its time: it focuses on C++ and Smalltalk which, at the time the book was written, were in a really bad place compared to today.\n\nThe issue, in my opinion, is \"expressiveness.\" Meaning, how easy is it to articulate a complex design in code?\n\nExpressive languages make it easy to accomplish complex tasks with code that is concise and easy to read and understand. The opposite is a language where those same tasks take far more code, and that code is difficult to read and understand.\n\nMost popular languages today are far more expressive than the popular languages of 30 years ago, even when they are technically the same language with 30 years of evolution between the two versions.\n\nWhen a language plus its standard library plus popular 3rd party libraries all combined push you toward a solution to your problem then yes, one could argue there is a design pattern there. But it was implemented in a library or framework, and you are simply along for the ride. Recognize the structure of the code, take a mental note, and move on. Go with the flow, not against it.\n\nI have over 25 years of experience in this field and I would struggle coming up with the \"most\" important thing to learn. I could certainly bucket sort various topics and say \"these are somewhere near the top\" and pattern recognition is certainly in that bucket.\n\nOther crucial skills to have:\n\n* Understanding data structures and algorithms. Even if you never implement a B-tree or linked list, understanding how they work will help you understand topics such as database indexing or queues.\n\n* Soft skills: working with project managers, QA, and customers. Knowing how to break down complex technical topics to people who do not have a computer science degree. Car analogies work well here.\n\n* A willingness to learn new things. Sometimes the easy, comfortable solution is ideal for your ego but not ideal for the project. Always be willing to expand your knowledge and learn new things as needed.\n\n  I also recommend working on personal projects on your own time outside of work that put you outside of your comfort zone - maybe learning a new aspect of a tech stack you already know, or learning a new tech stack. This flexibility will serve you well over the course of your career.",

It is funny how people just design the same stereotypical architectures over and over. After seeing lots of projects, you start to recognize patterns more easily.\n\n2. Search. You get really good at searching for code fragments. It can be anything; an error message, a UI string, something to get you to some file / line that is related to the bug.\n\n3. Call graphs. Once you find some relevant code, then you start branching out from it to find the exact components involved in your task. Hopefully your language has a strong type system so you can just right-click and \"find all callers\" (my biggest gripe about Ruby was that this never worked). Or else you use a debugger to break on that line and inspect the callstack while the code is running. \n\nI feel like these 3 things explain most of it. Give yourself time. It's a whole skill that takes time to learn.\n\nOh wait, I forgot one more:\n\n4. Ask people. So many people are shy, or want to prove they can work independently. But this is so wrong.

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why \"shift registers\" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!\n\nDon't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a \"perfect\" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around. \n\nBest suggestion is to start where you are, e.g. learn some Python, and work your way down, look at some assembly, then work your way up, towards more abstract programming concepts, data structures and whatnot, then back down again to another language, maybe C, and understand memory management, up again to understand garbage collecting and compilers, down again to understand addressing and registers in the CPU, and so on and on - not necessarily in this particular order, that was just a random example I made up on the spot.\n\nBut take a look at \"**Code**\", and try to write programs in your chosen higher level language that handles binary conversion, and select topics based on your current interest.\n\nAlso, if you are interested in the human history behind the computer, check out \"**The Innovators**: H*ow a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution*\" by Walter Isaacson.",

Presented a unique dilemma for which it has no model, any solution it came up with would be based purely on other solutions for other problems. It has no capacity for true creativity.

Three buts, actually.\n\nBut: most of the OO frameworks out there have everything inherit from Object or some other abstract class. It helps to know that.\n\nBut: polymorphism -- methods of the same name doing different things based on context -- is a useful thing to understand.\n\nBut: the more recent innovation of Interfaces is actually useful. It's not nearly as clunky as interitance, and certainly not as clunky as multiple inheritance. And it lets us do lots of useful things. If you understand inheritance, Interfaces are easy.\n\nSo, yeah, don't let stupid professor tricks grind you down. There's a pony somewhere in that stable, so keep shoveling.",

I've had the privilege of being on college review panels, and I've told them their game dev classes don't teach game dev. I've told them their OOP classes don't teach OOP.\n\nNo one cares.\n\n> I don't like object-oriented programming, I think it's often overabstracted and daunting to write code in\n\nFrankly, I doubt you have any idea what OOP even is. At all. If the first words from your lips aren't \"message passing\", then you don't know. If you've at least heard of it, but don't know how to implement it, you still don't know OOP.\n\nYou're not wrong for not liking OOP, I just want you to understand it so that you know why you shouldn't like it.\n\n> But if you learn OOP as a course in college, you'd know that professors seem to think that it's God's perfect gift to programmers.\n\nI think at this point this is a holdover of when OOP was the dominant paradigm across the industry. We're still dealing with the mess the 90s had made.\n\nMost academic material is going to teach Python, Java, or C++, and they're either going to teach procedural Python, extremely bad Java focused on syntax, or C with Classes fucking imperative bullshit.\n\n> My biggest problem is that colleges overemphasize inheritance as a feature. \n\nThis is so loaded it's not even wrong. There is an overemphasis inheritance, mostly from a C with Classes legacy.\n\n> Inheritance can be useful, but when used improperly, it becomes ridiculously difficult and annoying to work with.\n\nLike trying to eat soup with a claw hammer, the wrong tool for the job makes the job difficult. Your intuition - that pain your feeling, should be screaming that you're doing the wrong thing, and you need to seek out a different solution you don't yet know.\n\n> In software engineering, there is a concept called \"orthogonality\" [...] Inheritance completely shits on that.\n\nIt doesn't. Software has many assholes, and can shit out of any one of them, any combination of them, or all of them at once.\n\n> OOP can have some very subtle and easy to overlook rules in how inheritance and polymorphism work\n\nYou've conflated a paradigm with your language of choice. OOP says nothing about how either of these principles work. C++ alone has over a dozen different types of inheritance, at least a dozen different types of polymorphism, and several different object representations. THAT is what you have to look out for.\n\n> so it's very easy to create subtle bugs that are hard to reason about. \n\nWith language specifics in context, yes.\n\n> So yeah. By all means, learn OOP, but please do it well. Don't learn it the way professors have you learn it\n\nThe problem I've seen across academia is that the professors don't know what they're teaching, or they're not actually allowed to teach the paradigm - if they do know it. Typically they only teach the princples - abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. But even the Functional Programming paradigm has and exercises all these principles. This suggests a paradigm is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n> focus on composing classes rather than inheritance.\n\n    class C {\n      int i;\n      float f;\n      char c;\n    };\n\nBehold! HAS-A composition through tagged membership. Classes defined in such a way are tagged tuples.\n\n    class C: std::tuple<int, float, char> {};\n\nBehold! HAS-A composition through private inheritance, the same as above with the same amount of coupling. Changing either will implementation will change the definition of the type and force a recompilation of all downstream code clients.\n\nThe latter comes with a lot of benefits. Those members will all default initialize, which I find quite annoying (there are workarounds) but most people think it's a benefit.\n\nContinued...",

When you figure out your studies and you feel that the studying process is going well, then sure, you'll have a chance. Not right now.\n\nAnd even when you figure it out then you'll have an uphill battle ahead. Why a company should hire you over a Bachelor degree holder, a vocational school diploma holder, an ex-intern, a Junior developer changing a company, a desperate mid-level developer trying to find a job? How will you stand out?\n\nThe current job market is difficult even for professional developers. And even more for fresh university graduates. People without a degree have little chance.\n\nSo, you'll have two obstacles: figuring out the study process itself (as you are stuck right now) and figuring out why the company should hire YOU.\n\nMy advice would be going for a degree. Like this you'll have a structured study plan made ready by people who know the industry. You'll have more options available. More doors opened for you. And you being 36 does not mean it is too late to go for a degree. I did a career change when I was 28-32. Got my degree when I was 32 and got hired then. Followed it up with Master degree studies as well. We had guys in their 30s studying with course mates 10 years younger than them. No issues what so ever. Some few were also in 40s.\n\nIf, for some reason you are not going for a degree then you have to start building real life projects that will be taken into a real use either by you, your family and friends, or by somebody else. That will make you stand out. But if you make template tutorial \"projects\" that just sit in your Github and nobody will use these, then you'll have very little chance.",

It is natural that you don't see much use yet.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: even the most complex, largest program builds on the same fundamentals that you are learning now.\n\nDon't know what course you are doing, but I'd highly recommend the MOOC [Python Programming 2026](https://programming-26.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki. It is free, textual, extremely practice oriented and a proper first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\". Sign up, log in, go to part 1 and start learning.\n\nReal world use does not only mean GUI programs. In fact, the vast majority of programs run in the console, somewhere in the background where nobody apart from the people who work and maintain these programs see them. These programs are services, servers, etc.\n\n> how could I use it to make web app\n\nAgain, learn and solidify the fundamentals first. Patience is key. You cannot jump from not even have built the foundation of your house to the fifth floor. You'll eventually get there, but the process is gradual. One topic builds upon the previous one. Once you are getting there, you will find Flask and Django as well as FastAPI as web frameworks for Python.",

Programming is like programming. Believe me when I say my brain does work in similar ways, and I understand why you are trying to create these abstractions, but be careful because they can be misleading.\n\nFor example, in your model, a web application might be a bunch of separate \"flowcharts\" that share parts of their path.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but in the real world, software can be *quite* complex. Yes, it doesn’t branch infinitely in a literal sense the way a fractal might, but there are almost always far too many twists and turns to keep in your head all at the same time. Most real programs are more like a circle than a straight path, and the only reason that thats even true is that we write them to work that way so that we have some chance at reasoning about them.\n\nThe good news, though, is that you don’t need to keep it all in your head at the same time. Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes). Considering (and especially depending on) things outside the function can even be a liability.\n\nI’m glad that you’re sticking with it! Just don’t get too disheartened when you start working on larger programs snd start to see a lot of complexity. Remind yourself that you don’t need to understand every level of the process at the same time.",

        "body": "First, domain names are like file paths, just backwards. Instead of /foo/bar/baz/folder/myfile, you have myrecord.domain.baz.bar.foo. The domain name 9gag.com is registered as living on a set of nameservers that the folks at 9gag control, and they can put as many records there with as many levels of dots as they like (up to the limits of the system, which maxes out at 255 characters for a full domain and at most 63 characters between dots).\n\nSecond, the Internet predates the Web. There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - \"www\" for \"World-Wide Web\".\n\nBut it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's \"front door\", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (\"TLD\"), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)\n\nRather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the \"www\" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the \"canonical name\" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those:\n\n    $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a\n    www.9gag.com.           300     IN      CNAME   9gag.com.\n\nWhat that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of \"www.9gag.com\", it gets an answer back saying \"use the address of 9gag.com\". So it has to turn around and look up \"9gag.com\" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",

Yet, that is the tricky and difficult part. \n\nSince in current times, people are hand-held all their lives they don't want to give up being hand-held and spoon-fed. They don't dare to let go and less know how to stand on their own feet.\n\nThis was very different in the old days when there were no tutorials. You learnt by experimenting, by trying, by failing. But there also was more time and less competition.\n\nNow, fast is key. Which is completely wrong. Speedrunning learning leads to nothing.\n\nWell back to the original topic:\n\nThere are good, mediocre, and outright rubbish tutorials and there are *courses* - this is an important distinction.\n\nProper *courses* are e.g. the CS50 series from Harvard, the MOOCs from the University of Helsinki, Algorithms from Princeton, and countless others. Common to all of them is that they have a proper, educational curriculum, are approved and battle tested, and never pre-chew and spoon feed solutions - they all make the *learner* do the work.\n\nNow *tutorials* on the other hand, generally pre-chew and spoon feed. They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.\n\nWorst tutorials are *\"How to build X in language Y\"* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.\n\nAbout *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.\n\nI still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program. Experiment, try things, break them, fix them, play around with the code. The more you struggle, fail, and play around, the more you learn.",

You've got the basics of these concepts from tutorials so lets try to get deeper into it. That is where you can find your next area to focus on where to improve. You could go back to tutorials for those or maybe documentation, it all depends on what it is you're struggling with.\n\nIn short, tutorials are good for getting a basic idea of something (like how to connect a database to a website), but you only really learn and retain the info it tried to teach you if you then also try to do it on your own with your own project(s).

They should be identifying a field and learn the languages and tools used in that field.\n\nIf you just learn a random language, you could be stuck in tutorial hell because once you are done learning that random language you may well find that nobody actually uses that language in the field you are interested in.\n\ne.g. you are advised to learn Pascal in response to the incorrect question because of its clarity and simplicity. Then you want to work in robotics. Sorry, go back and learn C/C++.\n\n## watching/reading but not doing\n\nA common problem I see is people complaining that they slogged through the entire series, but then can't do anything.\n\nThat is because they slogged through the series and everything that went in one ear, got pushed right out the other side.\n\nPeople need to regularly press pause on the tutorial (or bookmark the book) and try  out what they have seen. Experiment with it. Try to get it to do something else. For example, if taught how to create a loop that counts from 1 to 10, try to make it so that it goes from 10 to 1.\n\n## AI\n\nThis will be triggering for some - especially the AI propaganda bots. But AI is a double edged sword.\n\nIf used correctly, to search, consolidate or explain it can be a useful tool.\n\nBut if it is used to generate code - especially on anything more than an occasional basis then the risk is the same as my previous \"... not doing\" point.  \nBut it is more insidious. IMHO.\n\nIn another sub that I moderate, we get a lot of posts along the lines of \"I used AI to write the code for the lessons and some basic things, but now I'm trying to do my own unique thing. It doesn't work and I don't know how to fix it.\".  \nEven worse, because they have been copying and pasting the AI gibberish, they often don't have the vocabulary to clearly explain what is going on nor understand the changes proposed (unless someone rewrites it for them).\n\nThe solution? Go back to the basics, ditch the AI and actually try doing stuff yourself.\n\n---\n\nThese are just 3 common and hopefully easy to understand examples that I have observed over and over.  \nIn my career I've seen plenty of other types of mistakes but these are a bit more subtle and complicated to explain.\n\n\n---\n\nYou also asked about:\n\n> ... and still can’t build anything without hand-holding (after doing the tutorials)\n\nThis one is a bit harder and probably is an it depends scenario. Again from my experience, I've seen the following:\n\n* The person is perfectly capable to do it, but lacks personal self confidence.\n* The person is new to a project and needs help becoming assimilated with the organisation of the code and the standards used in the project.\n* Some people have learned the technology by rote without understanding how it works \"under the covers\". Example, they know that they can use a `long` or regular `int` and can't understand why sometimes both work and sometimes one might get weird negative values unexpectedly (and I'm thinking C here, but also some other languages).\n* When joining a new project, people are often on probation and part of the probation involves mentoring.\n\nThere are other possible reasons including \"they didn't do the tutorials correctly\".",

That said, if you did do changes to your code without these before, you can improve code quality without. I am saying this, because it can seem that you are not allowed to improve code quality before you learn about two or more different things. (But since unittest is build into the standard library, maybe give it a try and write some simple tests for the functions you change!)\n\n\\- \"but I’m worried that even then it will still feel messy\". Yes, it will still feel messy, but thats just the first step, that enables the next ones. Its a journey and while the goal \"tidy code\" can be helpful as motivation it can also be overwhelming. \n\n\\- Talking about \"proceeding in steps\": A simple technique that can help is identifying sections in code, lines that belong together. Give these sections a comment saying what the section does. Then try to pull out that section into a function. The function name now can take the task that the comment had: It tells what happens, without the need to reading the whole function. Try to make the function only rely on the parameters you pass to it instead of \"global state\" (also called a \"pure function\"). This makes the function easy to test and to understand. This might not always be easy, but at least check if its possible. \n\n\\- There are a lot of helpful texts there – [https://refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a good online resource, Fowlers book \"Refactoring\" is also pretty helpful. Initially read them as inspiration, like browsing a cookbook, don't force yourself to use the methods immediately. Most likely, you will stumble upon a problem soon and be reminded of a section you have read. Then, find that section and give it a second read and try to follow its advice.",

Taking a big function and then making functions out of it often means that you're just switching between different functions, but have the same complexity.  That's often actually worse.\n\nBreaking things down into \"input, process, output\" helps dramatically, especially if you can then extract the \"output\" to a separate method/object.  If your big function makes a call to an API, does something with it, makes a call to another API, etc?  Try to separate at those boundaries, or push things to the end.  A useful pattern can be to gather up all of the changes you want in your function, and then apply them at the end.\n\nOne strategy I've often used is to \"chop the tail\".  What that means is finding the very last thing the function does, and then creating a new function at that point, taking all of the data it needs as parameters.  You can then work through the function as a whole.  This differs from the \"substep\" method because you can, when you make that final call, basically forget about what happened before that.  If you call that last function with the right parameters, then the previous function was correct.  That's also where things like mock objects come into play.",

Grab a big wall calendar with the entire year on a single page and a red marker. Cross off every day you do something. Try not to break the chain. The longer the chain gets, the more inclined you will be to continue and not break it.

Reread your code, run it, remind yourself what problem you were solving. Youll find it comes back way faster than starting over would.The restart urge is also a perfectionism trap.

Learn how to make a GitHub and update it locally as you make changes. Pick one language and stick with it for a few years, you will naturally run into other simpler languages and use them either way (HTML and CSS will come up A LOT). The project you start should be practical and allow some level of interaction for the user (login, fill cart, request info, etc;) and demonstrate competency managing this information on the backend.   \n\n\nIf you’re more inclined to make games or something more amusing, follow a tutorial of someone that just does sessions from time to time and uploads it.

My degree played no role in getting this job. \n\nIf you’re unable to get an apprenticeship, get a part time job that gives you enough money to do what you need, buy some Udemy courses (they’re dirt cheap), watch YouTube tutorials, use AI to help demistify any concepts you’re unsure of, build applications, get on LinkedIn, build a network, attend  meet-ups and then start applying…. Don’t even wait till summer to start doing this, do it now.\n\nBy the time your peers will have finished Uni, you could already be working as a junior dev, with 6 months to a year of experience under your belt and £0 student debt, which means more money in your pocket…. \n\nThat’s what I wish I had done.",

They know you won’t know every answer so just engage and tell them your thought process while approaching problems \n\nMake sure you test your Python install and have the tools etc working so you can run the code you write\n\nYou’ll probably get a task to do.  Don’t be afraid to look things up online if allowed. I’d expect you to use the Python docs \n\nYou’ll be sharing your screen so make sure you don’t have anything inappropriate open / nsfw desktop wallpaper etc\n\nIf you’re given a coding task mock out what you plan to do in pseudo code first.  Throw some empty functions in etc.  just do what you need to outline the problem and what you’re going to build so it’s clear to you\n\nIf they give you a task which has multiple parts get one working then the next. Don’t try do everything all at once.  I’d rather see a candidate get 2/3 problems solved and miss one than have 80% of all 3 and nothing working. \n\nSay to yourself make it work then make it better.  And say to them that’s what you’re doing. \n\nIf you have a short amount of time prioritise what you have to do and talk about the stuff you would do.  Like you won’t have time to write perfect error handling or unit tests but say where you would add them and why.  \n\nThe biggest thing to remember. Interviewers usually aren’t assholes.  They aren’t looking to trip you up it’s just an assessment of where you’re at so try enjoy it as much as you can.",

        "body": "Some advices:\n\n\\- Don't get stuck on the \"learning new languages\" cycle, SPECIALLY on high-level programming languages. It's fine if you do this for a while, but the diminishing returns become heavy after. This is because newcomers don't yet have the necessary exposure and knowledge to do \"new things\", therefore they just fall in the trap of: learn new language -> learn basic syntax -> pretty much do nothing actually minimally important (to your learning) with this language -> get bored because you pretty much did nothing -> learn new language.\n\n\\- Try to diversify your initial learning over several areas of computing: graphics, distributed systems, embedded systems, operating systems, application development (web & mobile), and so on...   \nQuick extra tip: place your effort into learning operating systems more, everything nowadays use an operating system as a basis, and therefore having at least a minimal understanding of how they work is important.\n\n\\- Try spending the majority of your time in an actual low-level programming such as C. I wouldn't recommend C++ just yet, because it won't give the same effect to a beginner as C does, this is because since C++ abstracts some stuff, beginners are prone of thinking about some features as an \"API\", which is not really what is happening, and this creates the exact opposite effect of what we want, since APIs in programming are usually perceived as a black box, and you don't want a black box, you want to actually understand what is going on. \n\nJust an additional note: I'd recommend coupling low-level programming learning with your OS studies.\n\n\\---------\n\nI'd take my advices with a grain of salt however, because it really depends on what stage you already are, and what type of approach you have towards your learning process. I also think it's pretty important you start recognizing early on what is holding you back, and what isn't, because believe me, it's very easy to stagnate when learning programming, and it's very hard to get out of that hole as well.",

For me, that goes over the line into just blatantly copying. That said they may have had licensing agreements behind the scenes so it is hard to know.

Self-teaching + building a mental model _does_ indeed require non-trivial mental effort.\n\nOne tip: When I need to read through particularly gnarly code, I like to keep notes in a separate text file or doc.\n\nI typically structure this in a 'question -> answer' kind of way, where I create a separate section for each open question or \"line of investigation\" I have. Maybe I'll also create a separate section for quick links, TODOs, snippets of cli commands to run, etc.\n\nI find having this sort of structure makes it much easier for me to stay focused, especially in cases where I feel too overwhelmed trying to mentally remember and keep track of everything.\n\n> I wonder if that is something that gets better after some time.\n\nIt will -- as you get more familiar with the code, you'll have to spend less and less time digging, simply by virtue of you already being familiar with more aspects of the codebase.\n\nEven longer term, it'll get easier once you've worked on enough systems to start seeing similarities and echos. For example, if you've spend a fair amount of time working with backend and cloud infra, new codebases in the same domain will start feeling vaguely similar. There are only so many ways of reasonably structuring code after all.\n\nI'll take time for both types of familiarity/experience to grow though: it's totally expected/normal to feel a bit lost as an intern or new hire.\n\n> This is my first in person internship, so I don't know if it is normal to just stand up and walk for 5 minutes. That is what I used to do in remote internships.\n\nThis is also normal. I've been programming professionally nearly a decade or so, and I also take short breaks once every hour or two. A quick stretch break, refilling my water, etc.\n\nIf I'm feeling particularly stumped/annoyed, I'll often go on a longer 15-20m walk break, maybe step outside to grab some fresh air...\n\nEvery now and then, I figure out how to \"enter the zone\" and manage to stay focused for hours and hours, though this usually happens when I'm writing code as opposed to debugging + investigating. I consider myself lucky when this happens: I haven't yet figured out how to reliably enter flow for the latter.",

The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.\n\nThere's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow \"cannot\" happen, so it can correctly optimize the \"obviously\" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.\n\nThus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.\n\nFurther, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.\n\nUB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.\n\nA lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB. These engineers would NEVER get a job working on critical systems, where that attitude is going to get a people killed, cause billions in damages, or cause unrecoverable losses.\n\nI hear the attitude - \"We're not saving lives, here...\" Yeah? You wanna diminish your company and it's product more? Do that in front of the CEO. You might not be saving lives with every product, but to be dismissive is also putting the revenue streams and the reputation of the company at risk. No one wants to hear it. It's as serious as it can be everywhere you go - and anyone who isn't serious about it is a toxic person you shouldn't be working with.",

But for the fourth problem, I was able to apply a lot of the ideas I saw in the solutions to the first, second, and third problems. It turns out that most solutions to BFS problems look very similar.\n\nIn my view, LeetCode is about pattern recognition, and it really helps to structure your studying in a way that helps the patterns \"jump out at you\".",

For example, [\"Conventional Commits\"](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.\n\nAs far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one \"right\" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.\n\nIf you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.\n\nFor instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. \n\nThe first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (\"perf\") in the scheduler (\"sched\") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.\n\nAgain, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.\n\n----\n\nNote also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change. If the commit included other bug fixes at the same time, it would be a lot harder to write a good description.\n\nYou might think that carefully breaking up your changes into multiple commits is just creating more work, but if you do it properly, it can make things easier for you in the long run.",

Then again everyone has their own style— but definitely do not do `git add .` — source control is your friend, it’s one of the icons on the left hand side of VS code that looks like a merge request icon IIRC. Commit a message for each file, and make it a habit to commit frequently until you get a feel for appropriate checkpoints.\n\nEdit: `git add .` is fine for initial project template / codebase, or overall changes — just don’t work on something for several hours and then be lazy / cut corners with it. Proper documenting of ongoing and frequent changes is essential if your goal is to eventually work with a team at any level from small to enterprise. Some teams have a specific recommended standard for commit verbosity and frequency as well!\n\nEdit edit: If your mind is searching for a statement for a commit and can’t find it— you can describe what you did to any LLM and it should be able to help you. \n\nEg; “I added a variable that is part of my useState into the array at the end of a useEffect” becomes “Added a dependency to useEffect hook that refreshes the state of the page should that dependency change” — these are equally concise but one is more *technically accurate*.",

So don't limit yourself to applying to software developer jobs (which you probably won't get). If you can get on as tech support or the like, especially at a big company which also employs developers, that gets you working and accumulating experience in a somewhat related field. Self taught vs B.Sc. plus internship is not a battle you're going to win with most employers, but several years of front line IT work and proving oneself as a reliable employee vs new college grad might be a more winnable comparison.",

Ask yourself this, if the new job is Python or Rust based can you adapt quickly to use those tools.   Frankly I don't see much of a future for C#.\n\nThe other side of this is how much have you developed completely on your own.   If you successfully have completed the design and implementation of a novel program or two you are off to a good start.   Frankly you should make this code available for review by the community.   Code reviews can be painful but they can keep you on the right tracks as your skills develop.   To put it another way if you haven't had your current programing reviewed by a third party you might not be as ready as you think.\n\nNow how quickly you might get hired depends upon demand and in many cases experience and knowledge outside of programming.   You mention \"office Job\" but that does not define much.   What I'm trying to say here is that sometimes other knowledge can be a factor in getting a job.   If you have in depth knowledge of part of a business it can make programming a lot easier to adapt to because otherwise as a programmer you have to understand the business logic before you can even write code.   I'm not having confidence in how I'm expressing this but if you have warehousing experience that can directly help in writing a business application to support warehousing software.",

This means that the field `elements` would normally not be declared by its full implementation type `ArrayList`, but by the *interface* `List`, so the initialization becomes `private List<String> elements;`.\n\nThis allows for more flexibility as it is easy to swap the actual *implementation type* when needed.\n\nSame thing for the return values.

In my experience programmers are a helpful, optimistic bunch. We’re more likely to say “Sure! Anybody can learn the basics of programming!” than “Programming might not be the best choice for you.” Depending on the details of your friend’s condition, trying to program might be futile, or it might be therapeutic. Encouraging someone to keep trying something that they literally can’t do seems cruel, but I definitely wouldn’t want to discourage someone from trying either.\n\nAs a programmer, I can tell you that programming really exercises your short term memory. Learning to write code might be a challenge in itself, but at least a programming language is consistent — most of what you learn this year will be the same next year and 5 or 10 years later. You can get used to it. But programming means reading a lot of code, considering how it fits with other code that you read earlier, keeping track of variables and functions, and so on.\n\nI think your friend should talk to a doctor or occupational therapist about what methods are most likely to help, and whether programming might help them improve their memory or prove endlessly painful.",

Since you already know a bit of JavaScript, a good start is learning basic programming concepts properly like variables loops functions and simple logic. Those fundamentals matter more than the language itself. Next move to a beginner friendly game engine. Unity with C sharp or Godot are great choices for programmers. Focus on making very small games like a simple platformer or a top down shooter. Finishing tiny projects teaches more than watching endless tutorials. Learn by doing. Build something small break it fix it repeat. Do not worry about graphics or perfection. As a programmer your goal is to understand how game logic works like movement collisions input and simple AI. Finally be patient. Game development takes time and confusion is part of the process. If you can code simple programs and slowly turn them into games you are on the right path.\n\n",

        "body": "Depends on the engine.\n\nFirstly: If you've never programmed before, learn that before touching a game engine. At the very least, learn\n\n1. What variables are (ints, floats, booleans, and strings)\n2. What functions/methods are (bonus points if you can tell me the difference)\n3. What for-loops and while-loops are\n4. What objects are\n5. What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.\n\nAfter that, then you can go to the game engine.\n\nIf you mean the whole \"getting used to your environment\" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video. This will teach you how to maneuver.\n\nAfter you understand the 5 basic windows most editors contain (scene view, game view, project files, hierarchy/scene tree, and the inspector), and you've followed maybe 3 basic tutorials, move onto making simple games on your own. [I recommend The 20 Games Challenge](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=82257b40e0c0ad322422c1a739ab848cd655250585883297a44bb103ee62ed7aJmltdHM9MTc2OTczMTIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=2c6d9a75-b7b3-6591-338f-8c84b639640d&psq=the+20+game+challeng&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly8yMF9nYW1lc19jaGFsbGVuZ2UuZ2l0bGFiLmlvL2NoYWxsZW5nZS8) \\- it's an amazing teaching tool simply due how it encourages repetition.\n\nBetween the games you make, try creating some basic systems - like an inventory, or a healthbar. Small things just to learn how to abstract these tools away. Better yet, make them on their own, and reuse them in some projects to learn how to make things modular.\n\nAs for healthy habits:\n\n* In general, you don't start a project in editor, you start with the notepad/whiteboard: Plan. Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.\n* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games\n* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.\n* Follow a consistent coding style. Your code should look the same regardless of where it is - this makes it easier to parse over later. Don't flipflop between \"snake\\_case\" and \"CamelCase\" for example.",

The easiest way is to read about it for a bit and then implement something that tests a feature so it make sense to you. If it has a physics engine, you could loot at how you make an object not be affected by gravity. how do you make an object adhere to gravity, what happens when two objects hit each other.\n\nBuild a single screen game \n\nStart with something simple like Pong. What do you need for that, break it down to the individual components of your game. Two independently moving paddles, a ball that moves and bounces around, and a pair of scoring zones, and a score display for each player.\n\n1. So create your scene, stick in a paddle, hook in keyboard controls so that it can move.\n2. Create a scene, stick in a ball and give it initial momentum so it moves in a direction, hook in the scoring zone and make the ball score if it enters the scoring zone, keep track of the score, display the score\n3. So create a scene, stick in a ball and a paddle and make the ball bounce off the paddle if it is hit.\n4. Create a scene that combines all of the above into one, and you have your game.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that those first three items also give you your tests cases for your game. If you make a change to the game, you can see if you broke something in regards to the gameplay.\n\nLook at the information about the various Game Jams to practice. So these might have a \"phrase\" or a couple of words your game needs to be about. So \"light & dark\", which could be a game about shadows, a Grue, or a battle of good vs evil.",

If the chance of a hash collision is one in 10^70, radiation bit flipping is a bigger problem.^1 A cryptographically strong hahs function allows to largely rule out attacks on that vector.\n\n**2. use hash for inequality**  \n\nThe hash guarantees that hashA != hashB ==> A != B. If the hashes are equal, compare the full data.  \n\nIf you store the hash along with the data, this allows to \"short cut\" many comparisons without accessing the actual data.\n\nThat pattern is common in deduplication stores: even if you store many elements, only a few (if any) will have the same hash, and you have to compare the full data only against those. A cheap hash (small, fast) is sufficient here.\n\n\n^1) ^(an old number I remember is 1 flip per GB of RAM per week. I hope it's gotten better - but still)",

It's perfectly valid to have a hashCode that always returns a constant - this will just make your hash tables inefficient. \n\nIf you want to use it for equality testing, this would only cover the negative case (unequal). But when both hash codes are equal you still need to properly compare the objects.\n\nAnd calculating hash codes is not trivial. A proper implementation will calculate the hash code over all fields, just like equals would compare all fields.\n\nHash codes are used for hash tables to quickly find an index into an array.\n\nYou can also use hashes that are unlikely to have collisions. This is often done for file-integrity. Here the hash is stored, so it doesn't need to be recomputed every time (one of the 2 hashes at least). And file I/O is also slower, making this more useful. Collision-resistant hashes are very useful, but still not cheap to calculate (not cheaper than testing equality), and hashCode* is definitely not collision-resistant.\n\n(* I'm assuming you're using Java?)",

        "body": "I don’t know about Dart, but in many languages it’s possible (or sometimes required) to override an object’s hash code function, so (contrary to some comments here) it’s important to understand how they work.\n\nNo, hash collisions are possible. They’re even quite likely if a developer has written a bad hashing function on their object. Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.\n\nComparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.\n\nComparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.\n\nComparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.\n\nIf you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:\n\n1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. \n\n2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. \n\n3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. \n\nHash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.\n\nOf course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.\n\nHopefully this helps. If you have any further questions about this I’d be happy to answer them.",

        "body": "Everything is normal - a lot of people like to confuse things further by talking about passing by reference or value or copying, etc. This usually only confuses things further.\n\nLet me try to show an example - first with an integer (code isn't Dart or anything in particular, mostly pseudocode):\n\n    int v1 = 5;             // first we declare a variable 'v1' with a value of '5'\n    \n    myFunc(v1);             // then we send that variable as an argument to the function\n    \n    def myFunc( v2 ) {      // in the function, the variable 'v2' is now also set to the value '5'\n      print( v2 )           // as we can see if we print it\n      v2 = 4;               // but then we change 'v2' to '4'\n    \n                            // 'v1' was never changed\n    }\n\nThen if we use lists - the result is actually exactly the same:\n\n    list l1 = ['c','a','t'];  // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't'\n    \n    myListFunc( l1 );         // then we send that list as an argument to the function\n    \n    def myListFunc( l2 ) {    // in that function, the variable 'l2' is now set to the same list\n                              // of 'c','a','t'\n       print( l2 );           // as we can see if we print it\n       l2 = ['d','o','g'];    // but when we change 'l2' to another list of 'd','o','g'\n    \n                              // the original 'l1' was never changed\n    }\n\nSome people like to argue that 'v2' becomes a copy of 'v1' but 'l2' becomes a reference to 'l1' - this isn't entirely correct, and in my opinion only muddies the water. The important thing is that when you set a variable = some other value, it doesn't matter where it originally got its value from, it is gone. And setting v2 = v1 doesn't \"link\" v2 and v1 in any way, it just makes them have the same value.\n\nNow for the tricky part!\n\nA value like 4 and 5 cannot be changed, setting v1 to 5 and then setting v2 to v1 and v2 to 4, does not change neither 4 nor 5, it only changes the variables v1 and v2.\n\nBut a *value* like a list, **can be changed**, you can replace individual items, add or remove them - it is still the same list. You cannot replace or remove anything in the number 5.\n\nSo this code does change the inside of l1:\n\n    list l1 = ['c','a','t'];  // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't'\n    \n    myOtherListFunc( l1 );    // then we send that list as an argument to the new function\n    \n    def myOtherListFun( l2 ) { // and receive the same list as variable 'l2'\n      l2.add('s');             // and we modify the inside of the list!\n            \n                               // this has also changed the list for 'l1' because it is the same list\n    }\n\nThere's nothing magic about it - note that we don't write `l2 = ['c','a','t','s']` because that would change l2 to be another list, just like v2 was changed to be another number.\n\nIf we could write `v2.increment()` or something like that, we would be able to change v1 through v2, but as that is usually not the case in most languages, programmers like to say that numbers are copied and lists are referenced - although it rarely is like that.",

So it's not that suitable for allocating new memory for data in the future. So the OS have a mechanism (heap) for requesting new memory pages in order for a program to be able to create new objects while it's running. If not for pointers we wouldn't be able to refer to objects located in heap because we don't know beforehand where they would be located, the compiler knows only about variables on the .data section.

I went through a bunch of books, powerpoint slidedecks, and web tutorials and *they were all the same*. So I wrote a 260-page book and made it free.",

Some \"official\" solutions are not optimal even with the learnt skills up to that point.\n\nYou have to understand that in programming nothing is chiseled in stone. There usually are several paths that lead to the goal. Some are more efficient than others, some are better readable/maintainable than others, and some are good middle-grounds between efficiency and readability/maintainability - that's the ones a programmer should strive for. If your solution is super intelligent and efficient but you are the only one who understands it, it is useless in production, but may be nice for competitions, if your solution is super slow but extremely readable, you're on the other end of the scale and should work on your speed.\n\nIt's all a matter of experience.

Courses like CS50, MOOC, Boot.dev, and so on, are amazing courses taught by the best; but they will always pale in comparison to any in-person multi-faceted learning environment. It's this reason I enrolled in a CS course at the local community college after having taken CS50x/p/w/g, completed most of boot.dev, and read a little more than half a dozen textbooks on Python, C++, HTML-CSS-JS, Design Patterns, and DS&A. Nothing beats listening, seeing, discussing, doing, and being critiqued all in a 2 hour block.\n\nHumans are social animals, and you're human.

Being well-rounded makes is a good skill for connecting with people too.\n\nPlus being able to create art you want, even if only as a hobby, is just a good skill. I do programming, a little bit of traditional arts, and digital arts as hobbies and the intersection of them is damn fun. I enjoy being able to draw/create whatever workflow. I quite enjoy employing common algorithms in interesting ways \\[re: not LLM/AI stuff as that wasn't around!\\]; I get to pursue a much wider variety of workflows/techniques since I can draw on a wider skillset.\n\nLearning how to paint, the mixtures, pigments, etc \\[I got quite into paint this last year\\] has really taught me the details of finishing, coating, and protecting anything I may make - from furniture to housing. And a quick coat of paint can make a used, cheap piece look brand new!\n\nPlus I find learning both digital and traditional art reinforces the core skills one needs to make good art overall. Composition, colors, lighting, texture, detail density, etc - all necessary to practice regardless of the medium.\n\nWhat's the point of being a programmer if you don't also get a bit of time to pursue other topics that you enjoy? I think it's worthwhile to read history, but I can tell you it will not be getting me raises anytime soon!\n\nLastly, when you learn things, it may open doors you previously would not have been aware of. The twists of life might open a door or two that would've been hidden otherwise.\n\nFinally, the AI stuff concerning \\*making\\* art is such a strong debate I think all the noise around it always misses the forest for the big tree. Thinking on it, however, one faces the same core issues with generative tools as you did with old school algorithmic/digital art!\n\nSay my 200x200 random pixel generator is able to theoretically produce any piece of art ever. (any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \\*seems\\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. \"This is random noise\".\n\nIMO, to make impactful art, you've\n\n\\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience.  \n\\- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important.  \n\\- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.\n\nThe first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)\n\nMuch like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed \"paint by numbers\" kits and never challenged yourself further.\n\n\\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha! But I've no need for productivity either, not working in a professional context.\\]",

Dont give me the answer and change the code for me. Instead, provide me with instructions on where to look or what to write so that i solve the problem myself and i learn and retain the information instead of copying and pasting answers\"\n\nSomething to that effect.\n\nIf its still a problem and you find youre still relying on it too much?

So I've come to the conclusion that most of its decisions will be sound. You just have to know what model to use for what part of your project. But maybe I'm doing it differently than others. I'm using the human in the loop method. As good as ai is, you still have to keep it from going off in an unintended direction.

You start with microcontroller firmware and USB.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 1: Pick a microcontroller and read its datasheet like scripture\n\nMost custom keyboards use:\n\t•\tATmega32U4 (classic Arduino Pro Micro)\n\t•\tRP2040\n\t•\tSTM32\n\nThe key requirement: native USB device support.\n\nBefore writing any keyboard code, you must understand:\n\t•\tGPIO configuration\n\t•\tTimers / interrupts\n\t•\tUSB endpoints\n\t•\tFlash + RAM limits\n\nThis is not optional. QMK hides this pain; you’re choosing to feel it.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 2: Implement a matrix scanner (this is the soul)\n\nA keyboard PCB is usually a row × column matrix.\n\nAlgorithmically:\n\t•\tSet all columns as outputs\n\t•\tSet all rows as inputs with pull-ups\n\t•\tDrive one column LOW at a time\n\t•\tRead rows\n\t•\tRepeat fast (≈1 kHz)\n\nYou will write:\n\t•\tGPIO init\n\t•\tA scan loop\n\t•\tA key state bitmap\n\nThis alone teaches you more embedded thinking than most app devs ever touch.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 3: Debouncing (time becomes real)\n\nSwitches lie. They bounce.\n\nYou need:\n\t•\tPer-key state\n\t•\tTimestamp or counter\n\t•\tStable-state confirmation\n\nClassic strategies:\n\t•\tIntegrator counters\n\t•\tTime-based debounce\n\t•\tState machines\n\nQMK has multiple debounce algorithms. Rewriting one is a rite of passage.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 4: Build a key event pipeline\n\nAt this point you have:\n\t•\tRaw matrix state\n\t•\tPress / release events\n\nNow you design your own internal API:\n\nraw_scan → debounced_state → key_event → action\n\nThis is where you can do things QMK doesn’t:\n\t•\tProbabilistic chording\n\t•\tPressure-aware timing\n\t•\tContextual layers (editor-aware, app-aware)\n\nThis is where creativity lives.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 5: USB HID from scratch (the dragon)\n\nNow the hard truth:\nUSB is the real boss fight.\n\nYou must implement:\n\t•\tUSB descriptors\n\t•\tHID report descriptors\n\t•\tPolling interval logic\n\t•\tKey rollover handling\n\nYou can:\n\t•\tWrite USB by hand (brutal but pure)\n\t•\tOr use a thin USB stack (LUFA, TinyUSB) without keyboard logic\n\nThis is still “from scratch” in spirit—USB is a protocol, not magic.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 6: Layers, macros, and remapping (language emerges)\n\nLayers are just:\n\t•\tLookup tables\n\t•\tStackable keymaps\n\t•\tState-dependent resolution\n\nMacros are:\n\t•\tEvent playback engines\n\t•\tTimed HID reports\n\nNothing mystical. QMK only organizes it well.\n\n⸻\n\nWhere to actually learn this (non-obvious sources)\n\nNot “keyboard tutorials.” Those are downstream.\n\nStudy instead:\n\t•\tUSB HID specification\n\t•\tLUFA examples (keyboard + mouse)\n\t•\tBare-metal MCU tutorials\n\t•\tOld AVR keyboard firmware (pre-QMK era)\n\nThen read QMK last, like reading a cathedral after learning how stones are cut.\n\n⸻\n\nA sharper insight most people miss\n\nQMK is not a keyboard firmware.\n\nQMK is:\n\t•\tA hardware abstraction layer\n\t•\tA policy engine for input\n\t•\tA build system that normalizes chaos\n\nIf you rebuild it, don’t clone it.\nDesign something smaller, stranger, and opinionated.\n\nFor example:\n\t•\tA keyboard that adapts layout based on typing entropy\n\t•\tA keyboard that changes layers by time-of-day\n\t•\tA keyboard optimized for African language input patterns\n\t•\tA keyboard that treats macros as code, not sequences\n\nThat’s how you go beyond “my own QMK” and into new instruments.",

Code is all in Lua, which isn't a favorite of mine, but it's super easy to work with and learn.\n\nMy daughter is 7 and I've recently started tinkering with PICO-8 again.  I've got her starting to draw sprites for me and I plan on trying some very simple code with her soon.\n\nBut expect to help out.  Maybe figure out on your own how to draw a sprite and then move it around with controller/keyboard (it's not hard).  Then start fresh and walk her through the process, letting her write some code along the way, and see if it sparks anything with her.\n\nEDU version is free here: [https://www.pico-8-edu.com/](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/)  Full version is \\~$15.  \n\nBut start with the EDU version and see if it's something that would be interesting.  Full version has a few niceties, but hardly required.\n\nAlso check out the [PICO8 BBS](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?cat=7#sub=2).   You can see people's games and play them there, or download the cart and load it into the EDU version to see their source code and assets, change things and run that.  If you watch videos about PICO-8, you'll likely hear about the`splore` command in the full version.  It's basically the in-game version of the BBS, but you can do those things with the EDU version without too much trouble.",

My guess is that (3) is really inefficient because you're constantly jumping around in your file in random order, which is the most inefficient thing for a file.\n\nInstead what you want is to have all of your file reads/writes to be sequential, and do the random swapping only in memory.\n\nThere are two algorithms to consider:\n\nI think most likely an \"External Distribution Sort\" would be the most efficient:\n\n1. Decide on how much you can have in memory at a time (like 100 MB, or 1 GB)\n2. Partition the data into chunks of approximately that size. As an example if your keys started with the letters A - Z, and you had 13 chunks, you could put A & B in chunk 1, C & D into chunk 2, and so on.\n3. Now sort each partition by loading it into RAM.\n4. Finally join the files together into one large file.\n\nAs an alternative, an External Merge Sort would also work. Split into chunks without partitioning, sort each chunk in RAM, then merge all of the chunks together in one pass.\n\nBoth External Distribution Sort and External Merge Sort have the property that the disk reads and writes are sequential. You might have multiple files open at a time, but you're never skipping around in the same file.\n\nSwitching to either one of those could give as much as a 100x speedup, because that's the difference between how fast sequential access vs random access is when reading large files from disk.",

Since you're already doing full-stack projects, you might want to consider whether you enjoy front-end work enough to invest in it long-term.\n\nUltimately, both paths will give you valuable experience, but if you’re leaning towards backend and feel more confident there, that might be the smarter choice to build depth in one area before branching out later.",

As I said, early in my career I was prefering frontend and invested a lot of time in javascript and related frameworks, was interested in UX design even (real full stack back then 🤣 from db schema design, backend to the html and css). Years later I was focused more on backend. Then the natural things in career growth - managing teams, where soft skills are way more important. But turned out that was not really my thing, being too far from creating things and instead, doing hiring, budgeting, such kind of boring stuff. Now I am in architect role - mostly talking and drawing, but way more connected to development teams, although not writing code. Don't miss it. Only occasionally I get to code something by myself helping teams in hard situations and I like it so. My point is - you shouldn't overthink it that much. There is no right or wrong, every decision comes with mistakes and lessons. Whatever you choose, you will learn something. If you do a mistake, you will learn more! And with years you will eventually get bored in something. One more important advice - stay there, where there are better guys than you - to compete with them and learn fron them. If you notice you aren't learning and progressing - change the job and even consider shift in technology or role. It's not that big of a problem to shift from c# to java .. or python. Having the basis and experience makes it really easy. (A lot of words I've wrote, sorry for that! 🤣",

Even if they're not part of your specialty, you can start to get familiar with them to help out more in the future. Look through the code for any TODOs.\n2. Scan the code for vulnerabilities. Depending on your stack, there are several tools out there to use. Even if you dont have access to any tools, you can double check no vulnerabilities are associated with any dependency versions on your project.\n3. Upgrade project dependencies. This one can be tricky and requires a lot of regression testing.\n4. Update, create, and improve junit test cases and test case coverage. Create/improve mock services\n5. Improve CI/CD. Add quality of life features\n6. \\^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.\n7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues. Though there better solutions.\n8. Study anything related to your job. Learn what you need to in order to eventually help your teammates with their load. Learn more about intricacies of the languages used in your stack. Research tools and libraries that may help your project.  Sometimes you can be the one to introduce new technology to the stack that improves something you already have or completely replaces it for some benefit or another.\n9. Update project documentation. You could also create guides for any new people that may join the team in the future\n10. Innovate. Maybe you can figure out a good way to leverage AI in your project. Don't immediately jump to an LLM. You might not even need AI and an LLM might be overkill if you can use traditional AI/ML.",

I don't mind it, but I've learned that the old adage of \"once you get your first job, the second one comes much easier\" is no longer remotely true in this field. In fact, it feels even more competitive. A small (but growing) part of me wishes I just did a real engineering field like electrical or civil. I know people in both who had no trouble getting a job and in fact make more than I do. Plus their work is far more interesting than the web development CRUD I'm doing right now. I wish I could do more specialized stuff, but you need experience in those specialized fields to do the work (which you can't even get unless you have experience lol, so good luck there).

My answer would be different if you were a fresh new grad or still in school, because there's a good case to be made that you still need to build up the manual coding skills before learning to rely on AI. But if you're an experienced engineer already, you should absolutely be taking advantage of the most recent tooling. You're only going to see skill atrophy over the long term if it's truly not needed, and you can always refresh your manual coding skills if needed.\n\n**One very very critical thing, though:** It's trivial to prompt AI agents and get output that *works,* but that's not enough. You should be aiming for code quality that *exceeds* the quality of your prior manual output, and you should always understand the details of how it all works - neither of which are very hard if you leverage the AI to do this (e.g. get it to refactor when needed, use other AI tools to review the code, ask for explanations).\n\nMost \"vibe coders\" don't do this, and that's where tech debt problems come in quickly. Serious professional engineers are leveraging AI in a very different way, keeping the AI on a short leash and ensuring high quality output just like in the manual coding days.",

We've lost candidates to lesser offers because we had weeks of lead time  \n* We continually interview top candidates, who'll naturally get multiple offers, but they can only accept one offer \n* Because we can get a stream of top candidates, we have little interest in interviewing weaker candidates EVEN though we lose people (for non-monetary reasons)\n\nFor startups (\"small businesses\" I suppose), I get reachouts from 3p recruiters who often aren't super equipped to hire, but I think they often want someone with specific knowledge and don't feel like they have resources to train general talent.",

Just a month ago I landed my first SWE job. There are definitely go guarantees, and it will likely take a while but its definitely not impossible. \n\nMy advice would be to focus on \n\n1. Projects: Building projects that you can talk about and show in some way, whether it be a demo of the project, a blog, or anything else. With AI you can pretty much just pick any topic you are interested in, find something that seems interesting to build and is within a reasonable scope and build it. Bonus points if its a product that solve actual peoples problems, product thinking is highly valued at startups. The goal is to show people that you have actually done stuff, and to be able to talk about it.\n\n2. Network: The most universal thing I learned after a year of searching for jobs was that pretty much everyone I knew got their job through some sort of connection and is also how I ended up getting my job, and this is doubly true in todays market. Network as aggressively as you can (not annoyingly but just a lot of people) and reach out to your own personal network. The cost is basically nothing other than maybe your ego, and the upside is tremendous, you never know who could be the one that has the connect, and people are very often happy to help. \n\n  \nDefinitely still apply to companies but don't spend too much time on it especially if you aren't getting much positive feedback. Your first job will most likely be from just knowing the right person (networking) and actually having something to show for your skills (projects). Good luck, and message me if you have any other questions I think my experience has made me somewhat of an expert in the subject lol.",

        "body": "That is the point of stack ranking. They want employees to be in a constant state of fear, anxiety and subservience to their manager.\n\nThe solution is to have a huge 1 to 2 years of monthly expenses saved up. Then you dont have to give a fuck about your performance while you wait for the inevitable layoff. I keep $100k in hysa just for a layoff scenario - it took 5 years to accumulate, which was tough at the time, but my anxiety level was greatly reduced. This hysa stack is seperate from stocks/bonds/401k/529/real-estate etc - those are not your emergency fund. Some people say $xxx in cash is too much - but thats not my problem. This is what I need for my mental safety net and you may need more or less for yours.\n\nMy last layoff, I got $20k severance and 2 months where I was paid salary but could spend the time searching - and I luckily got a job lined up before the clock ran out. The time before, it took me 2 months to find a job, but severance was only $10k. So I had to dip into my savings, despite unemployment checks. You should look up the weekly max unemployment benefit for your state and factor that into your plan. \n\nTLDR: Layoffs are inevitable. Stressing and extra effort will not save you from it. Fuck your employer. You need to stop worrying about stack ranking and layoffs, and instead worry about reducing your expenses and stacking your emergency fund. Use your anxious energy to plan and prep. Once you are prepped and have enough stacked, your anxiety will go away.",

I’ve had cases where companies wanted me to work on my own computer and install their software on it. In three other cases, I simply rejected the offer because they explicitly stated that the role required 50–60 hours of work per week for a below-median salary.\n\nSo my conclusion is this: if you have low expectations, I think it’s relatively easy to land a senior position.

        "body": "Traditional engineer here (chemical, not that it matters)... turns out, USA vs. Europe area engineering or not that makes little difference.  It looks like, checks the replies, a lot of software developers are just toxic regardless of where they live.  A lot of you all are really arguing about stupid shit.  Software development isn't a zero sum game, for US developers to win, EU doesn't have to lose, and vice versa.\n\nDo we chalk this up to people just being young?  Do European posters in /r/cscareerquestions ALSO skew young and NOT actually employed as software developers, just like the US counterparts?\n\nAnyways, unlike many people here, I regularly during the course of my work, engage with large teams of European engineers.  Primarily engineers from Ireland, Poland, and Germany.  Ireland is unique, in that it also has a large diaspora of engineers from OTHER European countries.  These have included multiple engineers from England, Spain, and France, and Architects from Ireland, Italy, and England.\n\nTwo things that have helped dramatically, are:  Persistent and clear communication.  Both parties need to be patient, and be \"clear\" with their communication.  English will be the lingua fraca, but all English is not the same.  Focus on using COMMON, more likely to be known, phrases, words, etc.  Avoid idioms that someone not from your country isn't going to know.  It's REALLY common for native speakers/writers to go crazy with this and communicate in a way that is very difficult to understand.  Simplify it down.  Assume positive intent, if something SOUNDS off, it's probably a bad translation.  Every language has it's own difficulties in translation to English.  Above all else, patience by BOTH parties.\n\nThe other, is absolutely when working with counterparts in other cultures, you HAVE to learn and understand what their leadership and accountability paradigm is, relative to yours.  Do NOT assume it is the same way, at all, to yours.  How people are led (do people DEFER to leadership, or INFORM leadership), how people are mentored, how people are held accountable, differs WILDLY between cultures; and, even within that culture, particularly in Poland I see big differences between junior and senior engineers.  I suspect in that country there's a divide there too; if I had to guess, it's roughly the 15+ and above vs. the newer peeps.  But, I don't fully understand, despite how much polish interaction I get.\n\nWith that last one, comes ASSUME positive intent.  Assume they WANT to get the job done, and done well, and seek to understand how and why they're behaving the way they are.  A metaphor I like to use borrows from the old American story about the cherry tree and the axe.  If \"Culture A\" was going to cut down a tree, and had 10 hours to do it, how many hours would they spend sharpening the axe?\"  The polish would sharpen the axe, and a backup axe, for 9.5 hours.  The Irish?  They cut it down last week.  My point?  The spread between preparing for the act, and doing the act, varies wildly, and can be a VERY common source of frustration ALL around.\n\nAnyways, good luck.  I've both enjoyed at times, and hated at times, working with various European engineering cultures.",

Don't be afraid to use it in the right manner.\n\nFor example, I typically try to come up with the solution to an unfamiliar problem on my own until I have a working solution or an almost working solution, then consult AI to confirm if my code snippet is doing things optimally. Oftentimes, it is not. Understand why the optimal solution works, and then implement it. Next time you run into a similar or the same problem, tailor it according to what you learned without using AI as a crutch.\n\nIf the problem is way too complex for you to understand at all, ask an experienced or senior dev for a high level overview of what you need to do.",

The way you use AI and particularly the kinds of questions you ask plays a huge role in how it impacts your learning rate. Are you trying to understanding what you're building or are you just full delegation hoping AI figures it out? People who are just full delegating to it appear to be crippling their understanding and learning with it.  The long term impact of that on the industry is not fully understood.  I suspect some people will be forever juniors.  Even if a better title comes their way they will still effectively operate on a junior level technically because they aren't learning over the years they are just hoping big daddy AI solves any issue that comes up for them.",

There should be some line of communication at that point that should hopefully lead to the agile development of the dashboard. You can also try to communicate directly to whom ever has access to this business data. You just need something on the dashboard, they’ll come back afterwards with additional requirements.",

Don't try to get it perfect the first time, because it's impossible.

I know people without certifications who know their stuff, and I know people who have certifications who don't seem to know anything. Of course there are people with certifications who also know their stuff. \n\nYou'll never be in a perfect scenario where you're evaluated exactly as another candidate, and the only difference is one has a certification. \n\nThe other thing to factor in is that hiring isn't a simple, one-person process. There are various filters you need to get through. A certification will mean less to a lot of technical people, but it may mean more to a recruiter. You need to get past the recruiter to get in front of an interviewer and a hiring manager. \n\nIf you already have lots of cloud experience and knowledge, they won't really add much for you.

Removing it creates a gap of twelve months between graduation and your next role. Most hiring managers view a one-year post-graduation gap as a greater risk than a short stint at an established firm like AMD. The brand name helps confirm your technical skills.\n\nYour current challenge is the total number of jobs you have held in a few years. You must change how you present your history during interviews. Instead of justifying why you left, explain that you have learned that high-growth startups do not provide the structure you need. State that you are now prioritizing stability and long-term projects.\n\nFocus your search on large companies in the automotive or consumer electronics sectors. These industries typically have the HR resources and management training that startups lack. You need an environment where the requirements are documented and the management style is predictable. This shift will help you break the cycle of short tenures and build a more consistent professional record.",

All of the interviews were semi-position agnostic meaning I could get an offer for mid-level or senior if offered at depending how the interviews went. Ended up getting a mid-level offer, which feels somewhat lateral if not almost a step down in responsibility, but was a jump in salary. With my previous org facing impending layoffs it wasn’t anything to wring my hands over. \n\nFrankly, cold applying doesn’t feel super great right now. If you get the opportunity to connect with a recruiter (mine reached out to me via InMail on LinkedIn) take advantage. People are definitely hiring, but the open positions don’t exactly match what they’re posting on the internet from what I’m seeing.",

This company is also nuts to expect a single developer to fully manage 4 different software projects.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I'd take this as a learning opportunity and move on when I can. You're not a bad developer. You're working for a non-technical company that is in over their heads as a relatively new developer with 3 years of experience. Software engineering is one of those things where you think you know something but you're constantly realizing you know nothing at all.\n\nI'll also point out that this early in your career it's extremely beneficial to work alongside other developers so you can grow your skills via osmosis. It's important to work alongside experienced people who do things the \"right\" way. From my own experience lone wolf engineers usually pick up a ton of bad habits. Usually because they're on their own and nobody can help them learn and apply proven techniques.\n\n\\- Senior engineer, 20 years experience.",

I'd recommend looking for contract work for projects in resource extraction areas.  Think big mines that have 2000 computers that need to be maintained and also upgraded every few years.\n\n\nHaving your degree (?) means you will have no issue with the software side and you will be able to learn the hardware side better.  Once you have a few years experience there, look for jobs back home with contracting companies or actual companies themselves that support point of sale devices for merchants, do a few years of that.\n\n\nThen you have software, hardware, and point of sale support and you can do some social networking with local tech support companies and you might have better luck back home.\n\n\nThe problem that I encountered when I was trying to break in, is I was competing with all these 40 year old people with 15 years experience that were moving back, and I just couldn't stand up against them.\n\n\nNow as it turns out where I am it is super rural, good help is hard to find, I found a great job, 20 min from my door to my desk, and it is a nice town; so I stayed, but I prefer a more rural setting.  I know lots of people that got their experience and moved back.\n\n\nHeck, I know of a few people that got hired on with internal companies, did a few years in town, then went home and supported things there.\n\n\nGood luck!",

This is true of just about every industry, tech just feels worse because people hear about how good things are (high paying jobs, remote work, huge benefits, etc). If you aren't already doing that then pivoting to something else won't really help.\n\n\nIf you are already doing that then I think it'd be helpful to know what sort of criteria you're using to look. It sounds like you have no internship/apprenticeship experience, so that's the sort of role you should be looking for.  Seek out contracting firms and recruiters, there's one on Michigan named Blue Chip. I'm sure your state has something like it.\n\n\nFinally, contact any careers department at your college. They have a vested interest in you getting a job so you can give them money and look good on reports about the school. They may have connections or job fairs you can leverage",

The same way being the cream of the crop of marketers can be lucrative but it’s not for everyone. And as markets condense, squeezing out many, you’re unfortunately left with few roles, with cheaper pay, and likely more cause for nepotistic hiring.\n\nThe difference is unemployment rates are sky high for CS atm, less jobs, and more applicants from senior positions from layoffs at big named places. So you have juniors and mids competing with seniors for lower paid roles. \n\nIgnoring these factors during a transition in the market is like saying if you’re passionate about being a lift operator you can stick it out while the industry changes? No, you move before it affects your life personally. \n\n(Before the pedantics, yes I know lift operators aren’t the same, pick whatever you like though, I just mean a role that becomes harder to attain and lower pay as companies believe they don’t need them. Maybe creative writing currently, or basic web dev that you can just get some web generator from many hosting sites when you only need a simple single page site)",

I don't know that I agree fully with your perspective on what it's nice to learn, but intense interview prep is absolutely not mandatory.\n\nZero prep is pretty stupid, though, as then your first few interviews will just be your prep. Everybody in every industry needs to prep for interviews.\n\nYou don't have to go crazy with months of leetcoding, but you should craft your stories about your past work. There's a big difference between a story that you actually wrote and one that you tell off the cuff. That's the important stuff, once you get out of the entry-level zone.\n\nFor some companies you need to do leetcode, but it is very far from mandatory across the industry. If you want to work at a high paying big name tech firm, then you play by their rules. If you want to have a job that still pays pretty good and is maybe kinda chill, then don't worry about it. Prep like anyone preps for any job. Don't jump through the tech hoops.\n\nI've done less than 5 hours of leetcode across 8-9 years in the industry. It absolutely cost me offers, and in turn has definitely extended some of my job searches. I've failed plenty of tech screens that I know I would have passed if I was studying DSA. But I've liked all of my jobs, and I never felt compelled to pursue the algo grind.",

You have to be at work anyway, so you may as well do things that will set yourself up for future success.\n\nI don't think it's worthwhile to Leetcode every day and intensively study system design interview stuff all the time. You can ramp up on that stuff in a few months when you need to or want to. \n\nI used to feel like you do, and I did not want to spend time making myself more marketable or worrying what recruiters thought. I just tried to do a good job at the job I had. Eventually I realized I was unhappy there for reasons that weren't going to change (in my case, it was extreme boredom, but it could be a lot of reasons.)\n\nI had a strong history in... C++, which even then was waning in popularity. Plus several weird proprietary languages and a whole weird proprietary stack and tools, so none of it was transferrable anywhere else. I had also failed to make connections outside my immediate co-workers, so I had very few connections at other companies or even people to serve as references. (Colleagues quit and go to work other places = the lazy way to build a network of connections.)

[Scalability Rules, 2nd Edition](https://a.co/d/j0dQVbm) (no longer being printed, but can be found in PDF online).\n3. [Building Microservices](https://a.co/d/c3i06pq)\n4. [Release It!](https://a.co/d/5Gg1CBt)\n5. [Designing Web APIs](https://a.co/d/c7I3WTH)\n\nDon't learn CI/CD \"by hand\". Learn the Infrastructure as Code approach either using Terraform or AWS CDK.\n\nThat should take you pretty far. It'll take around a year and a half to finish everything (could be less depending on how much time you put into it).\n\nGood luck!",

This was super important because we pivoted a lot early on while finding market fit and we could do so quickly (hours-days). Within first few months we had over X million DAU. \n\n4. Funny enough we were B2C. In some ways this was an advantage as success/failure signals were very visible early on and we had a lot of word of mouth engagement.\n\n5. We had a lot of attention in the media and somehow obtained partnerships with the biggest players in tech (NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft) who gave us resources, insider access, and a platform in their marketing and events. I have no idea how this came together but it seemed very organic tbh\n\n6. Side effect of everything else but people were applying from FAANG and other unicorns to join our team. Normally a startup’s talent pool is very small but this was not a problem here. We were able to be very selective and patient with our hiring and avoid the traps of other startups that scale too quickly.",

I don't think that says that much about you. And for that matter, often times, issues with deadlines is not an individual dev problem, but a management problem.\n\n>  And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.\n\nI know the pressure can be hard to avoid, don't work weekends. It's common that deadlines slip and stuff takes longer than expected. It shouldn't generally be a \"work extra\" thing, particularly not for no extra pay. From a practical standpoint, I understand it if your job is on the line (the economy and all), but resist the pressure under normal circumstances.\n\nOverall, sadly, intern positions on solo projects aren't that uncommon, yet are obviously bad for the intern. Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task. And yes, solo projects are strictly worse for a new person (or arguably any person) in pretty much every way (hard to get help, isolating, more likely to have incorrect estimates, etc). You'd probably have a better experience working on a project with an actual team, though I'm not sure how realistic of a possibility that is for you on the short term.",

But once you're burned out, that's it there's no going back. \n\nThe most you can do now is manage what you can at work and take care of yourself better and hope you get better over time or if there's not much in your control then you probably need to leave the situation.\n\nThe only other thing you can do is reexamine the situation to see if there's an end in sight. If there is maybe you can stick it out. But if it's not caused by a specific situation but rather the environment there may be no end in sight and spinning your wheels hoping it'll get better will just lead to worse burnout.\n\nTo me it sounds like you're in a bad environment where they're trying to take advantage of a cheap intern. Internships in the dev industry are supposed to be intros to the company so that an intern can decide if they want to take a job there or not, or they might be part of getting college credit. Smart companies don't make long interns manage a whole giant project with moving parts and deadlines, that'd just be idiotic of them.

Americans do make a considerable amount more, but we're also paid enough that I see it as clearly diminishing returns. I'd kinda get it if we were talking about something like $80k CAD to $150k USD, but for their level, we're talking more like $250k CAD to $300k USD. It's a *lot* of money with the Canadian dollar as it is, but in terms of quality of life, I see it as a point where more money won't do that much while the environment will do a lot more. \n\nMy sample size is too small to say if this is \"lots\", but certainly it stood out to me. I do know of at least a number of people not moving who have stated positions similar to mine, but that admittedly doesn't mean much, as they probably weren't the types to move to the US anyway (I certainly had no desire even before 2025).",

You can market yourself better by learning and understanding the business processes.

In my experience so far just doing it by hand I have yet to have a job completely ghost me and I am currently sitting at 12 applications. Mind you these were all declines still, and I will have to hunt for a little while. I do use Ai, specifically for cover letters though, but more of a guidance than fully copy pasting. Everything comes from me, but using Ai to get the thoughts flowing rather than sitting there and spending an hour on each letter that nobody will read just makes sense. I can get the creative juices flowing and type away the letter in about ten minutes or so. So, there is certainly a usefulness to Ai.\n\nI also certainly do not want to tell you which way is better over the other. It is literally a matter of do you want to manually apply to 50 - 200 places and have a higher chance of hearing something back? Or do you just want to apply to every job on the planet and not hear zip except for a couple gold mines? Believe me, there are a ton of people out there not using Ai at all or even experienced it, so they get a letter that sounds like a robot typed it (if they read it), it is going right in the trash. So it is really just that, quality vs quantity, they both can win, and in this situation they both win at the same time and lose at the same time.",

The main problem is that for us, nerdy guys, the main employers are small to mid-sized companies ( startups mainly - \"The backbone of the economy\").\n\nStartups are hiring only when they are profitable now (rarely), mid/large companies prefer to hire offshore and pay a hotdog per hour (bellow 12 bucks) or push for AI. This is the harsh reality: unless you play a major role in the company's security/policy, you are out.\n\nThat's why most jobs are now in Fintech or Healthtech, these are extremely sensitive and offshoring is too risky. How will the business sue someone or make them accountable? Would they even have money to pay? I bet not.\n\nSo, I would probably bet on networking and positioning myself into a role that is essential for any corporation, like cybersecurity or something crucial.",

I wish I had been less stubborn and willing to listen to a mentor.\n\n\nI would recommend making the game development a hobby, make it for androids, and make it to fix specific table top game editions, like D&D.\n\n\nBut I found that the more I worked at the fun, the less fun it was.  Turns out I have a.d.h.d. and autism and if I had been able to be medicated through school, I would have been unstoppable.\n\n\nI was pretty bitter trying to find work in 2008-2011 in video games while learning and programming in C++ for \"the game\" I had in my head.  Then once I would know what \"the game\" was, I would do some research and find out that someone else had the idea and had already done it.\n\n\nThat's when it hit me, the ideas are a dime a dozen, and everyone has them; it's being able to make it into a reality and get it to market faster than the competition that gets the money.\n\n\nThe secret, kookily enough, was watching the movie \"the secret\" and saying to myself \"If I am always saying that I am burned out and there are no jobs, then that is my reality\".  So instead I said \"I am a positive person, pleasant to be around, I love people, and there are lots of jobs I would enjoy (each of those was a lie)\".\n\n\nI just had that mindset and I just flipped the job search rules on its head and I just applied for everything that looked interesting.  I had one resume, one cover letter, a few letters of reference, and then I just \"cold job applied\", or \"shotgun approach\".  I just stopped looking at the job, the description, the requirements, and instead of stressing about if I qualified for a job or tailoring my resume and cover letter for one hour and then applying for one job in two hours, I did a blanket google search, opened up the top ten results in tabs, and just went through uploading my resume and cover letter to sites and applying for as many jobs as I could.  Some were an email, some were uploading documents, some were transcribing into their web fields, so some took a minute to apply to, some took 20 minutes.  I just applied and applied and applied.\n\n\nI \"knew\" everyone else was going to be tailoring their resume to the job, so instead of me doing that for each one, I wrote the cover letter like it was a personal conversation between friends and I sold myself as an amazing worker and someone they wanted on their team.\n\n\nI'd been applying for about a day before I got a call for a job where they were looking for a permanent full time position (but I didn't know that cause I hadn't really read the job listing).  I had a 2 year technical diploma and had just finished my 3rd year of a bsc in computer science, I was on summer break...\n\n\nSo I went to the preliminary interview and fucking nailed it with my positive attitude and my honest answers of \"I don't know what that is or how to do it, but I honestly don't know what I am doing with most things.  What I know how to do is know when I don't know, I know how to look something up, and I learn fast\".\n\n\nThey ended up hiring me for a summer rather than any of the other full time applicants that they had.    I fucking love automation and I get bored easily.  It was a tech support job for a software development company, so everytime I answered a question, I templated the response.  There's really only 20 questions anyone could have about this software, and I knew what they were cause I had been doing templated responses from May to July.\n\n\nIn July I asked to get some screen recording and captioning software to make some tutorial videos; I made basic, intermediate, and advanced video tutorials, published them, and the calls stopped.\n\n\nI had automated myself out of a job, and then I went back to school and finished my fourth year.\n\n\nI had a competitive job offer from them half way through the year, full benefits, to come back and work for them.  It was a great company, it got acquired during covid, but I did basically the same thing for them for 3 years before moving on.\n\n\nI just kept looking at something that had to be done more than once and figured out how to automate it.\n\n\nThe moral of this story is sometimes you have to run before you can walk.  Successfully selling yourself and taking initiative to do your job and improve everything, rather than just collecting a cheque allowed me to develop a specific set of skills.\n\n\nI work for a much bigger company now, \"work\" is a strong term.  I do tech support and am on a team with other people where we get sent problems no one can figure out how to fix.  We figure it out, fix it, and automate it.\n\n\nI never would have figured that out without actually doing it.",

For related art stuff I’ve made some animations recently (2D hand drawn digital animations) such as a basic looping character walk cycle from one angle and a few other simple animations, and I’ve also drawn some 2D digital art for a very brief unfinished game demo group project in university too but I didn’t end up doing any of the code for that one.

My only worry is the possibility that having formal diagnoses could lead to issues if I want to move out of the U.S. or cause discrimination based on having that on my medical record (more worried about autism as opposed to ADHD for that knowing how autistic people often get mistreated, seen as incompetent, and infantilized).",

That's the one they were contacting you about. \n\nI'm a regular reader of /r/Scams. This type of thing most often leads to a task scam and/or fake check scam. \n\nHere are the automod descriptions of each from r/Scams:\n\n* https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_task\n* https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_fake_check\n\nNote that scammers are now saying that they represent real companies, and in some cases, they even impersonate actual employees of those companies, so you can't take anything from the name of the company they say they represent.\n\nAlso, it looks like they didn't even fully replace the references. \"Thank you for your time and interest in *Tungsten Automation*\"\n\nBlock and report and move on with your life.\n\nEdit: Oh, another red flag is \"Mr Christian Deppisch.\" Nobody in the US would actually put \"Mr\" on their name, but it's apparently common convention in the former-colonial countries where many scammers operate. It's used very commonly in scam communications.\n\nEdit 2: apparently, when deciding whether number is a spammer, your cell phone service weighs the number of spam reports against the number of people who reply. By getting many people to reply with \"got it\", even if most of those people don't become scam victims, the scammers are helping to not get their numbers banned by inflating the number of replies.",

AI is a fast library and a good solution to the dead internet problem, but what is really going on here is what we will call \"the AI bubble\" in a few years, when it bursts.  In 1999 there was the .com bubble that burst.  In 2008 it was the sub prime predatory mortgage lending that burst. 2014 was the oil bubble bursting, then the covid blip, so we have 3 maybe 4 years more of this bubble.  The people with the money have been pumping it, and now they want their money; so they sensationalize everything and say it is going to be the next big thing and buy in before you lose your opportunity.  They will keep selling their stock, and once they are out, their news will stop talking about it and it will start to drop, fast, like no more trading today fast.  Over several months the severely over valued stocks will stabilize, losing much of their value.\n\n\nMost people are like cattle with the stock market, they want to keep their gains so they keep selling and the value goes lower and lower.  A bunch of companies will go out of business.\n\n\nA bunch of companies whose stock is valued at $50 a share will be on sale for $10 a share, I will buy in tech ETFs at that time.\n\n\nAI is like a digital dog, it needs a dog trainer and someone to keep it on task.  You can give it specific bounds and specific tasks to do, and it will do them well, but it will struggle when the parameters change and it will need guidance.  That's where you come in.",

Aka hack together an MVP, refactor to use best practices, and only then worry about “hard stuff”.",

Just make something that already exists, add your own flair to it with what you're learning or want experience in. What are your goals with your poject?\n\nFor example, I just had a job interview a few months ago ask how would I build a chat app. It wasn't a question about coding, it was a system design question.\n\nSo I decided to do that as a project. Plenty of them already exist. But I wanted experience with websockets, making a mobile app, and using serverless microservices so I focused on lambdas, dynamoDB, and API gateway. My primary goal wasn't learning to code, my primary focus was serverless microservices and system design, and creating a truly polished project to throw on my resume that I could point web, google play, and apple links at.\n\nI also wanted it to be a fully polished, presentable project I could put on my resume (it's live on google and web, pending apple right now), and I decided to throw in a few buzzworthy features - AI integration, TTL (self destructing mesages using TTL on the databases), and end-to-end encryption. After adding a slew of other features the app kind of took it's own form and is different than other chat apps.\n\nJust make anything. Put your own spin on it. The idea is something the recruiters can look at that looks polished, and something you can explain system design choices and code on it. You'll end up with a ton of good answers to 'how did you solve a technical challenge you had'.\n\nWhat is it you think you need experience learning, what do you want to post on your resume saying you know how to do? You can form what project you should do by answering those questions.",

Get good at communicating in Jira, Confluence, Github, Slack, etc. You’ve got tons of tooling to help with this, use it. After that, you may find that you don’t actually need synchronous standups EVERY day, maybe MWF, with async versions on TTh unless specifically needed.",
