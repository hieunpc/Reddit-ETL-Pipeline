Some candidates tried inviting an AI \"note taker\" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \\*asked\\* if they could do so).\n\nWe then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.\n\nBut every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate \"You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?\"\n\nEvery single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.\n\nI can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",

All the cdc pipelines work great, and I haven't had any issues.\n\nI have to ask, how come you can't use mirroring for your on-prem sql? Or at least spark if not mirroring.\n\nFor the front end, I just approached it via segmentation of capacity. So, each business domain only throttles themselves. But that doesn't happen much since nobody uses paginated reports, and the data models are pretty clean.\n\nHonestly, I'd still rather use Databricks, but my problem is I can't justify it to my organization since I made the Fabric site work too well on its own...",

This can be on-prem or in the cloud as a VM or equivalent, like a DB service that can scale but isn’t distributed, so you cannot break a constraint. \n\nVery different to distributed cloud DB computing where PK/FK constraints cannot be enforced, which is why we need to have a landing area for new data, staging, then Medallion.

Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. \n\nMy current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. \n\nWhen we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. \n\nThere's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times. ",

Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. \n\nData modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.\n\nNow this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. \n\nSo how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!\n\nIf anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source. ",

It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit.  I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may  like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions.  A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.\n\nI am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon.  I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now.  Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem).  A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers.  \n\nThe way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to).  So in the end it can only answer simple questions like \"tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months\".  Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy?  Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",

You're lacking that mercantalist attitude and, without realising that the market is pretty solid right now letting organisations pay you a junior level salary (yes, a junior salary for companies with a strong tech culture) with 4 YOE.\n\nThis isn't always a hard skills problem. This is also a softskills problem. Sorry to break it to you but markets do not operate on merit alone. It's also who you know, who you get to know, and timing. I was working a junior salary for the longest time (40k a year junior dev) and then I went right up to 170k/year as of today. I was lucky to have the Elixir slack group back in the day sit me down and have this talk with me and make me realise I'm letting myself get hustled (or fleeced if you're a northerner like me :) ) because I lack the self confidence to apply for positions that pay a respectable income, in the UK, above what a copywriter makes. \n\nI think you need to work more towards becoming a software enigneer and less of a tooling engineer. But even with your experience I'd estimate you should be able to pull at least 30k more in more of a devops role. There are a LOT of companies with broken data pipelines. Your job is to get street wise.",

Understanding what needs to be measured, how to measure it, and then building the pipelines.\n\nSome core skills that you need to be really good at in todays modern data tech stack world are these:\n\n- Strong SQL, i.e. its like reading and writing english\n- DBT, don’t let a new tool intermediate you, it’s just SQL queries orchestrated in an autogenerated DAG. \n- Data QA, building pipelines where data quality tests are first class citizens. The moment your dashboard shows one wrong number people instantly loose trust in your data assets. Better to delay data availability then delivering and redacting later.\n\nSome tools to look into:\n- Airbyte for data ingestion\n- Superset and Metabase for BI tools\n- Duckdb",

About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.\n\nIts not always about \"saving\" time for me but rather its about doing things the \"better\" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the future\n\nI know what I've said above is not related to \"AI on top of broken data stack\", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.\n\nBy fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to \"slap AI on top of our data\" as in:\n\n\\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\\_xyz contain data from source\\_abc? how often does table\\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)\n\n\\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like \"what was our prediction accuracy last week?\" \"how did model A perform vs model B last year?\"\n\nI think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the \"self-service\" utopia we've always dreamt about.",

However, IME for very complicated jobs, the catalyst query optimizer behind Spark performs better than the other two - if you have more than 10ish non-broadcast joins in a given query, I would rather trust spark. You will need to spend more time on a dev setup (e.g. unit tests are awfully slow without a spark connect server which you fire up each morning), but you also get some goodies such as Spark UI/History Server and a really powerful and stable API.\n\n\n- As you are using Delta, I would be cautious with duckdb. Afaict, write support is not yet there, and even for reads I had undocumented not-implemented errors bubble up from the internal c++ code (on1.41 if I remember correctly). The API there does not yet look super stable.\n\n\n- On the off chance that you are in a corporate environment where your development machines run windows, strongly prefer polars over spark. Delta spark on windows is possible but a pain because of the Hadoop dependency.",

This can be a specific person/team or it can be one of the checklist items (if your company is small enough) that every system owner is required to certify for acceptance.\n\nAnd it has to include backups, logs and analytics.  It is a lot of work up front, identifying the rules and what that needs to look like, but the maintenance part of that is generally straightforward.\n\nHonestly, in my experience the hardest part is getting the requirements clearly defined, as business users seldom want to give up old data; which is exactly what this is about.",

None of these are particularly insurmountable, just costs you should be happy to take on in exchange for the experience you like. \n\n\n\nOne thing you might do to hedge is store data at rest in Iceberg on GCS and self host a catalog like \\[Lakekeeper\\](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/).

It is not a super complicated stack but it *is* work and creates an additional point of failure, especially with the networking and security side of it imo.   \n  \nMy recommendation is keep it as is if you love it since Motherduck appears to be a very affordable service, if you end up having to migrate later on it should not be a very heavy lift.

But more important than arsenal of long list of tech stack is your structured problem-solving skills.\n\nLast but not least, communication skill. Usually senior-level engineer is able to communicate values and communicate complex tech in simpler terms. *Personally this is something that I keep on striving too* :).\n\n  \nGood luck!",

Data exploration is an important skill, but understanding schemas and how they fit together is the crucial part. Your data analyst background should help with data modeling as well. Try to focus on roles that highlight these things in the job description. \n\nAlso be aware that there are different flavors of data engineers. Being analytics focused means you’re more on the business intelligence and dashboarding side. Highlight your storytelling and data vis exp. If you’re on the ML side, highlight how you productionize ML models and maintain workflows.",

Best-practice in terms of this kind of thing is to know the trade-offs), implement observability from day 1 (that can be writing logs and checking them daily in cloudwatch at the start).\n\nNote that MANY of your trade-offs and architectural decisions will depend on what kind of requirements are required downstream. In fact, the very first thing you need to map is who are the data consumers and what are their needs - mind you that more often than not the end-users have very vague requirements (it is often a big part of the job to translate vague business requirements into technical choices - also, often what they want is different than what they need). If applicable to your case: also talk to upstream stakeholders (feks, in my company, the data is generated by services written by developers, so I have to sync with them to understand what is doable or not in terms of data serving/latency)\n\nEDIT: also, if you are not super familiar with AWS, dont underestimate how much time you'll spend implementing things there :D\n\n(I'm in a similar position, where I wear the architect, tech lead and engineer hat at the same time - and oh, Iam also brazilian ;) )",

Most decent teams don’t hire because you know ADF vs Glue, they hire because you understand pipelines, data modeling, failure modes, and tradeoffs.\n\n\nIf you already invested in Azure, don’t throw that away. The concepts transfer really well. S3 vs ADLS, Glue vs ADF, Redshift vs Synapse are different names, same ideas. Picking up AWS on top of Azure is way easier than starting from zero.\n\n\nFor getting your foot in the door, I’d stick with Azure as your “primary” stack, but get just enough AWS exposure to be conversational and not blocked in interviews. You don’t need to master both.\n\n\nAlso, product companies preferring AWS isn’t a hard rule, it’s just more common historically. Plenty of good teams care more about how you think than which cloud you used last.\n\n\nSo no, you don’t need to panic learn everything. Deep fundamentals  amd one strong stack beats shallow knowledge of two",

They just think 'but this is what everyone else is using so I should use it'.\n\nThe annoying thing is, if you have good judgement and figure out the most appropriate tech to use, that can get in the way of upskilling if you settle on a simple, cheap but more mundane alternative.\n\nIf you want to learn some of the things you listed:\n- if you're using snowflake, why not just start using dbt + git to manage your SQL?\n- how is data getting into snowflake in the first place? If that looks quite manual at the moment, maybe try setting up airflow to schedule data extraction / load\n\nI think you could probably find opportunities to do things you want to - obviously not all of it but maybe have a think about what's possible",

From there you should be able to design decent overall data models, talk with people in detail about what approach should be taken and point out issues in advance before anything has been coded, at this point you're working as much on people skills as hard technical skills.\n\nIt's tempting, because of the flood of shitty job ads, to think you need tool X or intricate knowledge of language Z, but the reality in terms of being capable has nothing to do with those, unless you're a typical recruiter.",

You’re spot on about batch jobs quietly being the best fit for so many “real time” requests.\n\nOn upskilling, experimenting with dbt + git is a great move even if it’s not in prod at your current job. Same with Airflow—just automating even one small pipeline can help you understand DAGs and scheduling. And if you want to broaden a bit into API stuff but aren’t getting those projects at work, there are plenty of open datasets out there you could ETL into Snowflake as a side project. Sometimes the best way to get experience is just faking a “business need” for yourself.\n\nUltimately, don’t sweat the trend-hopping; being able to design and maintain stable, clear data products is way rarer (and more valuable) than knowing every tool under the sun.",

It’s never happening, don’t try.\n\nMy advice: be practical and treat the old stuff like it’s cancer that needs to be cut out.\n\nDon’t try to document the mess you have. Instead build or fix things one piece at a time and document that as you go. Build in parallel, dual run against the old things, and when you know the old tables and batches are redundant, take them out back and shoot them in the head.\n\nAlso, forget AI. It knows when I’ve forgotten to close a print statement in my shitty code, but it doesn’t know architecture or systems design.\n\nIf you want to automate this, try the missing index reports.\n\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-missing-index-groups-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17\n\nBe wary, this reflects what queries are written and run (probably by the same useless engineers that made this mess) rather than the actual logic and definitions that matters.

It's great.\n\nWhere I work I use the MySQL v8 ODBC in a Windows server running MSSQL in prod, and push tables across the network truncate/load in a remote staging tables of a MySQL server (that the Wan IP addresses & ports are fixed and whitelisted for security). Once the load is completed, a stored proc is called remotely to signal the MySQL to process those staging tables.\n\nIt's an annoying process though, I would rather create flat files, push them somewhere, and an event triggered at the remote end (like a datalake container/folder) processes them. I could then make JSON data and send that, also based on events.\n\nIOW, JDBC/ODBC between servers is a \"work-around\" solution, and it's slow. Like 45 mins to send 2 gigs of data.\n\nHTH",

There is 0 gain from making it a snapshot and eating the storage and eventually processing speed. I wouldn't worry too much about what others think of how and where the data should work in theory. Theory rarely ever applies in the real world, the data and how you get it dictates what you do and in this field most cases, you have 0 control over the source of the data. Which means almost nothing operates like it should and you just have to get the data as accurate as possible, as efficiently as possible space, and processing wise.\n\n  \nTo me, Bronze always matches source, or at least as close to it as you can possibly get. If it doesn't, you are going to have a horrible time running down why things don't match up. Snapshotting like option A is really only good for if you need to see how things have changed over time, or doing day to day comparisons at the Bronze level and I'd rarely ever want to do that because that's honestly a waste of space and processing. \n\n  \nAs for Option C, I would avoid anything that makes data right after the fact and there's a point in time where non-dirty read data is inaccurate.

Glue jobs with bootstrapping logic (or even AWS SDK/CLI scripts) can generate and update the tables as needed, while the Terraform state stays clean and manageable. It does add an extra step to your deploys, but it’s more transparent and less prone to silent breakage than bending Terraform out of shape.\n\nFor versioning, a lot of folks lean on dbt’s schema versions and migration patterns, even if it means treating Glue like more of a catalog pointer than a true source of state.\n\nCurious to see if anyone’s found a less clunky solution that keeps everything declarative—but so far, the split-responsibility model seems the most maintainable.",

Chunking with pandas is a solid approach for memory management, but you do have to be careful: some operations just don’t make sense chunk-by-chunk.\n\nChunking is great for row-wise, stateless preprocessing (cleanup, type conversion, basic feature engineering). But for anything that needs a full view of the data—global normalization, deduplication, calculating rare category frequencies, finding global min/max—you’ll either need multiple passes or a clever accumulation/aggregation step.\n\nA typical workflow for your scenario:\n- First pass: Scan over chunks to gather global stats (means, stds, value counts, rare category thresholds).\n- Second pass: Use those stats to transform the data in chunks. Outlier detection, normalization, etc. can be done chunked, but with knowledge of global parameters.\n- Save intermediate files as Parquet if possible, for speed and compression.\n- Tools: Dask and Polars both handle these kinds of workflows better than vanilla pandas, especially Polars for very fast I/O and multi-threading.\n- For Colab: keep an eye on disk (mount Google Drive if needed), and be ready to restart if you hit session limits.\n\nIf you ever need to empower less technical folks to safely interact with this data (without risking direct DB access), there are platforms nowadays that let you build internal apps over your datasets via drag-and-drop, or even AI chat interfaces. Could help with democratizing those big data insights beyond just the Python crowd.\n\nBut for now: chunking + multi-pass over Parquet files + Dask/Polars is the combo I’ve seen work well in similar RAM-constrained settings. Good luck wrangling those 30 million rows!",

At 30M rows, this almost always triggers an OOM (Out of Memory) crash in environments like Colab.\n​Serialization Overhead: Converting DuckDB’s internal format to Pandas and then to a model-ready format creates unnecessary CPU work and memory duplication.\n​Moving to Polars solved this because it feels like it was built for the 'Model' part of 'Data Science.' Since it uses the Apache Arrow memory format, it integrates seamlessly with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Scikit-Learn with zero-copy potential meaning the model can often read the data directly without doubling the RAM usage.\n​The Lazy API and Streaming mode let me handle the full 30M-row feature engineering pipeline with way more stability. I can build complex transformations (scaling, encoding, joins) and only 'collect' the data when the model is ready for it. It's definitely the move if you're looking to build a scalable, production-ready ML pipeline!",

A few design things that usually matter more than model choicee would be like always ground generation on the actual schema + metrics layer, not just table names. Most failures come from the model guessing joins or columns, Add a validation step before execution (dry run, limits, blocked queries). Don’t let raw generated SQL hit prod blindly. Start narrow, Constrain what users can ask for (time ranges, metrics, dimensions) before going fully “chatty”. On the knowledge side, most teams I’ve seen keep it simple, Use RAG for business logic, definitions, metric semantics,Treat schema and relationships as structured input, not embeddings.GraphRAG helps when relationships are complex, but it adds a lot of operational overhead.Solr *can* work for retrieval, but it’s usually better as a search layer than a true graph store. If relationships matter a lot, a dedicated graph or just explicit schema metadata often ends up clearer and more reliable. and correctness and guardrails beat clever architecture early. If users don’t trust the numbers, they won’t use it, no matter how good the UX is",

I have helped many customers with this problem and truly believe that what Databricks gives is a high quality text2sql solution with AIBI Genie. You can find lot of information on Databricks Genie and its benchmarking results.\n\nIts a hard problem to solve especially around the biggest requirement which I see from analysts or power users, which is the need for quality and deterministic SQL code. This is where traditional BI does well, whereas LLMs could hallucinate.\n\nBest practices in Genie include using well curated metadata about each dataset, column definitions,  semantic understanding about the data etc. These become non negotiable with agent based solution, since that's the only context for AI.\n\nSomething like Genie being a tool in your arsenal will help your overall agentic solution. And best part is that you don't need data to be in Databricks. Databricks can connect into your database via Lakehouse federation and understand the layout of data.",

        "body": "The biggest shift for me was realizing that “thinking like an architect” is less about tools and more about trade offs. In real projects you are almost never designing from scratch. You’re reacting to constraints like messy data, changing requirements, cost limits, and systems you didn’t choose. So the thinking becomes things like where this pipeline will actually break, what happens when volume doubles, what can fail safely and what cannot, and what’s expensive to recompute versus cheap to store. If you’re not on a DE project right now, the closest substitute is to simulate real pain. Take a public dataset and design ingestion, transformations, and reporting, then deliberately change assumptions like schema changes, late arriving data, backfills, or higher volume, and force yourself to optimize for cost and reliability instead of elegance. Books and blogs help with vocabulary, but most architectural thinking comes from asking what the simplest thing is that won’t hurt you later, then being wrong a few times. Reading postmortems and migration stories taught me more than polished tutorials ever did. You don’t really learn architecture in a vacuum, but you can train the mindset by constantly reasoning about constraints, failure modes, and long term impact",

You'd learn whole lot more if you were to build your own pipeline portfolio, load them on GitHub. Perhaps, look into bootcamps if that interest you at all. \n\n3) Data Analyst is generally an entry point into data field. Can scale up from there to senior DA roles or pivot into data engineering, data scientist, AI/ML, Data Architect, Solutions Architect roles. \n\n4) Don't leave your current role if the pay is good and career is stable. Job market right now is pretty harsh, will not make sense to leave a good paying job. \nTake full advantage of FAANG stocks, benefits and their free online courses taught by FAANG on coursera. Check with HR to see if transition is possible as an internal employee into tech, what would be the process. Find out data engineers internally on outlook, teams, slack and setup 1-on-1 with them, ask all kinds of questions about the skills needed, about their career path, etc. \n\n5) The most fundamental skill required for any data role is SQL, there's no shortcut to that and one cannot survive without knowing SQL at good level. \nFrom here skills will pivot based on the role. Ex: Data Engineers require strong data modeling, distributed systems (ex: Databricks, snowflake) storage and compute skills. Tools don't matter at all, focus on the core, basics, foundations as everything else is build on those.\nData Scientist: Strong Applied Math or Applied Stats skills, domain knowledge helps a lot.  \n\nFeel free to dm me if you want to talk more.",

        "body": "I came into data in a similar way, coming from finance directly to lead a data team with limited technical knowledge other than decent sql.  I have also been involved with several data warehouse builds in my career.  You are thinking about it in the right way as this stuff is always a series of tradeoffs.  What does feature X do for us, how long will it take and what value does it provide?\n\nIt seems like you are vague on requirements, which is the norm, so I would focus on that as it will inform what you build (i.e. you will be rebuilding and reloading if you miss a bunch of stuff).  Start with what you have today and come up with a list of columns and the concepts they related to as a starting point.  I would also get with whoever does the budget modeling / FP&A work for the company as they know the KPIs and drivers of the business, which you will have to align to.  At the end you should have a list of columns or metrics with a domain and column (e.g. domain is customer and columns for account number, name, address, etc).\n\nThen start with that as you talk to other stakeholders.  A good meeting might involve say someone from marketing who knows the views they  want to see, a data analyst who might know what columns/calculations are involved in producing that view and then you and your DA can bump that off against your model.  It's easier to ask them for what's missing rather than come to them with a blank sheet of paper.  Also get a sign off from the department because they will inevitably come back with 20 more requests on the week you drop the finished product.  The DA should be able to work from that artifact.\n\nThe data model is important because ideally you want one data source that feeds 80% or more of your data requests.  This ensures that data is consistent across all reporting and dashboards as it uses the same core data and calculations.  If there is an error in a calculation, you can change it in one place and it propagates across all the dependencies.  If you build custom data models for each dashboard or request, then you can have inconsistencies where the developer used the wrong formula, or when you need to make a change you have to find it and change it dozens to hundreds of times.\n\nIn terms of important things I would say requirements is first (though you can often do this incrementally), then figuring out your infrastructure.  Like what is your approach to building pipelines and does it provide velocity to develop, is it maintainable, observable, etc.  Does your data platform align well with the likely use cases you know about?  You sort of need this initial planning in place to get going, but afterward you can build incrementally as MVPs or by data subject to show off progress.\n\nYou need to balance delivering value and insight to the business with the necessary things to support a robust platform.  Things like automations should be considered, but it's a question of prioritization.  How much time does the automation save vs time to build right now?  Can we defer it without major consequences?  Which ones are the priority?  Can we produce demoable work each sprint or quarter to show progress, and better if the platform can be partially used to deliver value ahead of being fully fleshed out.\n\n\\-sorry for  the essay.",

That cost should be separated, since it is a different discussion than the rest of the CDC discussion, unless you design a solution that needs to be re-initialized regularly.  Eg. I think Fabric's \"mirroring\" involves re-seeding every time the capacity is stopped and restarted. \n\n\n\nThe \"after that\" part of your answer is probably more interesting to OP.  This is where the underlying CDC magic happens. Most databases implement CDC by feeding the database transaction log to the subscriber.  This can be done asynchronously, at a lower priority than anything else that is happening.  In other words, the normal clients and users of the database can be given priority, and the CDC work can take place whenever there are free resources.  I wouldn't necessarily agree with the \"5-10%\" increase in server usage unless the server was very small.  This overhead would be based on a number of factors.  If you had a TB of data and 32 cores on your DBMS and only 100 CUD operations at the source a day, then the amount of transaction log activity would be neglible and the CDC workload would be virtually zero.  All things being equal the CDC workload would increase as the transaction log becomes more busy.  And even then the source DBMS wouldn't prioritize CDC activities over regular database usage.",

Since you've been working as a DE for a number of years and you're trying to over-employ (?!) I'll assume somewhere at the mid-level.  I'll note that I've primarily worked at startups so mid-level in my mind may have higher requirements or expectations than mid-level at MNCs.\n\nAt the mid level or senior level, I'd expect a DE to get assigned a few tickets at the beginning of a sprint and, during standup, note that they're looking for a new ticket if they're done with their existing work.  I'd also expect them to keep us abreast of any developments in their work so it doesn't fall behind, etc.\n\nFor ad hoc requests, if there does not exist a triage system (for example: if no one picks this up in 15 minutes, it's fair game for anyone and respond to the request) then I would recommend suggesting one.  If the style is \"whoever sees it first\" (like my job right now) then either the DEs must adapt to that style or communicate with one-another to enforce another style (like triage and sprint protectors or something); to ignore ad hoc requests or to require others to triage is putting extra work on the team --- and it seems like you've already been talked to about it, so it's possible that the team doesn't love that you don't pick up ad hoc stuff.  The big word here is _communication_, and it's extremely important to have team-wide communication open.\n\n\"Oh, but my job is so hard, and it's impossible to do XYZ...!\"  Yes, I know, there are a hundred thousand excuses for why any of us don't like our jobs and why it's impossible and why the workload is intolerable.  The reality of the situation is that you either adapt or fail to thrive.\n\n---\n\nAs I finished this, I saw this comment:\n\n> I had mentioned how things worked with me in the past and I thing it is really simple and clear if engineering lead or manager just informs me if they want to pick any issues up. Im thinking proactive would come eventually but not in a forced manner.\n\nI would never want to work with a mid-to-senior+ level DE who has this mindset.  How do you expect being proactive would come _eventually_ if you aren't practicing it at all and making your lead / manager do all the triage _for you_ (which gives them _more work_ to do)?\n\n\nEDIT: Apologies for being so blunt here: I've had a few coworkers in the last year with this mindset who made my job significantly more frustrating than it needed to be.  I want you to succeed in your company but it looks like you reply with a lot of excuses to well-meaning comments so I'm trying this approach.",

If you want to keep it free, there are open source ones used by actual companies like Apache Airflow. You can use this on the open data sources mentioned. \n\nI’ve been through many DE and DE role adjacent interviews, and SQL almost always comes up. Know some technicals like order of execution in a SQL query, CTE’s, Window functions. I have never been asked any python technicals (have done a few OA’s though that are typical leetcode style, but these were not the norm), aside from Spark concepts.\n\nWhen you scour job postings, you’ll see a company can be entirely on Azure, AWS, Databricks, Snowflake, etc. But I also see a lot of postings that are Airflow, DBT + Snowflake for example. Airflow and DBT are free and you can use a local RDBMS instead of a cloud DW for a project to teach you ETL concepts and data orchestration, warehousing, modeling.\n\nGet good at one stack and apply for jobs that use those. Before your resume gets to a human, an ATS will scan for all the relevant key words in your resume with the JD. I have only worked with Azure & Databricks so I immediately stop reading a JD when it’s asking for AWS or Snowflake. In your resume, emphasize the results per experience (ex. optimized X by Y%) first, responsibilities second. I think you can definitely give your many different roles to chatgpt and ask it to reframe those roles to be more DE-specific.\n\nAs for certs, I have noticed consulting roles seem to value those more than product company roles. If you’re fine with spending money, a Databricks DE associate cert, AWS DE, etc could make you stand out more as an entry level candidate. If you want to work with the cloud, AWS is more commonly used over Azure and GCP. Having worked in consulting before, the certs are how the firm pitches you to clients and gets you staffed (and therefore make money off of you).\n\nLastly, use Linkedin and have all the relevant DE skills and experiences on your profile. It’s a lot easier for recruiters to find you first instead of the other way around. \n\nGood luck and I’m happy to answer any more questions you may have!",

Those \"let's just do x for now\" always bite you in the ass. It seems today's strategy is to limp things along until the business is fed up enough to wait for an entire redesign. Then the tech team and manager are replaced and you don't even fix all the tech debt because the people aware of it left! Tech debt NEEDS to be tracked and talked about regularly. Where I'm at they pushed anyone technical out of those discussions and it's only been band and worse. The consulting team they brought in pointed the finger at the data/tech team, promoted mid level managers with no tech background into those leadership positions (now they have to lean on the consultants for EVERYTHING AND EVERY DECISION! So much wasted money and time but theres no one technical to explain anything, even WHY things are as messy as they are. \n\nI saw this happening and tried to get my boss to understand what was happening. Instead he fought her about design differences instead of division of responsibilities. The consultant got 2 years to work with the analysts (who from my outside perspective were much further behind the engineers) while pointing fingers at the engineers/data. He needed to be bringing up all of the things the analysts and the business side need to do to make teams like this successful.",

That doesn't run a count(1), it's getting it from metadata. So it's O(1) time relative to table size. \n\nObviously a PITA to do this if you had 100s of tables, but since you only have two tables, dead easy. \n\nIn theory you could query the metadata directly to get this programmatically. It's one of the sys views, but I never remember which.\n\nOther than checking table counts, I guess the important question is how is the server migration being performed? If it's a backup of the old DBs being restored onto the new server, then this is a pretty bombproof approach, so long as:\n\n- writes to the DB have been completely stopped first (e.g. put DB into read only mode first)\n- the backup is run with the checksum option\n\nSo in this case, I'd focus more on making sure the process for the migration has been thought out fully - then you don't have a lot of validation to do. Otherwise you're just validating that a widely used quarter-century-old enterprise RDBMS doesn't have a certain type of seriously fundamental bug.\n\nIf the data migration is happening via some bespoke approach then you do need to validate further. But you first need to ask why they're not doing the more obvious simple backup/restore. \n\nFor further validation, you really need to take the hit on slow scan queries and make sure the time needed for that is built into the migration plan.\n\nGathering stats is the right approach but I'd focus on sum() of numerical columns that mean something to the business (currency values, quantities, durations, etc). Just sum the whole table with no group by. It doesn't have to be a useful KPI /metric that way, it's just a number that would be very sensitive to anything going wrong in the migration. And if all those numbers are unchanged, you can be pretty confident that whatever you use the data for will still work.",

Cloud autoscaling is much better than it used to be, but only at a per-service level, and the deeper into your pipeline you get, things are like dominoes. Schema can also kill you; you absolutely need an experienced engineer to help you get that schema right. There will also be countless integration details and knobs to turn throughout the pipeline to ensure it doesn't crash, and you'll need to know the exact implications of each one. Data has a shape, both horizontal and vertical, and neither one likes sudden changes midstream. How will you handle deploying those changes? What happens if you need to roll back a change? How will you remember what changes you made? Do you understand CI/CD and why it was developed? How many tenants do you expect to onboard to this platform? How will you keep their data separate and secure? Some of these are very basic engineering skills, but we have them for good reason, and they're skills learned over time, and often painfully. Lost data is lost money, and when it's gone, it's usually gone.\n\nI don't mean to discourage you. Something like this is a fantastic learning project, but you really need to learn not just the code behind it, but exactly how the data flows through the system. We don't worry so much about Big O problems in the age of cloud computing, but similar math problems are still there (unless you have an unlimited budget). An SRE can also be helpful.\n\nYou can have this fast, cheap, or reliable. Pick two.",

Generating high quality Q&A from 100k word documents with a 70B model is always going to be slow and expensive unless you constrain it hard\n\nWhat usually works in practice is breaking this into stages. First chunk aggressively not just by tokens but by semantic boundaries like sections or topics, otherwise reasoning quality falls off anyway. Then do cheap filtering or summarisation passes first, either with a smaller model or heuristics, to identify which chunks are even worth turning into Q&A. Only send the “interesting” chunks to a large model\n\nFor cost people often mix models like small or mid size models for chunking, summarising, and question generation, then a stronger model only for refining or validating a much smaller subset. Trying to run LLaMA-3 70B end to end on a million long documents will blow your budget no matter the platform\n\nAlso, be realistic about “challenging reasoning” because most synthetic Q&A pipelines degrade if you push for depth at scale. You usually get better results by generating simpler questions at scale, then curating or rewriting a smaller evaluation set manually or semi automatically.",

Are they fine at that point that the roll-up for ID=1 will change to the v6 value?\" -->** We have two sets of these gold fact tables.  One set will always be updated, so it will always get the v=6 record when it comes.  The fact table I was writing about in the post will remain at v=5.  Business reason comes from our Financial Controller.  When the data comes in, we expect that after X days after a reporting period, if there are no upstream data changes, we consider it official.  There is an audit requirement to keep a permanent record of this official data for that time period because this is the data that was reported.  There is a main gold fact table that will always be up to date and that's used for other purposes, but will always be accurate.\n\nWe are implementing 'write controls' on the gold layer partition to limit this, but it won't be perfect. We're also going to store the snapshot of this data that can never be written to outside of the gold layer.\n\n**\"I'd be more concerned that the record can be updated and they don't want you to propogate the data up through the layers.\" -->** Generally, yes.  But we have a pretty unique requirement here.  We are fully propagating to gold but also maintaining a separate snapshot that will keep that snapshot in time for reporting purposes.  (They need to report on what was reported at the time as one requirement even if what was reported used an older version of the same record).,",

While all of them have this idea that they're using AI \"as a tool\" that is \"no different than a calculator\" or \"no different than using stackoverflow\" it is fundamentally different and they don't have the knowledge to realize it. Even more, they will use AI to solve the basic questions, the ones that are DESIGNED TO BE EASY so that they can learn to work with these technologies, and then complain that the later exercises are too hard.

And each of those generates new questions, and you spend all your time in a frustrating cycle that generates facts but no wisdom until you get discouraged and quit.\n\nImagine trying to learn how to program by reading [the Wikipedia page for Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) and just following all the links to related articles. *\"Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.\"* Holy cow, there's five links to click on just there, **none** of them useful for someone who wants to start learning Python.\n\nThat's from the second section after the intro.

I understand that probably nobody expects you to memorize entire libraries, but if you do not even know how to make a variable capable of carrying null value, or the difference between a stack and a list or other similar functions that you are not tought outside of programing context, then it will be extremly hard to translate a logical solution into code without rellying greatly on AI or other people to implement it for you.",

Just spend an hour creating a plan using nothing more than pen and paper. I would even suggest taking your plan to a senior developer and spending ten minutes discussing that plan with them.

This of course won't fly for many leet code problems, and some platforms don't even allow one to use many functional languages and set hard time requirements for execution time of the solutions. Parallelism and code cleanliness is given no thought. You can write all shit code with single letter variable names mutating shit everywhere, and it will accept your solution more likely than a very clean functional solution, that is trivially parallelizable and would scale (if ever needed).\n\nLooking at LC mastery mostly selects for people, who have ground that stuff hard and memorized that stuff (which won't be of too much use on the job for actual real world problems) or people, who think that this kind of procedural mutating way of programming and the typically associated languages are the end all be all, and have limited experience with other things.\n\nI much prefer advent of code (AoC) style puzzles, where you can use any language you want, and you just need a number as the solution.\n\nI feel like solving AoC puzzles has improved my ability to solve problems the functional way, even, if they at first seem to not lend themselves well to the functional paradigm. I found some pretty neat functional solutions at times. Like for example using bitboards represented by numbers as an underlying data structure and boosting performance of my previously too slow solution by a factor of more than 1000. I had to sometimes write functional versions of well known procedural algorithms. Things like A-star algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm, depth-first-search, breadth-first search. I've had to interpret how they work and how I can replace data structures they rely on with functional versions, and how I represent a graph or create it in a functional way.",

You didn't learn any of the other things that are normally taught in the first two years like patterns, web development, databases, intro to security, or general theory. Of course, programs can vary. I haven't seen a single one that's like \"C++ 101 and nothing else lmao.\"\n\nSecondly, you had to pass those classes to be going into your third year. So you passed a C++ class. You certainly had to build basic programs. You were able to follow guidelines, design by the prescribed principles, and received a passing grade. You also took an OOP class and passed it. Now you can't make your own basic programs at home. This does not make sense.\n\nThirdly, you're just figuring this out after 2 years. You paid money to be bullied and ridiculed for 2 years. You didn't go to your counselor or program director to ask if this was normal. You just dealt with the abuse, passed your classes, then immediately forgot what you learned.

JS proved interesting because of its prototype-based inheritance model - a completely different approach from classical OOP.\n\nThe pattern isn't obsession - it's sustained engagement through novelty. Each language shift brought fresh problems to solve and different paradigms to master. I didn't chase the same dopamine hit of early discovery; instead, I built deeper expertise while regularly introducing new complexity. The \"addiction\" you remember might have been beginner's excitement from rapid skill acquisition. That specific feeling doesn't return, but it's replaced by something more durable: the satisfaction of solving increasingly sophisticated problems with accumulated knowledge. You don't need to recapture obsession - you need new challenges that match your current skill level.",

I also persue programming with hope of doing it professionally. \n\nOne thing I've learned as I work in other industries is that most \"professionals\" don't know the right thing to do in a given situation. What makes them qualified to do the job is the wisdom and experience they've gathered that helps them figure out the right way. \n\nMy day job is working around a group of technicians. I've never seen them pull a tool from their tool box that I don't know how to use. When something on their unit is broken their experience tells them what tool they need and why they should start there. I think the same basic concept can be applied to programming professionally. I can write multi threaded code. How do I know when I should write multi-threaded code?\n\nLearning to use the tool is different from applying the tool to the trade. One is easy. The other can only be gained through time. A willingness to change, take criticism, and improve plus persistence is the only \"correct\" part that matters to me.",

Everyone feels this way at one time or another, even those who doesn't appear so.\n2. Also, instead of giving in, to feelings of being an imposter, actively identify and address the weaknesses you've already identified, and do something about them.\n3. E.g. Note down terms you don't understand and learn/clarify them for yourself.  Ask here. Or research on the internet.  Or start a conversation with Claude or ChatGPT and say \"I am a programmer and I ran across the concept/term of 'dependency injection' \\[for example\\] the other day.  I don't know what this is. Write me a short treatise on this subject including references so I can get up to speed. Include examples and exercises.\" (for example.)\n4. You also observed you do nothing outside of work.  Well, that's a hint/tell: Start doing something outside of work then!  (\"Doctor it hurts when I do \\*this\\*\"  Doctor: \"Well stop doing it then!.\" You get my drift.)\n5. For example, start answering questions on a programming site, or try to.  Sometimes you'd have to do some research in order to answer. From doing this, you will learn.\n6. Try sites like: [exercism.com](http://exercism.com), [codingame.com](http://codingame.com), [codewars.com](http://codewars.com), etc\n7. One final point: AI is no magic bullet.  The presence of AI is going to increase the demand for competent engineers that can also be AI whisperers.  You can get ahead of the curve by incorporating and learning and developing the art and science of making effective use of AI in your current job context.  As time goes on, I expect this skill might be more important that your naked skills, important though they remain too. (You cannot effectively use AI in anger if you cannot properly judge and evaluate an AI's output. So your human intelligence + experience is essential for the effective use of AI.)\n\nThe software industry is wide and deep, give yourself time.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  Read Peter Norvig [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).  I have been in industry for more than 25 years now and not a day goes by that I don't learn something.  Make peace with not knowing everything, that is not where your most important skill lies.",

I worked in C and C++ professionally until 2013, when I switched to Java with a spring in my step and a song in my heart. So when I say I disagree with Mr Spolsky, it’s not because I’m defensive about not knowing C or pointers.\n\nI guess if you want to contribute to the Linux kernel, it’s got to be C and you need to understand pointers like you understand your native language. Ditto drivers. But 99.9% of programmers aren’t getting that deep in the weeds with things. Even in 2005, they weren’t. People can’t come out of undergrad knowing everything. You’ve got to pick what’s important to get started.\n\nAlso C is hard in a lot of stupid, picky ways that have nothing to do with intelligence. Mostly it’s not portable the way a lot of modern languages are. Programs that compile and run fine in one environment won’t in another because the libraries are in a different directory, or you’re using different compilers, or different versions of the compiler, or different levels of optimization (it shouldn’t matter, but I’ve seen cases where it does.) Or all kinds of stupid crap. \n\nThis was already a serious obstacle to collaboration and knowledge-sharing in 2005. It’s gotten way worse as more knowledge is shared online. It’s why Java was such a hit—the intermediate bytecode step meant that it works the same everywhere. (I mean, you *can* find incompatibilities between the Oracle JDK and IBM Semaru or whatever, but you have to be doing something really obscure.) And the creator of Stack Overflow should know that better than anyone!",

For me, I think the answer is no. As others have said, starting a project is a really effective way to learn. Then your code can be your notes and you can refer back to code when you want to remember how to do things. Regarding how to take notes, there are studies that claim writing notes by hand makes you learn the material better than typing. But I don't have a good organization system for paper so any notes I make are done in a simple markdown editor.",

Some bugs are fairly trivial to detect and fix, others can take months or years.\n\nThe important thing is that this does not fully hinge on a given programmers debugging skills. Bugs only become easy to detect and fix when\n\n* the programmer is somewhat good at debugging and familiar with the codebase,\n* the code has been written in a way that facilitates easy debugging,\n* the infrastructure has been set up in a way that facilitates easy debugging,\n* the programmer has tools available that facilitate debugging.\n\nPeople can have different preferences for how to go about achieving these things, but they're likely to involve stuff like\n\n* [Good error messages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/index.html#common-message-styles)\n* Observability setups (logging, metrics, tracing)\n* Access to actual debuggers\n* Tests (both unit tests and integration tests)\n* Automated builds and common integration & testing infrastructure (to eliminate the \"it works on my machine\" situations)\n* Linters / rule engines that prevent certain code from being merged\n* Static typing and a [reliable type system](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (there are some people who swear by dynamic typing, but Typescript is gaining ground over Javascript, and it's pretty common now to have type hints and typechecking for Python too, and apparently PHP)\n* Various code architecting styles, though preferences there _really_ vary, but see e.g. \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" and \"parse, don't validate\"\n\nI.e. a lot of the work we do is done to make debugging easier, and avoid bugs reaching production in the first place.\n\nBut depending on situation and the technology involved some bugs can still be pretty hard to figure out. There's [a talk from CppCon 2017 by Louis Brandy, _Curiously recurring C++ bugs at Facebook_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkgszkPnV8g) that has a lot of examples of stuff that can stump professionals. (And they're specifically _C++_ bugs. Lots of companies are switching to Rust, and those bugs aren't present in Rust, and probably not in most other languages either.)",

If you do less than that, you won't have the group project experience and advanced topic fundamentals to hit the ground running. You'll be competing with offshore code monkeys we can staff during US or EU business hours for under $20/hr loaded cost rate (salary, benefits, support staff, equipment, building, everything). And now, you'll be competing with Claude. May as well wait tables at that point. \n\nAt 19 years old, the best advice anyone can give you is to go to university and do an engineering or CS program. You don't have to go to MIT or Cambridge or IIT etc. If you have a four year state technical school whose program is well respected and that has a strong internship placement office, that's fine. Hiring managers nearby probably graduated from that program and will recognize the credential. Especially with AI, your goal is to be solid enough to do the job without AI so you can manage AI as though it were a junior developer. I get customer hires and sometimes staff hires that came out of these six month bootcamps and it's tedious. I'm essentially their TA/professor for what they would have learned in their first big sophomore year project practicum to say nothing of the next two years of courses. And they'll be hamstrung because no one's going to ever make them build a simple database server or webserver or memory allocation method and they'll never really understand how that works.

What I really lacked was some sort of project to put all that together and the knowledge to break that down into the necessary steps. After all sorts of tutorials on YouTube and Udemy that didn't really have any good projects to walk through, I found a great tutorial from Tim Corey that built an actual app. It was an app that you would use to track a 3v3 basketball tournament for your office. What clicked the most about his approach was going through the planning phase of what the application needed to do. It needs to register players, register teams, and assign players to teams. It needs to keep track of who paid the $10 entry fee for the current tournament, it needs to track the bracket and match ups for the current tournament, etc. \n\nThe code was done in such a way that it would be platform agnostic, meaning you could build it as a desktop app that saved the data to both a text file and a database or it could run as a web app on your phone and connect to a cloud database or something like that. \n\nThat's the kind of tutorial I needed, and it sounds like you need more hands on learning with the planning part. I knew the syntax for all the loops, how to create functions and call them later, etc., but I never knew how to sit down with a blank project in the text editor and start building something. That tutorial did a great job showing how to go from an idea of what you want to make to breaking that idea up into smaller steps. It also did a good job of identifying what you needed for the MVP (minimally viable product--the bare minimum features to be a functioning app) vs what were \"nice to haves\" that could be added in future phases. \n\nI ended up abandoning the whole C# thing when I got a job as a data analyst several years ago. I've gotten by with just SQL so far, but I'm getting ready to start a peer mentorship with one of the folks on my team to learn python and predictive modeling now that I have a project that would benefit from it.

Like, for example, why don't you think of some things that are out there, like a contact form, or a blog, or just some tool like a calculator, and figure out how to build them from scratch.\n\nWith a contact form, if you're building from scratch (don't use a 3rd party form), then you have to figure out  not only how to accept data, but allow a user to submit, and then where does that data go?   that's a project.  Maybe you want the data sent to your email or to the cloud or stored in a Db, so maybe you need to learn Azure or SQL, but that'll get your brain thinking about a real, functional project\n\nFor a blog, you need to get user data to print/post to the screen, but again, do you want to be able to store/archive data, if so, what tools will you use to make that happen.\n\nYou can make a calculator look real with html and css, but how about accepting user input (when they push buttons) and the calculations behind the scenes to do the math and then display it.\n\nThe best thing you can do to learn is to break down these projects to figure out what parts will be HTML and CSS, but knowing what else you'll need to make it functional.\n\nCheck youtube for beginner html css javascript projects.",

It’s a book where you read and build at the same time, the author provides code snippets but it’s up to you as the reader to write the code by hand and get it working on your end. I’ve leaned so much and I’m only halfway through. You learn the entire life cycle of full-stack web development, from creating your first React app locally to deploying your app on the web through Docker and Google Cloud. \n\nYou definitely need to have a basic understanding of web development and programming concepts, but it’s still a book I’d recommend to anyone who is wanting to go into web dev. Hope this helps :)",

If you go beyond that the code will become a lot harder to read and maintain.\n\n> where responsibilities should realistically live\n\nCode that is executed together should be closely together. See [Locality of Behaviour](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)\n\n> how to keep things readable without over-engineering\n\nYou need to set the encapsulation boundaries the right way. If your compile time hierarchy of encapsulation matches the domain model, you will have a hard time managing all the different interactions and variations. An example for that would be an inheritance hierarchy where each class implements its own behaviour (Vehicle -> Car -> Truck / Bus; Vehicle -> Train -> ...; Vehicle -> Bycicle -> ElektroBike; Vehicle -> ??? -> MotorBike; ...)\n\nInstead, start with separating your data from your logic and keep your data in simple arrays. E.g. a List of Orders, a List of Products, a List of Deliveries, A List of Customer Account. This can be an exact match to how you design your database btw.. Also, have only 1 ID across **all** types of Entities. This will allow you to combine the Components at Runtime easily.\n\nThen write functions (not methods) that operate on those lists. One function may check whether your are going to be out of stock for any product and create a new order for your supplier. Another function may go over the recent orders by your customers and create an aggregated report of what has been ordered and how much. And so on.\n\nThink about your logic as systems or laws of nature. Similar to how gravity affects the trajectory of a ball thrown up, instead of the ball gravitating itself back to earth.\n\nYou will see that a lot of stuff that is challenging right now will become trivial.\n\nGood luck!",

Moving the window one step only changes a single data point. To make the list sorted again you only need to move this specific point to the correct place. \n\nGoing a bit further into potential optimizations you can also notice that if the point that's dropping out of the window (`op`) and the point that enters the window (`np`) are both larger or smaller than the current median, the median won't change and you can just replace `op` with `np` without resorting the list. Another observation is that if `op` and `np` are on different sides of the median, you don't actually have to resort everything to rebalance both sides because the balance can be easily restored by moving one element to the correct side:\n\n* `op` < median < `np`: move the smallest element to the right the median to the left of the median; this element is now also the largest element of the left. The new median lies between this element and the new smallest element on the right side.\n\n* `op` > median > `np`: Find the biggest element on the left side and move it to the right; it's now the smallest element on the right.\n\nBy using those observations and moving from fully sorting the window to simply partitioning it you should be able to make updating it much cheaper because you no longer have to shift all elements between `op` and `np` to either the left of the right.",

Those will make you a much more efficient programmer. Then you can go back to building more advanced projects, or make your earlier projects better.\n\nUdemy courses are helpful to get you started on a topic, similar to reading Python docs + some examples to get you started. It's helpful for exploration. But they're not that helpful for depth. You can use some of them to figure out what you want to learn next. (Protip: Never pay full price for Udemy courses. They have regular deep discounts down to $10-15 for a $200 course.)",

And a population of 4119.7 means the exact same, but RoundToInt will round the previous result to 4119 and this one to 4120.\n\nSo, use Floor or `FloorToInt` whenever you want to use the population in any other calculation - and also use `ints` for all other population-numbers, like `previousPopulation` and `deltaPopulation`. Basically you'll have \"population used in calculating the population\" as a float, and \"population used for everything else\" as an int, calculated by flooring the previous float!",

Which OS/platform are you targeting? How will the players control the game play? And so on...",

His code (in java) was very weird at first: lots of methods taking and returning Map<String,Object>. I eventually figured out that as a js developer, he was not familiar with strong typing or even class type definitions. Of course JS6 and TS in particular support those, but JS does a lot with anonymous functions and weakly typed, ad-hoc key value pair objects as a programming norm. Memory management is also completely under the hood and so the whole idea of a pointer or reference type was new as well.\n\nWhere I'm going with this is, the basics translate, but I still maintain that C/C++ is great first language followed by an OO-first language like Java, Python, or C# because it makes you internalize these concepts and gets you ready to write scalable, non-browser code. I don't prefer JS as a first language because it's hard syntactically to keep track of exactly what each construct is and the patterns, while syntactically concise, can easily be confusing on those points.\n\nJS is great; learn something else too. At least get to a point where you understand the difference between a function that's a method, a class template, or an instance of a class, understand variable typing, and understand why you might want strongly typed code and by extension what the typescript project was going for and why it was widely adopted by large js code bases.",

What follows is what I try to practice, but I'm sure others have had more experience...\n\nYou can pass by reference, that typically indicates the callee doesn't own the object and must assume it exists whilst and only until the function returns (or if passed to a constructor, whilst the exists). It places restrictions on the object which can be used to ensure you don't do things you shouldn't with it, and can be used to refer to automatically allocated objects.\n\nYou can pass a unique_ptr, the implication being that ownership is handed to the callee. Or const unique_ptr, meaning the callee can use and modify the object, but not move ownership to something else.\n\nYou can pass by shared_ptr, ownership is shared and lifetime managed by the pointer. I rarely used these. There are also weak_ptrs but I've not yet had to use them.\n\nSometimes it's perfectly valid to just pass a copy too.\n\nI try to avoid using raw pointers in c++ unless forced to, e.g. using a posix or third party C API, and if given one, I'll try and wrap them in a unique_ptr with custom deleter where and as soon as possible, so I don't forget to clean them up. But you can imply similar semantics with the constness of the raw pointer, you're just relying on other developers more than the compiler.\n\nExperts please feel free to correct me here.",

        "body": "What you are describing is commonly called *tutorial hell*, the frustrating cycle of trying different introductory tutorials but never feeling like you actually learn *how to create your own programs from scratch.*\n\nAt this point, people usually give you two pieces of bad advice: \"Work on your own projects\" and \"Contribute to open source projects\". Well, not *bad* but not without caveats.\n\nWorking on your own project is definitely a good idea, but beginners aren't in a place to know what sized project to take on. Especially because these days beginners might think, \"I want to make an AI\" or \"I want to make my own Instagram\" or \"I want to make Minecraft\" are good projects. If you pick a project that's too large, you'll spend two months on it, not finish, and then be left even more frustrated.\n\nThe solution is to **pick small projects**. You might not know what counts as \"small\", so I wrote [a free book with 81 small Python programs](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/). They all use text for output, including small ASCII art when needed. This may seem old-school, but the benefit is that every language has `print()` so you can use these projects even if you're not using Python, and there's no graphics libraries to install and configure on your computer.\n\nMy definition of \"small\" is roughly \"under a couple hundred lines of code.\"\n\nIf you work on your own projects, make a list of *negative* features: things your project *won't* do. It's too easy to let \"it would be cool if...\" expand your scope into something you'll never finish. (Every programmer who started making a game by first making their own 3D graphics library is guilty of this. It's a great for a learning experience, sure, but my money is that the game will never be released.)\n\nThere's no one moment where everything \"clicks\" but rather a series of small clicks. Finishing a dozen tiny projects is far more fulfilling and keeps you going than one half-finished giant project.\n\n\"Contribute to open source projects\" is not good advice; you do need to have some level of experience making complete software applications to meaningfully contribute, or find someone in the project to mentor you. Open source projects would love to mentor someone who will contribute in the future, but it's hard to trust that the person they invest time into will actually stick around.\n\nI tell people to write their own blog posts or tutorials of what they've learned, because that process spotlights any gaps in your understanding. (Writing programming books certainly does that for me.) Post it somewhere online under a pseudonym where it will have zero readers, but *do* post it: this forces you to finish it. I have a hundred files in my blog drafts folder and they aren't doing s*** for me.\n\nI'm going to get off Reddit and go write up this advice into a blog post now.",

A lot of the “name vibe” you want can come from rules, phoneme patterns, and weighted randomness, and you will learn faster by building a baseline you can compare against.\n\nIf you do want ML, the roadmap I would follow is: get comfortable in Python first, then learn how to prep text data, then try a simple character-level model that generates outputs conditioned on your input root. Start small with a dataset where you have pairs like (root, modern name) and ignore multi-step history at first. Once that works, you can add intermediate forms as extra training examples or as a multi-stage pipeline.\n\nThe hardest part will be the dataset, not the model. Etymology data is messy and sparse, and “multiple steps through history” is basically asking for aligned sequences across languages and time. I would prototype with whatever clean pairs you can get, then iterate. If you can make a dumb version that produces plausible names, you will be 90 percent of the way there.",

Why don’t you stop and go learn about something you feel good about? Do you like programming? Do you like the idea of programming? I’m not judging here — just looking for the other side of your story.\n\n2. A lot of programming involves not knowing the answer. Very often, things don’t work the way you think they should and you have to figure out why. You have to be very open to the idea that you might be wrong, because accepting that is often the key to finding the answer you’re looking for. You have to be okay with feeling frustrated for long periods, and you have to be persistent. Being good at programming is less a matter of knowing all the things and more a matter of being good at figuring out what you don’t know on an hourly basis. If those kinds of feelings make you uncomfortable or unhappy, programming may infeed not be a great career choice.\n\n3. The thing that hooks a lot of people is making stuff work. Seeing your program work exactly the way you want it to feels like an amazing combination of magic and certainty: it’s inspiring even though you know exactly how and why it works. It’s probably the same feeling someone gets when they fire up an engine for the first time after months of rebuilding work. If you’ve never experienced that, you might want to hang in there until you’ve built a few things to see whether you enjoy that part — it might make the rest worthwhile.",

Now, I'm trying to apply to other companies, but I'm scared of the coding assessments. Back in 2025, whenever I applied elsewhere, I would receive LeetCode-style assessments before even getting an interview. I lost hope immediately and didn’t continue with my applications.\n\nRight now, I’m using freeCodeCamp, but I struggled with one of the CSS labs, so I decided to take a break. I also started The Odin Project this new year, and I’m trying to learn it slowly.\n\nSince last week, I’ve been studying DSA because it feels like the only way to get hired in this job market. I try to code on my own first, but I get stuck—especially when there are nested loops. My brain just can’t comprehend the logic. I understand bubble sort and selection sort, but I can’t code them without looking at examples. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future; maybe if I keep learning, I’ll get better. The Odin Project says I need to practice a growth mindset, but studying DSA is so hard that it makes me wonder if I chose the wrong degree.\n\nI didn't choose my degree, my mother wanted me to take it, and I don't really know what I wanted to take before, so I just went with it.\n\nBack in college, I almost failed college algebra and my DSA subject, but I still managed to graduate on time. For algebra, the only reason I struggled was because I didn’t have eyeglasses. By the time I got them, it was already too late to catch up since I couldn’t see what the professor was teaching. For DSA, I didn’t really understand coding and syntax at first. I only started learning properly in my second year.\n\nMaybe I just got lucky before, because my first two jobs only required math assessments and quiz-style tests. If they had required coding assessments, I’m sure I would have failed and not gotten the job.\n\nI wish you the best OP, please know that you are not struggling alone.",

A person with a degree can prove that he has knowledge and experience in things on a certain level. Otherwise he would not pass the tests, would not pass the exams, and would not get his thesis defended.

I got recommended to my first workplace by my course mate. Which connections you'll be using when studying on your own?\n\nYes, universities/colleges differ. I have seen people telling how they learnt nothing really during their studies. I have read how in India the studies are mostly theoretical and people are unable to produce a code that compiles.

You learn what interests you and you leave what seems boring. Yet in a university professors teach you what you have to know. Even when you think it is irrelevant, too difficult, or boring.\n\nYes, a degree alone will not get you hired. Your knowledge, skills, experience you gained during your studies, your projects you built, that gets you hired. But that is what usually comes when doing degree studies.\n\nGoing back to what I told about hiring then having a degree will make you have much better chances in being called to the interview. Without a degree the HR person can just skip your application. And, from your post it is clear you do not have a clear idea about which projects to build. That does not compete with people who build hobby projects and that using these when it's done.\n\nSo, if possible, go for a degree.",

You have made a good choice (generally, but see my next paragraph) on naming things, which many beginners suck at. \n\nMy main criticism would be the name of the function `generate_board()` - I don't think that's an accurate description of what it does. The board is already \"generated\" and present in the `board` array. This function just *displays* it, so I think a name such as `display_board()` would be more accurate.\n\nThere are many areas for improvement once you learn more and gain more experience, though. \n\nFor example, your `check_winner()` function could be split up to make it shorter and more readable, e.g. create a function `bool is_tie()` which encapsulates the tie determination and returns true or false appropriately, then call that from `check_winner()`.\n\nYou could try separating the game logic from the input/output. By doing that you make it easier to change how the game looks (such as making a GUI version, where the logic is the same, but the display mechanism  is entirely different). \n\nFor example instead of `check_winner()` printing the result, it could return a value that indicates the state of the game.

Avoid global variables\n\nRight now board, playing, size\\_of\\_board are all global. This works but doesn't scale. Pass them as parameters instead:\n\nvoid check\\_winner(std::string board\\[\\], bool& playing);\n\n2. Use char instead of std::string for single characters\n\nstd::string for \"x\" and \"o\" is overkill:\n\nconst char X = 'x';\n\nconst char O = 'o';\n\nconst char SPACE = ' ';\n\nchar board\\[9\\] = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};\n\nMore memory efficient and faster comparisons.\n\n3. Use std::array instead of C-style array\n\n\\#include <array>\n\nstd::array<char, 9> board = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};\n\nThen you get board.size() instead of the sizeof trick.\n\n4. Tie detection bug\n\nYour tie check breaks early if it finds a SPACE, but that's wrong - game isn't a tie if there are empty spaces. Should be:\n\nbool is\\_full = true;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {\n\nif (board\\[i\\] == SPACE) {\n\nis\\_full = false;\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif (is\\_full) {\n\n// it's a tie\n\n}\n\n\n\n5. Use ternary for turn switching\n\ncurrent\\_turn = (current\\_turn == X) ? O : X;\n\n6. Consider an enum for players\n\nenum class Player { X, O, None };\n\nPrevents invalid states and makes code clearer.\n\n7. Magic numbers\n\n3 and 9 appear everywhere. Define them:\n\nconstexpr int BOARD\\_SIZE = 9;\n\nconstexpr int ROW\\_SIZE = 3;\n\nOverall solid for a beginner. The logic is correct (except tie check), code is readable, and you handled input edge cases. Next steps would be wrapping this in a class and adding a simple AI opponent.\n\nKeep building!",

What you can do is to have functions that don't touch IO at all, and just take parameters and return values. For example, `generate_board` returns a board object (or sets a global variable for now, if you haven't learnt classes yet). `set_cell(x, y, state)` sets the value in the cell, `check_winner` returns the winner. Then you'll have a method called `render_board` that renders the board on to the screen. \n\nSeparating your program into various parts helps in testing (later), and also you'll be able to easily change parts of your program without breaking the other.

If you change one of those files (a .css file in your case) and save it, it just gets saved to the drive. \n\nWeb site files get read by browsers, and the browsers do whatever the files say: show some text and images and apply css rules to make them look the way you want.\n\nBut the browser doesn't fetch the web site files you just saved **unless you tell it to.** \n\nAfter you change your .css file, try **holding the shift key and pressing the refresh button** in Edge. It's the little circle at the upper left of the Edge window.  That tells Edge to reload the HTML file it's showing and all the linked images, .css files, .js files, and other objects.\n\nOr **hold the Shift key and press F5**. That does the same thing. It's what I do.\n\nThere are software solutions to make Edge (or other browsers) automatically refresh themselves when a file changes. \n\nBut, with respect I suggest you do not use such a solution until you thoroughly understand how the browser works in this business of needing to re-fetch files you have changed on your drive. It's a fundamental concept of this whole world-wide-web dealio.",

But other people work differently: they like to start by understanding the basic building blocks, then seeing how they're combined.\n\nFor larger projects, there's an argument to be made that it's best to have all of your helper functions living in separate files, with the main function living just by itself in a single top-level file. This does sidestep (or at least defer) the problem a little.\n\n> The first multi line script i did upon running, made it difficult to refer to a variable in the top level function.\n\nThis seems unrelated to the order in which you define your functions.

Here's how I think through projects:\n\n# My Project Planning Process\n\n1. **I figure out who the project is for.** Who's going to use it? Even if it's just me.\n2. **I figure out what the user wants or needs to do.** I write statements like \"As a User, I can do \\_\\_\\_ so that \\_\\_\\_.\" Basically I'm figuring out what the user wants to do and why.\n3. **From there I usually start getting ideas for pages and what will be on the page.** I write them down. I draw some rough sketches. I mean actually write with pen and paper. You don't have to but I find that stepping away from screens for this preliminary planning helps me think better.\n4. **I like to take those sketches and bring them to full mockups.** I don't know that it's necessary, but it helps me to not have to think about styling and layout when I'm writing code. You could also use AI tools to make these mockups.\n5. **Then I get to building the project.** I try to follow TDD (Test Driven Development) and scaffold things out. I try to procrastinate the implementation details as much as possible. That way I can answer those questions about how to structure the project and everything one at a time",

Build that as a “walking skeleton” with hardcoded data and the simplest logic you can.

        "body": "One project I've always wanted to take on just for fun is delay-line storage. Back in the day, machines didn't have RAM. You had fast access and slow access memory.\n\nOne example was drum memory. At the most basic, there is a [write][erase][read] head over a spinning magnetic drum track. You had to wait for your data to sweep under the read head to get it - however long that took. This was a destructive process, because then the head passed under a magnet. This data was either written a moment later at the read head, or a write was scheduled to intercede the passive loop.\n\nThey then put a smaller, faster access loop over just a few degrees of the track, and had a larger, slower loop for the rest of the track, and this would take a couple sets of heads to pull off.\n\nBut this tech got faster still, and this is the one you can mimic - they used coils of wire, and sent modulated signals down it. Again with the feedback loop - if you wanted a piece of data, you had to wait for it to come around. If you wanted to persist that data, you had to immediately write it back on the wire. If you wanted to change it, you had to intercede the passive loop. You could add more storage with a longer wire, you could get lower latency with a shorter wire.\n\nSo that's what you can do - send data to an echo server, one on the furthest computer on the opposite, most remote destination to you on Earth or as ambitious as the DSN, and the data is stored ostensibly in the transmission itself. Want some data? You'll have to wait for that data to get back to you. Want to persist it? You'll have to send it back out. Want to change it? You get your chance as it's coming back to you and it's time to send again.\n\nCall it a time sequence data cache.\n\n---\n\nIf that doesn't quite fit the bill, then google \"fountain codes\", and implement your own bit-torrent-like protocol.",

If you are using arrows or lines or pseudo-syntax (that does not compile), it is up to you. The point of pseudocode is to convey the idea of the process/method. I will give an example:\n\n1) if [boy.name](http://boy.name) starts with Ü -> the boy is most likely from Europe. if [boy.name](http://boy.name) starts with Ф -> the boy is most likely from Greek or Russia.\n\nYou can look at it and instantly understand that you are checking the name of a boy and based on how the letter looks like, you are assuming where he is from. Because different countries use different alphabets and different letters. I can claim that what I wrote are two \"if\" sentences. Perhaps part of a \"switch\" statement. But no way what I wrote compiles or runs in any programming language. It is a pseudocode. Understandable to a human but not runnable by a machine.\n\n2)public static String getFamilyName(some person) {\n\nname = getNameFromDatabase(some person)\n\nfamilyName = splitTheName(name)\n\nreturn familyName\n\n}\n\nIt is more code-looking pseudocode. It even uses a little bit Java syntax. But will it compile? No. Will it work like this? No. Will it tell what happens? Absolutely.\n\nYou can see that a method gets some person as an input. Then you retrieve his name from a database. And then you split the name and return the last part of it. The flow is understandable. How you are accessing the database? Not important. Will it work with names like Alfonso Maria de Borbon y Borbon? No. It assumes the person to have only first and last name. But will it give the idea of the process? Definitely.\n\nBy an idea a pseudocode is something that even a non-IT person can read and understand. Free from language-specific and syntax-specific things.\n\nBut why the first option is answer to the question you asked, that got answered by others.",

Once I realized that, writing recursive functions became easier for me.\n\nThat seems obvious now, but the professor who first taught recursion to me didn't hammer that concept into me, probably because he thought it was already intuitive and obvious.  (It wasn't to me.)\n\nAnd writing the rest of the recursive function (the non-base case part) takes a *leap of faith*:  You have to believe that the recursive function you call from inside your function will return what you want.  Once you decide what you want for it to return, you have to work with that output.  And after that, you will have to make sure the internals of your recursive function returns exactly what you want it to return when you called it.  (Sorry is this is very abstract, but recursion is a very abstract concept.)\n\nAnd you may have noticed that reading already-written code is often more difficult to read and understand than writing new code (even if you're the one who wrote the code in the first place!).  This is especially true with recursive code, so when you're calling the function recursively, add comments to explain that you're doing so, preferably with some explanation as to what the recursive call is doing, in contrast to the current call.",

Very easy.\n\nBut how would you do it recursively?\n\nYou could break down the process into two steps\n\n1. If there's only one number, then we return that number. This is the base case, and where the recursion returns\n2. otherwise, we return the first number plus the sum of the remaining subset of numbers\n\nBased on this definition, we can write each of the following inputs as such\n\n* sum(\\[1,2,3,4,5\\]) = 1 + sum(\\[2,3,4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[2,3,4,5\\]) = 2 + sum(\\[3,4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[3,4,5\\]) = 3 + sum(\\[4,5\\])\n* sum(\\[4,5\\]) = 4 + sum(\\[5\\])\n* sum(\\[5\\]) = 5\n\nNow if you look at sum(\\[4,5\\]) and you sub in the value of sum(\\[5\\]) you will see that it is equal to 4 + 5 = 9\n\nAnd then for sum(\\[3,4,5\\]) you can sub in the value of sum(\\[4,5\\]) with 9, which gives 3 + 9 = 12\n\nThe key to solving recursion is to identify how you can repeat the algorithm on a subset of the input so that when you solve a smaller problem, that solution can be used to solve the larger problem.\n\nThe same applies to node-based structures. Every tree has a root and a bunch of children attached to that root. children also has its own sub-tree with the child as the root, and a bunch of children.\n\nSo you can create a recursive algorithm where you pick a root and recurse on the children, until you reach a leaf node which is a tree with no children.",

It's not made easier by the fact that there are very few examples that are both (a) intuitive and (b) more easily done with recursion than iteration. This means you either get examples you don't understand or examples where you don't see the point of recursion.\n\nLet's think about computing the height of a tree. The height of a tree is the longest distance from the root to a leaf node (we'll assume that a tree with just one node is height 1 and a tree that isn't there at all has height 0).\n\nSuppose you want to compute the height of a tree. Imagine I tell you that the height of the left branch is 7 and the height of the right branch is 4 (how? I'm magic. I just know these things). Can you tell me what the height of the whole tree is? If you think about the definition, the longest path to a leaf node is going to involve going either left or right from the root. If you go left (that's one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf *from that point* is 7 (because I told you). If you go right (also one step) then you know that the longest path to a leaf is 4 (again, I told you). So the longest path from the root is `1 + max(7, 4)` which is 8.\n\nThis solution, unfortunately, involves a magic step, where you ask me what the height of the left and right subtrees are and you use those results to determine the height of the overall tree. Wouldn't it be great if you had a function that would tell you the height of a tree so that you could use it to determine the height of another tree?\n\nYou do. It's this function we are talking about. We just change this:\n\n    func height(tree)\n      return 1 + max(ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.left),\n                     ask_lurgi_for_the_height(tree.right))\n\nto\n\n    func height(tree)\n      return 1 + max(height(tree.left),\n                     height(tree.right))\n\n\nThere is one thing missing from this, which every recursive function needs: a way to stop. There has to be some state (we call it the \"base case\") that you can work out immediately, without doing any other steps. This should be the smallest possible example. How about the empty tree? Not a tree with just one node, but a tree has no nodes at all. We'll say it has height 0.\n\n    func height(tree)\n      if empty(tree) return 0\n      return 1 + max(height(tree.left),\n                     height(tree.right))",

Why your IDE wouldn't do this for you if it's managing the build (and you used the GUI to create the file) I don't know.\n\nTo use things from one C++ source file in another, you generally need to lift the definitions into a header file (.h) and #include it in other files.\n\nIf you actually want two \"programs\" you'll need to look into CMake more. You could start by reading through the config you already have and googling. There's also a good guide on the CMake site.\n\nThat's about as helpful as I can be given the post. Hope it helps.",

        "body": "> from being paged at 3AM to chasing tight deadlines to preparing for weekly ops review in front of all the members of the orgs\n\nI've actually had all of those, for about 8 years:\n\n1. I was part of a tier-1 on-call rotation at my org. The money was amazing (I made ~55k a year from just the overtime oncall bonus). I do get paged about 2-3 a week when I was oncall, but we had a good playbook and heavily automated the triage to get rid of false positives. The frequency of 3am pages was just about zero to once a year per oncall, with 95% of pages coming in during work hours. That said, we were very disciplined about our oncall debt (proactively worked on making it as actionable as possible), so that was a major reason I never really minded it. (Fun fact, I actually helped promote one of our L3s by staffing them on reducing our org-wide oncall flakiness problem)\n\n2. Chasing tight deadlines - this is a function of how good your immediate upline leadership is. The more you feel like you're always on the offensive trying to hit arbitrary deadlines, the more that it's a sign of unstable leadership. Unfortunately, at a big tech company, you usually don't have too much direct control over this. I would sit in every planning/ops review and push back on unrealistic timelines, but if your L9 just sets a timeline (either you guys hit IO or we're not funding the product), well, then you only have two kind of shitty options. I've been fortunate to have had good sponsors/uplines for most of my career, who took me at my word when I tell them - no, it cannot be done, but we can descope or find a different launch target. The reason I eventually left was because we got a new VP who didn't listen to any of their area leads telling them that their timelines weren't reasonable. So, to answer your question, I probably handled it poorly by just bouncing when the going got tough :)\n\n3. Preparing for the weekly ops reviews - this is a cultural problem in big tech. We LOVE ops/steering/product/eng/design/anything reviews. Now, as aspiring TLs will likely know, there's a \"good\" reason for them - visibility with L+2s/L+3s who can vouch for you on your promo statement. The cost are these random blocks of time where you need to get together with a big or small group of people you don't really often work with for vague / unnecessary reasons (to shoehorn in collaboration when none really exists) but where you all know you sort of have to be there to play the game. The good news is that once you have a good TPM/PgM, they generally care a LOT more about these meetings being highly polished than you will, so they'll usually do the heavy lifting work of writing the slide templates, filling them out week over week, and setting the agenda. The bad news is that once you have dedicated TPM/PgMs, then at least 20% of your week will be taken up by these different types of reviews where you're either getting or giving visibility to/of someone else to help advance your/their career. \n\nHow do I cope with this? I just play the game. At the end of the day, a career in big tech is really just figuring out that you're playing the game. 9/10 times, you're going to be in a team who pays a lot of lip service about meritocracy but will continue to operate like any other big complex organization - there will always be an in-group, the favorites of the org leads who get tapped with better opportunities and are set up with faster career advancement. If you want to advance, you will unfortunately have to play that game.\n\nThat said, one thing I was very passionate about was ensuring that none of the people around me had to be exposed to too much shit, so growing my team from 4-20 people while still being able to remain an IC was actually rewarding enough for me to still feel pretty happy for most of those 8 years.\n\nIt's also a double edged sword. They paid me well enough that I make more passively than at the job, so when I got annoyed by our new leadership direction, the constant churns, the vague threats of being given less work but at the same pay (that's legitimately how they threaten you, I never understood this psychology), and just the general lack of direction under the new leadership direction, I just bounced.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention. The thing that was most stressful for me are all of the ducking red tapes to launch even the smallest bug fixes. I still have anxiety nightmares about having to beg for a launchcal bit for a prelaunch review.",

I don’t like talking to people outside of work and family, and the amount of bootlicking and fake enthusiasm you’re expected to show just to impress corporate types and land a job feels insane.\n\nMost of the cracked engineers I’ve worked with or know don’t do any of that. They’re loyal at their jobs, keep their heads down, and just want to do deep, meaningful technical work. On the flip side, a lot of the fake people I’ve seen spend more time crafting LinkedIn posts than actually improving their skills or doing real engineering work, and they all seem to have some hidden agenda.\n\nI literally saw a dude interview for big tech just so he could create content and attract more juniors to pay for his coaching side hustle.

It may be easier to do a master's and apply for internships again, but I can't make that call for you.",

Passion makes the job a lot easier - doing what you love, and all - but professionalism, doing the job you were hired to do well, is what really counts. I will say, though, if you’re dragging yourself into work in the morning, you should really question whether this is the right job for you, and I’d be concerned for you if you were doing this at the expense of your mental health.\n\nMore generally, you’ll find that a lot of people in the industry are like this. They don’t hate their job, find it challenging enough, but it is isn’t their undying passion.

Do not view this guy as your friend, he is not that at all.\n\n>they both seemed genuinely sad but idk I expected my manager to say more knowing he knew but he was just tucked away quiet.\n\nHe threw you under the bus lol. He is acting guilty because he knows he is in the wrong.\n\n>Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back.\n\nIf they ever call you to work for them again, make sure you just join as a contractor as a side gig and upcharge them way more than what you were paid before. They view you as a number and disposable and don't ever think otherwise.",

I'd only focus on roles that are in your old tech stack, that are in office, and require 0-3 years of experience.\n\nI'd also highly recommend the OMSCS at Georgia tech. It costs 8k and has a great course catalog. It'll give you a hard reset and gives you an opportunity to apply to internships alongside applying to full-time roles. \n\nAs for your resume, you need to look at Jake's resume, it's a standardized template. Have gemini distill your experience and format it to fit in Jake's resume. I feel like gemini has the best creative and visual model so it'd be the best for this use case. There are other standardized resume templates, I'm not positive Jake's resume is still the most recommended so do your research. I remember his resume template being referenced all the time a few years ago.\n\nUse a mock interview platform to find where your weaknesses are (idk what they are, I think pramp is one?). Pay for it and utilize it as much as necessary. \n\nOnce you fine-tune your ability to conduct interviews, grind leetcode for 3-4 months, 30 to 60 mins a day with one day off a week. Use neetcode.io. No excuses. Stretch it to 6 months if you want to target highly paid roles at tech companies. \n\nTake whatever salary you can get, even if it's 60k it doesn't matter. You need to get back into the market, rebuild your marketability. After a year or two you can focus on more desirable roles. \n\nSeriously you can do this, I don't care how bad the market is 2.5 years is unacceptable. You're unfocused and undisciplined. No offense. Be hungry and tenacious. \n\nGood luck man, I believe in you.",

Around 2023, the job market was still pretty demanding to fill software engineering roles. You really need do everything in your power to stand out nowadays. I’m sure you’re applying to jobs frequently like many others and I’m sorry to take the tough love approach, but you need to try harder.\n\nSome advice I can share however is looking for production support(L2 or L3) roles. These roles have a lower barrier of entry and you work adjacent to software engineers to resolve production issues. Not the most exciting job, but can lead to something better with time by having some dialogue with managers about your skillset if openings become available internally.\n\nAlso as some others have said, your resume could definitely use some refactoring. Best of luck!",

Unrelated BS.\n* After a handful of general applications that didn't produce even a \"no,\" she hyper-focused on job postings involving GIS experience as either a \"must\" or \"nice\" to have. She had this experience first from a previous career as a wildlife tech and more recently has 3yoe doing something similar as a SWE in her current soon-to-end job.\n* The pay in her new job is by no means silicon valley, but she's very much interested in quality of life and stability vs the brass ring. She wants the Lenovo and not the Macbook, so to speak.\n* She will be building flood prediction and mitigation software for a huge civil engineering company.

Unfortunately those boom days are gone, but it is still not impossible.\n\nMy first recommendation is find a dev sweatshop and see if you can break in this way. You’ll get bent on the hours and make about the minimum wages, but it may open some doors for you.\n\nI also got a friend who is (hopefully) still in process of breaking in last year from working as a dev in startup, also making minimum wage in a vhcol area. His work experience was also horrid with years of wastes, but he made some very interesting projects that I believe impressed the startup folks to giving him a shot.\n\nNo sugarcoating but it is a lot of hard work, grit, and luck. Be willing to do anything and move anywhere, even at a minimum wage.. personally I had gave it all a go with a hard one year deadline of make it or try something else.\n\nGood luck",

What you need is visible proof you can ship, like a real app or something, so that website idea could be cool, if you actually do it.  \n  \nI think realistically your best options are SWE-adjacent roles (QA automation, DevOps junior roles, support/production engineering, data analysis with SQL and dashboards), government or university tech jobs, or small freelance or contract work.   \n  \nAs for the gap, don't hide it, just acknowledge it, explain it without drama, and then immediately talk about recent work that proves you can actually be taken seriously and be trusted, not someone literally did nothing for years.  \n  \nI know I'm being kind of mean, but I really do think you got this IF you start today and work seriously for a year.

You're not the only one with no replies, even if you are senior level.\n\nThird: Isn't engineering what you love? Are you as good and passionate about anything else than this? If your financial situation isn't super tight, you should really pour your heart and soul into your next startup, whether it's something you've tried before or something brand new. It might take months, maybe years, but if this is what you want to do, you have to approach it as something you love and not something you're nervous it will fail. If your financial situation is tight, then you make ends meet with jobs perhaps unrelated to software, but you keep working on a product you have in mind on the side. If coding, programming and software development is what makes you happy, you should do it regardless of income potential.\n\nYou seem confused about one important thing: you meld successful career/income with engineering. I think you should shift your mindset - if development is truly what you enjoy, do it regardless of success and income. Nowadays, those who succeed as engineers are both talented and lucky. So the most important thing to do is to continue developing software while networking, applying for jobs and/or trying a new startup. I know the latter might not seem very appealing to you, but it's the only way to sustain income while continuing to do what you love.",

Depending on the amount of travel and personal factors (spouse?, kids?, ..etc.) maybe that is a dealbreaker but I couldn’t weigh in on that.  \n\nIf taking that position is attractive and wouldn’t hurt your home life then why not take it?  It shows growth at your current company which can set you apart from others.  Basically you getting “promoted” at your current job is a better indicator than you getting that same position elsewhere. \n\nIn a few years you can hit the job market at a higher level when things are a bit better is what I am thinking.\n\nEDIT: I don’t know your qualifications but I am at a little under 20YoE IC on the software side.  I haven’t been able to get a callback unless it was from a direct referral and I am currently employed. \n\nIf your network is strong then you might not have much trouble but cold applying right now is pretty bleak.",

It's an absolutely awful market, and there are people more skilled than you or farther ahead of you applying for the same roles as you, and forming part of the N hundred other applications for each listing you see. How are you going to prove yourself better than them? How are you going to convince hiring managers to move forward with you, and not them?\n\nIf a while passes after you graduate and you've still got nothing in hand, I'd seriously consider going to grad school, but for a non-CS field. Some fields others here have mentioned include nursing, teaching, business (MBA), law, medicine, or some form of engineering. Some of these are harder than CS, but offer stronger career outlooks and better job security. The trades could be yet another option, but know that a lot of their hype is even more inflated than that of CS, and they're genuinely not for everyone.\n\nDon't wait around hoping for the economy to improve, either, because it genuinely might never. Did the automobile jobs ever come back to Detroit? Did factory workers ever get their jobs back? Exactly. And don't expect AI to \"create new tech jobs\" either, they're not going to be junior jobs.\n\nI'm sorry, I know I'm sounding pretty negative right now, but I don't want to give anyone a false sense of hope or security. It really is that bad, and we're all in the same boat. Just prepare for a rough next couple of years.",

Basically I'm just the best SWE in a sea of mediocre or poor SWEs that would never get a job at an actual tech company.\n\nSo while you can say I have lots of experience and even leading teams of 20 SWEs on projects it's just not the same as somebody who has worked at multiple big tech companies over the years.  I still apply to all those big tech companies hoping to get a chance, but deep down I know I won't get an offer and just do the interviews I get for shits and giggles.\n\nFrankly I would take a new grad role at a big tech company if I could, but they won't down-level you that far.  The recruiters always want me to interview for Senior or Staff level and I'm just not going to be at that level. I'm probably mid-level SWE at a top tech company at best.\n\nI'm just not top tech company smart at the end of the day.  It probably doesn't help that I worked on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for all those years.  So my experience lies in C and C++ roles and I look for jobs working on physical products over web stuff.\n\nAlso as a side note, having your name on patents sounds cool, but nobody gives a shit about them at the end of the day, lol.",

When it comes to Front End work items on our board in DevOps, I am usually the one that gets handed these types of tickets since front end work is pretty much straightforward and self explanatory. \n\n“Self-sufficient, don’t need handholding” — I’ve noticed probably within the past 4 months that for this portion I am starting to be more self sufficient, but occasionally I do need support or guidance getting through the work item. For instance, I had to edit a table (database migration for C#) on one of our database tables for an application that we are in the midst of building and kind of got lost. I had to nudge one of our lead developers for some assistance, but I still occasionally do need help with more difficult problems that I sometimes run into. \n\n“Can own features end-to-end” — for this specific point, this is NOT true with me. If you really do own features end to end I expect these to be more front end feature work items, but not back end stuff. I struggle with back end work items immensely. Correct me if I am wrong please!!!\n\n“Collaborate with other teams on system design and write ADRs” — At my company, we really don’t have “ADRs”. Sure we understand the things we work on, but my company is so small that having things like this does not really benefit us. For bigger companies I could definitely see the benefit of this. My coworker who has been doing Software Engineering for 15 years wrote up the architecture design documents and database schema for a new application we are releasing soon about 6 months ago. He knew EXACTLY how to get it done, how long it would take, and how hard it would be. That’s something I totally expect from someone with that much experience. \n\nIt also depends heavily on the work place you are at. Especially what you work on, how difficult it is, and if you are learning new things. \n\nI would say that from what you said in your post and comparing where I am at, we are probably in a similar spot. Now I don’t know how much you make, but I expect the next job you get (hopefully for me too) you will make substantially more. \n\nWhat I would work on for improving your knowledge is maybe look at more back end specific problems. I am currently working on a full stack application that calls a local database and uses REST to grab information from said database. I had a coworker who moved on to bigger and better things that told me back end development is where the big money is at. If you can understand that more, you will do great!",

It’s just a great experience imo.\n\nThere’s no guarantee that you’ll learn anything new at a different job or be given any autonomy to work on fun stuff that actually interests you. \n\nNot saying don’t do it but I’d really think about it. I went from being at home 3-5 days a week to being in the office 3 days a week.\n\nIt is miserable when you barely have anything to do because there isn’t enough work in the pipeline but it could be worse and end up being a ton of work with no chance to breathe.

I'd like to get back soon though. \n\nThis all depends on your circumstances, if you have friends and family to fall back on, you don't mind selling your home or moving, whether you have a family of your own that depends on you etc. \n\nWhen I was laid off a few years back I went into panic mode and landed plenty of interviews, I knew one manager who could tell I was a bit stressed. He interviewed me and offered me a position with no questions asked. I worked at that job for six months and learned it really wasn't for me and we parted ways. \n\nI took a step back and realized I had plenty of money in savings and also realized I didn't really want to work at that moment. I don't recommend just taking any job out of desperation if you can avoid it. I'm using my time off to relax, reflect, and become an even better developer.\n\nI feel for people with families and quality of life that needs to be maintained, I feel for people who go through this with a mortgage or health issues (I personally had to get on Medicaid when I lost my insurance). In those cases take whatever is on the table until something better comes along. I had interviews lined up within weeks when I was in panic mode. Now that I'm calm I can pick and choose roles that interest me. \n\nJust one thing to mention though about mental health, software development is a rapidly changing, confusing, and mentally taxing field. Going through a layoff in this field takes a toll on everyone, doesn't matter who you are. Try to stay positive and realize it's not your fault, you're just modernizing. You're not useless or undervalued, and you don't lack skill. You will make a comeback in this field. Take the high salary they'll give you in your next position and make sure to save enough for the inevitable rainy day, do this until you're six feet under or computers cease to exist.",

My coworker got hired after having an incredibly embellished resume and overselling every single one of his skills. It made him seem like he was the most qualified candidate even though he probably wasn't and he got the job. Now, 2 years later, he's still doing great at the company. I understand wanting to be completely candid, but unfortunately, interviewers aren't looking for transparency, they are looking for the most qualified and competent candidate.

Eventually, you're gonna need to interview, and a lot of the good jobs out there will have this as part of their interview steps. Might as well start learning.   \nIn addition to it preparing you for interviews, I have the maybe unpopular opinion that studying these things can make you a better developer. It builds muscle memory in your language of choice, and forces you to think about solving problems in certain ways.",

The system isn't about working harder. It's about **making the invisible workload visible** so you can manage it without burning out. It turns ambition into a sustainable action plan.

They're also the ones who can keep your name around for future consideration if you don't get hired, which _you very much want_. Most people I knew at Google failed their first hiring attempt but were contacted again later because their names were on file and passed later rounds.\n\n\nNot all of them are great.

For implementation rounds, practice writing clean, testable code quickly; it personally helped me to time myelf while coding to sort of simulate what I'd encounter during interviews. I also recommend checking out [company-specific interview guides](https://www.interviewquery.com/companies), since some companies focus more on certain rounds like system design while others are more holistic with how they review your performance.

Code is an orchestrator and software are tools that automate or pave some new process to enable business. The end goal is not maintainability, it's money.
