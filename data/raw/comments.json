So now I get to download parquet files every 5 minutes for hundreds of tables and ingest all this crap into a local database. More time/energy investment for me and my company. They probably spent tens or hundreds of thousands implementing that solution on their side. They won’t make up the difference for years vs what we and some other clients pay them, and have only added huge technical debt for themselves and us in the process of just removing a direct access data source (that’s easy to maintain). 🙄🙄🙄",

Since you mentioned acquisition lean on the people you're bringing in to get you up to speed and make sure you understand cost, moving anything to the cloud is not cheap.\n\n3. I would only learn enough snowflake to a) understand what exists, and b) understand where your existing platform may be plugged in. Again lean on the resources you've acquired.\n\n4. For CI/CD it's important, but learn whatever they're already using. It's probably not worth the effort to learn a bunch of systems and it's almost never worth the effort to move things, so you'll end up using what they've built anyways.\n\nThat should set you up for coming up with a plan for migration if any. I would say be cautious on any move to cloud. You've likely invested in on-prem hardware already, and cloud isn't cheap. Make sure there's a real business gain before investing in a big move, and don't discount hybrid approaches.",

Pick what you need to build and create your own version for your company to set a vision. Get business to buy into it.\n\n2. Refer to this [GitLab Enterprise Data Platform Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/). It is quite comprehensive and well maintained. It will provide the general direction, some ideas that you can adopt.\n\n3. Skip certifications and learn AWS basics based on what you decide to implement above. Deep dive on services that you think you will need to adopt.\n\n4. Attend tech / data meetups, network with speakers, other leaders in the data landscape and pick their brains. Discuss challenges.

Define a project.yaml with per-env connections and schema maps; make prod read-only by default and require a change ticket to unlock writes. Generate migrations via Flyway or Liquibase and block ad‑hoc DDL outside “migration mode”; run dry‑runs in SIT and produce plan diffs. Normalize dialects with SQLGlot, auto-inject LIMIT/time windows, cap bytes scanned, and fingerprint each query tied to commit and user. Add pre-commit SQLFluff and a small suite of canary queries; CI should run EXPLAINs and sample-result checks before merge. Keep a dataset catalog that maps queries to dataset IDs and auto-writes lightweight docs next to the SQL; emit OpenLineage or DataHub events so ops can trace breakage. I’ve used DataGrip for editing and dbt for transformations, with DreamFactory to auto-generate REST endpoints over SQL Server and Mongo so downstream tools hit curated views. Nail env profiles, guardrails, and lineage/CI first; the rest can layer on.",

If you constantly put in bad gasoline and never change the oil, the car will still run for a while but over time, performance drops, parts wear out, and things start to break. In the same way, if your AI models are trained on low-quality, inconsistent, or noisy data, it will limit how accurate and reliable their outputs can be, no matter how much tuning you do under the hood.\n\nBut if you treat your car well use clean, high-quality data, keep things consistent, and regularly monitor and maintain your pipelines it will run smoother, perform better, and be far less likely to produce bad or unpredictable results. data engineering doesn’t magically solve everything, but it can massively improve what your AI capabilities",

The work becomes more about shaping the contract between producers and consumers and less about just moving data from A to B. That shift feels pretty fundamental.\n\nThe biggest change on my side is tighter collaboration cycles. DE gets pulled in earlier when a new product idea forms since everyone knows messy upstream data will kill the project later. Ownership has improved a bit too, mostly because teams finally realized they can’t bolt governance on at the end.\n\nIt still varies a lot by company, but the places that treat DE as a core layer tend to move faster and spend less time firefighting.

No lineage, no visibility.\n\nCredit-card example: central team gave a DS team access to sensitive data *only* for fraud modeling. They built a derived table, and because there were no permission controls, that table suddenly became visible to everyone in the company. No one caught it for weeks.\n\nCompany 3 (Large mobile-gaming company): Strong central platform team + distributed product analysts.\n\nResult: Honestly the smoothest setup I’ve seen. Even less technical analysts shipped fast because the platform team handled the heavy lifting.\n\nCompany 4 (Small gaming studio): 1–2 engineers built the whole thing on Prefect + dbt and enforced strict rules manually.\n\nResult: Super slow, pipelines broke constantly, everything was fragile.\n\nCompany 5 (Neo-bank): Huge data team, started doing full Data Mesh during COVID. Each domain ran its own infra and pipelines.\n\nResult: Now they’re trying to re-centralize everything, and it’s incredibly painful. Every domain has different tools, different workflows, different security assumptions. They literally said they wish they had standardized the platform from day one.\n\nSo yeah, from everything I’ve seen:\n\nHaving a strong central platform/governance team that sets the standards and provides the tooling, and then letting domains build data products on top of that, is the only setup that doesn’t blow up over time.",

They had mainly an old school on-premise solution which was built of multiple siloed data warehouses and depended on tribal knowledge to keep it running. I believe there was one super complicated ETL pipeline that would fail, and they only knew to restart it, until it finally ran. No one bothered to debug why it failed. A combination of older technology, and not managing tech debt because all stable data solutions wander into cost-centre territory where they only care about costs management. Anyway, onto your challenge -\n\nMultiple siloed analytics systems, some on-prem, some on private cloud, mish-mash of Azure/Microsoft based solutions and generally no one had a standard approach to data.\n\nSo we architected a whole new data-mesh(-istic) approach. Hub-and-Spoke architecture built off Databricks for the Hub, bring what you want for the Spoke. Hub is your managed and governed central data lake. Spokes correspond to different domains of the business (Finance, HR, Customer Experience, Investment and so on.).\n\nMore lower done, we maintain Landing, Bronze, Silver, Silver Plus (meant to hold curated/canonical model, still WIP), with the respective domain spokes having the Gold Layers.\n\nOur core idea was the data platform should be a genuine platform. Not just something to build analytics on. So now we can progress to building AI based applications, ontologies and so on without the restrictive mindset of a data platform being only to build data warehouses.\n\nFor us Databricks has worked like a dream, and barring reporting (Power BI), we haven't considered needing to use it for anything else. Unity Catalog especially from this year, has been a knock-out for the use cases we have. And we still have more to implement - governed tags, data masking and so on.\n\nI would say it has been a success and the struggle is to keep innovating on it, than marking it as done and stable and letting tech debt accumulate over the years till someone else comes in and says let's make a new data platform but do it right this time. :-D",

Mixed experiences. \n\nThe bad:\n- There is at times a large desync when reading and writing to lakehouses and warehouses. PySpark operation will complete and show transformations applied within a session only for the data to not match at the endpoint for... A while. No hard numbers on this but seen others talking about it. Bottlenecks development and is really frustrating. \n\n- The low code solutions are terribly inefficient. My first time testing a basic Dataflow Gen2 operation ran for way too long and had a ridiculously large CU consumption, so if you want to handle ETL processes better get dug into Spark notebooks (I've been using PySpark which is considerably faster and more performant than the Dataflow seemed, not sure how other Spark modules behave) \n\n- Speaking of CU consumption, interrogation of compute is so... Opaque. Want to see how much CU your new code block uses? You're out of luck if you've ran it multiple times for debugging and testing - there's no way to get a granular report on costing. The documentation here isn't much better. \n\n- Managing a traditional Dev -> Prod pipeline feels harder than necessary. Currently I'm running a NonProd/Prod architecture where end users only have access to a workspace with models loaded into a warehouse because as far as I can tell there is no object level security available within a workspace. There's also no way that I've found to directly write across workspaces, so I'm shortcutting my endpoint data in the NonProd workspace to a lakehouse is the Prod workspace, then using cross warehouse T-SQL to create views for the end users.\n\nThe good:\n- For an organisation with a large investment in PowerBI with multiple workspaces and satellite teams within the business, I can see how Fabric might be a good solution that slots in nicely. In it's current state I'm not sure that it pulls ahead of any other architecture solutions. \n\n- It's an interesting playground for less technical users to 'get their hands dirty'; I see the appeal. As mentioned before however, I discounted the low code options pretty quickly so it remains to be seen how this will progress. \n\n- There is native CoPilot integration in Fabric (when set up with the right licence option in workspaces). I haven't tested this out yet but I imagine this will be useful for people in the business to ask questions and interrogate data without requiring models to be built or a knowledge of SQL or PowerBI development. \n\nOverall it's not terrible and if you're already paying for a fabric capacity you're not incurring additional costs if your capacity has headroom. For users with a less technical background I'm not sure if the juice would be worth the squeeze as every end user I've spoken to has gravitated to Dataflows for ETL work as it's familiar to them (it works like an online PowerQuery interface). \n\nMy background is in analytics and I have less experience with data engineering so my observations should be taken with a grain of salt.",

Although it sounds like youre just storing config values in a table to be used when calling the api, which is pretty standard for pipelines in general. If youre using aws, you can store metadata into something like ssm, but if you're operating in a datalake (and it's not sensitive), you want everything consolidated.

That way, we know right from the ingestion layer if the schema is breaking the contract and we can work to remediate. Then, the pipeline can always assume that schema is enforced and we don't need to worry about missing or unexpected data.\n\nIf it's some sort of public API that can change at any point, then the approach would probably be a bit different. Just throwing something out there this isn't necessarily how I'd do it, but perhaps store as just raw JSON, then parse out the data we actually need from it, and store that in a known schema (i.e. a bronze layer feeding into a silver layer). Of course, all of this will depend on *how* the API changes, so the real answer is that it has to be handled case-by-case (e.g. if a field is added or removed, but we don't use that field anyway, then we do nothing because it doesn't matter, but if we do use it, then we need to figure out what to do in the particular scenario).\n\n3 is again sorta dependent on the use-case. If I have access to the full source dataset and it's only a few thousand records, I wouldn't bother with incrementally loading data. I *might* do something like tracking which rows are new/updated if that's relevant to downstreams in the pipeline, but again, depends on the use case.\n\nFor 4, I generally prefer loading into a bronze layer (if that's what you mean by \"staging tables\"). If it's easy to keep the source data, I don't really see a reason not to do so and to keep it close to the rest of the data (i.e. in the same warehouse). But there are of course cases when this is not desired (for example, if the source data is enormous and is mostly thrown away anyway, then I wouldn't want to waste the cost to store it).\n\nFor 5\\*, I'm not sure what you mean by a \"metadata driven pipeline\". Do you mean using things like Iceberg or Delta Lake for CDC?",

You can't remove old columns from the schema since there is old data likely using them.\n\n3) Full load if possible. My main reasons are that it's quick and if your source deletes rows without a method for getting which rows are deleted, an incremental update won't pick them up. This is very much dependent on a number of factors, so quite often a full load isn't the best option.\n\n4) If you have a need for a staging table, use it. If not, don't complicate things because it fits the design pattern you saw on a YouTube video.\n\n5) First time I've heard of this, but I read your explanation in a different comment. If you can use that pattern, go right ahead, I'm all for code deduplication. I think for a lot of people though, and certainly me, it would be far more trouble than it's worth. I work with about a dozen products from various vendors each with their own API auth methods, pagination rules, and return schemas. To try and cram all that into a generic pipeline would be a nightmare of if statements and rule exceptions. It just wouldn't work in my case. Dedicated pipelines are isolated so I know I can change one without it affecting anything else. I can see a generic pipeline having to be tested against everything it calls whenever a change is made to any one of them.\n\nIf you have a setup where most pipelines use a similar setup, then yeah I can see it being useful, that's not my environment.",

After ingesting data from API and assuming flattening to tabular\n\nI think these concepts are all related. With JSON, you can just insert the JSON payload into a JSONB field with whatever fields happen to be in the JSON payload. So flattening wouldn't be necessary. And since flattening isn't necessary, you don't have to worry about whether fields are included, deleted, omitted, etc. from one payload to the next. Just query it using SQL with the JSON features that the database provides.\n\nQuerying raw JSON using SQL is still relatively new. Some databases (e.g. postgres) are excellent at it. But even the ones that are not yet, they will likely only get better. Demand for these features will only grow with time imo.",

For example, you present your data in proper form to facilitate analytics, you have your date-based data presented vertically, so your months go top to bottom ascending. There are some who have cognitive barriers that prevent them from comprehending those outputs... unless the dates are present horizontally left to right.\n\nSo there are a myriad of reasons why users wish to export and do their own thing. This applies ro tech and non-tech people alike. It does require  a certain trained skill to read reports, and everyone is different in their cognitive design and abilities, all you can do is find that balance that caters for all abilities and levels.\n\nDon't be disheartened - in this industry, it's totally the norm, just try to find a way to buiild a comprehensive solution that caters for these different types of needs.\n\nGood luck!",

Even if you don’t directly use these tools, familiarity with them would help you understand how Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery and other data warehouses/lakehouses work under the hood. Could be good for someone who wants to become a dev for a data solution or company like that\n\nAs far as ML and AI, I think this would just be relevant from an operations perspective — eg how hard/expensive would it be to train or infer from a massive amount of data? What are the systems behavior and considerations involved? I don’t think it’s the most relevant topic for advancing an ML/AI career. I would think you’d be better off focusing on how to get quality data for models, which models to use for which scenarios, and in the case of agentic AI the big learning area might be systems integration via things like MCP and how to evaluate for sufficient performance/improvements, plus security. I wouldn’t necessarily expect there to be courses really relating to agentic AI since it’s still so new",

As part of the batch process, an environment variable representing the job number can be accessed via int(os.environ\\['AWS\\_BATCH\\_JOB\\_ARRAY\\_INDEX'\\]). Use this and your mapping from step 2 to get the list of files this job should process.\n5.

The aim is to stop people editing 'data storage' spreadsheets directly (each form should also be an easy thing to set up).\n\nSo what have we achieved?\n\n- added some level of control over data entry\n- introduced BigQuery, allowing you to start defining transformations in SQL (e.g. Views, Scheduled Queries), and setting up the foundation for the future\n- decoupled data analysis from data storage. Data analysis with spreadsheets reading well-managed data from BigQuery is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight pattern\n- prepared everyone for a future where you have data entry methods write directly to BigQuery, without spooking the horses\n- oh, and for free your data is ready to analyse out of the box with 'Looker Studio' (free, not to be confused with Looker 'proper'), allowing you to set up reasonably nice dashboards",

Apps Script sidebars + validation absolutely work, and it’s a common way to modernize workflows before moving to something like BigQuery later.\n\nThe main thing to watch out for is long-term maintenance. Once the logic grows (sidebars, menus, validations, logs, error handling), you become the only person who can support the Scripts. That can be tough when you’re the lone “tech” person. Since you’re on Google Workspace, i suggest to look into Zenphi as an alternative to Apps Script. It covers pretty much everything people usually build in Apps Script—supplier/product workflows, validations, approvals, logging—but without writing code, which makes the system easier for others to understand and maintain.",

Good support here would mean we don’t have to use spark for everything, tons of enterprises would adopt it, and it would disrupt the big players compute oriented business models. But instead they lean into their proprietary storage formats. It’s their project, so work on what you like, but most development just seems aimed at making MotherDuck profitable.",

After completing it, you'll have a solid foundation in data engineering, but there's always more to learn, of course.\n\nOne downside is that they used AI voices for most of the videos, and when they do have real people in the videos, you can tell that most of them are reading from a script. Another thing is that it focuses on IBM's offerings in the data engineering space, when offerings from other companies are much more popular in the job market. It is an IBM cert, though. Why wouldn't they teach you IBM stuff? Fortunately, they made a lot of the IBM-specific parts of the courses optional.\n\nIf you can get past the negatives, it's a pretty solid starting point for getting into data engineering.",

Data volume is not a problem here, listing the files - it’s the biggest issue. \nUnfortunately with Glue there is not so much you can do, but next things might help a little:\n1. If possible remove asterix, so you can use recursive lookup and listing won’t take place on driver. Do ‘s3://../parsed-data/us/‘ instead and  .option(recursiveFileLookup\", \"true\")\n2. Increase number of workers\n3. Tune up a config a little bit for working with small files\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes\", 64 * 1024 * 1024) \nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes\",   4 * 1024 * 1024)  \n4. Use repartition instead of coalesce, because your bottleneck is read, not write. \n\n\nBut really, that’s not Spark use case, there is nothing “analytical” about this kind of processing. So the only valid approach - stop producing tons of little files or switch to another technology. You just wasting lot of money by trying to use not suitable technology for a quite trivial job. \nDatabricks have ‘cloudFiles’ functionality to handle such things and it works perfectly, but unfortunately there is nothing similar to it in pure Spark or Glue.",

I’m a data engineer and I can tell you from my experience that I’m just a software engineer specialized in data. I develop/deploy REST APIs in kubernetes. I manage infrastructure and resources in Terraform like databases, service principals, storage containers, etc. I manage alerting and monitoring of services and pipelines with Datadog and ServiceNow. I work cross-cloud in Azure and GCP managing data pipelines in Databricks or Airflow. I build consumers/producers with Kafka. I work in Python mainly but occasionally run into Java. My role has always been this way for the last 5 years. As a tech lead I also do some product work like epic breakdowns, quarterly planning, sprint planning for my team. I also manage a team of 6 devs and do performance reviews etc. My job isn’t stressful because I push back if a request isn’t reasonable, and if the PM insists on making my team pivot then I insist on dropping an epic to make room for the new work. The only thing that ever gets stressful to me sometimes is dealing with people who either don’t do their job or do their job very badly, and I end up compensating. Otherwise I love being a data engineer!",

Roles of DE’s vary quite a bit so it’s going to depend on the position you switch to… \n\nWith that being said, in DE you don’t have to worry about the 1,000 ways an end user can misuse and crash your site, or covering every edge case for security vulnerabilities… you probably won’t need to learn 5+ languages and frameworks for one project. These are things I didn’t consider stress wise when making the switch to ‘SWE’, however I enjoy the struggle of this. \n\nWith DE you’re extracting data, transforming and loading it into a space where DA’s and DS can easily retrieve accurate data. The way I think about it is the DB serves as your UI and this simplifies worrying about security and misuse. Not to say these concerns don’t exist, but I don’t feel like they’re as complex to resolve. The real complexity/stress comes in taking disparate data from various systems in various formats, that’s available in disjunct timeframes and making it fit into a cohesive/canonical model that represents how the business/analysts thinks about operations. Applying and understanding business rules can be very difficult/stressful. \n\nInherently I don’t think one or the other is less stressful, it depends on the job and your interests… good luck :)",

Deadlines are everywhere.  Hard-to-diagnose problems are probably everywhere, too, especially when you inherit things.  Sometimes specific tools are worse for it (I've heard comments in this regard about Spark, for example).\n\n\n\nI've done this transition, albeit kind of unconsciously.  It's been good.  Having software background is definitely valuable, I think.  It probably depends some on your stack, but I also think there is *a lot* of crossover.  Especially if you consider that often it's the soft-skills that count, too.\n\n\n\nI started in general development, primarily working on an internal web-based system using .NET Core.  That job started having more and more \"reporting\" work, using the same backend database, but SSRS was the frontend instead.  From there, into an analyst type role, which rapidly became a catch-all ETL-developer-report-builder-platform-admin role.  Last few years it has become more about \"engineering\", admin, and architecture.  I'm very much enjoying it.\n\n  \nEarly on, I did miss working in code that wasn't primarily SQL (and especially wasn't DAX), and the ways in which we did it - like devops processes and dev tools.  I've seen that shift where I am now, partly because team, partly because tool set with us jumping into Databricks.  The inner software dev has much more cause to come back to the surface.  I've been in a position to bring devops practices in.  I'm thinking again about things like encapsulation and DRY.  I was not the whizz-bang top-dog developer, but I picked up some good fundamentals and experience.  It's helpful as a data-focused engineer.\n\n  \nIs DE a good fit for you?  Probably if you have an analytical mind, enjoy the problem-solving, and sometimes having to help discover what that problem really is.  I would also say that it's all just input-to-output.",

For example we recently had it include a shuffle step to rebalance files, but we were rewriting 50TB of data and it just flooded the spill space and crashed.\n\nThe old 200 default is almost never a good number. It ends up spending more time finalising tasks and spinning up new ones than it does actually processing things (may be slight exaggeration). The ideal number on a fixed-worker-count cluster is 2x the number of cores on the workers, and then higher multiples of that if you have significantly skewed data in large amounts.\n\nEven with AQE you might be able to guide it to a better plan by lining up data nicely for it. But I wouldn't necessarily worry about it until something is taking longer than it seems it should and is taking long enough that it is worth optimising.\n\nThere are other approaches that can help as well. Saving intermediate results somewhere so that it can be reused without relying on cache memory being available as well as truncating the query plan. You can also focus on dropping the descriptive data and just moving keys and filter-by columns for all the major join work, create a unique composite key for each row, then send that back to the original descriptive data then re-join everything on the new unique row key. That minimises shuffles if you have multiple different keys to join on, because you're only reshuffling the keys, and you shuffle all the extra data just once.",

I use duckdb’s read_blob with hive partitioning against s3 to load blob assets without needing a database for metadata. Only problem is that the read_blob fetch mechanism loads all data at once instead of just the batch being fetched. The incremental fetch loading works fine for read_parquet though. For now I have a workaround where I load all the metadata by not reading the content and then incrementally calling read_blob with a batch of filenames from the metadata at a time, but would be nice to just natively support incremental result loading to make the experience more seamless and approachable. \n\nhttps://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-python/discussions/92",

        "body": "Disclaimer: I work in the data platform space (founder of Bruin), so take this as general guidance, not a pitch. The best option really depends on your company size, how your teams are structured, and what your current stack looks like (MSSQL 2016, lake, warehouse, etc.). Also helpful to know how you orchestrate things today; Airflow, SSIS, cron, notebooks, whatever.\n\nOne thing I’d definitely think about is choosing asset-based orchestration instead of task-based. Task-based tools like Airflow or SSIS focus on tasks, not data, so lineage ends up shallow, incomplete, or manually maintained. You also get a lot of glue code that makes governance harder. Asset-based tools like Dagster, dbt, or Bruin treat data assets as the core unit, which gives you proper lineage, clear dependencies, and a cleaner way to centralize metadata and governance. If your goal is a single referential for governance, this approach saves a lot of pain later.\n\nRegarding OpenMetadata: it’s a good open-source option, but it’s not light. You’ll spend time maintaining connectors, and lineage quality depends on how your SQL is written. Glossary, business rules, RACI, etc., also take time to set up. It works well in mature teams that can own it.\n\nYou can also look at metadata-first platforms like DataHub if your priority is lineage and visibility over heavy enterprise governance. Sometimes that’s enough depending on your size.\n\nJust keep in mind that no tool magically creates governance. You still need a central team, standards, ownership, and a gradual rollout. The tool only reinforces the process you already put in place.",

If you eventually want to move into those roles, starting with cloud data engineering will give you an advantage because you’ll understand the systems, the infrastructure, and the production side of data far better. Since you’re already studying ML and ethical/technical subjects, a Cloud Data Engineering path can blend well with your background. You don’t have to choose today but you can start by building data foundations and then transition into ML/Data workflows once you’re comfortable with the cloud and data pipelines.\n\nHere’s a short piece that I came across which breaks down a practical path to getting started in data engineering: [“How to Start a Data Engineering Career With 5 No-Nonsense Moves”](https://medium.com/@khushbu.shah_661/how-to-start-a-data-engineering-career-with-5-no-nonsense-moves-1bd9d2e1248c)  \nHope this gives you some clarity.

Things I can and do teach on the job are working on a specific cloud platform (GCP, Azure) or using specific pipeline tooling (airflow, databricks, azure data factory), etc. Databricks has a lot of nice tutorials and free cloud compute that you could take advantage of for a portfolio piece.

In terms of scalability, we've heard time & time again from our 14k+ community members & DataHub Cloud customers alike that DataHub far exceeds any other platform (open-source or otherwise) in performance and handling massive volumes of real-time changes, cross-platform complexity, etc. \n\nHere are some additional resources for ya -\n\n* I covered lineage generation methods & accuracy benchmarks during a recent Town Hall - here's a link to that specific section: [https://youtu.be/MfcVg\\_uC6L0?si=3DZIA0FcfTKavyOg&t=2260](https://youtu.be/MfcVg_uC6L0?si=3DZIA0FcfTKavyOg&t=2260)\n* Block & Robinhood spoke at CONTEXT this summer, our virtual conference; their session was a deep dive into how they've made the most of cross-platform lineage, impact analysis, etc. [https://datahub.com/webinars/data-supply-chain-visibility-lineage/](https://datahub.com/webinars/data-supply-chain-visibility-lineage/)\n* We also had talks from [Netflix](https://datahub.com/webinars/netflix-global-data-catalog/) & [Apple](https://datahub.com/webinars/agentic-workflows-data-catalog/), both of which are using DataHub at massive scale for some pretty dang amazing use cases\n\nI hope you have some fun with your evaluation!

If you must keep SSIS, point it to ADLS via the Azure Feature Pack; otherwise use ADF with a self-hosted IR from on-prem. Enable SQL Server CDC and push changes to ADLS (via ADF or Event Hubs) to avoid nightly fulls. Lock down with Private Link, Managed VNet IR, Key Vault–backed secrets, and service principals.\n\nPitfalls I’ve seen🥲modeling twice (MI then lakehouse), duplicate security policies, lineage gaps, and schema drift when multiple tools write to the same tables. Pick one orchestrator (ADF is fine), version pipelines, and test backfills early. A measured skip-to-DB approach works: run a 2-week spike for one domain using Autoloader + Photon and keep MI only for legacy apps.\nWith Azure Data Factory and MuleSoft, DreamFactory helped us expose legacy SQL Server as secure REST endpoints so Databricks jobs could ingest without custom middleware.\nSo, keep Phase 1, but aim everything at ADLS/Delta and Databricks from day one so almost nothing gets thrown away.",

Set one changelog per DB, small ordered changesets, and enforce a mainline flow (feature branches rebase to avoid merge conflicts). Always dry-run and generate SQL for review; treat rollbacks as forward fixes, not “undo,” especially on prod.\n\nBytebase shines when you want review workflows, SQL lint, environment pipelines, and permission guardrails without building your own. It also logs who approved what, which kept auditors off our backs. For near-zero downtime: MySQL via gh-ost/pt-osc; MSSQL with online index rebuilds, adding columns with defaults that are metadata-only, and pre/post scripts to backfill.\n\nUse a deploy service account per env with least privilege. Gate releases with tSQLt or SQLFluff, and wire CI in GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. We used Redgate SQL Compare for drift checks and GitHub Actions for pipelines; DreamFactory gave us quick REST APIs over MSSQL/MySQL so app teams didn’t need direct DB perms.\nSo I’d go Liquibase by default; choose Bytebase only if you need built-in approvals, SQL review, and audit trails your auditors will actually use.",

E.g: denormalized data are normalized to store quality data (center of star), then denormalized (dimensions) for reporting for example.  \n2. Generally, it's a combination of the data management stage where we decide sources to use (maybe reliable ones) and define \"rules\", and the data architecture stage where we structure data. For examples, from three sources S1, S2, and S3, maybe we keep only S1 and S3 because data from S2 are not reliable (bad quality). Then data shapes and values from S1 and S3 which may differ at multiple points but generally unique identifier is used (like email), here is where \"rules\" are applied, for example use the email as identifier, set data with no value to NULL, if two other addresses have different values, keep the one which match the phone number, ...  \n3. An example is where instead of creating dimensions which is a transformation, we directly serve the data, and then flexible queries will retrieve them on demand.  \n  \nI hope it helps :)",

Denormalized only means attributes are combined, not that the structure matches the grain or logic needed for reporting. If the current shape works, you can keep it. If it doesn’t, you transform it into whatever structure performs well-normalize first, remodel into facts/dims, or rebuild a wider table. The model itself isn’t the goal; usability and query performance are. So denormalized is different with ready for analytics. Adjust the structure when needed to make it clean, fast, and reliable.\n\n2. Multiple customer sources with different IDs and attributes usually lead to a conformed customer dimension. The goal is to unify identity across systems using a surrogate key, then merge records via deterministic or fuzzy matching rules. You track history using SCD when attributes change over time. From the conformed dimension, you can also generate shrunken dimensions when a specific process only needs a subset of attributes - reducing complexity and improving performance while keeping consistency. The key idea is: one enterprise-wide definition of customer, multiple shapes depending on analytical needs. For more details, you can read the chapter \"Integrate via conformed dimension\" of The Data Warehouse Toolkit.\n\n3. A star schema is part of dimensional modeling and works great for data warehousing because it’s simple, performant, and easy for business users to query. But it isn’t the only modeling approach. Data Vault focuses on flexibility and historical tracking when dealing with many changing data sources, while the Inmon approach builds a 3NF enterprise warehouse before data marts, or One Big Table stores data in wide-tables,... Each method has strengths and trade-offs, so the right choice depends on requirements - speed to deliver, data complexity, volume, regulatory needs.",

Reuse the same cleaned staging models so you’re not doing the work twice. Materialize dims/facts as tables and use incremental loads where it helps.\n\n2) For customer, create a surrogate-keyed dimcustomer and a customerxref (sourcesystem, sourceid, customersk, matchconfidence, matched\\_on, rule). Do deterministic matches first (tax ID, email+dob), then fuzzy for names/addresses. Store survivorship rules for attributes, run SCD2, and route low-confidence cases to a review queue so ops can merge/split and you can replay history. I’ve used Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for modeling, Great Expectations for tests, and DreamFactory to expose a lightweight approval API for those manual merges without giving warehouse write access.\n\n3) Skip strict star when you need event streams with nested arrays, high-card time series, graphy relationships, or an ODS/Data Vault layer feeding multiple marts.\n\nMain point: keep raw raw, standardize once into conformed models, denormalize only where it serves the queries, and treat customer identity as a first-class process :)",

If so, you may find it more useful to create a set of compound keys (which could also be expressed in a singular column as a hashkey, which is my preference) - which contain all identifier columns that make each record unique. \n\nThen there's a question of data consistency - are we dealing with slowly changing dimensions or static facts? You don't want to create a key with nulls in it, but equally so you don't want to establish a new record each time a customer updates their info. So much of these considerations are determined by both the business logic at the point of collection (data source) and the desired update pattern for your tables.\n\nGetting this all diagrammed out alongside mapping out the business rules ahead of the engineering process will make everyone's work much easier, as at that point it's mostly plug-and-play to build your DDL and DML pieces.\n\nAs much as I personally bristled at Medallion architecture when I was first introduced to it, I realized you can think of your raw sources as the bronze layer, the normalized star schema as the silver layer, and all downstream transformations as your gold layer. Alternatively, you can stick with the classic approach of a raw dataset, staging tables, production tables, and data marts for specific user groups if your governance plan allows for it/business needs require it. You can also mix and match with materialized views substituting for tables if they fit your needs and your platform supports them.\n\nThis doesn't work for all types of data or use cases, but hopefully gives you something to work with and learn from.",

This means you can run Python anywhere, and not limited by what Snowpark or similar platforms allow you to do with dbt Python models.\n   * Bruin uses `uv` in the background, meaning that your pipelines will work even if you don't have Python installed, and each task runs separately in isolated environments.\n* Native column-level lineage in open-source and open-source [VSCode/Cursor extension](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/vscode-extension/overview.html).\n* Bruin allows [defining policies](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/policies.html) in code to apply your SQL statements, e.g. \"this SQL model must have an owner\" or \"it must follow these rules\". You can enforce these in your ci/cd pipelines.\n* `bruin validate` validates all your queries via dry-run to check if they are valid, this means invalid code never lands. \n* Bruin contains embedded sqlfluff for linting with your existing rules.\n* Bruin has an open-source MCP server to let agents build/help with your T layer.\n* dbt has \\`doc\\` macro, Bruin contains a built-in [glossary](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/glossary.html) instead.\n\nBoth tools are useful in their own ways, and share different approaches, hope this comparison is helpful.",

For Protobuf, if you have a descriptor set (.desc), protoc --decode or grpcurl (with reflection or -protoset) gets you readable output; with Confluent’s Protobuf support, the same schema‑id header flow applies. Redpanda Console or Conduktor are nice when you want a UI that decodes messages against the registry. Confluent Schema Registry and Redpanda Console do the heavy lifting day‑to‑day; DreamFactory has been handy when I need a quick REST shim around decoded records plus schema lookup.\n\n\n\nIf you build a visual inspector, make it registry‑aware (Confluent/Karapace), handle Avro/Protobuf wire headers, accept .desc files, and show schema diffs; otherwise quick scripts will still win.",

OLTP databases have a lot more functionality than OLAP (more constraints, lower latency, faster updates/deletes, etc.) and will work as long as your data isn't huge, so go for something like Postgres for storage.\n\nUse custom python scripts to request data from the API, and minimally transform it before loading into Postgres. Then you can use dbt models to restructure the data into fact/dim tables. Power BI has a native connector for Postgres, so setting it up to read from the clean dimensional tables should be simple.\n\nAt your data scale, everything downstream of the API requests will be very fast to update. The main bottleneck will be how fast the API is, how much data you can pull with each request, and the request quotas you currently have with your subscription.",

Using legal docs as an example I’ve seen arbitration transcripts that have wild formatting differences simply based on which transcription vendor was used. Can’t do much about that other than adapt to what you’ve got. \n\nIMO just pick a set of tools and start playing with it. You can spend months trying to over plan at the beginning just to find out at implementation none of that planning caught something that would have been obvious on day one had you just gone for it.\n\nPick some arbitrary fixed chunk size to start, add a reranking step, then test with a cheap model so you don’t rack up a bunch of costs. Once you start playing with it (with a real user involved) the next steps start to become apparent. You’ll start to see deficiencies that give some intuition on what meta data might be helpful. Also, the more traditional filter that can be used without becoming a pain to the user, the better. I’ve seen some absolutely crazy amounts of effort put into mapping infinite possibilities of classification that could have been solved with a dropdown. (Don’t have an LLM try to figure out which of 15 cases the user is referring to based on a vague query when it’s no big deal to have them select it themselves and massively narrow down the documents being parsed).",

Can you check this and provide more details about your job so that we can find the \"error\" together?",

I'm really excited about it and have been obsessively working on it on the past days and I am dying to talk about it with someone hahahah\n\n  \nBut the idea is: the scripts collect some really interesting alternative data from the game that couldn't really be gathered manually and do creative stuff with it. For example: by analyzing 5 days of scraped chat data I found out players that play past midnight are willing to pay a huge premium on some of the items on the game since there are less active players past midnight that could sell them the item. So I bought some of those items before going to sleep, woke up early the next day (5am), Opened a jupyter notebook to analyze my \"chat\\_history\" database, and contacted the players that were still online to sell them the items at a premium.",

If you have someone that manages your infra, but do not develop your own software, you have other options like Airbyte, which is open source, extendable and has a graphical interface, but i never used it in production, so take that with a pinch of salt.\n\nBest regards",

To me this isn’t about blocking marketing or “never letting them make technical decisions.” That’s gatekeeping, and it usually creates more tension than it solves.\n\nMarketing people are adults. They can understand trade-offs and deal with consequences just like everyone else. The real problem is usually not who suggested a tool, but who actually owns the process and the outcomes.\n\nIf ingestion is owned by the data team, then the data team should make the final call. If marketing owns the workload and carries the operational risk, then they can make the decision. Just make ownership explicit and you avoid the “how could you allow this?” gaslighting scenario entirely.\n\nAlso, you don’t want to become the “no person” who rejects every tool non-engineers propose. That kills collaboration. Better approach is:\n\n1. define the owner  \n2. list the requirements  \n3. evaluate trade-offs together  \n4. let the owner decide\n\nSometimes a no-code tool is the right choice. Sometimes it isn’t. But shutting non-technical teams out of the decision entirely almost always backfires.",

Agree on an exit path upfront: how to export raw data, how to rehydrate if you leave, and who funds the switch.\n\nPressure-test vendor lock-in: do they support CDC or at least webhooks, raw landing in object storage, and schema-change handling? Add simple data contracts for key tables so ownership survives tool swaps.\n\nStack-wise, Windsor could handle common marketing connectors; keep dlt for oddball sources; Airbyte is a nice middle when you need open-source and extendable. I’ve paired Fivetran for paid connectors, Airbyte for customs, and DreamFactory to expose curated tables as REST for downstream tools without new microservices.\n\nBottom line: pick the owner, set SLOs and costs, time-box a pilot, and keep a clear exit plan.",

A job doesn't need to be something you're passionate about, a job needs to be something you can tolerate doing every day, even on days you're feeling uninspired, even on days you kinda feel like shit. Having at least mild interest in the job helps with that, but it's not the focus. Interest and passion is something that better comes from your *life*. A job is how you pay for it.\n\nMy direction after art school was getting a phd in math and working in machine learning, and that's something I never would have thought I would find fun until I did it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone else, it was just something I resonated with when exploring, and my interest in it is unique to me. What I would recommend is not being afraid to change direction if you realize the path you're on is making you miserable. If you really can't stand compsci, don't power through the degree, all that does is set you up to do something every day that you hate. But if you pivot, don't look for passion, look for stability, for contentment with the day to day. A good sign is if something seems *kinda fun*. Not amazing, not cool, not noble, not virtuous. Kinda fun. Kinda fun is where it's at.",

It's disappointing but usually the point of degrees is to get a good source of income, what the current state of degrees in your country's economy is matters too. \nEdit; but take my advice with a grain of salt. Because if you are ready to face any economic hardship, or living in shitty apartments or not having any stable career, if you have enough passion (not just interest eg '\" I really like this but I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it either but true burning passion & dedication)) you know what you want with it and if you're ready to face anything for it, who knows there is always a possibility it'll work out",

        "body": "My background:\nI graduated with a master's in CS about a year ago. I'm still looking for work, but part of this was my own doing for not doing a technical internship while I was in school and not doing more personal projects (I want to teach as a 2nd career, so I tutored/did teaching jobs for CS during my summers. At the time tech was still stable, so I did not think I had to do a technical internship. You live, make choices, and you learn). \n\nI'd think about first why you hate CS and why you have negative feelings about it. For people I've tutored, usually their hatred for CS was resentment for not pursuing their passions, feelings of frustration for not understanding the material (often trying to do the work alone), math phobias, not connecting with the material, or a mixture of those reasons. All extremely valid reasons and reasons often reliant on your environment (bad profs, depression, lack of community, etc). \n\nBefore you decide to jump ship from CS, be extremely honest with yourself. Did you give CS your full effort? This means if you had the time, did you attend Office hours, talk to your professors, try to talk to peers, go to tutoring (if you could afford/uni offered it), join CS clubs, etc? If the answer is no, then something was holding you back from giving it a full shot, so you need to figure out what that is and if it's within your control to get past it. Some people, even with the best tutors, need more time to learn STEM subjects than the 4 years expected out of uni- this is completely normal, but may not be a financial option for all students (which is an unfortunate position to be during later years of uni and will require some tough decisions).\n\nIf you have managed to stay in your CS program this far without acidemic probation, then you likely understand *some* aspects of code, but too many knowledge gaps are there to make you see the big picture (which in CS is important, its when everything begins to click). With enough hustle, I think you can salvage the rest of your degree and make it through- but this will require complete humility to get there. You making this reddit post in full honesty about your knowledge gaps makes me think you might be able to do it. Next steps would be scheduling meetings with your profs, get a tutor if possible, talk to your GTAs, joining study groups, etc. The key part of wanting anyone to support you in your success is to take the initiative (with humility) and be consistent (show up, do the work). I've had students reach out to me with failing grades halfway through the course with humility, and it was that act of bravery that lead to them passing the class (if they put the work in).\n\n\nMy best advice is to find a prof you like/trust in your CS department and have an honest convo with them. I'd also schedule an appointment with career services and talk to them too (you pay a ton of money to be in uni- use your resources!!!). Ask them if there is a realistic way for you to finish your degree with the knowledge gaps or if it's for the best you switch. I know plenty of people that made CS a minor and switched to business with a technical component- there could be options you aren't aware of, but you need to have those conversations with people who have that knowledge.\n\nEven if you do switch- get that internship! It's extremely important in this job market, and the easiest way to get and prove you have experience.\n\nGood Luck! Always happy to chat further. I have personally supported many CS students to find the acidemic path right for them (even if it meant a different major) and also helped many find the fun in CS to get through it (a lot actually went from hating to loving CS). I will say in learning anything, community is extremely important to help you get over hurdles and where you need to go, so don't take any resources you have for granted :)",

You get to focus on the concepts they're teaching you rather than waste time on the C++ syntax and errors, and 2. It's easier for those who come into uni with little to no experience in programming. If I were you, I'd learn Python as part of my courses, and do projects with C++ in personal projects. Personal projects are amazing when you lack experience by the way, employers always asked me about the personal projects I have in my resume in interviews when I was a student. Also, being good at more languages is ALWAYS a plus, it increases opportunities you can apply for AND makes it so much easier to learn other languages cuz you'd see a pattern of common things between languages. It's true that Python is getting more and more popular, some of my projects would have been brutal without the Python libraries, but there's always jobs that require C++. Finally, remember, you're not cheating on C++ if you learn Python (no judgement, I felt like I was too).\n\nGood luck and enjoy programming!",

There are a lot of reasons why, IMO, developing on Linux is better -- you could make solid arguments that doing development on Linux is easier, faster, and more secure -- but none of those things matter if the people who will be buying your game are on Windows.\n\nServers, on the other hand, aren't normally run by end users, and aren't even normally run on desktop systems.  Professional environments will usually buy hardware that is intended just for running a specific server, and if you're not already locked into using a specific OS, there's little reason to not pick the one that you have full control over and isn't bloated with things you don't need.\n\nTo be fair, that's been shifting a lot in recent years thanks to Proton.  Prior to the release of the Steam Deck in 2022, Linux desktop share had been stuck at around 1% on the Steam hardware surveys for basically forever; but it's been steadily climbing since then, and it recently crossed 3% for the first time ever.  3% still isn't a lot, but tripling Linux's desktop share in three years after decades of stagnation is pretty incredible.  We're at the point now where all of the big engines are multi-platform, and Proton can run 95% of games that are Windows-only (not counting games with kernel-level anti-cheat software), so sticking with Windows for development is increasingly becoming completely optional... and why stick with it if you can get a better developer experience on Linux but still deliver a game to Windows customers?",

What the CLI app does doesnt matter a ton, maybe its a thin wrapper around git, maybe just checks the weather from some external api. The key is that you are able to talk about your experience creating the CLI app on your resume and in an interview. As for the API, I have only had experiences with a basic CRUD and REST HTTP Apis. If you want to use something newer go for that! But as others have said, it would be best to use some form of enterprise framework. If you dont know any, dont worry too much! Just get a first draft out there and start applying! Take inspiration from something you care about in life, i built a movie tracking api, pretty much a letterboxd.com clone when i was trying to beef up my resume for my first job.\n\nBeing able to talk about the standard coding practices like DRY, DI, OOP would be good too.

Tech is arguably one of the most community oriented STEM fields out there, especially evident in it's history. Lean into this strength!\n\nI guarentee you have at least 5 classmates who feel exactly like you. Next time you go to class, talk to a few classmates and ask them if they are doing any side projects, how they feel about leetcode, etc. Do not feel discouraged if you hear a few people talk about their side projects/ease with leetcode- find comfort in being aware of people more knowledgeable than you in your community- you can learn a lot from them! \n\nOnce you got enough feelers, start figuring out what you want to do with that info. Is someone working on a side project that sounds interesting? Then see if you can do something similar or ask if there is any way you can join in on it. Are a lot of students struggling too? Then form a study group together and collectively figure out what projects you can work on either together (get that github practice in) or independently. Even if you are surrounded by many people who \"have it together\", ask them what got them there and how you can be more involved. Whatever you do with the feelers, make sure it's rooted in community and doing work consistently. Personal projects have really frustrating hurdles, so you need that support system to get you to keep going.\n\nYour professors are also goldmines of knowledge too, so ask them what types of personal projects you can work on or some general guidance- literally email them to schedule a meeting.\n\nIf there is one thing college gives you, it's the opportunity to connect with people (your first network). One of the best lessons I took away from college is it only takes one person to get the momentum to build a community- so if you can't find community that will help you grow, then that is a sign you need to put in the work to build it. The other big lesson I learned in college is that people really admire someone who openly wears humility and accountability on their sleeve- it builds trust and leaves room for stronger connections to grow.\n\n\nWhenever I have feelings of imposter syndrome kicking in with thoughts like \"I could never achieve x\", I pause and ask myself \"But why not me?\". And I keep asking why until I have measurable steps I can take to improve.\n\nHope that helps! Even with the stuff we are passionate about, it's easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when we try to tackle it alone.

The real metric of general knowledge/skill is what projects you have made. Since you say you haven't made anything, the best time to start making a project is right now, whenever you have some free time to spare. Pick something you find interesting and just start making it. The hardest thing is looking at a blank editor, but once you write the first few lines (even if it's just a bunch of comments outlining the general program flow you are going to implement), you'll naturally fall into a pipe-line of problems you have to solve, allowing you to iteratively reach a solution over time. There's no shame in using google or any other forms of documentation, everyone does it, and if they don't then they're either lying or making something trivial. The only thing I'd avoid, or at least use with extreme caution, is any form of generative A.I. Ideally, you'd use it as a tool or a tutor, asking it to explain concepts or answer some questions you might have. However, in reality most people (especially beginners/learners!) fall into the trap of having the A.I. do everything for them, and essentially \"outsource\" their thinking to the machine. By that point, you may as well not waste your time, since you will learn nothing.\n\nYou should also avoid falling into the trap of \"collecting\" languages as if they are Pokemon. You should be focusing on language-agnostic concepts, which can be implemented in a variety of languages (some of which will be better suited than others to whatever you're making). Of course, it's ideal to have a basic grasp of the language you are going to use, but if you're firm in your language-agnostic concepts, it will be easy to just pick up the syntax along the way.\n\nAs an answer to your question, it's definitely not over. You just need to change your approach to education. And you need to ask yourself if you really enjoy Computer Science, because if you do, then everything you do will feel a lot less arduous.",

Eventually you have to specialize and your field will have knowledge that is specific to it, and not applicable to other experts.\n\nI’ve found that with programming, it doesn’t really neatly fit into a nice sequence, because it’s far less sequential, and far more parallel. You learn *out* rather than you learn *up* if that makes any sense. And you advance in terms of your general maturity, rather than specific knowledge building on each other as theorems imply further theorems. \n\nThe other thing is that programming sits in this place between academia and a trade, where there’s a ton of “craft” and professional knowledge that exists in the form of essentially folk wisdom transmitted via forums and blogs, not books. \n\nAll that is to say, it’s harder to curate a list like you imagine, and there’s going to be way more disagreement about it when they do.\n\nHere is a list of articles about software which I think are all excellent, but decidedly mostly on the advanced side. These mostly all deal with the wisdom of professional software development, rather than the how-to: \n\nhttps://refactoringenglish.com/blog/software-essays-that-shaped-me/",

It’s the kind of book that starts with stuff where you’re like “Yeah, obviously” and then a couple chapters later you’re going “WHAT?!” People tend to have strong opinions about it one way or the other; I think it’s brilliant and should be on pretty much every programmer’s to-read list, but plenty of people think it’s overrated. Given that it’s free, it’s worth a try.\n* [*Concrete Mathematics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) is, as the title suggests, focused on the math side of CS, but since this is where most programmers are weakest, it’s worth mentioning. One of its authors, Donald Knuth, is more famous for his advanced work, but *CM* is suitable for pretty much anyone who is confident about the bare bones of programming but wants to understand it more deeply.",

He wrote a compiler that only outputs MOV instructions but is still Turing complete. He wrote a thing that when you reverse engineer it, it displays pictures from your own hard drive, as a deterrent to reveng further. He hacked into ring -2 on an x86 processor - you don’t know what ring -2 is? Neither did anyone else until he hacked it. He wrote Cantor Dust to suggest what the next gen of reveng tools should look like. Man is a legend. \n\nSo, while other recommendations make perfect sense, these magazines/books will expand your mind in ways they never could. And the PDFs are free. Did I mention they are free?

It teaches craftsmanship: naming, structure, clarity, and how to think about code quality in any language.\n2. **Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler:** One of the most important books if you want to write and improve maintainable code. You will learn patterns, code smells, and how to gradually improve structure without breaking things.\n3. **Design Patterns (Gang of Four):** The foundational book on object-oriented design patterns. It’s dense, but once you get the concepts, you’ll start seeing these patterns everywhere in real projects.\n\nThese aren’t low-level, but they’re the kind of books that make you a better programmer overall, they improve how you think about code, structure, and long-term maintainability, regardless of whether you’re writing Python, C, Java, or anything else.",

You’re receiving formatted text that your host binds to a handing method which in turn returns formatted text. Taking the long view, Rest is simply a point of view that “the http verb in the formatted text header should dictate the operation” which replaced the previous opinion which more or less said “just use post or get for that mandatory verb header and name your operation in the relative path and the name should usually match the handling method so you can find things”. Neither is wrong. People just have strong opinions about formatted text. \n\nBonus: If you really want to annoy people, go take the position that soap with xsd-defined payloads is more precise, more extensible, and can be more secure than rest with json (it is) and that devs were simply too lazy to learn the spec. It’s a bit better now that swagger (open api) is more mainstream, but for a while rest was a real pain to consume.\n\nThe next thing to remember is that your reaction is valid and you’re often going to have more tailored controller services for web front ends. These aren’t enterprise APIs. They’re part of the same logical application and are only services because the halves run on two different computers. Otherwise they would just be helper or data layer methods. We do this because chattiness and sequential service call latency is the death of web pages. So if a commonly used page needs a getMyStuff composite method that returns a splittable json payload in one hit, that’s not crazy. \n\nIf you need that to be available generically, you can expose a graphql or composite endpoint that allows you to specify an object and specific children and fields.

You don't see YouTubers doing it for the same reason TV cooking shows have \"one already made\" in the oven to skip over the step most people find tedious to witness. But in terms of actual practice: doing that gives you insight into how different patterns overlap (or are even the same pattern wearing a different moustache) and it's *great* for building your capabilities.\n\nIdeally, for maximum safety, you have tests in place before making changes like that so you can confirm that a change that was just \"saying the same thing more clearly\" doesn't actually break the program. But the importance of doing that scales with the number of people on the project, the likelihood someone who didn't write your code becomes responsible for maintaining it, and lines of code in the project; for a small, personal project, one script, one file of functions, that kind of testing might be overkill.\n\n(To put on my guy-who's-been-at-this-for-thirty-three-years philosopher's hat: programming is different from other engineering disciplines because the description of the thing we do very nearly *is* the thing we do. It's like magic... Like *old* magick. \"The name of the thing is the thing.\" If you find yourself only being able to put two hands on a problem after you've written one crack at how to solve it, that's *extremely* normal, because you describe the problem with words but also solve it with words. As you gain more experience you often can do more of that work in your head and you'll see more problems that you immediately go \"Oh I'll just solve that with X\" because you've solved a nearly-identical problem before, but looking at the code you just wrote and going \"Oh it'd be easier if I just\\~\" is extremely normal. Programmers aren't rock-stars; we're *writers*. Much like an author realizing a deeper truth about their characters after making a first draft, we often grasp our problems better one we have *one* solution for them on the table.)",

Or not interested in Source Code Control. Or not interested in the design process (which may involve some UML and other diagramming techniques as well as boring old documentation). But these are all important things to understand and understand how to use them and when to use them.\n\nWhen I was at University, there were definitely subjects and topics that were part of the course that many of us though \"What is the point of this?\". As a result those people that thought that way often struggled with it.

Don't try to come up with \"the perfect\" project. Just choose something you have at least some interest in, ideally something you can use yourself. It should also be relatively small, so that you don't feel frustrated about not being able to finish it.\n\nA couple of suggestions off the top of my head:\n\n1. Just a simple intro page about yourself. Later you can introduce your other hobby projects there\n2. Habit tracker. You can use it to track whether you work on hobby projects every day :)\n3. Language learning tool\n\nOver time, you will have a much better idea of what and how you want to build.\n\nThis simple habit accomplishes many things at the same time:\n\n1. Gives a lot of learning opportunity. You need to think what tools you need to use, how to use them, etc.\n2. Similar to 1, but it's more about some domain knowledge. e.g. if you decide to build a language learning tool, you'd probably research some established tools and will either copy their UI/UX or even improve them. You'd understand what challenges users have while using these kinds of apps, etc\n3. Builds confidence. Once you have a couple of very small projects under your belt, you can gradually move to more and more complex ones. Over time, you will feel more and more confident in your skills\n4. Builds your portfolio that you can show to your potential employer. Trust me, most employers(at least the ones I'd like to work for) would love to see you build stuff in your free time without anybody's direction.\n\nIMO AI is only scary for junior devs who can only follow simple directions of their employers and don't show any initiative. By building your own things, you will inevitably learn how to be more proactive which I don't think AI will be able to replicate in foreseeable future.",

You gotta treat it like a petty toddler that is going to do exactly what you tell it to, to. the. letter. Take a problem you want to solve break it down into smaller problems, then worry about combining them later. While you're doing that discard any features that aren't critical to accomplish the primary goal, this gets you a minimum viable product. Worry about bells and whistles after you got and MVP.\n\nSearch Stack Overflow, reddit, and youtube for help and, if you really want to learn programming, ignore AI. Using AI will not make you a competent programmer it's robbing you of the headbanging frustration required to breakthrough to understanding. It can be a powerful tool used judiciously but you don't have the experience yet to know when to do that.",

It teaches them the basics of problem solving and following procedures. I think of games like Portal, Zelda, Tomb Raider, Uncharted… Games where you do You do A and B to then be able to do C. Actual coding, might as well be teaching him French or Chinese. If he’s not into language, it’s kinda school-like. \n\nRemember what we do is solve problems by writing repeatable procedures. What motivates us to actually code? Somebody with money will pay us to solve their problems, while maybe personal problems motivate us for personal projects. \n\nWhat motivates a 9 year old, or what personal problems could they solve through coding?

That isn't to say getting a certification would definitely be worthless, but in my mind, if your goal is to be able to show a potential employer \"Hey, I can do X thing,\" it's actually probably more effective to just focus on talking about interesting projects you've done (don't need to be external to school, can just be school assignments or final projects) at a level that shows that you have a good conceptual grasp of what you were doing, along with some experience with the tools that are common to the industry you're interested in. Tools that you might get asked about are ones related to version control (e.g., git), debugging (e.g., gdb), and unit testing (lots of options, and you may not use anything formal for this purpose, which is also OK). It is not necessary to fully master any one tool, you're just trying to signal \"Hey, I have used these tools as part of my process, and I can fairly quickly pick up different ones that do the same job.\"\n\nAs for questions 3 and 4 about what else you should be doing right now and how to stand out, I will first say that I admire your willingness to think ahead. On the other hand, I will also say that you should not feel compelled to do extra work beyond what is already being assigned to you at school. This is because, imo, the amount of hard work and effort it takes to stand out is not worth the payoff *if* your only goal with that effort is to stand out a little more. Your driving motivator should just be what you're interested in, especially because what you're interested in may change, which can lead to you going into a different field than the one you're currently considering, at which point any past hyper-specific work done for the purpose of standing out may not be very useful to you.\n\nThat being said, projects are a good place to start. A project can be anything you're interested in: a website, a game, a tool, an extension of a school project. The important thing is just that there's some overlap between your project and the field you're interested in. For example, if you think you might want to work in embedded systems, then building a web app won't help you very much (it may still help a little, though). However, you want to be willing to devote some proper time to it -- probably at least 50 hours in total, spread out over the course of a summer or school year.",

Just grinding won't get you further. Your brain will just get overloaded and shut down.\n\nA little story from my experience: when Java came out, I was already programming for over a decade and was proficient in multiple procedural languages. Then, I tried Java and OOP. This was a humbling experience. I could not make heads or tails at all. The *language* was easy enough to understand, but switching from procedural to OOP didn't click at all. I tried many times and failed many times until at one point, it suddenly started to make sense. Can't even say what really did it for me.\n\nNow, my advice is to program something with it and here, I deviate from the common examples: build a *library* for card games, like Blackjack, Poker, Uno, etc. Start with modeling a single `Card`. It has a suit, a rank, a numeric value, a face, a back, it can be face up or down - the fields. The card can report its data - provided it is face up, it can draw itself (in a loose sense), it can be flipped - toggle face up/down.\n\nThen, go further: make a `Deck` that can hold a full set of cards, that can be shuffled, that can deal cards, that can tell if it is empty or not, etc.\n\nNext, a `Hand` that takes cards.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBuild it in such a way that you can create different `Card` types, e.g. PokerCard, UnoCard, etc. All these can use the `Deck` without modification.\n\nWith such an exercise, you'll cover abstract classes, inheritance, composition, polymorphism. \n\nThe benefit is that you can draw a relation between a real world object and its digital representation.",

I am not sure what university you go to or how they teach it there, but in general I don't think they teach it very well and you certainly have not had enough classes to be this hard on yourself.\n\nOOP is not just a Java thing either. You can think of it as real life and that is why it is supposed to make sense once you understand that. Classes are just descriptions of things. Objects are instances of that description.\n\nUse animals as an example. Mammals are a class that describes things with hair. So,  hasHair == true. Some mammals are land animals and some are sea animals. So, where == \"land | sea\". A lion (subclass) \"Inherits\" the attributes of a mammal and adds a few more attributes like sharp teeth. So, hasTeeth == true && hasBigTeeth == true && isDangerous == true :). A pig is a mammal too and it \"inherits\" from mammal too. Some of the attributes it shares with a lion has different values. If we were to control a lion or a pig we call the \"run\" function, the lion will have a faster run implementation than the pig. \"Polymorphism\". We typically hide the implementation and field access to make code less brittle. We would not want someone binding directly to something we want to be able to change later. We make these attributes and internal functions private. \"Encapsulation\".  There should be a subclass of mammal that lion inherits from named \"LandAnimal\". Now this part gets tricky because Java does not support multiple inheritance so we want to use hasA vs isA implementation. When we access the base class LandAnimal which actually has the \"run\" method which is slower in pigs than in lions \"polymorphism\" again. LandAnimal is an \"abstraction\" (or base class) of Lion (isA LandAnimal). Or we can use interfaces for this \"abstraction\" (hasA LandAnimal) interface (composition).\n\nI just wrote this from the top of my head so I hope it makes sense and is correct.\n\nI hope this helps. Relax a little, go easy, and don't give up. You will get it.",

The project was assigned to an ERP solution architect, who immediately saw that this is an ERP project - implementing a new BOM (bill of materials) and warehouse management for the new site. This was designed, built, tested, and delivered. \n\nBut, because he was an ERP solution architect, and not a trained project manager, he completely ignored the whole infrastructure side of the project - it was a new building, so it needed cabling, WiFi routers, client devices, and a new conference room. This only popped up a few weeks before the \"ribbon cutting\" on the new site, when someone came around and asked when we were going to install the hardware, and no one knew what he was talking about. \n\nWe were literally pulling cables inside the building while the CEO was outside talking to the local news teams announcing the start of production. \n\nSo, my advice to anyone who is given a project to lead: First, stop and think. Ask yourself if you really see the ENTIRE problem that needs to be solved. THEN break it down into manageable chunks, and plan each one of those in terms of resources and efforts. Once the plan has been agreed and the necessary resources are on board, THEN you start designing the solution (either traditional/sequential project, or a series of agile sprints).",

I had used well known libraries for this prior, but watching his presentation gave me an insight into “how” he implemented this idea in his library react-virtualized.\n\nI went off and tried to build my own little library that could do the same. I dropped the “I’m not gonna re-invent the wheel” mindset, and instead just said I’m gonna sit here and get something working if it takes me all month. \n\nInstead of querying GPT for answers, I just broke it down into small bites. “How do I unmount something when it goes out of view? How do I detect when something is coming into view?” Etc.” In the end, my little library worked well enough for me to be super proud that I figured this out, and the amount I learned during the process was pretty wild. \n\nI use this example because it was the first of what would become many of these little “let me see if I can make a basic version of this” exercises.

Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. EDIT: fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.\n\nNow for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.\n\nDo this with every small project you work on. An address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.\n\nYou will get this. Best wishes.",

Using AI like this is pretty much the best way to kneecap any learning a beginner does.\n\nIn the beginning stages, you are honestly *training* yourself as much as you are learning - you have to build up your mind, to be able to handle the abstractions and prolonged mental effort programming requires. I find most beginners fail not because they can't find the right knowledge, but because they never get their mind \"in shape\" enough.\n\nCoding assistants can be fine for already skilled developers, people who already have the types of habits one needs to be successful. But for a beginner it can prevent you from doing the kind of hard mental work you need to be doing in order to get your brain in shape.\n\nThink of it like you're training to go on backwoods adventures, hiking and climbing mountains and trudging through forests. When you go on your big backpacking trip, sure, you'll probably get in a truck and drive to the trailhead - that's fine. But when you're starting out training and going \"I'm going to walk a few miles every day to build up my endurance\", it wouldn't make very much sense to just drive those miles every day instead and still call it training, right?\n\nDitch the AI until you reach the point when you're smarter than the AI. AI is kryptonite for learners when they used it to do things they can't already easily do, save it until you get to tasks where you're like \"I've done this 100 times on my own, I don't need to bore myself the 101st time, I'll get AI to generate it because this task is too easy to challenge me\".",

Each instruction is N bits, of which some bits tell the circuitry which op, some tell it the operands (what to operate on, e.g. register, immediate value etc.). These instructions can be written in assembly text or directly in machine code, which your compiler will output for a given architecture when writing in a high level language (e.g. C, C++...).

Graduating from a good theater school will get you an interview. Knowing someone on the cast will work just as well. But if you don't impress them with your audition, none of it will matter.\n\nSo your primary focus should be to learn the skills, don't worry about the credential because it's the least important thing.\n\nThe good news is that there are tons of completely free resources to learn to code online.\n\nMy suggestion is rather than worrying about which one is the most likely to lead to a career, focus on which one is the best fit for you. The first course you pick won't determine your career trajectory, the goal is simply to get you from zero to coding. Once you get the hang of coding, you can pivot to different languages depending on your interests and goals.\n\nHere are three suggestions for very high-quality free courses. All three of them are a fantastic way to go from zero to coding, even though they teach very different things. They have very different styles and teach different languages, but all are valid first steps.

If you want to be a programmer, I absolutely recommend no shortcuts - learn computer science fundamentals first. High-level languages are not \"programming on easy mode\", it's better to think of them as means of thoughtful shortcuts for engineers who understand the tradeoffs. \n\n> Especially for roles that I am eyeing (devops, cloud, etc...)\n\nWhat do you actually want to do? If you want to go into devops, coding is helpful to know but it's not required and you may well be wasting your time. \n\n> I want to be job ready in 1 year or so.\n\nIf you are able to work on learning programming every day as a full time job for a year, you might have a slight chance that someone is willing to take a chance on you. When I got into being a professional engineer in the early 2010s, I had already been doing hobby programming since the 90s and I had a couple of websites under my belt. I don't want to be discouraging, but everyone is trying to shift into software engineering and the entry level market is absolutely brutal - you're going to be competing with people who have compsci degrees and almost a decade of programming experience (if they took coding courses in middle school and high school).\n\n> I was also advised by some of my programmer friends to stick to one language as a beginner.\n\nProgramming is programming fundamentally. I don't want to say language doesn't matter at all either, but if you learn to program properly you might work with 2-3 languages just in the learning phase. To throw in my two cents, I did 6502 Assembly, BASIC, and then C when I got my hands on an x86 PC, and then on to PHP when I did websites. I strongly dislike Python due to its syntax, whitespace rules and tooling ecosystem, most of my day-to-day is now done in Ruby and Go, two languages I enjoy immensely.",

He is a team player and seeks help when he has done his part but still being stuck. He listens to the advice of his team mates. But the second one is a lost case. He does not function in a team and is unable to work on his tasks. He requires a constant handholding and even with handholding is unable to pick up any new knowledge. Eventually he either quits or is let go.\n\nCoding interviews are not just there to see if you can write code. How do you approach a problem. How do you analyze it. What you are trying and what you are not trying. How do you react to a stressful situation. How do you communicate with your \"team\" (your interviewers and such). etc.\n\nEither you succeeded or you failed. No point to worry over something that is out of your control. If you succeeded then well done. If you failed then ask them for a feedback in what was lacking and what you can improve in yourself before you start applying to jobs again.",

It's the only way you'll stay motivated to write code outside of class, build new things, and deal with the rapidly-changing landscape and job market (AI, new libraries, new tools, new approaches, refactors, \"breaking changes\", debugging, so on and so forth); at least that's how it is for me. I thought I hated programming, refused to even try it until I was 30, then I found out I'm good at it and I love it (I'm a little obsessive when it comes to programming now). Almost all of my friends who went to school for software engineering, thinking it'd land them a high-paying job (who never programmed outside of class) are all working in a different fields now. In a tight market, employers aren't interested in programmers who aren't interested in code.\n\nYou've basically answered your own question. There's no reason to specialize in something you hate, nor in going to college if you hate it, for a degree you'll hate working in. Look into audio production and audio engineering (that's somewhat different from straight \"music technology\"). However, you're kind of giving mixed signals. If you're into music and music software, what don't you like about the music technology you were introduced to (which, presumably, uses said software)? I tried being a musician a long while back, and I loved messing with MIDI devices and all the music MIDI and editing software. I liked messing with soundboards, and I think it'd be fun to be the sound mixer/tech at concerts (for example).\n\nIf the idea is: You hate college, you hate all the degrees, but you're going to get one anyways. Pick something ***you can stand***. Something adjacent to what you want to do. For example, I got a business degree with an emphasis in entrepreneurship, because I've always wanted to start a small business (and as of now, I'm building out my presence as independent contractor for full stack software engineering). Yes, the degree is kind of worthless, and no it didn't ***really*** teach me much about building and sustaining a small business, but it all starts to add up.\n\nIn my mind, it'd make way more sense for you to go to a technical school for audio production. It'll be cheaper, faster, and you might actually develop a stronger interest for it. Then, if it turns out you hate it, at least you didn't waste 4 years and $30,000 getting a degree you hate.",

You talk to someone - explain the problem to them in a calm and relaxed way, tell them what you have been trying, and ask if they have any suggestions.

When learning, the expected outcome is always that you try something, that you experiment with, work with the theory covered in the course. Sometimes problems do require a sudden insight that you shouldn't be expected to get, but more often they actually just require you to apply the material from the latest class.\n\nMost importantly, don't sit alone with your docs and LLM machines - talk to actual people, maybe those you are studying with, maybe someone completely unrelated.",

Like, why did I get an engineering degree? I was tired of making $12 as a security guard. Why am I now in a second degree program for data science? Turns out I don't like factory work. Oddly enough, in relation to one part of your post, my intro to data structures course was the first time I actually enjoyed coding because I found machine learning to be really fun when I did that as extra credit on an assignment. \n\n\nI'm not here to be crude or rude to you. The reality is you're in the same situation as a lot of us, and even more difficult because of your location. My main suggestion is to find your \"why\" and grab onto it. A lot of self help books emphasize that as well. The fact that you actually enjoy coding puts you ahead of where I was for a long time lol. \n\n\nDon't give up. Keep learning, trying, honing your skills. I wish you the best. ",

It is usually the point where the material shifts from “fun building” into theory and you are juggling projects, deadlines and pressure at the same time. Forgetting things does not mean you are bad at this. It just means you learned them once and have not used them enough for them to stick. Backend work is a perfectly solid direction, and the fact that you enjoyed wiring APIs to databases is a good sign. You do not need to be great at front end to have a career. You also do not need to master data structures in one pass. Most people only internalize that stuff once they use it in real projects. If you keep going and make small practice projects at your own pace, the fog starts to clear. You are not behind, you are just early in the timeline and judging yourself too hard.",

College does not teach you mastery, only YOU can do that over time.\n\nThe best way to get good at software engineering is to build projects as others have suggested. You have a great base somewhere in your head :) to pull from. Start with something small and definitely do it full stack. If you focus on frontend only you will miss backend context. Same thing the other way around. To me, those two things go together.\n\nStart small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.\n\nStart small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, and the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.\n\nMake TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack.\n\nNow for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.\n\nDo this with every small project you work on. An address book, an small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from take TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skill you need to build any of these.\n\nAlso, I have been doing this for over 30+ years and I pretty much only know (often remember) basic syntax. Things I have done before are familiar, but I still need to look almost everything up.\n\nBest wishes. You can do this.",

Make a simple project on your own, like a to-do list. Break the problem into smaller pieces, and then if you can't figure out those smaller pieces, Google it. As you keep working on the project you'll gain more understanding of what to use and when to use it, and you'll rely less on Google for the simpler stuff. It's important you don't try to Google the solution to your larger problem, but instead a smaller chunk of it. Splitting work down to the smallest piece possible is the best way I found to learn.\n\n  \nIf you get your to-do list done, keep adding to it. Sure, it starts simple, but you can expand it to do way more than it did before. Try and find a project to create that you're passionate about, that passion will translate to motivation to learn and create. Keep working on it, don't go too hard on yourself, and try to avoid videos that tell you exactly how to do a project if you feel you're ready to move on yourself.\n\n  \nGoogle is a great resource for asking questions, becoming a confident developer is mostly about learning how to ask questions, and how to word the problem you are facing. Once you've done that, you can create anything really.",

At least for me it helps me to understand better.\n\nLike if you’re just starting to learn JavaScript, start with a bare naked project and get the script to say something. A simple hello world. Then build it up to be a simple, SIMPLE calculator. All just in the terminal, no ui. Then when you’re comfortable with JavaScript itself and getting things to pop up on the terminal, then you’re ready to start learning how to build a project from scratch.\n\nTake your script you made, and try and slap a React ui on top of it, moving your logic to the backend to get practice with full-stack development (if that’s a goal of yours). This is the important stepping away from the tutorial part. This is where you make a decision to NOT follow a tutorial and instead look at documentation and examples to understand what is going on in these, in this instance, React applications. Every engineer uses references. It’s okay to not know things. But the goal is to understand the process, not copying and pasting to create a finished product as fast as you can to feel impressive. I struggled with that part of the mental frame when I first started. \n\nOverall, just pick an IDE (vscode or IntelliJ community edition, whatever floats your boat), create a file, and start practicing. Don’t overthink the process. There is no fast path to learning, it’s at your own pace. Place the emphasis on understanding what you want to do and how to do it using best practices.",

Does this move give you more exposure in your company?\n\nOne the one hand, learning how to build a monitoring dashboard from scratch can be done on the side. You can learn this on your own. You will be able to choose what and how you learn this way.\n\nOn the other hand, to use AI for development you need to be pretty solid with your software development skills and debugging code you did not write yourself to use it effectively.

Are you asking if the win rate is too low to be fun, or are you asking if the program is behaving incorrectly?\n\nIt's straightforward to calculate the exact probability of each possible outcome of a spin, and thereby calculate the probability of a win. One way to do this is by brute force: there are 116^3 = 1560896 possible outcomes, all equally probable, and you can write a program to count them up *without* randomness.\n\nWith a little work, you can calculate the same win probability more efficiently, by avoiding repeatedly considering all the duplicate ways to get the same outcome.\n\nOf course, even if the probability of a win is 1/100, that doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly one win every 100 plays. The actual outcome is very likely to be higher or lower due to random variation. If you want to check your program for correct behavior, you can do a large number of runs (say, 10000) and then use an appropriate statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) to see where the observed number of wins falls, in comparison to the statistically likely range.\n\nI'm not a gambling expert, but I believe real slot machines don't *only* pay out if all of the symbols on a line match. They have additional lower-value payouts that are more frequent, designed to keep the player engaged and addicted in hopes of a jackpot.",

I found this an intriguing design requirement: \"It is important to make a machine that is perceived to present greater chances of payoff than it actually has within the legal limitations that games of chance must operate.\"",

Just treat it as gobbledygook that *has* to be written for a program to work.\n\nHowever, it's great that you are curious. The `main` method is what the Java runtime invokes when you run a Java program. It has the specific signature you described, and here are the reasons for the questions you asked about the method signature:\n\n1. All methods are supposed to either return a value, or indicate that they do NOT return a value using the keyword `void`. Java does not expect the `main` method to return a value, which is why we use the keyword `void`.\n\n2. `main(String[] args)`: This is just the name of the method that takes a string array as an argument. This does not directly result in any user input. The Java runtime receives the user input arguments from the OS, and then passes them into `main` when it invokes the `main` method.\n\n3. The method is marked public because it has to be invoked by the Java runtime. It needs to be accessible to the outside world, it wouldn't make sense for it to be private.\n\nHonestly, I don't know if any of this explanation would make sense to a beginner. When I was learning Java, I just accepted that these are lines that have to be there. It made sense only after I had learned a lot more about data types, arguments, return values, classes, etc.",

What's more, it can be a challenge to just dream up a project out of thin air.\n\nAdd to that, it's difficult when you're too young to know what your personal strengths are. That often takes time to develop. All you can do is experiment and explore until you discover the things that you find interesting and exciting. For me it was solving technical problems. It was like solving a puzzle for me, and I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment once I found the solution. It wasn't always easy, but it was rewarding.\n\nI'd recommend picking a language and focusing on it. Find tutorials and sample code. Study them and try to understand how they work. Then take the next step and create a project of your own. It doesn't have to be complicated or flashy. It might just be a simple console application that performs some utility function like a calculator.",

Don’t pick one camp and die on that hill.\n\nMonth 1 – structured learning (your colleague’s way)**  \nDo the boring “list of topics” thing first, but keep it short and focused.  \nOne good book/course on design patterns + clean architecture (Head First Design Patterns or the free Refactoring Guru site + YouTube).  \nOne proper Python refresher (Python Tricks or Fluent Python – just read and code the examples).  \nQuick deep-dive on Kafka, Airflow, Spark, Postgres, K8s, basic AWS (official docs + one solid free course each, 1–2 weeks max per topic).  \n\nDo the little exercises, rewrite them a week later, compare. This fills the holes fast and stops that “I only half-know this” feeling. You’ll feel way more confident in 30 days.\n\nMonth 2-3 – big project + mini projects (your original idea)**  \nNow pick ONE decent-sized project that forces you to use everything together (example: a data pipeline that pulls from Kafka → processes with Spark/Airflow → stores in Postgres → simple dashboard on AWS).\n  \nWhile building it, you’ll hit walls → go back and learn exactly what you need → apply it instantly. That’s when stuff actually sticks forever.\n\nDo 2–3 tiny weekend projects too (one pure Kafka producer/consumer, one Airflow-only DAG, one Spark job). They’re quick wins and prove to yourself you can finish things.\n\nI wasted years doing only projects and still felt like a fraud because I skipped the basics. Then I wasted months doing only courses and felt zero progress because nothing was connected. Doing structured learning first, then a real project second, was the combo that finally made me feel “yeah, I actually know my shit.”\n\nYou’ve got 3 months and zero other commitments — perfect window. Spend the first month closing the gaps with books/courses, then the next two building and shipping. You’ll come out the other side actually proud of what you know.\n\nYou got this. Start tomorrow with design patterns or Python, whichever scares you most. Hit me in a month and tell me how it’s going.",

For me, I have to understand the why in order to remember it. I was never good at reading a book and memorizing the material. I had to put my hands on it, break it, and fix it before I could commit it to memory. The benefit for me was once I understood it, I would never forget it, but it took longer for me to go through the cycle. \n\nI think it's always best to have a problem to solve. It doesn't have to be a difficult problem, but simply something that software can help with. Often times a tutorial will provide you with a basic framework that you can leverage to build on. \n\nMy programming journey started with simple projects in electronics, like solving resistor networks that required a target impedance and range of voltage offsets. I often implemented an iterative solver that started with a guesstimate and automatically adjusted itself until the solution was found. I learned a lot about iterative problem solving as well as learning the language.  Those programs became utilities that I would use from time to time.\n\nAnother project of mine was a Monte Carlo simulator to test various strategies for maintenance contracts. I learned a lot about Monte Carlo simulations, event queues, and the distribution of non-normal data. This was a much more ambitious project and never reached a production ready state, but still it was a useful means of analyzing my problem and learning to leverage features of the language I was working using (C++).\n\nWhatever you decide to do, you need to write code. Just stepping through a tutorial is unlikely to provide long-lasting knowledge (if you're like me). However, tutorials, videos, and course-work may be a great springboard inspiring you to solve other problems. Maybe you learn how to build a simple web application that uses a database and you decide to build your own budgeting application. Be curious and be inspired.\n\nKeep a directory of all your artifacts so you can use them as reference material - a grep utility is good way to find them for future reference.",

Then learn the basics of that language up until OOP (classes and objects) then use a game library to start building applications or games. Like I use SDL to build games in C++ but for someone who knows absolutely nothing I think C# or python is the best option particularly because of their relative simplicity python in particular being really easy. Now to learn you really don't need any fancy courses just some random tutorial on YouTube and trust me you will almost never use most of the 'advanced' stuff they teach you. The fun part is actually using the game library (or engine) so once you get to that you will get addicted (hopefully). If you didn't understand anything just ask me.",

Here is a way to learn more deeply in the small projects you work on to get more out of them:\n\nStart small and keep it simple. Let the project guide what you need to learn next. I almost always suggest the often dismissed TODO exercise to start with since you already have some base knowledge.\n\nStart small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.\n\nMake TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. EDIT: fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.\n\nNow for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.\n\nDo this with every small project you work on. An address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.",

Everyone feels imposter syndrome, even the person who seems to breeze through everything. It’s your brain trying to protect you from failure, but it’s lying to you about your capabilities.

Add facets (module, package, abstract/interface, annotation, sealed) and a size cutoff.\n- Visualize: precompute layout with sfdp or OpenOrd, render in Cytoscape.js or Sigma.js, and wire a fuzzy search index (Lucene/Elasticsearch) that highlights paths between two nodes. Click-through to the Javadoc.\n- Scale: store the graph in Neo4j so you can serve “subgraph by query” (e.g., everything that implements List within java.base).\nI’ve used Sourcegraph for code intel and Neo4j for subgraph queries; DreamFactory let me expose the graph as a quick REST API without hand-rolling a backend.\nIf you ship a filtered, searchable graph, folks will actually use it.",

If the job is likely to be boring indefinitely I find a new job\n\nTo address AI directly, I am deep in it with claude code. I am finding that the normal day to day stuff is pretty boring now. Adding an api to support some new feature, along with implementing the front end is pretty easy. Previously those tasks were like 15% planning, 70% coding and 15% QA. Now it is almost entirely QA. It is legit boring but requires a smart human to make sure it works as expected and the code is maintainable. Rarely does claude code one shot things. Although I still do feature development, I have been shifting to harder problems. Finding slow memory leaks, building dev tools to address some inefficiencies, analyzing and addressing performance issues, optimizing our horrendously slow CI, devop stuff, etc. I still use ai for these harder problems but it involves a lot more human coding and intervention. These things felt a bit overwhelming before but now feel doable.... and they are fun. Learning a lot going outside of my comfort zone",

        "body": "Former dev here who went the Scrum Master / RTE / Agile Coach route starting about 14 years ago.\n\n>How screwed am I for another job?\n\nMost of the jobs you'll be applying for are being spammed with AI generated resumes by offshore types throwing anything against the wall to see what will stick.  If you have a professional network / connections, they are your best resource for getting past all the noise created by AI resumes and all the tactics that HR / recruiting departments are using to thin them out.\n\nA friend at another company said they just fired an offshore guy who they later found out had 6 jobs at the same time.  That's what you're competing against, the noise of professional job applicants using every tool at their disposal.\n\n>Also, does anyone have experience applying for a TPM or manager position after being a software engineer? Thinking of pivoting.\n\nYou need to pivot in place at your next employer, rather than try to pivot between jobs.  It won't work, you have no experience in the role you're applying for.  My advice would be to try to be your next team's Scrum Master, if they don't have one.  Get the certs for that, get some experience, then look at pivoting again to Product Owner or TPM based on your preference.\n\nFYI these \\^\\^\\^ roles are getting even worse for cold applications because all the offshore that can't code (or get their cousin who can code to do the interview for them) get scrum / PM certs instead.  Every cert class I teach / attend has a disproportionate number of offshore attendees, most of whom couldn't create a dashboard in Jira to save their lives.\n\nNot to be irrationally negative about offshore but there's so much noise in the system right now that it's hard to match US workers to US jobs.  I can't even get callbacks on ITAR / DoD jobs that get relisted 2-3 times, and these people were throwing all the money at me 3 years ago.  The whole system is broken.  Rely on your network.\n\nEdit:  TPM, PO, Scrum Master, Agile Coach etc are all excellent places for former devs to go.  Moving to coaching was the best thing for my career, as most of your competition won't even be close to your technical skillset.  You need to like people more than the average dev does, and you'll need to learn how to navigate some of the politics.  I'm paid at a Sr Mgr / Director grade (Fortune 100 tech company you've heard of), have frequent access to organizational leaders, and am basically the wizard who has the data and the dev background to tell them where their orgs are running right and where they aren't.  Get a good leader or five who like you and know what you can do, and they'll take you everywhere they go.",

Who made those plans, and under what authority? Who decided that there should be a code freeze, and how on earth are people still changing code?\n\n>So the CEO and CTO have gotten frustrated with lack of progress and made an insane decision that the CTO will vibe code the frontend and backend alone.\n\nAnyway I can short them?\n\n>He does have the most business context and the original product was poorly written, but this has been worked on for two years and has a lot of custom config that will likely be overlooked in the rewrite and will cause tons of issues for existing customers.\n\nAnd who is calling the shots for the re-write?\n\n>My CEO was bragging about how our CTO stays up all night vibe coding and I later found out that they are not even reviewing their frontend code. He expects my team to maintain his code - literally said, “I don’t want to maintain that.” He said it appears to work because his endpoints work (who cares about user interaction). I feel like his failure to manage his team has led to him deciding that it is easier to do it himself than do his job.\n\nSeems fair. Does it matter?\n\nthere is only one question: Are you being paid well enough to endure this style of job?\n\n>This is insane right? Do I jump ship? How do I express how ruinous this is as a business decision when both the CEO and CTO are on board?\n\nYes.  \nSooner or later; eventually that decision will be made for you. See above.  \nYou don't. Not your circus, not your monkeys. It is unlikely that anyone will want to listen to you, let alone heed your advise. you have far more to lose here than win.",

Don't tell a hypothetical story, tell a story as if it happened to you even though you made it up before hand. Honestly it's easiest to take something that happened at work that you were maybe just kind of involved in and make yourself the main character.\n\nThe trick is that you shouldn't lie about your capabilities. If you lie in such a way that you imply you are proficient in some technology or methodology that you're not, it can really bite you in the ass. Though of course puffing yourself up a little is also expected.\n\nAnd the hiring managers and engineers you talk to all expect this. They know they can't actually verify the minute details of your employment (and this is why you don't lie about things that can be easily verified, such as degrees and job titles), they just want to see if you can effectively sell your capabilities.",

You can try to memorize something ahead of time, but then you'll likely be caught off guard when follow up questions are asked since even if it's your own story, narrating it in the moment feels no different than reciting a fairy tale.\n\nAlso this of course has no bearing on semantic memory, even if you cannot narrate the autobiographical details around an event doesn't mean you don't remember the event or its context. And since your job doesn't consist of narrating your life. about the only time it might impact you is during performance reviews when you might take a lot longer to piece together some narrative of what you worked on, but this is written anyway and you can reference artifacts.",

        "body": "It sounds like you're complaining about two separate things: 1) you don't like or understand STAR, 2) you have trouble remembering relevant past experiences on the spot when asked.\n\nFor number 1, as others have mentioned, STAR is less a template you're expected to fit into (although I have seen rubrics that break down the same way) and more a communication tool as others have said. It just makes it easier to break a story down into the exposition (S and T), what you did (the A), and why it mattered (the R). Kind of like how most movies or books have a beginning, middle, and end.\n\nNumber 2 is tough and that's where the studying for behavioral interviews comes from. Whenever I've gone interviewing, I've sat down and written out a Google doc outline where I try to think of all the experiences I've had that would be good in these interviews. This should include projects that meet any of these criteria:\n- you're proud of it / designed and implemented the whole thing even if it's small \n- it involved mentoring a junior\n- it required you to make a big design doc and/or plan and delegate tasks across a team you're leading\n- something went wrong along the way but you either successfully navigated around it or you minimized damage / got something useful out of the failure\n- you disagreed with somebody but you either convinced them or compromised and the project moved forward\n- you had to convince someone of something in order to proceed\n\nEtc - basically aside from stuff you're just proud of or where you led or mentored one or more people, the more uncomfortable the situation was, the better. Depending on how senior you're going for, it's ok if you don't have as much on the leadership or cross team stuff, but anything that remotely fits that bill goes in.\n\nThe ideal candidate didn't actively make good contributions to an important project that successfully launched. They also had to convince two other teams who hated the idea at first, and they planned and led a team of people to get it done, and then when critical partner team x got canned halfway through they found a way to work with teams y and z to ship the project, all while some person on team y was critical of the project and trying to hamstring it the whole time until candidate met with them and got them on board with it. (to be clear this is the hyperbolic sum of all the things you try to fit into this interview and not realistically in a single story from any candidate)\n\nLast time I interviewed (last year), once I wrote this doc, I actually found ChatGPT really useful to help me digest it and fit the stories into the framework of these interviews (to be extremely clear: as a study aid leading up to interviews, not as a live tool during the interview). I literally copied and pasted / imported the whole doc and told it \"I'm interviewing for role x at level y with company z. Give me a bunch of example behavioral interview questions with answers drawn from my experiences that fit into the STAR framework.\"\n\nIt was beautiful. The response ended up being a really helpful study guide to pick my best stories for questions like \"tell me about a time you had a disagreement with someone\" and how to break the story down and communicate it. Make sure you have two or three stories for any one question, since you probably have stories that are relevant to more than one question (it's ok to occasionally answer with \"story x from a minute ago fits that bill because of x, y, and z\" but you don't want to do that too much).\n\nRead back over your doc and the ChatGPT convo for a while every day and iterate a bit more with ChatGPT about it so you can internalize everything. With a week or two of this type of study, you'll be way more confident. The hardest part is just remembering all your work experiences in detail and writing the initial doc.",

Sometime you have to update a button on an app and it takes you a hour and then there’s nothing else to do for the day. Other times that button takes you multiple days to figure out.

Lately a lot of companies avoid senior people because they don’t want to pay higher salaries, so candidates with 2–3 YOE sometimes get more callbacks than someone with 10+.\n\nThere was a dev (post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/)) with around your level of experience who couldn’t get a job for months. He pulled hundreds of companies from Google Maps, emailed his resume to all of them, and ended up getting a couple mid-size projects that way. If normal applications aren’t working, trying something unconventional like that actually helps.\n\nAlso make sure your resume is ATS-friendly and keyword-optimized. It really makes a difference. Someone recently shared an AI resume-tailor prompt here and using something like that boosts your visibility a lot in recruiter searches.",

There's also the distinct possibility that many tools/companies will fail/enshittify, and waiting to pick the winning/remaining tooling is generally a smart decision.\n\nAdditionally, many (probably most) senior devs have been an early adopter of some piece of tech and had it fail, often catastrophically.

It often feels like, I can do the job, I want the job, don't block me for nonsense. On the flip side, it's a very low bar for job seekers to do a Spring Boot tutorial and just claim they have expertise and/or can pick it up after they start the job. And some hiring managers, when they are paying for talent, they rightfully want more than just hot air.\n\nAnother point: Spring Boot is great, especially the new 4.0 release, but the other big Java platforms are great too. Jakarta 10/11, Helidon, and Quarkus are all great options too. And team leads, can't just let every dev switch to whatever tech stack they want. Often if a product is using something, the team needs everyone using the same stack.\n\nLastly: the software job market is hard. Jobs are there. People are getting hired. But it's very competitive. If a recruiter has a thousand applicants for a single job opening, they can only hire once, and then they have to reject the other 999 applicants, which means their job offer process must be extremely selective. And that might upset the 999 candidates who don't get the offer, but what else is the recruiter supposed to do? Bottom line: expect a lot competition, a lot of rejection, cast a wide net, see what's out there, and get the best offer you reasonably can get.",

My coding speed grew by 3x to 5x in my first 3 years on the job, as did my ability to learn and comprehend repos with 2000 to 10,000 lines of code.\n\nI want to emphasize this. I was a super star in the classroom but when I hit the real job, I was a total beginner. The first day, my manager yelled at me to stop committing every 30 minutes since each commit took 40 minutes to build, run unit tests and deploy to DEV and blocked everyone's else changes from going through. I didn't know, there was no training. Better integration was to have the build run automatically once an hour that picks up all the changes.\n\nI had never seen so much shittily written and undocumented code and the project was already 6 months late. Sometimes I write code that could have been cleaner but you won't able to do everything you want if you don't marry your job. Some people do. I say don't.",

These are large companies, and if you look at startups in DIFC or Hub71, there are a handful of companies hiring interns as well, although the pay may be low or unpaid\n\nWhat projects did you work on during the last two years? This matters. Ask yourself whether you worked on interesting projects, did you learn some tech on your own and whether you can see yourself doing that kind of work full time. If not, maybe computer science is not the right fit\n\nDo not consider only swe roles, data analyst, data science, AI engineer, data engineer, tech consulting, and product manager positions are all paths you can explore\n\nLC does not matter as much in the UAE. Startups care more about your backend, frontend, systems skills than your lc grind (only companies ik who are crazy about lc are dytedanxe, noon, talabat). i could be wrong here\n\nThe market is tough for CS majors everywhere. If you are not interested in the work or feel you lack the necessary skills, switching fields could be an option (i only say this as you claim you didn’t learn much in uni, but it’s been 2 years since graduation and you could self learn more industry skills)",

I've talked to a bunch of recruiters out there and they all say the same thing - companies want people with 3-5 years minimum because they're competing globally for talent and can afford to be picky. It's not you, it's legitimately the market structure there.\n\nThe masters pivot might not be the worst idea but... business degrees after CS can be weird. You'll be competing with people who did business undergrad and have that foundation already. Plus you'd be starting over in a new field while still carrying student debt (assuming you're not getting it funded). Have you thought about maybe doing a technical masters instead? Something like data science or specialized AI programs? At least then you're building on what you already know instead of completely starting fresh.\n\nOne thing - that gap on your resume isn't as bad as you think. I see people come back from 2-3 year breaks all the time. The story matters more than the gap itself. \"I graduated into a terrible market and kept grinding while exploring options\" is way better than most explanations i hear. Also those unpaid internships you're applying to? Skip them. They know you're desperate and will treat you accordingly. Focus on contract work, freelance projects, or even contributing to open source stuff. At least then you're building real portfolio pieces instead of fetching coffee for free.",

Nobody wants to work hard for a rude, ignorant asshole.\n\nIf your leadership lays people off, fires people randomly, overloads people in a cynical way, encourages dark patterns in your code, doesn’t care about quality, doesn’t care about finding the right work for each individual, chronically understaffs teams, etc. - you will be far more prone to burnout, even if your workload isn’t that bad.",

When other teams give you work, give it a priority level with regards to existing work. Whenever you add work to your current sprint, take an equivalent amount of work out.\n\n\nIt's common for people, especially tech leads, to feel like they need to handle something themselves because they read the message first. Sometimes the senior devs are swamped, but the juniors don't have enough work. Seniors should help refine and break down tasks so that a junior can handle them, and juniors should show initiative by taking on unfamiliar tasks and trying to learn while doing.\n\n\nAt least in my company, if you are up at 3am fixing an issue no one expects you to be at a 9am meeting. Not to mention that if someone on my team was up at 3am, we'd make it a high priority to make sure it never happens again.\n\n\nFeeling peessure to constantly improve is natural when you're a junior and want to get promoted, but yeah it turns toxic when stack ranking is involved and you know that someone around you will get a PIP.\n\n\nWhen it becomes too much, you need to tell your manager your concerns during a regularly scheduled 1:1.

FAANG is probably one of the best places for someone like you, because they index on general problem-solving skills and less on selling yourself (ehhh, with the exception being Amazon and its leadership principles) or passing stack or language-specific quizzes.\n\nI was actually in kind of the same scenario. The company was Google, so it had CV weight, but between all the internal systems, configs, and getting passed around to different projects, I hit a point where I felt like I didn’t even know how to program. Ended up taking a year off and when I started again I got a lot of interviews but blew most of them because I had such a hard time communicating and selling myself on that kind of extremely specific, internal work. It was super frustrating. One of the few offers I got was from Meta, and now I’m doing ML infra work and feel like I’m starting to level up on those skills. \n\nOne of the biggest things for me has been working on personal projects just for fun, and it’s made me so much better as an engineer. The natural progression of those projects basically forces me into more modern stacks and approaches. Like I had this idea to do network analysis on Twitter hate groups, and suddenly I’m deep into TLS fingerprinting, optimizing hundreds of concurrent workers without hitting Postgres deadlocks, building a double-buffer architecture, messing with text classification, yada yada.

Networking means you'll try to find jobs that aren't advertised; but I am not sure how much of a dent that can make. What does your current employer have to say about transitioning you to full time?

If anything at all, you should work on a process that makes you find all these jobs within the first 5 or 2 days.\n\nYou cannot change the market; you cannot change how hiring works. You can adjust your own processes to make the most of the given circumstances, and see that the work you put into it has the highest ROI that's possible for you to achieve.\n\n>What are the best resources for finding real job postings from companies that are genuinely looking to hire? Any advice would help.\n\nNot from the US, but when I am looking for work, I see which job boards have good results for what I have to offer, I scan those regularly ,and apply quickly. If that ends up in too few results, I'll have to start looking at places where the good matches are less dense. (Assuming that I am happy with my CV, my application process, etc. Those I can change, I cannot change who posts how many jobs where.)",

I have a good friend who has his masters and teaches regular and advanced history / social studies for highschool students, and he's had some uncomfortable insights about AI\n\n\nFor the first time since we've really been recording this information, my friend has been seeing an inverse bell curve; meaning the average score is no longer in the middle ~70%, there are two polar opposites: students that care and are trying, scoring 90%+ and those who just don't give a shit at all. So to give the younger generation some credit, there is a big group of students that see what tik tok and AI are doing to their attention span and are determined to succeed in spite of that. But there just as big of a cohort that are straight up turning off their critical thinking and letting AI take the wheel.\n\n\nBecause critical thinking, making decisions really is the skill AI threatens to take away the most. Most of these failing students just refuse to put in any effort that requires them to think beyond a surface level.\n\n\nSo to reiterate, this is genuinely new. This is different. Previous technologies like the Internet certainly changed education, but a huge emphasis was placed on digging beyond surface level Wikipedia details. Today AI can (appear to anyway) do that digging beyond for you in a few prompts, and the skill to research and analyze information just gets thrown away by a startling number of people ",

From what I heard for Google was that they have all engineers do their own QA.\n\nI personally think it’s a conflict of interest to consolidate the roles and it’s a bit burdensome, but QA sometimes felt like an afterthought to these higher up chains… so I would stick to dev if you have the choice.",

        "body": "Current SWE (SRE), former Support Engineer.\n\nIn my experience, Support Engineers are great in theory but in practice the number of truly good Support Engineers is very low.\n\nThe common anti-pattern with Support is 1. customer complains about something via chat/email > 2. support person copy and pastes customers problem into a dev ticket > 3. now dev has yet another ticket thats probably vague and not actionable out of the box > 4. dev asks support person questions which they relay back and forth to customer until resolution. I call this the **”Carrier Pigeon model of Support” (tm)** and it’s terrible - customers are left thinking “why am i talking to this support person instead of the dev” and devs are left thinking “why is this person making my job harder”. It’s inefficient (latency due to relay) and ultimately makes everyone frustrated. \n\nNot falling into this antipattern is hard - customers will pester you (because they want cases solved faster), sales people will pester you (because they want their customer happy), and product/dev people will ignore you (because you’re bothering them and they have More Important Things (tm) to do). What a good Support Engineers does is equal parts social engineering (how do I get this person to help me when it’s not necessarily in their interest) and technical skill (troubleshooting whatever problem the customer has). \n\nGenerally, I see the following in good Support Engineers:\n\n- They learn how to ask good questions - good questions are asked to the right person, in the right way, with the right information in such a way that *makes it as easy as is possible for the answerer to give a response*. Good Support Engineers ask for help from devs in a way that makes it easy to help them.\n- They manage expectations effectively - sometimes the customer should not be expecting an “urgent fix” for something that is at best a P2 feature request. Good Support Engineers set proper expectations with customers and only let customer urgency bleed onto Devs when its’s warranted.\n- They are self sufficient and proactive - good Support Engineers leverage resources, the access they have, and their troubleshooting skills to get information. They don’t bother devs about every single question. Thats not to say they never bother devs, but they try to dig up information on their own. Ditto on the proactive - a resource doesnt exist for some issue? They create it. Some issue is happening x times with a common pattern and the org is getting y support cases? They start a thread and start investigating root cause.\n\nGreat Support Engineers are considerate, thoughtful, and aggressively helpful.",

        "body": "I’m just a SWE 1, but I like to think I have a healthy relationship with AI coding right now. I use it for work daily, but I originally learned and got to where I am without AI.\n\nI mentor for lots of college hackathons and I see so many students like you, who are completely reliant on AI to code, and fail spectacularly. It is an **insane power move** (HAHA) when I pull up to a mentee, immediately close ChatGPT or ask them “how do you close cursor?”, skip over all the Google AI overview when I google stuff, and debug their thing “raw” old school and fix it either in 1 glance or in half the time they’ve been stuck in an LLM prompting circle.\n\nMy advice? Learn without AI. AI is a force multiplier imo, it turns say a level 1 engineer into a level 2, and a level 10 into a level 20. The moment you let things go, you stop leveling up. There is a significant difference in quality and speed between “code me an api for an app” vs “implement an API with these exact 5 routes, implementation steps, pagination, specific auth middleware, database, other layers, and other architectural and security concerns/requirements.”\n\nTLDR: better you are, the more effective it will be.\n\n“Learning without ai??? That’s impossible.”\n\nYeah yeah, I hear you. You want to be spoon fed everything relevant now. You want it fast and customized. You’ll be better reading and learning without AI, but yeah yeah, it will take longer. Remember that programming is supposed to engage your brain. But if you really want to learn with AI, which I totally get the temptation, here’s what I’ve been advising my mentees at least.\n\nIt about aligns with how I learned without AI, but adapted to this new day and age:\n\n## Use AI as a guide, not as your driver.\n\n> in the past, I learned through documentation and stack overflow. I would try copy and pasting code, but it would rarely work without me understanding how it works and modifying it to work with my code.\n\n1. Let the AI guide you, not drive for you. Get off cursor or whatever. Do not auto approve changes. Review everything it proposes. Stop copy pasting ChatGPT code. Instead, read each line it proposes, understand what it does and why it does what it does. Never ever put the code in until you know what each line does. Research the documentation, the patterns, everything OUTSIDE of asking an LLM. Too many times, I’ve been burned by incredibly convincing hallucinations I blindly trust.\n\n**My company gives me Claude 4.5. I have coded with Gemini 3 in my spare time. Even then, a near top-of-the-line coding LLM isn’t perfect enough to fully vibe-trust for work and for mildly complex projects.**\n\n## Ask AI to cite its sources or give it the sources.\n\n> I learned everything by reading documentation\n\n2. If you ever let an LLM drive (rather, think) for you, ask it for QUOTED sources and links, OR plug in the relevant documentation yourself and then ask for direct quotes that inform its implementation. Then, go back and read that relevant section yourself. Only then, can you hit yes on the code. You’ll learn something, at least, while keeping some momentum and enhancing accuracy. Still—better to learn yourself and feed it what it needs rather than trust it.\n\n## Debug without an LLM\n\n> Debugging and making effective hypothesis and knowing how to test them is the best skill I’ve learned, and it’s helped me both with and without AI. Trial and error have helped build my intuition and propose ideas on why things aren’t working, and that’s built on a solid debugging strategy, tons of experience, and exploration. \n\n3. Learn effective debugging skills. I’ve had so many situations where students debug via LLM by saying “it doesn’t work, fix it” or “it’s not smooth, fix it”. Instead, when you tell it “I identify a race condition, I’d like to refactor the code by XYZ” the LLM works actually pretty well. But to figure this out, you gotta know how to debug outside of an LLM. Sometimes, it may involve a big or novel switch in approach that an AI in its little rabbit hole cannot suggest. Also, being a code detective is the best part of programming imo, why would you offload the best part to an AI?\n\nTLDR: don’t turn off your brain and don’t trust anything the LLM says. Pretend it’s a con artist or scammer and double check everything yourself OUTSIDE of the LLM “scammer ring” scheme.",

Of the many questions I ask, I like to ask engineering managers / directors: \"What was the hardest conversation you've ever had with a stakeholder\". \n\nWhat I'm listening for in the manager's/director's response is:\n\n1. Have they ever told a stakeholder \"no\" or \"[yes, and](https://galenemanuele.com/blog/power-of-yes-and)\" (which is really just fancy \"no\"). Unless they've been in leadership like ... 2-3 years ... an answer of \"huh, nothing comes to mind\" is a red flag for me. My read on that is they're very likely avoiding difficult conversations to the detriment of their team, because leadership is almost never sunshine and butterflies for everyone. Business is hard.\n2. What inputs lead to that difficult conversation? The team? A Jira board? An existential threat? Customer feedback? Data? Hopefully something more tangible than intuition alone.\n3. How did they tailor the conversation to this specific stakeholder's behaviors, values, and goals?\n\nAnd I often ask clarifying questions, or for them to elaborate, if I don't get 1, 2, and 3 covered in their initial response. Covering all 3 in the initial response is a big old green flag for me. I need to work with leaders who know how to \"go to bat\" for their people and advocate for what they believe is best for the business -- maybe that isn't as important to you. A big, big part of having a healthy engineering practice is telling important people \"no\" sometimes, even if they might fire you or advocate for your firing because you said \"no\". But they probably won't fire me, because I've already established through a different line of questioning that this leader values [psychological safety](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-72-personal-user-manuals/).",

The project was obviously just a training exercise and clearly was not going to be useed in their actual code base. If it was something that looked like it was actually going to be used, I probably wouldn't have done it. The job itself was fine.\n\nI think the red flags to watch out for are:\n\nis the unpaid project kind of generic? Or is it incredibly specific and seems like it is new functionallity for an existing app?\n\nIf the project they are asking for is very generic, IE: heres a user login and password, create a page to authenticate to our app services then build a page to accept a userID and submit it to retrieve user details and display it tto the screen and allow someone to edit. Thats fine with me. Its just shhowing I understand how auth / REST works and that I can build a web app that communicates with a backend.\n\nIf instead they ask me to create a hyper specific page that requires multiple rest calls and data analysis maybe with business logic, thats when the red line is crossed IMO. To get an idea if you can do the job shouldnt require you to understand their business logic when coding, that stuff should be taught on the job. In the interview rounds the project assigned needs to be generic and just demonstrating you have the skills you say you do.",

There are so many devs that yearn for a long stretch of time to just \"go build\" and be left alone to get it done, but I straight up loathe it.

I want to talk to people, I want to fix problems for people, I don't want it to take weeks or more, and I can't stand the forced overtime/on-call crap that is \"just normal\" for these jobs\n\nIt's subjectively awful. I spent 6 years on a CS degree, 10 years in engineering, I'm great at getting quality work done and I can bring creativity when it's time to come up with a new solution or solve a problem - but the moment I'm required to work on something big that takes more than a week and doesn't require conversations with others, I generally hit a burnout vicious cycle and it all falls apart\n\nAdd in the insanity that we're seeing with AI being used to judge the effectiveness of development, along with major companies \"leading the way\" into a digital wood chipper of approximate solutions and interviews that range from 4 to 10 rounds of incresingly dehumanizing bullshit from 40-hour takehomes to literal video recordings to prove you're not coding with AI when your whole job is fully reliant on the speed AI provides you, and maaaan... I got into this industry to help people, what the fuck happened. I worked tech support and tutored through college and thought that somehow, that level of direct support to others and mentoring would be something I could continue to do at future roles and throughout my career - and I did to some extent, despite the fact that I had to force it, and only in hindsight am I actually seeing that I had to force it\n\nI'm starting to understand that the general role of a dev is to quietly crank out text for a computer that does the same thing all of their employer's competitors are doing but microscopically differently - and maybe just a little too late, I'm realizing it's just not good for me. I wish I'd known that before I committed to 15 years of it, back when I still qualified for student aid and could still pursue psychology or education, but worst case the trades are hiring, and being an electrician is a damn good worst case for me\n\nMight still have to code for a while, depending on how the current interviews I'm going through work out, but if I somehow score a support role I'm never writing code for someone else's vision again. Maybe I can finally find the energy to build all the cool shit I've put off for so long while trying to minimize feature burnout for my employer",

Some of the technical infrastructure at big banks and major retailers is almost completely run by these people.\n\nMy theory is that it's much more efficient for these \"main\" companies to hire a core staff and management, then farm out the entry level tech work to these consultancies, than it is for them to hire entry level talent directly. The cost of acquisition and retainment is high and entry level tech work is often not that unique or specialized anymore, so they'd rather leave that headache to the consulting agencies.",

There are obviously some languages that are different, but logic and optimizations/algorithms will always be somewhat consistent. \n\nYou're also noting one reason why people go into management or leave the field. They get sick of having to keep learning things. \n\nI've had interviews with people where we discussed AI, and some people have a nuanced opinion on it. Not everyone thinks it will take over the world. And not everyone thinks it's garbage. There are people trying to understand how it can improve their jobs/careers. \n\nOne thing you have to realize is no one can predict the future, and no one knows things for sure.

However, it is going to remain in some form as a tool for handling large volume communications; it does acceptably at auto-responding to messages, though it still needs considerable supervision for anything. So it's good to have *some* familiarity with using it. But in my opinion you'll still do best learning the basics and doing most things manually, maybe querying the AI for quick summaries of a topic so you can find relevant search terms for further, non-AI study.\n\n\nThis field is pretty volatile while you're getting started, so make sure you have some full-time work to pay your bills when you first begin your jobseeking.",

The FAANG had the best pay and benefits but I got laid off. I enjoyed my time there as I got to work with smart people that taught me a lot. The con being it was an impact culture that always kept you pushing (Meta). The SP500 Im at now is a great WLB that pays about 20-25% less than the FAANG role.

The metacognition part is the most problematic part because no LLM model is able to accurately identify when it genuinely doesn’t know something. The output layers only give probabilities for the next token, but those probabilities don’t mean anything real about the outside world.

This cut my anxiety with dealing with these people quite a bit.\n\nHonestly, a lot of this is just learned with experience. But your anxiety probably isn’t doing you favors. It’s probably making you less likely to push projects forward for risk of offending or possibly being afraid to ask for direction.",

It's a really fun city to spend your 20s in. Not sure what your goals are in austin but it is one of those cities that people seem to grow out of after a few years here. When i got here everybody i knew that had been here for 3+ years talks about leaving. I was always like \"why it's so fun\" and theyd just be like \"give it a few years\". Now i started my 4th year here and i can see why. It's really fun but it's also really young and once you outgrow the bar scenes it makes you want to just find something new.",

I told him my 10+ years of experience as a java developer should assure anyone I could become productive in spring boot very quickly but he didn't care.\n\nSo there is no point in learning anything on your own. Focus on the things you have used at previous jobs.",

Many data careers want a masters in maths for example so your bootcamp just isn’t going to be competitive give how many relevant degree holders are going to be in the pool of candidates. It’s not really a career where someone that isn’t passionate about it, will do well because it is so highly saturated. The bubble has popped in that sense. \n\nIf you do want to do some courses I’d recommend things like AWS certified courses or Microsoft certifications. Not free but might help you leverage some credibility. But the gold standard would be getting any role and leveraging data in that role as a stepping stone to a better job.",

Managers, good or bad, have a strong preference for self-reliant employees. Try to learn what you can at work, but mostly a lot of gaps will have to be filled in on your own. Your seniors are busy trying to drive business value and manage expectations with leaderships. Mid-level engineers might have more time to mentor you but they are not motivated to.\n\n> On top of that, I’m assigned high-priority tasks with a lot of ownership, but I drop the ball or I am given no guidance. I’ve felt completely in the dark and left to fend for myself. Feeling extremely disappointed because I am older than the usual junior because I switched careers.\n> \n\nYou've got to make sure you nail down requirements and get the answers you need before you start coding. After coding, make sure you do QA, and have confidence in your happy path tests and edge cases. If you're working on a difficult task, then improve your communication and manage up for your PM and manager. Prioritize tasks that unblock other engineers so they trust you and don't blame you for delays.\n\n> How do I up-skill effectively, perform better in my current role, and prepare to transition to a healthier company?\n\nIt's as simple and hard as starting now, practicing consistently, and documenting your accomplishments so you can talk about what you've done and can do.

You will take the tasks on no matter the challenge and complete. Show your eagerness to learn. They do t owe you anything.

Many dream of the ability to have enterprise level experience in tech. That gets your foot in the door much easier than no experience. I sure as hell would’ve loved that on my resume when was interviewing with no CS degree(Jazz studies degree), and no enterprise level experience. I had to learn how to sell myself well….\n\nIf you want it that bad nobody will do it for you. Boomers say “When the going gets tough, the tough get going.” Not validating, but cold hard truth.

The true removal or decreasing of jobs come from that of purely offshoring, using 3rd party companies over seas, using Indian Consultancies, LATAM consultancies, European Consultancies, Filipino Consultancies to expedite job creation else where to then cut jobs on the shores of the USA.

Again, some don’t have exposure. \n\nBut a lot depends on what you know going into this. \n\nI’d be curious about context. What additional interview steps are there? How much time are you being given?\n\nAlso, don’t go in with the mindset if the interviews doesn’t work out, it was a waste of time. Think of it as a way of learning some new things. You might want to dig deeper on your own, and these could become talking points during future interviews. \n\nA lot will also depend on the people doing the evaluations. Some people want to understand how you think. Others just want to nitpick. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that some companies also use a project like this as a personality test. Did you go the extra mile? Did you make interesting, thoughtful decisions? \n\nThere’s not a perfect answer, but I assume you’ll get a decent amount of people on this sub complaining.  ",

Since you have DS experience you can absolutely get a job in Cali, but it would not be because of your penn degree. \n\nAlso yeah it is true that a lot of the courses will probably have overlap with your undergrad, and look at [mymcit.org](http://mymcit.org) and look at the DS reviews - they aren't great. If I were to go back, I would have applied to a West Coast school as I want to move to Cali too. This would be the optimal choice, but hey completing the MSE-DS is still going to move you forward and is not a bad decision, but just that there may be a better decision for the 3 years that you would put into completing the degree.\n\nMy humble opinion: apply to an MSCS instead. Your DS undergrad combined with CS masters will make you unstoppable. It does not have to be brand name either. For example, SJSU is heavily recruited by big tech companies. So I would apply to all brand-name and non-brand name schools on west coast and see where you get in. After all, tech is not *as* elitist(unless you get into berkeley/stanford which will give you a massive advantage) as top finance/consulting. So, being on the west coast even at an average school will give you a higher chance of being hired in Cali than MSE-DS.",
