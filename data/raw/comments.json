Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.\n\nWhat stayed the same (unfortunately):\n- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.\n- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.\n- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.\n\nWhat's genuinely better:\n- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.\n- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.\n- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.\n\nThe 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work. But the semantic layer and data modeling parts got more complex, not less. Different work, roughly same headcount.",

Still ml models are scary and we don't hire people who know how to do it so they all end up half arsed. No Python server as we are big into sas although some teams use r to make models. We now have ai which isn't so bad for data as you can't just write stuff as the data is a bit unknown to the AI so it can only build small functions but they are always super complicated and anyone that wants to reuse it has to try really hard to understand the over complexity of a simple task.",

The data engineer gets the heat when the products of their automation designs don't meet expectations, and the QA inquiry too often reveals problems with the data itself, including missing values, data entry errors, mismatched or approximated semantics when bringing together variously sourced data, accuracy and precision problems, deliberate and accidental bias, agenda selectivity, etc.  AI is built on big data infrastructure, so its good that we have this professional layer to review our supply chains as we procede to the next generation of decision support.",

Have you considered having an “intermediate” type table materialization? We have several large models that have to be broken up into intermediate steps because they would either overload memory, or perform poorly due to CTE’s that are called multiple times, which we can instead just process them once in a separate model. What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes. I know you have ephemeral and view materializations, but none of those solve the problem of having too much stuff happening in the final query that uses them. Thanks again!",

So if you take this path, assume you're going to be very focused on data-engineering-applied-to-AI.\n\nNow, given the actual pace at which human institutions move, I am convinced that even if foundation models get _quite a lot better_ it will take five years to reorient a bunch of legacy businesses around the new technology.

A few years ago, my job was heavily DE and DA and now it also involves building infrastructure and test suite, which are the jobs of SRE and SDET. Its much easier to build pipelines and dashboards these days. It means more people from other tech areas transition to DE, increasing the competition. For people in the industries, as long as you're expanding your skill sets, it's OK. For someone new, it'll hard to break into, because you might even be competing with SWE, SDET etc who lost their jobs and tried to transition to DE for example. \n\n\nIf you wanna get into tech, be prepared to learn everything from every areas.

Are you just writing one off queries on raw data to populate them? In my experience ad hoc reports are a symptom of a lack of good models (and pipelines that build those models) going into your BI tools.

I LOVE it when someone requests a spreadsheet because it’s an opportunity for me to ask them “out of curiosity” what are they doing with the spreadsheet - then you almost always get given an opportunity to solve a problem that they didn’t even know existed, this can make people very happy and that’s the most satisfying part of this job, I find.\n\nMaybe I’ve got the completely wrong take here but it sounds like the company hasn’t been exposed to a modern data stack before and are doing things the old way, if you’ve already shown them how it could be better (time optimisation, data reliability, and undiscovered insights being the selling points that execs hear) - then fair enough leave - if you haven’t you’re sitting on a golden opportunity, cause it sounds like you’re the only authority.

You just might be surprised how much faster you can go, after practicing on harder problems, and getting better at pattern recognition. \n\nBesides DataLemur, I think having a proper project to talk about is also super important for Data Engineering interviews. Hopefully, this can be sourced from a past internship – but if not, go make a real portfolio project that's end-to-end, deployed (with a live link), that's also key-word rich (so use AWS, PostgreSQL, Airflow, Python, etc.).

We might define a relationship that says \"A sibling is defined as someone who shares the same parents.\" The ontology can then (given enough input data) infer these additional relationships logically, even though they've not been expressly provided by the data.",

If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.\n\nThe return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.\n\nThe real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.\n\nWorth having a direct conversation about it. Ask what specific concern drives the no dependencies stance. Sometimes it's a bad experience with a package breaking, which is valid but solvable with pinned versions and testing.",

I had nobody telling me no, I just communicated to IT what I was doing and got their blessing in email to cover my ass.\n\nAside from that, I think I was also pretty strict about choosing libraries.  I try to stick to stuff that's in the Anaconda suite since it seems to get a buttload of community and support.\n\nIf a vendor has their own libraries that they actively maintain, I'll use those.  \n\nIf it's a real niche thing by some dude and I can't find a way to feel good about it, hell no.  I've never had anything bad happen, but it only takes one time.  \n\nI don't think my situation is a very good comparison.  Nobody was really supporting me or looking at my work.  I just packaged code where I could reference a config file like a control table.  Send queries, save them as flat files, do the things like package them into this or that or upload them here or there.\n\nI was never given the greenlight for an actual database, but it got us by in the interim as we grew.  \n\nAgain, my situation was very specific with weird constraints.\n\nIf your senior dev dude is having you basically write your own stuff instead of using a library, take that is a chance to reverse engineer a process that many might take for granted.  A few years from now you'll be that much more versed in things I guess?  \n\nLike, I had nobody to review my code.  If anyone had to go back and look at it, it was me.

If you’ve internalized those shapes, most questions are just variations.\n\nAlso practice explaining your thinking out loud while you write.

        "body": "Since you (and a couple others) seem to be more or less asking for some structure to learn against, here's what I use or have used in my day-to-day.\n\n- How to install docker, and the follow-ups needed, on your Distro/OS. Windows/Mac are pretty straight-forward. Linux has some steps after install that you need to do.\n\n- Get used to navigating dockerhub, finding official image builds, and how to pull specific versions. Much like Python version pinning, you _certainly_ want to pin versions of infra.\n\n- Read the docs on the most important docker cli commands. Non-exhaustive: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker pull`, `docker exec`, `docker container cp`.\n\n- Learn and practice making [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). Learn the subtle differences between `ADD` and `COPY`. How Layering works. Learn the differences between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`, `ARG` and `ENV`. Learn how to expose a port on a container to the host. HINT: it isn't with the `EXPOSE` instruction and if you made it this far without being able to ping your container from your host you should go back one step ;) . Make a `.dockerignore` so you don't put anything you don't want in the container. You can ignore these instructions for now: `HEALTHCHECK`, `LABEL`, `MAINTAINER`, `ONBUILD`, `SHELL`, `STOPSIGNAL`.\n\n- Learn how networking works for Docker. Networking generally is a weak point for most SWEs, and seems to often be doubly so for DEs. In the same vein, read the docs on how Docker Volumes work and how to attach them.\n\nNow, you came to the DE Subreddit to ask this and mention you have 2 YOE already, so I'm going to also mention a couple of more specific things.\n\n1. [Running Airflow in Docker](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html) is D E N S E but obfuscated heavily. As in, it has a lot of levers and knobs, but it mostly assumes the defaults are good enough for this. It also assumes you know docker-compose which I _did_ leave out of the top. The justification I'll give for that is that Docker Compose is great... but you should be using the dockerized airflow mentioned here as a TESTING system ONLY. Thus, get it going following thier instructions, do what you need to do, but don't assume it matches production-grade Airflow deployments.\n\n2. You could (and perhaps should) use [Astronomer's CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/overview). I don't work for them or anything, but I have used their managed service in the past. The fact that the CLI exists for free is great and should be taken advantage of for local testing.\n\n3. Now that you've seen those two and understand how docker works and have played with the ins and outs, contrary to what others may say, I would then _AND ONLY THEN_ look into Kubernetes. No matter the system, managed or self-hosted, Airflow and it's pipelines ALWAYS run on Kubernetes behind the scenes. The way you build the image for [Airflow will change](https://gist.github.com/wesh92/4ce0634e61949a1679e2ae5a1788cb18) and, thus, how you manage dependancies and the way you need to understand how Kubernetes sees Containers versus how you've seen them thus far at this point. I cannot stress this enough though, DO NOT jump straight to this point. Everything above here should be _weeks_ of testing, toiling, and troubleshooting at a minimum before you try to introduce K8s. When you do, start with a local manager like `k3s`. I would recommend not using `minikube` or `kind` as those are \"k8s in docker\" which is a whole extra layer you don't need. The justification I'll give for including this: I like my local testing env for pipelines to be as close, if not exact, to what I will deploy. For me this means _in kubernetes using exactly what I will deploy_ with as much of the kubernetes weirdness as I can account for. If this doesn't feel important to you, please feel free to ignore!\n\nHope this helps! But please, just start with the Docker basics. You can search up a youtube if your more visually-inclined. Read through the docs and try implementing things if you're more of the experiential kind. Nothing is going to be a cheat code because these are kind of foundational tools for SWE and DE.\n\nEDIT: formatting. reddit pls",

Cool guy!\n\nIt tries to improve on multiple fronts ,mostly user experience (e.g. hyperlinks to problematic files, init command, pretty output , some SE better practices and of course leverage Rust speed and binary size), which are explained here: [here](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/faq/), in the 'How does dbtective compare to similar projects' dropdown. One of the improvements I wanted required a completely different architecture and [Rust traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) were the perfect candidate.\n\nThe simplest explanation of this architectural change is by example, comparing dbt-bouncers [`CheckModelDescriptionPopulated`](https://godatadriven.github.io/dbt-bouncer/stable/checks/manifest/check_models/#manifest.check_models.CheckModelDescriptionPopulated)  rule (which only applies to models) with dbtective's \\`[has\\_description](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules/description/)\\`  rule, which can apply to all eligible dbt objects, for example  \\`sources\\`, \\`seeds\\`.  \\`macros\\` or anything that can be described (in the \\`applies\\_to\\` setting). So in \\`dbtective's\\` case, one rule can be used to expect descriptions on multiple objects, leaving less work for the user.\n\nWith this in mind we can set defaults that make sense (e.g. it makes sense to describe a lot of things so the default \\`applies\\_to\\` setting contains literally all objects that can have a description field for the has\\_description rule), but we can also easily remove or add objects if the project requires it, using the applies\\_to configuration.\n\nThese defaults I would like to eventually leave to the community or be fixed by asked the right questions in the init command. For now I've set them to what makes sense to me (this is also much of the reason to stay on v0)!\n\nHope that clears things up!",

I'd say without a doubt you made the right choice to focus on SWE over DS. The thing you actually get in DS is about Statistics-with-programming and how to properly employ research against data. All good things, not really what we're concerned about with DE. \n\n2. Since you're in SWE and looking at design patterns, keep in mind what it would be like if the only thing you had to care about was the data inside the objects. A lot of folks coming from a SWE background focus on the abstract object versus what is contained by the object. To move to DE you have to care a lot more about the latter. \n\n3. Things that will be evergreen in DE: python, SQL, databases, warehouses, data modelling (although the meaning of this varies person to person, company to company, much to my chagrin). Focus on these. Python at an expert level (focus on the data packages. Polars, Duckdb. And DB packages. Pscyopg, etc.), at least 1 RDBMS 1 NoSQL and 1 DB system you're just interested in, SQL to an expert level which will give you passable knowledge for most Warehouses as well. \n\n4. Tools that will be evergreen in DE: Airflow, Docker, GitHub, K8s. TOML/YAML as well. DBT is very good to know as well. \n\n5. And that the issue is that job descriptions are very heavily implying mastery while the actual job wants a jack of all trades. Get good at probing for this information in interviews with tech staff. Take advantage of mock interviews if you have the chance.",

The operator defers the polling for results to an async function running in the Triggerer component. \n\nSo you'd have 2 tasks: the first one sending the request, then after that a deferrable operator, which the HttpSensor can be turned into by setting deferrable=True. That second task defers itself (becomes purple) until its condition is fulfilled, then the Dag resumes. Because the polling is done in the Triggerer, the worker slot is released. ",

An example of how [Shopify handles it can be seen here](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries#bulk-query-overview). But essentially an API request contains the details needed to start the long running operation, and the API returns a job number. The user then polls a 'job status' endpoint with that job number. Generally most providers I've seen use a signed url to a CSV as the response so that their API isn't locked up during sending the body back if it's hundred of megabytes. \n\nJaniF suggestion works well, if you need to write your own sensor for more complicated handling it's super straightforward.",

You might get some additional storage savings because JSONB is per-row, but that's pretty marginal saving that requires some benchmark to show the actual benefit of moving to VARIANT at this point.",

But for analytics engineering work, especially in niche domains with messy data like you describe, it doesn't work that way. The hard part of your job is not writing SQL, it's knowing which parameter to look at based on domain knowledge. That's exactly where AI struggles.Where AI actually helps me is the tedious stuff. Debugging weird errors, generating boilerplate tests, converting between formats. I'd say 6/10 useful is about right for debugging help. Where it falls apart is anything requiring judgment about your specific business [context. My](http://context.My) honest take after a year of heavy Claude usage for data work is that the people who are no longer doing anything technical are probably working on much simpler problems than yours. When you're eyeballing raw files to figure out which field is correct because documentation doesn't exist, there's no prompt that replaces that institutional knowledge.Try Claude for the parts of your job you already know how to do but find tedious. That's where it shines. Skip the hype about agents replacing analytics engineers, that's not happening anytime soon for anyone doing real domain-specific work.",

Not know what is the desired end result, or stakeholders not knowing what they want and you having to guess that is not. It's not clear to me what is the situation here, but you can use AI for both:\n\n- use AI to generate documentation of where each parameter/column is, what it describes, how to query it, etc. Review that documentation for mistakes/errors and rewrite/fix what needs to be fixed in the documentation. Then, the AI can refer back to this documentation when generating code, saving you time\n\n- ask AI to clarify requirements, or identify information gaps, and draft responses to requests that are not clear\n\nUsing AI to code is fine and useful, but you said that's not the part you struggle with.

It’s in use at DoD, DHS, State Dept that I know of. I moved from SSAS (which was an old version of Synapse) to Databricks once. It wasn’t trivial - converting whatever the MS language was to SQL or Python wasn’t obvious. If your Synapse is on SQL I’m sure it would be easier but you’d probably have to try it to see. Databricks/Spark SQL is currently very capable - it took a while to get there, but most things you can do on other platforms are there now. You said you need good RBAC - Databricks uses standard sql permissions and now has very good fine grained permissions including constraints and expectations for data quality assurance. Pricing model seems clear to me - pay based on compute usage (kind of a big markup) and not really much else. I’ve been in the fed gov in Databricks for 5 years now on a large data warehouse and I still think it’s a good product.",

Use-cases that require real-time streaming take quite a lot of design and iteration to get right.\n\nThat being said, Flink helps you much more than Spark for real-time. State management is much cleaner, and you have much more control over the streaming pipeline. Also, it's so nice having real streaming and not \"micro-batches\".\n\nIn our case, Flink was used by a software engineering team. They use Java, as it was the language they already used.\n\nWe then tried to adopt it with a Python DE team. Turns out, PyFlink is quite limited, and does not really offer the power you would want from Flink. DE teams continued to use Spark, because their streaming needs were much more simple (basically moving data around, transformations, some aggregations with no low-latency requirement).",

Treasure I know have self-paced learning and certification available that would be worth exploring. There's not a lot of opportunity to try them out and learn by doing though, as they're all licenced commercial products.\n\nI'd recommend familiarizing yourself with the concepts of what they all cover (ingestion, customer unification, segmentation, activation), which can then apply across the board. Rudderstack have an open source offering that covers the ingestion and activation parts of their platform, so this may also be worth exploring to allow you to get hands on with at least part of a CDP.\n\nAlso, personally I find very few customers that actually need a CDP, or manage to implement one effectively. In a lot of cases, they'd get more mileage for significantly less investment by implementing a data activation or \"reverse ETL\" solution on top of their existing stack. The likes of Hightouch provide CDP features on top of your existing warehouse at a fraction of the cost.",

Then a few months later the outside world AI space comes out with agents that essentially work in any space, making a lot of their work extremely outdated in a matter of week/months. \n\nI can’t overstate how fast AI is progressing in comparison to how slow companies implement changes.",

        "body": "The way that I have ended up managing Data Infra in a couple of roles now is by being able to rapidly produce a prototype. You'll want to pick up, and use regularly, systems like Docker and Kubernetes. Even for your own small data projects. This will introduce you into that world where those things are heavily used. These are also cloud-agnostic meaning no matter what service provider your future employer(s) use you'll be squared on this front. In the same vein are things like VPCs and general networking which I spend more time debugging than anything else in DE/DataOps. After that you can get into the specifics of particular platforms. \n\nAs far as practicing is concerned: Start with `docker`. Learn the ins and outs of taking arbitrary python code you have and stuffing it into a container. Learn how to find images, how Dockerfiles work, run into the issues so you can troubleshoot them. Then see what it takes to incorporate tools you may be using to develop your code into the dockerfiles. Things like `uv`. If you can have one system managing both your local dev and your container builds you have less points of failure to troubleshoot. \n\nThen grab `k3s` for local development. This is, notably, \"actual\" kubernetes. That is opposed to things like minikube which are \"kubernetes in docker\". Nothing wrong with that, but when we're talking about \"rapid\" prototyping, k3s is as close as it gets to just managing raw k8s on your local system. You'll probably immediately want to grab `helm` as well. Read up on `k8s`, `k3s`, `helm`, and `kubectl`. Play around with trying to get your docker containers that do things or expose things up onto k3s locally. See what it takes to setup `postgres` on kubernetes, and how to expose it so you can communicate with it externally.\n\nOutside of those things, which are more typical of `self host first` shops, you can likely find playgrounds around specific tech. I believe `databricks` recently opened up a playground of sorts. Snowflake may as well, but I don't honestly remember. Google on `GCP` used to give you like $300 in credits, plus they have the open BigQuery datasets you can mess around with. I think all of these things are secondary or tertiary things to focus on though, as they are mostly provisioned and managed for you from an infra standpoint. It's not bad to see what the platforms look like behind the scenes, though!\n\nI find Data infra specifically very interesting. It's got some nuance that can apply to standard web infra, but often times deviates from it. Which ends up as a nice challenge and break from the typical DE work for me!",

I have thought of studying Linux (more than your regular CLI commands) and from there jump to Docker. I am following a book on Ubuntu and as the book progresses it introduces the concept of Docker in Linux in chapter 10 I believe, that's why I had thought of it as a good path to follow. Additionally, I am reading an intro book to Networking, I think is called \"Networking for Sysadmin\", it is the only book I've found is easy to follow on that topic with practical examples. From there my idea is to start doing labs in Azure and Amazon, to start getting hands-on experience in building infrastructure with IaC and then finally visit K8, possibly get a cert on that if time allows. Of course, my day to day for the next year will be familiarising myself with Snowflake, DBT and learning how to use Claude to write more efficient code. This is a 2 year plan. Alternatively, I could go the Masters way, and enrol in one to get a better picture of CS as a whole, but I feel there are many topics that I don't need, and my best bet would be focusing on the tools that I use day to day and potentially the ones I could use in a couple of years.",

But it will cycle around again and cost savings will be the thing, you just have to wait. I’ve been in corporate data spaces for 30 years, I’ve seen a few of those cycles 😅",

You can even kind of simulate that functionality using old fashioned SQL, but it's a huge pain.\n\nIf, like most folks in our situation, you have no resources, no support, and no external understanding of the probelm, I've tackled it in Python. If your data isn't \"Big Data\" you can basically use Python to iterate over records like it's replaying an event stream. I basically have it scrutinize the identifiers on each event and ask \"Have I seen any of these identifiers in prior events I just processed? No, alright I'll give them a master, internal warehouse ID. Yes, I'll go back and find the master ID I gave some of them previously and assign it to this batch.\n\nI'm usually not a big fan of probablistic methods so I only count observations where there is some real identifier in common.",

That is to say, event driven data operations. \"When X happens, I publish to a topic. My subscriber is listening for that push and consumes the message to do push to Y\". You can use whatever for the message bus, there's plenty of easy ones.\n\nIf you're asking about general design patterns though, you'll want the `onSubmit` you mentioned to probably capture the data from an input, probably on the same screen as the button, and to do an operation against notion with that information. But that's just free-text-to-POST. If you wanted to spend a little more time on it, you could check that the GitHub username exists before pushing it, or return an error if it doesn't that way you're actually pushing a GH Username and not just text.

When it comes to working vertically on bigquery I didn't adopt it for a few reasons:\n\n\\- It could correctly parse queries with clear syntax errors (e.g., this one: with cte as (select 1 as x) insert into foo select x from foo -- the cte must be within the insert) \n\n\\- It didn't support nested types nor multi-statement queries (haven't checked if they added support for them in the meantime!)\n\n\\- I wanted to be it as fast as possible (I use inbq during pre-commit and CI). Parsing alone is 17x faster (compared to the last release of sqlglot with the rust tokenizer) on my codebase (586 sqls, 102k LoC, 1020 schema objects with an average of 30 cols per table). I will try to add some benchmarks to the repository in the next days",

Networking tickets to try connect to the source system from AWS. Also networking tickets for AWS to connect to destination systems. \n2. Finding out where all the variables for informatica were stored on the on prem server.\n   1. I hated this part soooooo much. \n3. Understanding the complex logic of the informatica jobs since people who built them left and no one understood what they were doing. I exported the XML for the informatica jobs and used copilot to create sql queries to pull from source systems instead of manually doing this. \n\nI know this didn't really answer you question but I needed to vent as this was an exhausting project.\n\nFor tools. I wasn't expecting large loads(Under 20gb). So I used Docker, python, and duckdb. I created a custom image to use on lambda and I orchestrated with AWS step function or Airflow depending on the team. I used ECS if I expected loads to take longer than 15 minutes. \n\nWe might have had to keep the on prem server if we could not access the source from aws. So Docker, python, and duckdb would still have been used. Orchestration would have been some sort of cron schedule. \n\nHope this helps and sorry for the vent. ",

I make double what I would in engineering. There will be decent private sector jobs available but considering you have BA in there, I would advise building out the scope of your current job insanely quickly to pad the ol resume and hunting pay rises or job hopping. The job is fantastic for analytical minds and formal training will make it easier if you know what technical options are available to you for the problem solving. \n\nI don't regret a thing 7 years down the line. My student debt is fully paid off, my job keeps me engaged and the pay was good to start so I never had to job hop (again, stupidly lucky) the only risk I have is I've had to dodge rounds of layoffs like a freaking ninja so if you can manage that you should be sweet long term!\n\nTldr; you've done the ground work to make great money in an interesting field, your anxiety is valid but you've set yourself up for big wins in the future.

I was insanely depressed and felt exactly the same way you do right now. 2 years behind, wild debt and nothing to show for it. Pure dumb luck and a long damn time later I just bought a house (with help).\n\nBuild your own skill set at your own pace, target niches and chase the dollars till you're free of debt. Getting a house is nearly impossible at the moment and no one would shame you for renting for the next decade till you get there, even if you have to reinvent yourself 3 more times in the middle.

The honest answer is instruction files help with style but won't catch logical bugs.\n\nCLAUDE.md is great for things like 'use this date format' or 'always check if table exists before dropping' but AI will still write a dbt model that uses the wrong join type or handles nulls in a way that silently drops records. The instruction files can't encode business logic deep enough to prevent that.\n\nWhat actually works: dbt's built-in tests get you maybe 30% there. The wins come from singular tests that encode your actual business rules, stuff like 'revenue should never be negative' or 'customer count should be within 5% of yesterday.' We run those on every PR.\n\nWe also started requiring example queries with expected outputs in PR descriptions. Manual, yeah, but reviewers can run them and verify the logic. Caught more issues than any linter.\n\nThe sneaky pattern with AI-generated dbt is syntactically valid code that does the wrong thing with joins or nulls. We added a TESTING.md file listing these gotchas and requiring specific test coverage for them.\n\nFor open source where you can't control what people use, CI becomes the only guardrail. Require schema tests and singular tests per model before merge. If someone's AI code passes all that, honestly, good enough.",

        "body": "Howdy. Twenty-five-year-professional, thirty-eight-year passionate programmer here. I think you're feeling the right feelings but you might lack context.\n\nI used an LLM this weekend to knock out some database code. We have models (sqlalchemy talking to a Posgresql database), ORMs, and then GraphQL interfaces to fetch that data. So I had a collection of A's and I needed new collections of B's and C's and the interfaces for them. I described the problem to Copilot, and it did the work for me by creating new files, each of which was a 90% rewrite of an existing file.\n\nYou see the problem already. \"Why do you have to rewrite 90% of a file to do something as simple as 'a collection, but for a new type of data?' Because our abstraction is bad.\n\nBut here's the thing about software engineering in a professional setting: *the abstraction is always bad.* We are, forever, solving real problems real people have, balancing correctness, speed, and maintainability. As a programmer passionate about the profession, I want to push maintainability *all* the way to maximum.\n\nI am not paid to do that because it impacts speed. So we write enough abstraction to do the job and we limp it along until it becomes too burdensome to maintain.\n\nYou see code as art. And it is! I love creating a beautiful abstraction that cleanly describes and solves a problem. I do my best to write that code in my hobby-time outside work. But problems in the real world are not clean, they are often ill-described, and the deliverable solution is, as a result, messy and tricky to maintain. We can and do refactor, but not until we're *very* sure that the problem domain is so well-defined that hiding it behind abstraction to make it less verbose and error-prone will be worth costing us the flexibility of writing everything long-form. You don't write clean code to solve the problem every time because you don't even have a clear picture of the problem you're trying to solve. But each possible solution clarifies the problem and gets you closer. And LLMs, it turns out, are *great* at recognizing fuzzy patterns and applying transformations based on that.\n\nIf you treat code *only* as art (which you can choose to do!), you'll get paid like an artist. I'm not gonna tell you not to.\n\nBut solving real problems for real people usually requires writing mountains of bad code fast. LLMs are great at that. They're also surprisingly good at fast analysis of bad (overly verbose, redundant, ill-fit to the problem domain) code and creation of more code fitting the pattern. Which means someone's real problem gets solved faster.\n\nNo surprise people are gravitating towards that, because people have problems and want them solved.\n\nMy advice to you is to keep the passion. The algorithms *are* beautiful. Code *is* art. And, as you've already observed with your peers, letting the AI spit something out you can't understand and putting it in production is just the Sorcerer's Apprentice enchanting the broom to carry water and then letting it go.\n\nBut... Your mastery of craft will take you further *with* AI because you can use it to write code faster than your fingers can, and that gets real solutions into real people's hands faster.\n\nAnd programming and computer science is about the algorithms, but software engineering is about solving the problems human beings have right now.\n\nGood luck out there. The world is a big adventure right now. Bigger than it was when I was in uni. I envy you that, in a sense.",

To be honest, some of it is not bad; if you'd trust an intern to make repeated changes to your software, then AI can usually be leveraged to your advantage.  But if your codebase is complex and is 90% complete, AI often does a lot of harm along with some good.\n\n>And AI can't even code to save its life. It spits out nonsense inefficient code that doesn't even work half the time.\n\nYeah... I once asked AI to re-write code to be more efficient, and it wrote it using an algorithm that many people think is efficient, but that I knew from experience wasn't very efficient in my case.  It's as if AI accepts common misconceptions as fact.\n\n>The fact that people are saying that \"Programming is dead\" infruits me so much.\n\nCool word!  I don't know what \"*infruits*\" means, but I like it already!  I might even start using it myself!  `;-)`\n\n>I want my classmates to learn and discover the beauty of writing algorithms. I want websites to have strong cyber security measures that weren't vibe coded by sloppy AI. And most importantly to me I want to write code.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say.  This AI and Vibe Coding boom has only been going on for a handful of years now, so in another five years I wouldn't be surprised if the programming landscape will be very different.  Perhaps competent coders like you will be in high demand in 2030.\n\nI will say, however, that AI is unlikely to go away completely, and I've found that AI results tend to help us ***provided that a knowledgeable human*** ***vets the results*** first.  So if an AI generates results that are only 10% significant, a human can review them and find lots of good stuff.  But if we blindly use AI results that are only 10%, 50%, or even 90% accurate, we're liable to get nasty surprises 10%, 50%, or 90% of the time.\n\nSo my take is that blindly putting AI on autopilot has its problems, but using it as a search tool to find results we wouldn't normally find on our own is not so bad, provided we review all its results.",

If I took my time to understand the principles of analysis I am doing, the context I’m writing the code in, and then all of the CS analysis to make it beautiful, and then write the tests for it, it’d take me a month.\n\nCopilot can look at code I’ve written before and give the rough beats which I can then fill in quickly with context to my necessity, so I can be more intentional about any minute inaccuracies which might affect my ability to do a worthwhile analysis on the actual data I have.\n\nIt’s a way to work faster.

They do it 100% unpaid. Just for fun. When you are actually interested in programming you will naturally do the same. \n\nUnfortunately university level computer science programs are more than happy to take students who have never written a single line of code in their lives and I think that gives beginners the false impression that you can just be taught to write software from a school and you don't need to actually go into it with any prior experience. \n\nBut look at art or music schools. Can you imagine going to into a university music program and say \"Ok, now how do I play this instrument?\" Thats would be crazy. No respectable school would take such a student. \n\n> I keep seeing beginners (and even some experienced devs) struggle because they jump straight into writing code without fully understanding the problem. \n\nNo, they struggle because they are impatient and expect to be able to do more than is reasonable for a beginner.

Basic is such, well, a basic language that it read so much like english and i could just, as a 3rd grader without a compuer, read the book and follow the programming examples, and I picked up basic programming just by doing that, just as if one reads a book about math and learns math.\n\nI mean how simple is:\n\n10 PRINT \"What is your name?\"  \n20 INPUT $NAME  \n30 PRINT \"Hello, \" + $NAME\n\nI didn't even know until a year later in 4th grade that the home computer we had had basic installed on it (QBasic specifically) and I could actually write these programs.  By then just by reading the book i understanded it as simple as basic algebra.\n\nYou really do have to start with spending some time reading code and trying to make out what it does before you jump in.  It's not so much about what the code is, but 'why' the code is.  What is this code trying to do?  Why did they write it that was as opposed to some other way you have seen?  Each time you ask yourself one of these questions youre filling in the actual foundation of 'getting it'.  Actually trying to write the syntax is just applying that knowledge.",

What changed my perspective was realizing most standardized aptitude tests measure narrow reasoning traits (pattern detection, working memory, etc.), but programming seems more tied to temperament and problem-solving style.\n\nWhen I was considering whether to commit seriously, I actually did a broader strengths/work-style breakdown (one I tried was Pigment). It wasn’t programming-specific at all, but it helped me see that I naturally prefer structured analytical environments over open-ended social ones which made coding feel like a good bet for me. In hindsight, enjoyment + tolerance for debugging frustration seems like a stronger predictor than any aptitude score.",

Learn how to apply abstractions with protocols and ABCs, and injecting with FastAPI depends(). Start with just a REPL app if you must while you get the core structure, then evolve into fastAPI. (You can just write to a json file until you get a DB connected) \n\nBut I’d look into fastAPI, sqlalchemy for ORM, Alembic for migrations, pydantic for serialization and DTOs. Etc. \n\nYou have a lot to learn with Python alone. Could also throw in unit testing with pytest, also start thinking about docker, see if you can get a dockerfile + compose to spin up your app in one container and Postgres in another (I’d recommend focus on Postgres). It’s a lot if you want to go full stack with Python. It’s also not like C# where repo and unit if work patterns are implemented for you.

But in a timed, no Google, recorded setting, recognition is not enough. You need to be comfortable building the logic from first principles, slowly and methodically.\n\nOne pattern I see is people practicing by consuming solutions instead of reconstructing them. If you redo those exact problems, try this approach: write out the data structures on paper first. For tic tac toe, what does state actually look like? Array of 9? Whose turn is it? How do you detect a win? Force yourself to describe it in plain language before touching the keyboard.\n\nAlso, simulate the constraint. Set a timer. Disable autocomplete. No AI. No tabs. It will feel bad at first. That discomfort is the training.\n\nThe fact that you knew “in theory” what to do is actually promising. It means the gap is translation under pressure, not total ignorance. That gap closes with reps.\n\nAnd this is a normal rite of passage. A lot of strong engineers have a story like this.

Writing and maintaining docs (even small READMEs).  \n* Basic security awareness (auth, secrets, common vulnerabilities).  \n\nYou don’t need to be an expert in all of this as a student, but having working familiarity makes a huge difference and makes learning new stacks much easier later.",

        "body": "This is one of those opinion based things so people may disagree but here is my list.\n\n1. Learn to communicate well!   This include written and verbal communications.   Frankly in college this was a huge challenge, more difficult than just about all other courses I took.   In the corporate world it can be more important than really understanding what you are doing.   Yes that is sad.\n2. Learn to navigate at least two Operating Systems from the command line.  This includes multiple tools that these OS'es deliver.\n3. SCM!   Yes git and github are extremely popular these days but in the corporate world you use what they currently have set up.   So understand the hows and whys.   \n4. Docker might not be a thing, in fact there are plenty of jobs that never touch the web.    As a programmer you may need to target platform specific applications.   So don't dismiss native app development.   This Reddit seems to be very web development focused but people need to know there are many jobs where programming skills might be leveraged.\n5. If you are not doing web development learn the default IDE for the platform you are working on inside out.   With modern IDE's this can take as much time as learning Python.    This especially with AI integration.   So if you are programming a Mac, that means learn XCode, if you are programming a PLC. that might mean RSLogix.   \n6. Which brings up AI, learn to leverage it as a programmer to improve your productivity.   This is entirely different than trying to implement AI features in an application.\n7. Learn Python even if Python might not be your primary development language.\n8. Speaking of Python, spend some time with C or C++ at the command line.   This should be covered in the first few classes of a good CS program.   The reason here is that understanding how compilers, linkers and such, work is important, especially in the future when the IDE breaks.   Command line development might not be the norm these days but understanding how an app is built is still required knowledge.\n9. Keep you math skills up.   You may go years not needing a particular math skill in your programming career, then one day somebody asks for a specific statistical result.   Yes there are reference manuals and text to refer to but in all honesty rusty algebra can really trip you up.   Some people believe mathematical thinking and practice helps keep you programming skill honed, I don't know about that, what I do know is removing rust can really set you behind.\n10. Someone else mentioned typing, this is actually huge.   I literally learned typing in high school well before I could even get access to a computer much less buy one.    Yes this was a teenager looking towards his future - shocking.   In any event it is a skill that makes the job much easier.\n11. Take an assembly language course as part of your college education.   The point here is not to become an embedded programmer but rather to get insight into how processors work.   In the past a good CS program required one quarter of assembly, in that case done on a emulator.    These days you could just as easily buy a small microcontroller system and learn there.\n12. I touched on this above but when it comes to computing systems, the world is much bigger than delivering web apps and in some cases these alternatives pay much better.   So don't dismiss these alternative paths in IT that may or may not be programming heavy.   Examples: Security, embedded programming, industrial automation, platform apps, network management, compiler development (because most languages suck), interpreter development (because Python has been taken over by mad men), API and SDK development, test and validation, SQL (databases) and so forth.   Others can add to this list, ultimately this should be an FAQ someplace.  \n13. Have a well defined minor.   Lets face it programming as a skill by itself is not going to be a huge career driver.   Rather it is how you apply those programming skills to solve problems.   While a weak example if you are doing web development a minor in business might be a big plus.   If you are going to be involved in embedded as stronger background in electronics can be helpful.   If you want to work in the optics industry a strong physics background should be considered.    Actually a strong physics background can help for many paths in a programming career.\n\nThere you go a bakers dozen.   I  suspect the most important point above is to avoid this idea that programming means the web.    There are actually many career paths to follow.",

Figure out the mouse works and screen regions, callbacks, etc.  You’ll abandon this but you gained insight into what’s going on.  All of that mouse info is tracked in real frameworks.  Be aware of it and use it.\n\nNow start higher languages.  Try some procedural and some functional.  You’ll start to like one.  \n\nNext, learn threads and asynchronous coding.  Wrap your head around the different ways languages and systems handle threads and how not to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\nIn parallel with learning threads, learn I/O, bottlenecks, buffering, streams, etc., combining these with threads and async code.  Do extreme tests and see how quickly you can process insanely large files.  How many large files in parallel?  How about millions of small files?\n\nThen there is database connectivity.

This would give you a pretty good idea how computers worked under the hood back in the 80s:\n\n[https://eater.net/8bit/](https://eater.net/8bit/)\n\n  \nThings are a lot more complicated now, but knowing about this stuff helps you ask the right questions, and it's a lot simpler to understand.\n\nA book I bought was really great at explaining basic EE stuff was Getting Started in Electronics by Forest Mims:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Electronics-Forrest-Mims/dp/0945053282](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Electronics-Forrest-Mims/dp/0945053282)\n\nLearning Pascal and then C taught me a lot about how programs and computers work.  C gets you pretty close to the metal.\n\nI never read Knuth, but his stuff is still valuable today.  I did have to implement various data structures and algorithms using the language itself without any libraries.  You could also learn stuff like Boolean algebra to get a handle on the theoretical underpinnings of CS.  If you want to get into deep theory, you could read Turing's stuff (which I regard as fairly arcane and only really needed to know something about it to write a compiler in school).\n\nWhile I don't use any of this stuff day-to-day, knowing about it (half-remembering it if we're being honest) is helpful in understanding how magic (i.e. complicated and/or poorly documented software someone you don't know wrote) works.",

Here me out though: work is still work. You will find yourself creating ”the same” endpoint over and over again, while having meetings that should have been emails and tight deadlines. \n\nSecond. You probably are ready. There’s no reaching the end of programming. Either some new version of your language comes out, some new language appears, libraries update with breaking changes… technology changes. If you need a graduation ceremony to feel you are ready, that’s ok, but then self learning ain’t gonna help much.\n\nStart one of those projects. The 3d section thing is the one I think is the most exciting. I think you like graphics programming, animations. Artistic stuff. Backend can get so predictable that it feels mindless. Frontend is more chaotic and feels new everytime but can’t get annoying when what you did last time doesn’t seem to work. That 3d section project is something in the middle there. Is more abstract code, closeish to backend and produces something you can look at.\n\nNo matter if you get a job tomorrow or start your projects, learning is always needed and it will never end.",

It's almost self reinforcing that you'll feel like you need to specifically have been guided through a project in order to do it. Pick one of your things, and just try building it. If you run into a stuck, find a project that does that thing, look at how they did it, and implement as needed for your own. Alternatively, talk it through with an LLM. Don't use agentic modes, just open a chat with GitHub copilot or something and ask it for suggestions on how to solve X problem, preferably multiple ways.\n\nPersonally, I'd take your art catalog project and write a web scraper that can scrape a single website. Then build it for a second site. Look at the patterns between the two scrapers you built, and build one that can effectively scrape both. Finding patterns and making code reusable is an essential skill to have. For what it's worth I think you've probably put more time into raw practice than I ever have. Just build, learn and rebuild when you learn something new.",

The use of a contiguous memory layout, as well as enforcement of homogenous contents, are both secondary aspects of what makes something an array. An array is an ordered data structure which has (close to) constant time access to its contents by index. It’s better to think of these data structures in terms of the performance guarantees they provide for different operations than to try to focus on their implementations. Implementations can involve all sorts of hairy performance optimizations which obscure the intent of the data structure.\n\nThe weird thing about JS arrays, and ArrayList objects compared to something like C or Java’s primitive arrays, is that they allow the data structure’s size to efficiently dynamically grow. The other weird thing about JS arrays is that they can be sparse, but that’s something you hopefully will never have to deal with. \n\nTo be pedantic, it’s pretty common for arrays to “hold” heterogenous contents in languages other than JS. I use scare quotes because arrays of objects generally don’t hold objects themselves, but rather pointers to those objects. In languages with subtyping (like Java) the pointers may indeed point to multiple different types of objects as long as they are all subclasses of the array’s declared generic argument. A typed language like Java thus allows arrays to hold heterogenous data, but requires you to access the data as though it is homogenous (unless you use an unsafe downcast). Dynamically typed languages like JS and Python are more permissive, but it’s (IMO) a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.",

So it's entirely expressible as a type, and as such the array is homogenously `array[Any]` or however you'd want to express the type.\n\nThe other thing is that pretty much any language has some affordance for creating some sort of union, which you can then use in arrays. It will vary how ergonomic and error-prone it is, but in any case you can cook up an array of data that holds heterogenous base types.\n\nAs in, you can define some union of integers and floats and put that in an array, which will be homogenous in that it only accepts that union and rejects stuff like strings, objects, etc; at the same time it'll be heterogenous in that you'll need to have some way of knowing which of the types in the union a given entry is.\n\nSo the idea of homo/heterogeneity can be misleading,\n\n* because any sort of collection will always be homogenous if it's well-typed: all the elements in some collection `C[T]` are of type `T`\n* but may still be heterogenous in terms of base types: `T` may be a union of `T1 | T2 | …`",

In terms of programming an object is an instance of a class. - It's the *data/state* (fields/attributes/members) coupled with the *behavior* (methods) of a specific class (type).\n2.  The binary data is scattered - the methods are stored in one place, and in one place only, no matter how many objects you create. The *state* (fields, attributes, members) are stored somewhere else, typically, but not necessarily, in contiguous memory blocks, individually for each object (apart from the exception of `static` members that also only exist once in memory). This is a very efficient approach as the data is usually a lot less than the methods.\n3. It is not actually that different. In some languages even structs can have methods - so the line blurs depending on the language. In a way, structs (as the structs in C) are the predecessor of classes.\n4. Methods are functions that belong to a class - it's basically just terminology. When a programmer talks about *functions* they mean *unbound functions* that exist outside the context of OO. When they talk about *methods*, they always talk about \"functions\" that are bound to classes and that only exist in the context of OO.\n\nThe difference between function and method is: `len(string)` vs. `string.length()` - the former is a function that exists outside the context of classes and objects, but can accept an object, and the latter is a method that exists in the context of the `string` instance of a class.\n\nIt's like \"please draw me a fish\" (\"draw\" being the function and \"fish\" being the argument) and \"fish, please draw yourself\" (\"fish\" being the object and \"draw yourself\" being the method called).",

Consider:\n\n    class person {\n      int weight, height, age;\n\n    public:\n      void jump(int how_high), run(int how_far);\n    };\n\nIn memory - whether it's on the stack or the heap, it going to lay out in memory per byte something like:\n\n    [w][w][w][w][h][h][h][h][a][a][a][a]\n\nThis is the same as if it were a structure. Objects are programming concepts - when you get down to the machine, it's all bytes - bytes for data, bytes for addresses, bytes for offsets, bytes for instructions...\n\nAs for the functions, that gets compiled into the program binary, just like any other function. The syntax dissolves at the assembly level - to call the interface, you have to build a stack frame and push your parameters. One of the parameters is going to be the location of the object instance in memory - the hidden `this` pointer. So just as you have to push how high to jump, you also need to push who is doing the jumping. Again - the machine just sees program instruction sequences - bytes, and more bytes, and more bytes.\n\nYes, you can directly replicate what the compiler is going to generate for you with a `struct` and a function that takes a pointer, but why? The syntax is there to facilitate what you already want to do in a more concise manner.\n\nBut also, programming constructs are MORE than just syntax. C++, Rust, ANY language is more than just a high level assembly. The language defines the confines of what these things are, and the compiler is allowed to exploit everything else. In other words, stated more concretely - C++ has a SHITTON of Undefined Behavior, it's kind of notorious for it, but that's a GOOD thing, because everything the language doesn't say, the compiler can exploit for optimization. We want as much of that as possible, and then we can wrap those dicy corners with the standard library so you don't have to deal with it directly.\n\nThe hard part is cultural - getting people to use the facilities provided and stop writing raw imperative code that gets them into trouble.\n\n> What is an object in terms of programming? \n\nAn object is a user defined type, that models behavior, by encapsulating state, to protect it's invariant.\n\nSo an `std::vector` is always implemented in terms of 3 pointers. The invariant is that those pointers are ALWAYS well defined. There is no intermediate state that YOU the client can ever observe. You also don't actually know how the vector is implemented, and you don't have direct access. You defer to the vector to enforce its invariant, and it's behavior is well defined through its interface. When you hand program control to the vector, it can suspend it's own invariant - say, to reallocate, but that invariant is reestablished before it returns control.\n\nSo objects have a certain level of autonomy and agency. They know what to do, they don't need you to tell them how to do their job. It's why you employ classes in the first place, because that encapsulation keeps your program more correct and consistent.\n\n> How does the binary data and the methods in the class get managed at low level? Does the data get scattered in one place? Or it's just managed by pointers? \n\nFrankly it doesn't matter. No programming language gets that specific, because it's not portable.\n\n> How is an instance of a class that has no methods in it different from a struct type variable?\n\nTechnically there is no different. Idiomatically, a class models behavior, and a struct is a tagged tuple. It's a conventional difference in meaning. Classes make for terrible structures. A car has some state, about the position of keys, dials, doors, etc, and the interface will open and close things, speed up and slow down... But NONE of that is dependent upon the make, model, or year. Those are variables that are independent. The same car can go by different names and makes. Is that a Subaru BRZ or a Scion FRS? Trick question, they're the exact same car made in the exact same factory as a joint project between the two companies.\n\nSo if anything, you bundle your car model with it's pedantic properties in some sort of tagged tuple or relational or table structure.\n\n> How is a method different from a function that does some operations based on different values of its properties?\n\nAt that low level, there isn't a difference. But any language and implementation can make the difference more significant. A free function and a public structure, you can do anything you want, and while you can do everything strict and correct, there's nothing preventing me from writing my own function that fucks everything. A class with a method? You're encapsulating state and enforcing an invariant.",

There are some things that you might wind up doing differently over time, especially in bigger projects. Which is to say, they can be considered overengineering for a program of this size & scope, but overengineering otherwise small programs can also be a decent way to learn about those engineering practices.\n\n*Avoiding \"magic\" numbers*: Your `else` case for the difficulty rating is meant to result in `easy` mode, but this can drift apart. If you decide to give `easy` mode 4 tries for example, then you need to update that number in two spots. There are a couple of ways around that, like storing the numbers in constants, e.g. `const int EASY_MODE_TRIES = 3;` and then using the constant rather than the literal number, and/or having an extra parsing step where you wind up doing something like an extra function that ends on `else { cout << \"Something…\"; return EASY; }`, returning something like an `enum` of the valid difficulty ratings, or even a struct. Error handling and parsing user input can be kind of big topics with lots of options.\n\nBut generally, magic numbers are a hazard for code maintenance, because it very often turns into questions like \"why is it _this_ number? can I change it? what happens if I do?\" and some constants with names and rationales go a long way to alleviate that.\n\n*More functions*: Generally we break code up into what's hopefully logical chunks. Often to avoid repetition, but also sometimes just to break up long reams of code into something more like a condensed sequence of subtasks. Opinions vary on how long a function should be allowed to get. My opinion is something like trying to be able to fit the entire function on the screen (but also not trying to bend over backwards to follow the rule), which I think is a fairly common middle-of-the-road opinion.\n\nThere are also a whole bunch of C++ concepts and best practices that you'll kind of have to pick up over time; one that may be good to get you to look into as soon as possible is \"[const correctness](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)\".",

The important thing is to not tell us what the code tells us, because here's the thing - typically such comments and code disagree. So who's the authority? Which is right? The code? Or the comment?\n\nOne thing your comments are doing is making up for a lack of functions. You're lacking expressiveness, and so you're trying to name what you're doing with the comment. Perhaps your next lesson will introduce functions to you, and this will dry up.\n\n    std::transform(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end(), difficulty.begin(), ::tolower);\n\nThere is a bug here. It's really technical and subtle, and I don't fully understand it myself, but the [reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/tolower.html) warns you this is unsafe, that you need to write a function that casts your character type to `int`.\n\n    random_num = rand() % max_num + 1;\n\nThis is the same in every branch of your difficulty condition. Just hoist it out and write this code once, after the condition block.\n\n    std::getline(std::cin, guess); // Take guess as string\n    user_guess = std::stoi(guess); // Convert string to integer\n\nToo many steps! Streams know how to extract integers! Your problem is interleaving extraction with line grabbing.\n\nThe rules of extraction are:\n\n1) Ignore leading whitespace\n\n2) Start grabbing characters\n\n3) Stop at some delimiter character. Leave the delimiting character behind, in the stream.\n\nThe rules for line grabbing are:\n\n1) Grab characters one at a time\n\n2) Stop when you find the delimiter character, discarding it.\n\nSo imagine first extracting an `int` - something like `\"    123\\n\"; the stream purges the leading whitespace, grabs \"123\" and leaves \"\\n\" behind. Now you line grab, and what happens? We grab \"\\n\", which is our delimiter, and we stop.\n\nSo the thing to do is know when you're switching between the two, and `ignore` the newline as necessary.\n\n    int x;\n    std::string s;\n\n    std::cin >> x;\n    std::cin.ignore(); // Purge after extraction, before getline\n    std::getline(std::cin, s);\n\n    std::getline(std::cin, s);\n    std::cin >> x; // No purge necessary after getline\n\nAnother thing you should be doing is checking your streams. A stream is implemented as a \"user defined type\", which are made from `class`, `struct`, `enum`, and `union`. One of the things you can do is \"overload\" almost any of the language operators. That's how `operator >>` and `operator <<` - the bit shift operators, are made to work as stream extraction and insertion - they're written as functions that work with stream types. And when you learn to make your own types, you can write your own stream operators for them without having to modify the stream class itself - the pattern is extensible.\n\nContinued...",

Like, over 90% can’t program at all. Certifications can be faked and aren’t used very much. Manually verifying someone’s resume takes forever, and often employers will only tell you that someone was employed during certain dates. \n\nSo, you need some way to quickly verify that the person you’re interviewing can actually program. \n\nHistorically, I think it was Microsoft that is to blame for popularizing programming puzzles, but the reason they’re still being used is that it’s one way to be sure that the interviewee can program. Although it’s far from the only way, and you definitely miss out on people that can program in a more real world setting. \n\nPersonally, my favorite approach is to ask people to submit any piece of code that they wrote and are proud of, about 100 lines or so, and then we talk about it. Another popular alternative is take-home tests, which tend to be more similar to real-world programming, but are a bigger burden on applicants. One interesting approach I’ve seen is they ask you to review a piece of code and tell them if there are bugs or other issues.",

I was making a mod for Minecraft (using Java obviously). I had an item that could petrify entities by replacing the targeted entity with a modded “petrified entity”. In the petrified entity renderer I had to use Forge’s API in order to get the model from some render buffer somewhere. It then takes the model and applies a stone texture for rendering.\n\nHowever I quickly discovered a burial bug that occurs. If there is an actual instance of the target entity being rendered on screen at the same time as a petrified entity of the same entity, then any animations that played on the living one played on the petrified entity model. That obviously looks a little weird.\n\nI determined the cause of this was the fact the function I was calling to get the model wasn’t new model and was a shared reference or a shallow copy of a model. Now this were a copy constructor would have been very handy, but it didn’t seem to have one nor did the model class have the copy method implemented. \n\nI ended up writing this kinda ugly piece of code using reflections to solve it. It only needs to run once as it caches the model,  so it isn’t too bad performance wise, but the code is ugly. A copy constructor or similar would have been super handy.",

If you have a constructor, and use it to create a new Whatever that should be just like some other Whatever, that's a copy constructor. The Java language does have a related and more built-in thing, which is called \"Cloneable,\" but you can and should mostly ignore it.\n\nWhat exactly is a copy constructor?  It's any constructor for class Whatever that takes a parameter of another Whatever and tries to make this new Whatever exactly like the other Whatever.\n\nWhen should I actually use it in real code? Whenever you want there to be a new thing that is a separate thing from another thing but has the same value. \"Make a copy of this thingy\" is a very common, basic operation in a lot of situations.\n\nwhat problem does a copy constructor solve? It lets you make copies. There are lots of ways to solve that problem, and copy constructors are one of them. Other ways involve factory methods, cloneable, and just creating a new thing and setting all of its properties with setters() for the new thing and getters() for the old thing.",

Some objects really do need to run some code to make a valid copy, because they internally manage some resource. \n\nAs a simple example, consider a list. The list object itself usually doesn't directly contain its elements. It contains some kind of reference to separate memory which stores the elements. That memory is a resource it has to manage. Stuff like allocate new memory when you insert elements, free the memory when the list itself is being destroyed, etc.\n\nIf you were to just create a bitwise copy of the list object, now you'd have two list objects, which are expected to manage the same memory, probably not knowing that the other one exists. This would lead to some serious memory safety bugs. What you actually need to do, when you want to create a real copy is to run some code that allocates the new memory for the second list, and copies over the elements.

And at that point basic DSA and other stuff you've learned may look like kindergarten knowledge to you but from most lectures I've attended I can tell you that the base is absolutely crucial. If you can figure out the proper data structure(s) for your system/sub-system, the algorithms will follow without you having to explicitly design anything beyond business logic operations. And one of the most important statements I've learned is that whenever you're building something - a small project, a system, a library, an api, etc. think of it as \"Everything is a __\" where the __ is basically a morphable entity that you design from scratch. And the entire system can essentially be considered a single unit of that entity, even though it's made out of the same entity in smaller scales. This is where programming paradigms help alot. For example in Java, everything is an object. What is an object? For that you must know the details of OOP - which is just another programming paradigm. \n\nI can recommend https://roadmap.sh/ for a quick progress tracker as it covers the majority of this sphere.\n\nLastly, having a mathematical mind is crucial to programming, because getting desired results from any given problem through programming can be achievable via brute force in the worst situations. But solving a problem in an optimized manner requires a ton of math and math oriented thinking. Because taking shortcuts and cutting corners is what makes your code precise and fast. This is where your knowledge of DSA can be applied in smaller scales - competitive programming problems from sites like Leetcode are extremely helpful and will give you a good grasp of what to do in most situations.",

You can use Github Project, Trello, Notion, Jira, IceScrum or sheet of paper.\n\nWrite nice-to-have and optional and keep them in mind when you code. It does not mean doing a lot of abstraction \"just in case\".\n\nThis will already help a lot.\nNow, don't refactor until absolutely needed to add a feature. You should not have to refactor a lot if you did the first part correctly.\n\nSometimes 1-2 workarounds are fine, everything does not need to be perfect all the time. Wait until the workaround causes more issues that it solves.\n\nFinally, from time to time, allow yourself a review of your project. List the pain points, bottlenecks, ... and plan refactors. It's better because:\n- you need time between the time you wrote the code and its refactor\n- you need to move forward. The refactor today is not the same as tomorrow's",

That is what refactoring is - it isn't something you can wave around that solves your weird memory-allocation scheme into something more professional.\n\nAnyways - first you plan how the code should be structured, you probably need to diagram something for this, as you won't be able to remember. You plan which classes you need, and which methods they should contain, what those methods should receive and return, and so on. You decide if some methods should perhaps be closer together in a single class, to keep coherence high, and you decide if some should receive fewer data-structures (or objects) to keep coupling loose ...\n\nAlso, you make sure that you have valid tests that can run for both the un-refactored and the refactored code - if not, you write them along the way.\n\nAlso, create a new branch for all this work, as you'll without a doubt break something!\n\nThen you begin - usually the steps are somewhat like this, but there's never a perfect recipe:\n\n1. Split functions and methods up into smaller parts\n2. Create additional classes and connect them\n3. Move functions / methods to their new classes\n4. Change globally available variables to locally where needed\n5. Change method parameters and/or return values - perhaps introduce new objects to be received and returned.\n\nBetween each step you test, and once the tests pass, you commit - then go on to the next step.\n\nThat is basically the way.\n\n  \nRefactoring *never* makes the code \"better\" or \"faster\" from the computer's point of view - it is usually still the exact same lines of code that runs, but they are structured better from the programmers' point of view, so that they'll have an easier time implementing new features and changing functionality!",

        "body": "> Why does refactoring Code seem so Hard for us?\n\nPolitics, bias, and limitations.\n\nFirst you have to justify to management that the refactor is necessary, you also have to convince them that the benefits outweigh the risks. Yeah, your existing code is shit, it's even got bugs, but it's a known quantity. What you're suggesting is all new code, that accomplishes the same goals as the old code, and it's unproven. Remember that the customer doesn't see the code. You mean you want to take 6 months to deliver... the exact same thing as what we already have?\n\n> Like i dont know if i have some kind of RoadBlock but for me when you already have \"working\" Code but you know you can refactor it to make it better, faster, etc. it just seems like starting from Scratch feeling :(\n\n> Also i gotta be honest i really often do not know where to begin even >.> \n\nSecond, the human mind is conservative. We HATE loss, so we're susceptible to things like the sunk cost fallacy. So to save some of the cost you've put into this code base, to minimize your losses, you try to make a minimal change. It's usually not robust enough to be a total solution, it's a hack or bandaid. One or two can be forgivable, but they add up quickly.\n\n> But yea anyone got any Advice for dealing with these Huge Tasks of either Refactoring or Rewriting Large Chunks of your Code >.>\n\nThird, this is the difference between juniors and seniors. I have 37 years of mistakes to inform my design decisions without having to consciously think about it - that's called intuition. This may be new code, but I've already made up my mind about it 20 years ago, when I had to learn that one thing the hard way... So refactoring is so hard because your system is too tightly coupled and does not tolerate refactoring. All software systems have their limitations, nothing is infinitely extensible or refactorable or perfectly decoupled. The difference is how far you can go before it starts looking like bandaids or hits the hard wall that you need a redesign.\n\nOne form of refactoring is short-sighted, where what you have is \"over-fit\" (borrowing from my data analyst wife), too tightly coupled, not flexible or extensible, it only does exactly what it was designed to do, and how. So what you end up doing is redesigning the thing with YET ANOTHER over-fit solution.\n\nAnother form of refactoring is well seasoned. You design with flexibility in mind. This can be a hard sell even in the industry, because it can seem pointless at the time if the others think this is a well understood and fixed area. So good code is actually needlessly decoupled, because you end up tripping over it eventually, and you'll be glad you have that flexibility built in. It's stupid until you end up needing it. It's extra and unnecessary complexity until you end up needing it. It's needlessly expensive (premature optimization) until you both need it and discover the performance didn't matter here, anyway.\n\nAnd that's a dangerous one - performance, people will die on that hill, but then you become over-dependent on the performance of that segment to makeup for the failings of other, \"justified\", sloppy and expensive code. Well now you have to break this thing, and you lose the performance, and it's not itself a big deal, but it does expose the weaknesses of other code. And rather than fixing it, there's more bias to ignore it and blame other parts, put the burden on them to make up for it.\n\n---\n\nContinued...",

        "body": "Hey! If you’re just starting out with programming, I think you should give pseudocode a try. Many tutors and computer science professors have already developed an algorithmic mindset, so they often dive straight into teaching specific languages and syntax. In doing so, they sometimes overlook the root of the challenge: learning how to think like a coder.\n\nIn my opinion, when you're a beginner facing a programming problem, you should first grab a blank sheet of paper and ask yourself: 'How can I break this down like a cooking recipe?'\n\nFor example, if I asked you to write a function that returns a boolean based on whether a number is prime, you could map it out like this:\n\n>Function isPrime(n):\n\n>If n≤1 then:\n\n>return False\n\n>If n=2 then:\n\n>return True\n\n>If n is even then:\n\n>return False\n\n>For i from 3 to SquareRoot(n) with a step of 2:\n\n>If i divides n then:\n\n>return False\n\n>EndFor\n\n>return True\n\nOnce you’ve done that and you’re confident in your logic, go ahead and write the code in the language you're learning. If you get stuck on the syntax, just look it up. Remember: syntax is just a matter of practice and habit. The real hurdle is training your brain to think algorithmically.\n\nIt might seem a bit silly to use pen and paper for a simple function like this, but I promise you that after a few weeks, you’ll develop a real knack for deconstructing problems. After that, you'll be free to focus entirely on reading and writing the code itself.",

You end up wiring libraries together without understanding failure modes, limits, or trade-offs. That is not machine learning competence.\n\nStart by separating Python from machine learning. Python is a tool. Machine learning is applied mathematics.\n\nFirst phase: foundations.\n\nYou need linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues), calculus (derivatives, partial derivatives, gradients), probability (distributions, expectation, variance), and statistics (hypothesis testing, bias/variance). Without these, concepts like gradient descent, regularization, overfitting, or loss functions are opaque symbols. Use textbooks, not shortcut videos. Expect months, not weeks.\n\nSecond phase: Python as a numerical language.\n\nLearn Python only to the level needed to express math. Focus on:\n\nCore syntax, functions, loops, list/dict comprehensions\n\nNumPy for vectorized computation\n\nMatplotlib for visualising functions and error surfaces\n\nIgnore \"Python for ML in 10 hours\" content. It trains imitation, not understanding.\n\nThird phase: machine learning from first principles.\n\nBefore touching scikit-learn, implement algorithms yourself:\n\nLinear regression from scratch\n\nGradient descent manually\n\nLogistic regression with your own loss function\n\nk-means without libraries\n\nIf you cannot derive the update rule on paper, you are not ready to code it.\n\nFourth phase: libraries.\n\nOnly after the above should you use scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. At this point libraries accelerate work rather than replace thinking. You should be able to predict model behaviour before running it.\n\nRules to follow:\n\nAvoid tutorial playlists that jump straight to neural networks\n\nPrefer courses that derive equations before code\n\nIf math feels uncomfortable, that is the signal you are on the right path\n\nExpect frustration; ML is not a \"learn a library\" skill\n\nBottom line:\n\nMachine learning is mathematics implemented in Python. If you skip the mathematics, you are not learning machine learning you are decorating code with buzzwords.",

        "body": "This is very good, and I concur with the bulk of it. I think there's good reasons that Golang and Rust lean far more towards a model of \"These are the shapes of data structures and we describe them and then write functions to act on them\" (with a syntactic sugar to do method calls) than their predecessors. I'd also like to add one more thought in this space: as software engineering has cared more and more about the network and shipping data between execution domains, coupling data to behavior has fallen grossly out of favor because **behavior is local to an execution engine and data is not**. If my data is wrapped up in a class instance and I have to ship it over the wire, I now have to peel the \"shippable\" data from the \"unshippable,\" i.e. any dynamic method pointers, vtables, or other mechanisms to specify what class this is an instance of, and that's annoying. If your data is in a bog-standard language-supported generic structure, you can ship it to a bog-standard language-supported generic marshaller and be done with the problem of getting it on and off the wire.\n\nI think I'd like to tune your thoughts a bit, because OOP conflates a couple of goals and we might want to talk about how we toss the bathwater without the baby.\n\n**Encapsulation and interface boundary**: You mention the challenge of \"re-opening\" a class to add new behavior. Some languages allow that! It's generally considered an anti-design. The reason is that being able to wall off code and say \"You can touch this via this mechanism and no other\" is a feature that enables large, decentralized teams to collaborate better by hiding details. If I hand you a Date object with methods, you do not need to care how I'm implementing the methods (with the tradeoff being the only things you can do with *my* Date object are the ones the interface exposes). This leaves me free to change my implementation without breaking you (maybe; see Hyrum's Law), and that's extremely important for being able to iterate to a solution because we almost never know how to write the best solution the first time. The humble `string` is actually my favorite example of this; crack the actual implementation of strings open in many high-level languages and you find that they're fascinatingly complicated (implementing things like caching and memory-reuse on string copy and substring so that the programmer doing the most obvious things with strings doesn't immediately torpedo program performance). If programmers touched the string internals directly, it would make using strings in those systems a nightmare. Golang has interfaces and structs instead of classes and objects, but it also has the rule that you can't write a function that acts directly on the contents of a struct if you aren't in the same module as the struct so that developers can't write code that depends directly on another developer's implementation without consent.\n\n**Discoverability**: So I have a struct. What can I do with it? How do I find all the functions that could be applied to that struct so I don't reinvent the wheel? In OOP, the answer is simple: the methods on the class and the parents of the class. In the data-and-functions paradigm... Good luck!\n\nIt's not quite that bad. It *was* when computers were slower and smaller, which is one of the reasons I think OOP took off when it did. Nowadays, with a language with good static typing and an LSP, you can find all functions that take a given data type as an argument (even grep will work in a pinch, although you'll have to do your own composition analysis). But OOP gives someone a big leg-up on the discovery problem by imposing a paradigm of how code is sorted.\n\nThough I highlight the above, I concur with OP: **you don't** ***need*** **OOP to get those things.** It's just worth noting that when you throw OOP out, you're throwing out a paradigm that tries to give you those things for free (well, for cheap... The documentation engines I've seen for Java factories kind of give the lie to the notion that OOP \"solves\" discoverability). The trick is to know what your plan is to get those things without OOP in the languages you plan to use.",

OOP is about message passing - which you've missed entirely, OOD is about object modeling, which is orthogonal to OOP and entirely at your discretion - I don't use it. Objects don't couple behavior with data, they couple behavior with state. You can use OOD to model data. You conflate objects with types, and your arguments are mostly about types. You misunderstand aggregation vs. composition. Your conclusion is confused, because ECS is an architecture you can implement regardless of your paradigm.\n\nYou do have one valid criticism of OOP, and that is due to the agency of the object. Each object is an island of one, which for batch processing is bad, and for stream processing is worse. While you can make a character object and a string object - to get adequate performance, you can't composite one in terms of the other, so you get a scaling problem that composition in FP solves.\n\nWhile I still say stick with FP, I can also say the difficulties you have suffered from OOP is due to your misunderstands. You're in the majority, and I would say this is one of the valid criticisms of OOP, as well.",

That's the OO part of it. Without interfaces and inheritance you aren't doing OO.

From that I conclude that coupling data with behaviour is the problem and should be avoided in the first place to avoid the design problems in the first place.\n\nTo counter that argument you would have to argue why that conclusion is not logical.

It means multiple tasks are literally running at the same time on different hardware resources.\n\nSo yes, parallelism is usually considered a subset of concurrency. A concurrent program may or may not run in parallel depending on the hardware and runtime. But a parallel program is inherently concurrent because multiple flows of control exist at once.\n\nYou’re also right that race conditions and deadlocks show up in both cases. They are properties of shared state and coordination, not of whether the CPU is single core or multi core. Even with context switching on one core, the interleaving can expose the same hazards.\n\nOne mental model that helps is: concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.",

        "body": "I'm working on a Kotlin math library for higher math. I was going to post my Cayley-Dickson construction to show how I generate the complex numbers from the field of real (double) numbers and then apply CD once again to get one of the six unital quaternionic (not commutative but still associative) involution division rings by doubling the complex numbers and mapping i to one of ±i, ±j, or ±k, but I would have to post too much code (a few dozen interfaces) to make it make sense, so instead, I'll post something more self-contained that will probably be more interesting to people here, i.e. the factoradic representation of a number.\n\nStill, it's a really cool algorithm and way to generate the \"Cayley-Dickson tower\" which creates an infinite sequence of algebras starting with the reals to create the complex numbers, the quaternions, the octonions, the sedenions, etc. without needing to explicitly code any of them.\n\nThe thing about Cayley-Dickson is that you lose \"nice properties\" every time you recurse:\n\nWhen you go from the Reals to the Complex, you lose ordering, but you do get an algebraically closed field, which is always nice. (Every polynomial has a root in the field, and thus splits.)\n\nWhen you go from the Complex to the Quaternions, you lose commutativity (so xy ≠ yx for all x, y).\n\nWhen you go from the Quaternions to the Octonions, you lose associativity (so x(yz) ≠ (xy)z for all x, y, z, but you still have alternativity, which is a weaker form where (xx)y = x(xy) and y(xx) = (yx)x for all x, y.)\n\nThe Sedenions are where the shit really hits the fan: you only have power associativity and you get nonzero divisors, i.e. ab = 0 where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson\\_construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4)\n\n**Instead: Factoradics**\n\nSo you know how normally, we write numbers in base 10, e.g. 1234?\n\nAnd then we can write them in hexadecimal and binary?\n\n1234 in hex is 0x4d2 and in binary it's 0b10011010010?\n\nWell, another representation of numbers is called factoradic and is based on factorials. The rightmost digit is always 0, and the number is written:\n\n    a_n * n! + a_{n-1} * (n-1)! + ... + a_1 * 1! + 0 * 0!\n\nwhere `0 ≤ a_i ≤ i` .\n\nThen 1234 in factoradic is:\n\n    1411200_!\n    = 1 * 6! + 4 * 5! + 1 * 4! + 1 * 3! + 2 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0!\n    = 720 + 480 + 24 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0\n    = 1234 (as expected in base-10)\n\nHere's my factoradic encoder / decoder and the explanation. Note that I prefer to use functional programming constructs when possible: hence why there are no loops here (tail call optimized recursion is my looping: in Kotlin, when you use the keyword val, you cannot reassign to a variable): hence why you see the `aux` function in encode. I (distastefully) use a MutableList all the same to avoid unnecessary list copies.\n\nI can't seem to paste it here (too long?) so I made a link to it:\n\n[https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS](https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS)\n\nReleased under the 3-Clause BSD License, but not of much use to you unless you implement your own Factorial implementation (and there's a reasonable bit of machinery there as I represent a few dozen integer sequences and arrays).\n\nRight now I just finished polynomial rings / semirings and am working on quotient rings / semirings / fields so I can get the full gamut of finite fields for combinatorial constructions, elliptic curve cryptography (and other forms), coding theory, linear feedback shift registers, etc, as well as implementing geometric lattices nicely and naturally using rings like ℤ\\[x\\]/(x\\^2 + x + 1) for the Eisenstein integers instead of jumping through hoops to replace ω\\^2 = -ω - 1.\n\n(Not a beginner: I started programming when I was five and I'm 48 now and work in space astronomy. I have a BSc and MSc in comp sci and a PhD in math, but I have lots of holes in my math background, so this has been a great way to fill them in and learn more and program challenging, fun algorithms.)",

This will likely not work running it directly from Android, but a suggestion:\n\nIf you're genuinely worried about songs disappearing off of YouTube (and I would be - it's happened to me so many times), I would cache the songs locally to my machine: check to see if the song exists locally, in which case, play it, and if not, download it using yt-dlp (a fork of the - I believe now dead - youtube-dl, which runs in Python):\n\n[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)\n\nI have the following alias set up on my MacBook Pro (should work on any machine). Substitute your browser in.\n\n    alias yt='yt-dlp -f '\\''bv+ba'\\'' --cookies-from-browser chrome --no-check-certificate'\n\nThen if you want, say, video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w) (you don't), you just exec:\n\n    yt \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w\"\n\nand it should download locally. Save it as \"XqZsoesa55w\" and search for that locally and play it if you have it, and if you don't, download it. (That actually downloads the video and the audio: you can also modify the alias to just download the audio if that's all you want.)\n\nYou can also download entire playlists by putting in a playlist. (Quotes are probably necessary in that case, and optional in the case of single songs / videos.)\n\nYou don't need a YouTube subscription or anything like that, but I recommend you be logged in (so the cookies will work).\n\nI have had way too many videos that I loved throughout the years get yoinked either by their creators or by YouTube, and I no longer risk that happening. Every time I find something I like or something educational that I want to check out at some point, I download the entire thing locally.\n\nThe other option would be to just keep going the way you are, still cache songs locally, and keep a log of any files that are no longer accessible. Just copy those to your Android device and if a song doesn't show up on YouTube, check your \"saved files\" to get whatever has been deleted.\n\nJust a suggestion so you don't get burned like me and my \"significant other\" have multiple times over the years.",

The definition of high and low level languages has shifted over the years as we have developed more and more languages.

This means that pretty much every programming language falls into the category of “high level”, with the exceptions of assembly and machine code “languages” (if you could call machine code a language). This means that even languages like C, are considered a high level language.

As long as a compiler exists for a target system, your C code will run largely the same on any system (assuming whatever libraries you use are similarly supported). I would say that your professor is largely correct, using this historical definition of high and low level language. However I would add the asterisk that some projects, most notably Linux, have plenty of source code written by humans in assembly. In this case, the assembly is still source code, but is still a low level language since it is dependent on the hardware it will run on. (In large projects like Linux, this often looks like writing the same functionality multiple times in assembly for each target hardware system. So while C code largely only has to be written once, you may find multiple implementations of the same functionality in multiple assembly languages)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language\n\nHowever, this distinction has somewhat shifted over the years and people some times use more relative terms like “high*er*” and “low*er*” level programming languages. These refer to how close or far to the hardware your language is abstracted away. So this means that while C is technically a high level language, it is often perceived as “low*er*” level than something like python. You’ll even see some people say that C is generally a “low*er*” level language. However these distinctions are largely semantic and don’t have much real meaning, especially when you’re first learning. I would not get caught up on these.\n\nThe difference however between an interpreted and compiled language is completely different, and also in the modern day, much more complex. Generally speaking, an interpreter is any program that takes as an input some source code, and executes it without first compiling it to machine code. (Ripped from the first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))) A compiler is then any program that takes source code in one language as an input, and outputs code in another language. However, almost always, this looks like translating a higher level language, into a lower level language, typically from a strictly high level language, into a strictly low level language (like C -> assembly).\n\nSo the 2 concepts are somewhat related, but there is no exact relationship between them. Modern compilers and interpreters are much more complex and have many stages that translate source code through many different levels of abstraction. And, modern programming languages have started blurring the lines between what is seen as higher level and lower level.",

You might write a `mov` statement, but which specific instruction you get is dependent on it's parameters.\n\nHigh level languages target abstract machines and are portable. C++, for example, targets an abstract, byte addressable stack machine, two's compliment signed integers, little-endian, etc. So byte offset and bit manipulation on up - calling conventions, etc, all that is beyond the language, and must be defined by the implementation. So if your machine is word-addressable, the compiler has to translate byte addressing into words in some way.\n\nLanguages can affect architecture; C++03 is THE DEFINITION of the x64 Itanium ABI, and is standard for the hardware, which was designed around it. That doesn't some how lower the level of the language on that particular platform.\n\nSo it doesn't matter if the language is compiled or interpreted. You can build an interpreter around a virtual Turing Complete stack machine that runs an assembly. Or you can JIT compile an interpreted language like Java or C#, neither execution actually affects the high level nature of either language.",

        "body": "I'll list some things that might make you consider using message brokers, not in order of importance and not in a mumbo jumbo scientific way.\n\n1. A message broker is a separate, usually unchanging service\n\nThis means that redeploying your service has no effect on receiving data and storing event data.  \nYou could argue that writing events to a database is the same - and you'd be right, however we're not done yet!\n\n  \n2. Let's take a topic exchange as an example, you've created your topic exchange and have many routing keys for it. One of these routing keys is lets say for messages indicating that a payment has been completed.\n\nOne day, you'd like to send these payments to a fraud detection company (totally random example, I'm still having coffee), you could make the most barebones service that simply registers a new queue/binding to this exchange listening to the same routing key your main service already listens - and you'll receive a copy of all the payment events.\n\nThis plug and play style once your messaging system is set up is really comfortable and doesn't require extra work apart from occasionally adding a new field to your message.\n\n3. Manual acknowledgement + outbox/inbox patterns for your messages/events is intuitive and safe to work with  . Retries are handled with minimal work from your side with the correct configuration for your queue - connectivity issues and the like can be glossed over and you can define a threshold for dead letters where you'll actually have to think if messages reach there - but little connectivity issues or temporary outages don't really hurt you.\n\n  \n4. It's super easy to scale! Apart from being able to plug different consumers into the same routing key to get copies of messages to do different things with them you can also plug multiple (usually identical) instances of a consumer to a single queue so they can fairly share the work. It's really simply to dynamically scale this by adding or removing consumers to a queue that isn't doing the work fast enough.\n\n4.5-ish. Like you already mentioned and as it might be a bit obvious it really helps keep your system tidy(er) where each instance can just do its own thing and if you need something *else* you just make something fresh and connect it without bogging down your existing services with more responsibilities.\n\n  \nObviously it's not all sunshine and rainbows and you can easily make a sprawling mess of events flying all over the place and eventual consistency does have its own considerations.\n\n",

If the API actually also does stuff (goes to the kitchen and makes the stuff requested), it stops being interactive for that duration, which is its primary job. So the API delegates as much work as possible to keep being interactive, the work is done via queues and message brokers.\n\nIn short, any (real) work should not be done by the API, it should get done by something else.

Like imagine there are multiple instances of your application each with their own local in memory queue, a message might be sent to both and the work is duplicated or some consistency criteria might even break. You can have this sync without queues but if you need queues anyways, just using a service for queues that can observe all the events is massively helpful.\n\n4) the queue can scale independently \n\n5) observability, you have once central logical place where the queues report to even if internally they are all running in different physical/virtual systems. So you can then do 2nd level of adaptations based on the state of your queues. A queue suddenly having way too many events in it from normal might be signalling an issue somewhere else.",

        "body": "I'm not entirely sure what I should picture under \"robot sumo competition\" but I have a bit of experience in foundational robotics in my CS degree.\n\nTo answer your questions: Yes, you can use a camera and a bunch of methods to recognize things. OpenCV is a widespread standard image processing library. You can do C++ but I honestly would say the adapter to Python would probably be a bit more easier to handle because you can use Python for ML stuff as well if you want to, even if Python isn't exactly the fastest.\n\nOne of the problem you really need to figure out first is to determine the boundary of the problem. What do you mean when you say \"front\" and \"back\" of a robot?\n\nIf the competition has defined features of a robot, you can use that to determine what constitutes front and back. Using standard or advanced image processing algorithms are going to be an option in this case.\n\nA very straight-forward case would be if the competition requires every robot to show some sort of marker for the front facing side. You can use some variant of HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) or if its more complicated SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) to get a decently robust feature detection for the front-side and then deduct that the absence of that feature plus something else like rotational tracking will be the back-side.\n\nYou can also try the Generalized Hough Transform (although that one might be a bit too slow for pictures with too many pixels).\n\nAll 3 algorithms are implemented in OpenCV I think (although if not, you can certainly just build them yourself using the OpenCV toolkit).\n\nBut If robots can look arbitrary and you cannot say that there is some sort of fixed recognizable features, the detection is going to be tricky and OpenCV will not solve your problem. In the latter case, I would honestly consider resorting to machine learning. Retraining CNNs for classification can yield pretty decent results. You would need to have a decently sized training set of images of competition robots fronts and back. You would then do the pre-processing in OpenCV and then pass it on to the model or if you have something integrated like from Nvidia's developer suite, maybe use their stuff.\n\nThe problem with the ML approach is that you need a decently powerful compute platform on your robot. Even if the majority of computation happens at training phase, processing and then prediction still takes decent amount of compute power. Small embedded systems with a good GPU to handle matrix operations are necessary while not being power hungry monsters.\n\nYour other question is a bit vague: What do you mean \"friend or foe system\" for \"recognizing yourself\"?",

The simplest way to detect front and back is to add asymmetric markers to each robot, like a colored patch on one end or distinct shapes, so orientation can be inferred from the contour or marker positions. For friend or foe, you can give your robot a unique color pattern or fiducial marker and track that specifically, which avoids relying on pure shape detection.\n\nSince you are new to CV, I would start with basic color thresholding and contour detection in OpenCV before jumping into anything fancy. Real time performance in C++ should be fine if your frame size and processing pipeline stay reasonable. The biggest challenge will probably be lighting consistency and tuning thresholds, not the math itself.",

At some point you might specialize, but right now you just need experience using programming to solve any problem at all. \n2. Honestly C is an old language and not many working programmers today would choose it unless it was a very niche thing. The main reason is that C programs are relatively tricky for things like memory management and concurrency. C also doesn't have many features that modern languages have. That is actually why I mentioned Rust, which meant as a kind of modern C replacement. Rust is similar to C, but it has many cool features and still is very fast and runs \"close to the metal\" like C does.\n   * The general answer to the question of \"what is good to write in C (or Rust)?\" is: anything that has to run very fast and/or in limited environments like embedded systems (eg raspberry pi)\n   * a different answer could be a math-heavy problem. Something that uses a lot of data and does a lot of calculations on it very fast.\n3. Creating your own language is a great thing to try. I suggest trying it after you have learned a few different ones. After all, how will you know what kind of language you want to build if you have never experienced writing any language?\n4. I'm not sure I can answer the core of the creative block problem. I first got into programming because I wanted something to exist that didn't. I had a problem and the only way to solve my problem was to write a program to solve it. I'm not sure how you would come from the other direction, with a solution in search of a problem. I guess my advice to think about what you wish existed.\n5. Finally, I would not worry about \"knowing what you need to know.\" When I started with my problem I knew nothing at all. You will learn what you need to know as you go step by step through the problem you're trying to solve. At each step you will not know what to do, and you'll figure it out by searching, then you'll move on to the next step and repeat the process over and over until the problem is solved.",

Plus another button to delete the inputs if their are wrong and i'd like to make them dependent on the previous input. So basically you put your name first, then the dropdown for the station becomes visible, you select the station and depending on the station, the next dropdown only shows the robots which are located in that station. You choose the robot and the next dropdown only shows part which are build onto your selected robot. So there is no chance to pick something which wouldn't make sense (we have lot of entries on our current list, which are false because the part isnt used on that robot). The other department has much more variations on stations, robots and parts so the cross-checking does make sense for them, but not for us and also with my idea of preselecting the inputs it would be obsolet aswell. \n\nMaybe i put that incorrectly and the code itself isnt confusing for an expert on that matter, but for me (and my skilllevel) it is.

Some of the guys who made FoundationDB's testing framework have created a company called Antithesis which is doing some really interesting stuff in testing entire systems.  \n  \n Anyway those are just some examples of topics I'm trying to learn more about myself. Knowing some JS will be helpful because so many people use it and ultimately we need frontends to actually make products people want to use.

So I can make a variable and inside of that variable can be a number of different functions.\n\nIn C you can pass data around, but you cannot pass a function (behavior, it’s not ‘data’). You can technically but it’s not a callable object which is what you’re actually asking.\n\nSo I can’t make a List or an Array and inside of that array put a function… I also can’t pass them as a parameter to be the input into another totally separate function. \n\nIn Dart or JS and most modern-ish languages a function are treated as an object just like any other data like a var or a const, so you can manipulate them the same exact way.\n\nSo if I have a function that does something to an array of numbers, an then sends those numbers out to be updated in real time, it’ll have specifics like who’s logged in, and who’s looking at what. It’ll be a huge function. But I may want to manipulate that data in a certain way before that function executes and send those numbers out.\n\nMaybe I want the numbers converted to a different currency, or rounded, or cut off any number below X or above Y, so I make my function.\n\nCoreFunction forEachItem(nums, SpecialBehaviorFunction5) and then the rest of that function.\n\nI may have 14 different “special behavior functions” that I’m going to use, and that gets passed to this core function 5000 times a minute.\n\nSo this makes writing and compositing the code way easier and way easier to think about as well because I don’t have a ton of classes or function sitting around scattered. I’ve got the core function, the special behavior function, and some function that decides what special behavior function to pass to the core function.\n\nThat’s the easiest way I can explain it for now but I’ll keep thinking for a concrete example.",

Pull raw data with SQL, clean and transform it in pandas, then rebuild the visuals with matplotlib or seaborn. It forces you to understand what the BI tool was abstracting away.\n\nA solid starter project is a small end to end analysis on a public dataset. For example, take a sales or e commerce dataset, write SQL queries for KPIs, load the results into pandas, do some feature engineering, and produce a short narrative with visuals. Treat it like you’re presenting to a stakeholder.\n\nIf you want something more exploratory, try analyzing your own habits. Track expenses, workouts, or study time in a simple database. Query it with SQL, then use pandas to find trends and seaborn to visualize patterns. Personal data makes it easier to stay motivated.\n\nThe key is not just plotting charts, but practicing the full workflow: question, query, clean, analyze, explain. That’s what really builds analysis muscle.",

It just points at it, thus, the sign can change to point at anything else that’s real. But the sign will never be the thing that it’s pointing at. \n\nIn C, pointers point at memory addresses. The memory houses the actual real data by (at the most basic level) cutting it into chunks where data is then housed(also called pages). \nYour pointer can point at the beginning of such chunk and then you can ask the pointer to move forward or backward through the memory to reveal the whole chunk.",

The pointer for the array stores the address of the very first element in the array - and here is where the \"0-based\" array indexing comes from. Since the elements are stored in a contiguous memory block and have a fixed size depending on the data type, it's easy to figure  out where the elements are: `base address + (index * size)`. You know the *base address* - the pointer, you know the *index* - the element you want to access, you know the *size*, which is determined by the data type. That's it.\n\nPointers are extremely useful, but more modern languages (or more modern implementations of languages) often *hide* them away from the user so that they don't have to deal with them. In C++, you have *smart pointers*, you have *references*, which are just extensions to pointers.",

With the new year, people are really dissecting annual reports of publicly traded companies, and after ~5 years of this bubble, no major player has reported a positive ROI on AI software integration. Not one.\n\nWe're seeing ~$22 billion in technical debt created by AI, because the slop they generated can't be understood by people. This is important, because the industry is finally really coming around to understand - you can't hold AI accountable.\n\nIf a corporation loses shareholder value, causes damages, or kills people, C-levels and employees can be held personally accountable. There was a time I was responsible for 60% of all option trading on Earth, can you just imagine the concrete shoes I'd be wearing at the bottom of some lake right now if I allowed AI to speak on my behalf? Where did all the money go? I dunno, Boss; I asked the AI and they don't know, either. How does this work? I dunno, Boss, the AI made it, and every time I ask, it remakes it in a different way...\n\nWe're also seeing the employment pendulum swing the other way. That technical debt we've accrued so far is going to take a decade to un-fuck, and we're still going with it, so there will be work for the rest of MY career...\n\nAnd things lag, so there's still a feeling of uncertainty that everyone is acting on, and employers are taking advantage of that while they can by offering low wages since it's still a saturated, employer's market. As the employee market dries up, those salaries are going to pick back up. That things are actively changing isn't a secret, if you know where to look and who to ask.\n\n> Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?\n\nI'm not quite sure how to interpret this one, yet. Businesses thought they'd replace junior level work with AI, but that means entry level positions would be essentially senior architect roles, basically what you're suggesting - and how can you do that without the experience?\n\nSo AI has caused some damage, and there will be a gap in employee demographics as we took a whack at 5 years of college grads who didn't find their footing in the middle of this bungling market experiment. They'll all be off into other markets, or set back from missing 5 years critical experience. If you've invested 5 years into something else while this market figures its shit out, you're probably better off sticking to that, rather than finally kick-starting a late career.\n\n> I see that companies are mostly hiring senior engineers these days, but if there aren't enough junior engineers, who will they hire are seniors in the future? ( sorry if this sounds silly ) \n\nThat's a very real question, and the answer is they're going to pay out the ear for the mistake, in the long run.\n\nCompanies are hiring seniors for two reasons:\n\n1) Trump. He's a bad actor, a Russian asset; he has grifted and pilfered this government and economy, intentionally destroyed it in ways that cannot be explained by economics or incompetence alone, and he's such a wildcard, that everyone is just buckling down and hoping to survive this administration, until we can get back to \"business as usual\". And to conservatives and authoritarians of the regime who disagree - you're evil.\n\n2) Corporate interest rates went up from 0% 3 years ago, and then the massive layoffs started happening. It wasn't due to AI. Zero interest corporate loans are federal subsidies to grow the economy. You fork off a subsidiary of your conglomerate, spend the money, develop the tech, and when the money runs out, you fold the subsidiary tied to the loan - taking the debt with it. But the parent company keeps all the IP. This scheme is over for FAANG, but not for smaller corporations - so expect some underdog success stories.\n\n> how will software work envolve in the future?\n\nAI won't go anywhere. But like outsourcing to a Sally Struthers country for pennies on the dollar, you don't outsource anything actually important. It has to be able to fail to deliver, or do what it's supposed to, and that has to be OK. It can be an aid, if it can generate simple code that is faster to verify than it is to write. It'll be useful for refactoring, permuting, generating (but not implementing) protocols, other things.\n\n> What should we learn to day to avoid getting stuck in the future?\n\nStick to the fundamentals. Get good at math. The one thing AI can never do is think, and that's on you to learn.",

It also looks like they are running into scaling issues aand quickly approaching the upper limit of what LLMs are realistically capable of, without having any new developments (meaning new architectures) up their sleeves. My prediction would be that most of us will use LLMs for coding in 5 years, but not for vibe coding. Stuff like autocomplete and boilerplate. \n\n>Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?\n\nThis is actually a real issue, because junior devs have a harder time getting used to codebases and companies now that their normal tasks have been partially automated, and they are expected to start immediately with more advanced tasks. \n\n>how will software work envolve in the future? What should we learn to day to avoid getting stuck in the future? thanks in advance for your answers.\n\nbasically just learn the same things we did. The skills are not really different, using an LLM as a small help in coding is not really a skill you need to learn. You need to know how software works, how to write and evaluate it etc. just as we did back before LLMs were big. AI doesn't enable you to build more complex software, it helps you do the easy things slightly faster (sometimes(TM)). ",

It's not 100% related to your end goal, but a cheap and easy starting point. Arduino Starter Kits (including the actual Arduino system) are in the range of $50 to $100 and you get lots of hardware (sensors, LEDs, motors, etc.) to play around with.\n\nMaybe, ask also in guitar or synthesizer related subreddits, or in the embedded ones, like /r/esp32, /r/arduino, /r/esp8266, /r/nodeMCU, and so on. /r/vsti and /r/synthesizers with their related subreddits could also be viable resources.\n\nAlso, my general advice would be to focus on *learning programming* first, and there, since you will need C++ use https://learncpp.com\n\nWe normally don't suggest C++ as first language as it is a difficult language to get into. Normally, we recommend Python (with the MOOC [Python Programming 2026](https://programming-26.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki), but that would not get you in the direction you want. You'll most likely have to bite the bullet and go in the hard way.\n\nWhat you will also need are really solid mathematical foundations of higher concepts. You'll need to go into waveforms, maybe FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation), maybe DFT (Discrete Fourier Transformation), and a lot more. Synthesis and Signal Processing use higher mathematical concepts. You'll need to work with sampling intervals, ADC (Analog to Digital Converters), and DAC (Digital to Analog Converters) and much more. You'll also need to have some musical understanding about the frequencies, etc.",

For pedals/synth hardware most people start with something approachable like Arduino or Teensy boards because they let you write C/C++ and interact with real components without drowning in low-level complexity, and from there you gradually understand how microcontrollers talk to knobs, switches, audio signals, etc. It really just comes down to writing code that reads inputs and controls outputs, and the toolchains make that less scary than it sounds. Honestly the best move right now is hands-on experimentation — build a tiny audio or control project, not your dream device — because that’s where the mental model forms.

If you use a public variable, you could just do something like 'vol = 200;' you want to limit volume between 0 and 100. You thus use a setter that has validation built in so you can't set it to whatever you like. Later you then prevent yourself (or someone else) from accidentally writing an incorrect or impossible value. \n\n\n2. Keeping code lean:\nSometimes variables might only be internally used in the class. I might not need to know specific information, in those cases just setting the variable private prevents it from showing up in your IDE and or documentation, keeping things leaner\n\n\n3. Magic numbers: Magic numbers (or magic strings) are plain numbers in your code. Say you want to give a spefic tag or ID to something, and you write 'var = 5;'. The '5' could be turned into a variable and made private. This to reduce magic numbers, and allow easier modification later. (hand in hand with #2) \n\n\n4. Coding standards/consistency:\nThe common pattern of private variable with a public getter/setter is used for lots of reasons (including above) Because of this sometimes it sorta makes sense to just apply this to variables that might not really benefit from the approach, just to keep your API consistent.",

Not all users have the same security clearance, so you might need to filter a list so they only see what their clearance allows them to see.

Code all over your program can still effectively (but indirectly) cause reads/writes to the memory of instance data, but that indirection of external code having to go through member functions to do so means that you get to define those interactions, essentially providing an interface for mutating state over time, rather than possibly having many parts of the application make a grab for members. Where you need to guarantee things or you have invariants etc. this can matter a lot. C doesn't have protected/private struct (same as class in C++) members, and I don't know any C programmers who particularly care, myself included. Where it is needed in languages that don't have it, you see idioms like \"pimpl\" etc. to hide things, but they also introduce runtime overhead. It's nice to have compile-time enforcement without runtime cost. It can be very handy when refactoring not to have references to member data everywhere too.\n\nI've tried not to lecture on encapsulation because you can find that anywhere online.\n\nSide note: it's rarely useful to use private over protected. Protected will encapsulate whilst allowing you to derive without having to change code in the base (from private to protected). In the common case you want derived classes to have access to things in their base class.",

Your requirements are specified by the professor and do not change. *At worst*, the professor will provide an additional assignment that requires you to build upon your existing work (and this is steadily becoming rarer because we continue to lower our standards in CS programs).\n2. Maintenance of the project lasts for approximately one term, at which point your code goes into a folder with all the other projects, never to be touched again.\n3. The only people who will use your code are yourself and maybe some groupmates.\n\nSo - fixed requirements, short timeframes, with no customers. Let's change that.\n\n---\n\nPeople dispute exactly when the C++ standard library became \"the standard library,\" but cppreference says 1992, and that sounds pretty reasonable. This breaks all three of the above items:\n\n* Its requirements change over time because the platforms and operating systems that people use will change. \n* The maintenance time is indefinite (34 years and counting, and despite the hype over Rust on this site, extremely likely to be another 34 years and counting).\n* Billions of people depend on it, however indirectly (literally everyone with a web browser).\n\nIf you read the code for, say, `std::istream`, you're going to find A Gigantic Mess. You care about none of that. You care about the [public methods specified by the standard](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream.html), which should not change. And, indeed, they generally have not changed for the 30+ years that this language has existed, and they probably won't change much in the next 30 years.\n\nAt the same time, people are always looking to eke out more performance. If they find a tool to get more performance, they are going to use it. They might not care, despite their better judgment, that they are taking advantage of an implementation detail that could change at any time. This tendency is summed up as [Hyrum's Law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/), which states\n\n> With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.\n\nAccess specifiers establish boundaries. If you make something public, that **locks the maintainers** into preserving that thing for all time (30 years and counting. Choose wisely!) Making it private means that you can mess with it however you want. Change it every version if you want. All changes to `public` are breaking changes and will likely get you roundly cursed 30 years from now.",

Your team member that made the stripe branch should be able to use reflog on their own local client to find the branch they merged into main.\n\nOnce they've found it, you can `git checkout` right to the reflog's hash code to make it current, `git checkout -b name` to give it a new name, and then merge it into main (the approach I'd use to that merge is probably `git rebase main` first to put stripe as the most recent change, but different teams have different approaches).\n\nAs far as preventing merges straight into main: if you're using GitHub, it's possible to flag a branch as protected so that, for example, it can only be merged into with pull requests. If you're self-hosting, the bare branch on the server has a pre-receive hook that can be used to reject someone trying to push their main to server's main.",

That's a long term goal, don't even think about it yet. \n\nSo choose a platform: web or desktop? You can do desktop apps with Java easily enough. If you're going web, Java isn't going to enter the picture unless you're designing something with a front end communicating with a back end, which, again, is probably too ambitious as a starting point. So choose a platform for your UI and figure out how to mock something up that looks vaguely like what you want the game to look like. It doesn't need to be pretty, you can always revisit and iterate as you learn. So your ui might just be a playing field and a row of cards at the bottom to start. \n\nThen define your game rules -- simple rules are fine for starters. \"Cards have a cost assigned to them and a player can only play cards they have the necessary resources to play\" for example. So implement the logic necessary to check player resources, subtract spent resources, generate new resources, whatever.",

Controlling the playback with an on-screen UI moght need more complex software but if no control is needed a simple script might work.\n\nThe raspberry pi doesn't normally have power controls though so it will be continuously playing even when the TV is off. But as a \"dumb\" video player that your parents only need to switch to HDMI to watch,, it could work.",

Less magic, but fewer surprises when delivery logic gets complex.\n\n",

So every mutation being done is there, never a save/update from a serializer or view itself. \n\nMy reasoning in general is that business logic should be callable easily from the django shell or a management command as well as a REST view. It makes unit testing easier as well.\n\n**Services**\n\nI put them in a folder like this as separate functions that can include other services:\n\n[https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/tree/main/backend/wdb\\_wallpaper/services](https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/tree/main/backend/wdb_wallpaper/services)\n\nYou can add additional sub folders there when a specific part is more complex\n\nThen i call them using the full path: `wdb_wallpaper.services.wallpaper.set_ai_generated_description(wallpaper=wallpaper)`\n\nYou can also use classes, but i would keep them stateless.\n\n**Services in views**\n\nI dont have the best example because this project doesnt have create/update calls from the API:\n\n[https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/blob/main/backend/wdb\\_wallpaper/api/views.py](https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/blob/main/backend/wdb_wallpaper/api/views.py)\n\nInstead of letting serializers save, i would use the arguments/object from the serializer and put them manually in the service. Here i did that with a search argument, but you can also do that for create and update.\n\nIm not sure if i would put all 'get' / queries in the service layer like i did here, but maybe in a 'selectors' folder like this style guide describes: [https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide?tab=readme-ov-file#selectors](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide?tab=readme-ov-file#selectors)",

        "body": "I've been working professionally as a Software Engineer for a little over a year but have 10 years of experience in the real professional working world. And here's the truth: people don't have even have the slightest clue of what they're talking about.\n\nOriginally I studied Finance and Accounting. My first job was at a Big 4 public accounting firm in 2016, they demoed an AI agent that could do our job to show they were \"cutting edge.\" Did we use it? No. We used excel workbooks that have been around longer than your grandma's fridge. Did we leverage Python, VBA, and so on to work better and faster like I knew how to do? No. Some of these people could barely move around a single sheet in Excel.\n\nThen I worked at a F500 company. In addition to regular accounting and finance work, tried as much as possible to automate. I tried to do things better, faster, more efficiently. I wrote \"shadow apps\" (not managed by the dev teams) for other financial analysts and accountants as the massive dev teams we had didn't have \"capacity\".  Eventually I hit a wall and essentially there was so much I wanted to incorporate and change but was denied the tools needed to deploy and maintain them. Basically \"sorry you're not an SWE so we can't give you access.\" So I left and now I'm building financial systems and doing meaningful work as a SWE and getting my masters in CS. And making more than I did before and happier.\n\nHere's my takeaway: you will be stunned to see how SLOW companies adopt tech outside of big tech companies. Even if you TRY you'll hit resistance.\n\nIf you have a desire to build a solution, you will have a job. If people on this sub or the vibe coding subs think an accountant at a F500 company will use Claude Code to vibe up a solution, I'm sorry but it will not happen about 90% of the time. If they didn't write basic Python scripts before, they are not vibe coding now. Anyone that believes that will happen are either delusional or have never actually worked outside of tech roles.\n\nAnd a final note: I could have automated 80% of my work as an accountant and financial analyst pre-AI. The only people to look at that career path as bulletproof are tech people who never worked in that field or tried to get a job in it.",

If a company wants to be somewhere, they'll lease property.  If a company doesn't want or need to be somewhere, they'll let leases expire.  And then everything else falls into line with the leases.\n\n10 years ago, every smart CFO advocated very long leases to reduce lease rates.  Now that companies have been shown that they don't need people onsite, every smart CFO is recommending that the company only renew very essential leases and let the rest expire.  This is a corporate finance tectonic shift on par with switching to defined-contribution retirement plans (late '90's) and switching to unlimited PTO (late '00's).\n\nIf you like working there, make yourself as valuable as you can.  It still might not make the difference, but it usually does.  If your boss can say about you to their boss \"I can't succeed without this person\", then you are usually safe.  That's your goal...if you want to stay there.\n\nAnd in a few years when your company's leases expire, then leadership will say that they've discovered or realized that WFH is a vital part of work life balance or whatever stupid way they have of justifying what is ultimately a financial, lease-centric decision.",

Eventually after close to 600 applications some 11-12 months after graduation I got my first offer! I too had that realization that “I was not going to give up till I had that offer”. I think after I made that decision I was applying to upwards of 10-15 jobs a day. \n\nI wish you all the luck, try to make sure your employer extends an offer to you!",

We don’t have fewer accountants after Excel, we have accountants doing different work. Code generation tools make certain tasks faster, which means engineers tackle bigger problems or more projects, not that companies need 80% fewer engineers.\n\nThe skills that matter are shifting toward system design, understanding business problems, debugging AI-generated code, and knowing when the AI solution is wrong or suboptimal. Junior engineers who can use AI tools effectively while understanding fundamentals will outperform those who either reject AI or blindly trust it. The job becomes more about judgment and architecture than syntax.\n\nFocus on areas harder to automate: distributed systems, security, performance optimization, and domain expertise in complex fields like healthcare or finance. Build things AI can’t easily replicate yet, like deep understanding of legacy systems or cross-functional communication skills. The engineers who get displaced are those who only knew how to translate requirements into boilerplate code. \n\nNobody can predict timelines accurately, but historically tech revolutions create more jobs than they eliminate, just different ones. The transition period is uncomfortable and some roles disappear, but demand for people who can build and maintain software systems keeps growing even as the nature of that work evolves.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I won’t speak to if phD holders are better or worse than staff engineers cus I only have anecdotal evidence but the staff engineers I work with are just incredible.\n\nI went on a business trip with this E6 who was very quiet. I knew they were a 6 but didn’t quite understand why, as I had never worked directly with them and they always just seemed to listen and didnt really speak. I figured they were just coding machines. As soon as we got a client in front of us it was immediately clear why they were a 6. The questions and follow up questions they were asking on a whim would take me an entire day to come up with and yet the questions seemed so obvious and simple. Then they were able to consolidate all of the information into learnings and built out an entire roadmap. \n\nIt felt like they were capable of thinking in a way I will never be able to.\n\nWe hired an external E6 last year as my teams tech lead. Within 3 months he had more context on every single engineers work than the engineers themselves.

They specialise in different aspects. And there’s nothing ruling out someone from switching between should they want to change roles. I thought this was common sense tbh.",

Offshoring jobs to \"cheaper\" places means that those places  become less cheap over time because increasing demand for actual skilled talent which is generally not too high in supply causes salaries abroad to increase and the cost of living to likewise increase from the capital being sent there. It's the reason why tech salaries in a lot of offshore locations like Eastern Europe and Latin America have jumped dramatically in recent years. Not only that, but there's nothing really to suggest that \"expensive\" countries couldn't just lower salaries domestically. This is honestly something that everyone on these subs seem to miss and I don't know why. It may be argued that nobody in such countries would be willing to work for a fair amount less if it came to that, but if push comes to shove, I think it is reasonable to assume that there would be a lot of people willing to do so because otherwise it might mean not having a job. Also:\n\n\\> Over time, those countries will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.\n\nYeah, no that's very likely not going to happen.

Something in your application materials is triggering an automatic rejection before human eyes ever see them. The fact that your network connections got you interviews proves you can perform when given the chance, so the barrier is purely at the screening stage.\n\nSix resume rewrites might actually be hurting you if each version strays further from ATS optimization. Consider this: get your most recent version reviewed by someone currently hiring in tech, not just resume writers. They’ll spot what’s causing the auto-rejections. Also, gaps on your resume or the layoff itself might need different framing. Some companies filter out anyone currently unemployed, which is brutal but real\n\nYour tech stack isn’t the problem since those skills are still in demand. More likely it’s resume formatting breaking ATS parsers, missing keywords that match job descriptions exactly, or your experience level falling into an awkward middle zone where you’re overqualified for junior roles but competing with seniors.\n\nStop applying to undervalued positions immediately. That signals desperation and companies assume you’ll leave when something better appears. Focus on contract or freelance work to fill the gap while maintaining your search. Breaking the unemployment streak often unlocks opportunities faster than anything else.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

You’re basically going to get squeezed in the middle. \n\n6) Which brings me to my next point: you’re young enough and smart enough to pivot to a different career at this point. The reality is that AI and offshoring are eviscerating the SWE job market at an astonishing rate and we’re simply never catching up. There is no shame in pivoting to a different field.",

That's not on you and it's a sucky position.\n\nI'll caveat this by saying that a lot of people aren't comfortable with this much honesty, but if I were you I think I'd apply for entry level jobs and be prepared to tell recruiters the truth about your experience. The right employer will look at your experience and your eagerness to do real SWE work and see someone worth investing time in. It probably won't be a big tech company, maybe not a big company period, but at this point you just need someone who is willing to take you on for your qualities beyond raw experience. \n\nI can only speak to my own experience, but I'm a mostly self taught SWE who switched from a completely unrelated field and have managed to do pretty well for myself at this point, but the thing that made my career growth possible was that I spent the first 4 years of my software career at a tiny startup that just wanted hard workers willing to learn. It wasn't my favorite product or anything and it didn't pay that well, but it let me be neck deep in code day in and day out. \n\nIf you can find something like that and really grind it out for a couple of years I think you can catch up pretty quickly.",

        "body": "I have worked at 3 jobs in my career. Mid-sized DoD company as my first, second was not FAANG but it's one that i personally would say is at the same level as FAANG (or mag7) and the third and current is big tech. I wouldnt consider it the same tier as FAANG but i would say it's a tier just under FAANG. \n\nTo answer the question, i tdepends. I've never worked startup but i've heard startups have similar culture. But what i will say on each company i feel like it's general for each type of company.\n\nDoD- at DoD, this was super chill. The work felt meaningful but the work was also super chill. Like i could sit on a task for a month, work 8 hour days where half the day i twiddled my thumbs and still get good reviews at the end of 6 months. I remember getting to my project and it was a year away from being \"complete\" and it took us 3 years to complete it and nobody was mad or batted an eye. It was a poorly run project because everybody just wanted to do 8 hours and go home. Nobody was really trying to go all out for them. The pay wasnt the best but it was good. I would recommend DoD to anybody who likes CS but doesnt love it to want to learn new systems, new code, etc. Just wants to get their day done and go home and not htink about work. But it'sv ery easy to get behind the times and not move ahead in your career. You will get promoted pretty quickly but wont learn much really. Nobody even sends an email after 5 pm.\n\nFAANG level - when i left DoD i wanted more pay and to learn more. It was a huge culture shock. I went to cloud services. The company i worked for was known for having work life balance but I didnt ralize cloud is where that dies. It was super competitive. A SWE2, did twice as much work as a senior at DoD did. I made good money but god it sucked. Seniors and up were so booked they had no time to help juniors. Reviews were not based on what was expected it was based on how you compared ot your coworkers. I literally got in my review, \"his coworkers do more than him\" becaus ei didnt work 60 hour weeks like osme of them. That wasnt the reason but whne most are doing 60 and you are doing 40 it shows in the work. I got laid off and honestly didnt even miss it. If you werent sending emails or getting at calls at like 8pm you were behind. It felt like you always had to be available. \n\nBig tech - i got a job in big tech and was making more than i was at FAANG. Honestly it's been great because the work is meanigful, i work for a cloud service that's big but not as big as the faang one. But because it's not as big, nobody feels overworked. For the first ime iin years i had people say \"dude it's 6pm go home\". It's a good level of feeling like youa re doing meaningful work and not feeling like you have to work 60 hours to keep up. \n\n  \nSo i will say, even if the work isnt as meaningful or worldwide as FAANG, you can definetely work at places and do meaningful work. Every company to some degree is meaningful, just some more than others. ",

If, with 5 yoe you cannot out-compete any ai, that, too, is a you-problem.  \n  \nI'm not being snarky - you are doing something very, very wrong. It might be an easy fix.

A lot of people believe LLMs are the silver bullet from that and can eventually replace human support agents. However banks also have to deal with a lot of regulation and tend to have a mountain of internal controls which hamstring their AI efforts. There's still a lot of ML being done at a bank in other areas including credit scoring, risk modeling, and fraud or anomaly detection; but it's not groundbreaking stuff and honestly it's kind of a solved problem at this point so you don't hear much about it.\n\nMy personal take is if you want to actually do ML engineering you should aim higher than ML at a bank.",

Because of this belief, along with the price of LLMs (for now) everyone is just implementing the existing offering because it is seen as a \"no-brainer\".\n\nIt is my belief that this will not continue.\n\nFirstly, the prices of LLMs will go up, how much by? No-one outside of those companies know definitively.\n\nSecondly, LLMs are shit and need constant monitoring and verification, which most people don't do and even fewer do well. This will cause (and probably already is causing) quite a lot of very avoidable pitfalls and designs.\n\nThirdly, LLMs discourage you from thinking, just about anything. There has not been a single study that has proven the opposite, only this point.\n\nSo I guess to answer your question, everyone is lying about ML at the moment because LLMs are a cash cow the likes of which hasn't been seen for quite a while; far wider reaching than crypto or similar fads.\n\nThings will change though one way or another.\n\nAlso, any of you cock wombles who want to tell me I'm wrong, I will be ignoring you unless you can back up your claims with data.\n\nEdit: changed AI to LLMs",

So the degree requirement is part of a generalised move to standardise data science and put a level of assurance to baseline expectations of skills. \n\nIn addition, AI has obviously changed the hiring field and a big concern of employers is hiring someone shit that is propped up by AI.

CTEs are worth learning though since they make complex queries much more readable and interviewers appreciate clean code.\n\n  \nOne tip for practice: try converting everyday questions into SQL queries.

I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.\n\nOMSCS is not going to move the needle in terms of recruiting, most recruiters are aware of the program and its 90% acceptance rate after they've seen thousands of applications of people blasting through Georgia Tech MSCS (online omitted of course). Everytime I say this I get someone pointing out the rigor, which I don't find to be a working argument because any decent engineering program is going to be fairly rigorous in its own right. \n\nWhat recruiters actually care about is name brand and the selectivity signal that comes with prestige. Example in point: a majority of interns are completely useless and are a complete net loss for the company. Having a nice internship from a good big tech is still going to move the needle very favorably resume-wise because of the bar of what it took to be accepted, and the signal to recruiters that you were able to get in a prestigious company, even if you didn't really do anything productive.\n\n>I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume.\n\nNo one is specifically blacklisting WGU, this seems very unlikely. The simpler and more likely reason at hand is that your resume is probably not competitive enough for the current landscape. Adding OMSCS to your resume is not going to change that either.\n\nThe reality is that it's going to be very difficult for average CS grads to find work within this environment and landscape. The easier times when many people could reasonably make their way into a decent SWE job have passed, and is most likely not going to come back. SWE payroll has always been one of the biggest costs that companies look to reduce within their financials, and rampant outsourcing and AI have done a lot to cut down on available jobs. ",

Try to get any tech job during your break between school.\n\n\nSomething you can try is look for full time jobs in your area.  When you see the posting, try to contact through the careers area of the website, email, or if you have to, through the application itself.\n\n\nHowever you are able to try to contact someone, let them know you are an older student who will be graduating in two years, you are checking out different careers, this one caught your eye, and you are wondering what the career is like, what courses might help, and any advice anyone who will talk to you has.\n\n\nAsk for a phone call, email, or buy them a cup of coffee or lunch.  Get the advice and just listen, don't \"but what about, or I heard, or people say\", just listen and ask actually meaningful questions.   Right after, and I mean right after, write everything down, whatever you can remember.\n\n\nThis is both local advice, networking, and a sort of introduction to an interview.\n\n\nKeep doing this as you can.  Keep your eye out for and ask about any local events where IT people meet to talk IT stuff, if you can, try to attend.  The goal is to be seen.\n\n\nGetting the degree and being a good fit for the company and the team are what is important.  Regardless of what you take, you are not going to really know what you are doing for the first five years, so when people give you free advice, listen.\n\n\nIdeally, you will graduate having had a few tech summer jobs, and have networked with several people.  When you are close to graduating, reach out to any of them that gave you their contact info and ask them if they know if any job opportunities.  Do this slowly, not all at once, you don't want to burn any bridges.\n\n\nGood luck",

How long has basic literacy and arithmetic been a requirement, yet the average person still reads between a 6th and 8th grade education and many college students continue to need remedial math.\n\nPeople might be doing more.

        "body": "tl;dr; keep looking, this is at best a lateral move if not a step down.\n\nContext: I have \\~20 YOE and currently am/have been in a senior US technology leadership role at small/medium-sized companies (40+ FTE reports in my area). I oversee software engineering, IT, DevOps, cybersec, and technical support/solutions teams which sounds very similar to what you're describing.\n\n>I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience\n\n>I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role\n\nFor starters, you are not market-competitive as a \"senior engineer\". Lots of differences in how titles are interpreted, but you are unlikely to place into a senior engineer position at a company with good engineering talent; you just haven't seen enough / could be trusted with important problems. I would be aiming for a mid-level position if I were you. I bet you *are* the most technical, talented person in your org, but this sounds like a \"big fish in a small pond\" situation; you will realize how impressive the talent out there is once you leave this pond.\n\n>I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.\n\nGood instincts; this is my read as well. You need to move on from this company or you *will* plateau.\n\n>The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes.\n\nThis sounds identical to what my org calls \"Solutions\". A typical solutions specialist/engineer has a CS degree from a small school or comes from a nontraditional background (bootcamp, self-taught, etc.). Required to code and know SQL, but isn't trusted to build customer-facing products from scratch. Much of their work is being responsive to customer demands; support tickets, onboarding new customers, code changes that are often formulaic / pattern repetition, etc.\n\n>They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.\n\n...and this is exactly how I sell folks on doing the work, and getting paid less for it. I pitch the variety of tasks they have, how much they can learn technically and about our products. It's not *wrong* but it's also not saying the quiet part out loud: you aren't trusted to be a *full* software engineer, nor do we want to pay for that for this position.\n\nHave people successfully transferred to a full Software Engineer position from our Solutions org? Absolutely, and I love enabling that move. But due to classic company issues, it's very hard to pay them the same as their peers vs. an external direct hire.\n\n>What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.  \nEDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.\n\nIMO if you're good at what you do, bet on yourself. Don't rely on a \"down the road\" transfer/promotion. Find a company that thinks you're good *now* and is willing to give you that responsibility and compensation. Even if they think you're ready in 6-12 months they might still delay on a move because you've proven yourself invaluable to their \"support\" organization and they don't have a backfill ready.\n\n>There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.\n\nI would ask them to go directly into a SE role instead of the support role, or else walk and keep looking.\n\n>Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?\n\nCaveat to all of the above: if you are not in the US and you live in a country where employment opportunities are scarce, you might need to toss all of my advice and take the job anyway. For example, if you live in Pakistan and are having trouble finding *any* job that is technical and pays reasonably well, this might be your best angle to transition into something better. I can't speak to your personal job market situation; my advice is based around what I know best (US labor market and you have authorization to work).",

Id combine info from all 3 and helped define project requirements and also help implement them and then present them back.

I became the face for that department for awhile.

First was Graduate Algorithms. It used to be homework plus exams, but they switched it to basically exam-only for grading. From what I heard, that change happened after one semester where the professor/TAs flagged a bunch of students to the Office of Student Integrity, and most of them ended up winning their cases. After that, they moved to exams only.\n\nSecond was AI course. They rolled out a VS Code based IDE called NOSI that tracks all of your activity. And in that class, you’re not allowed to use AI at all, or even the internet. You’re expected to rely strictly on the textbook, lectures, and write your code in that IDE. It also got two take-home exams that are like 50 pages each, and you get a week for each one, also no internet allowed.\n\nThird was Machine Learning. This one is the complete opposite, you can use as much AI as you want, even to generate all of your code. But the class is so hard that even with AI, it still took me like 20–30 hours a week (so they basically made the course almost impossible to get through without using AI). On top of that there’s also an Honorlock-proctored exam.\n\nSo yeah, just from these 3 classes alone, it’s basically three totally different approaches to dealing with AI tools.",

I definetely did not know about much of this. Stack overflow and googling answers online was our thing. \n\nMy school had tools to find for cheating on coding assignments which were like 80% of the grade. \n\nI got caught once and got away with a 0 on the assignment (brougth my grade down from a B to B-) but i knew people who got caught for like 10 assignemnts and went from an A to an F. It was professor dependent too, i knew people who got caught for 1 assignment and failed the whole calss. SO i was terrified to even google anything. \n\nIm not sure how it is today, but imagine that tool has updated for AI as well. If there's AI to help code, im willing to bet there's AI to help find cheating and these programs/projects have millions of dollars, i don thtink they mind spending a few hundred dollars to help find cheating in the program.",

Most of the applied stuff is stuff you eventually pick up in the industry based on years of career specialization. It's fine to have an interest in many different specializations, but it's not particularly realistic to expect that schooling is gonna bridge the gaps (which are more like chasms for the breadth of things you're listing)\n\nMore realistic is pick one thing and go deep in that. Pivoting professionally generally assumes you'll work your way into the relevant experience somehow, either through lateral moves in your current employer or startup experience or something along those lines, rather than starting from scratch as a new grad junior all over again.",

I disagree with comments saying going back to school for CS can't hurt, because it absolutely can hurt to study while working full time: your bank account, your relationships, your health. I had a lot of difficult life events happen almost as soon as I started the OSU program that made the whole experience really painful. Don't take the decision lightly",

The imposter syndrome is real, but tbh I think you're overthinking this.\n\nHere's the thing about those foundational gaps you mentioned. Yeah, they're important for certain roles, but for the path you're describing (backend dev, cloud infrastructure, applied ML), you can absolutely fill those gaps without going back to school. I've been learning this stuff in real time while building, and honestly some of the best engineers I know are self-taught or have non-CS degrees.\n\nThe AI systems architect goal is totally doable without a formal CS degree. What matters more is understanding how to design scalable systems, knowing your way around cloud platforms, and having practical experience with ML workflows. I'm seeing this firsthand - we're building Sprout (an AI job search tool) and the technical challenges are more about system design, data pipelines, and user experience than theoretical CS concepts. The foundational stuff comes up, but you learn it when you need it.\n\nThat said, if you do want structured learning, there are way more efficient options than a full degree program. MIT OpenCourseWare has excellent systems courses, Coursera has solid ML specializations, and honestly YouTube + building projects will teach you more practical skills than most university programs. The Georgia Tech OMSCS program is solid if you really want the credential later, but you could probably test into it with your existing experience and some strategic self-study.\n\nThe real question is whether you need the degree for credibility or just the knowledge. For backend/cloud/systems architecture roles, your portfolio and ability to solve problems matters way more than your diploma. Plus you're already employed and gaining experience - that's honestly more valuable than classroom time right now.\n\nWhat specific foundational concepts are you feeling most lost on in your current work? That might help you prioritize what to tackle first without the whole degree commitment.",

Honestly, lately, i tend to prompt engineer a lot of my work, especially boiler plate tasks. Not because I can’t solve it myself but just to expedite tasks that would have otherwise been super tedious. Of course, i always make sure to double check what’s been implemented.\n\nAnyways, i came to realize that I don’t really encounter too much heavy math or really any of the foundational topics i mentioned in my post. Well, except maybe data structures and algorithms. But I know for a fact I can just revisit those topics on my own. Even then, the type of data structures and algorithms that I come across or use aren’t really all too complicated.\n\nI guess i’d like to pivot into something with a little more “job security”. I feel like ai systems management is the way to go. But, to be perfectly frank, i haven’t taken much of a deep dive with system design nor machine learning. Im just at that stage where I’m thinking about pivoting into those roles. Right now im doing mostly basic crud both fe and be. Which is why im wanting to do something that’s a little more future proof. That’s why im considering perhaps going back to school. To learn the fundamentals of cs. But, I honestly do feel that I can teach myself these things. The tricky thing is coming up with a solid structure/strategy. In fact, i asked chat gpt and it actually did lay out a pretty solid plan. Thank you for those course recommendations btw, ill make sure to look into those. \n\nMaybe it’s the confirmation bias talking (i really do try to look both sides of the equation), but your response has sort of helped put my mind at ease. Honestly, I’m fine with hearing both sides. I just like not keep all of this bottled up in my head as I tend to overthink. I generally go with my intuition, but, it’s still good to keep an open mind. Thanks again for your perspective",

I fear leaving my current company will end up being the same.
