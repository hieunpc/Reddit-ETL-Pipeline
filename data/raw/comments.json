If your time are mostly spend on doing the mental work of wrangling data, the tools that are much user friendly is much preferable. \n\nThe same reason why python is popular. Ofc there’s a factor where you can do rust/cpp bindings but in general it’s more to do with how python is much more user friend interactive scripting language.

She expected you to know and do your job. She'd fight for (and mostly win) when we told her we needed resources.  If you betrayed that trust then God help you.\n\nIf you get a manager like her, look after her, support her, make sure she doesn't burn out.\n\nThe worst, non sociopathic manager was someone who actually had been a successful developer, was a bit of a geek. Would describe themselves as a \"Thought Leader\" and clearly believed they were a 12x developer. \n That meant they wouldn't listen. Thought they new it all, made fundamental decisions in isolation without consultation. They turned the data estate into a data sewage farm.\n\nHe wasn't evil,  malicious or unpleasant as a person.

It offers a way to process large amounts of data on multiple nodes with a ton of confidence that your job won't die. \n\nBut then what if your data is a bunch of little jobs that come in from multiple sources, then you might want to adopt a streaming service like Kafka or redis. Each one of your data sources can publish data to the stream, then you can set up spark to consume those messages to process it. Then you can set up a notebook that will check the stream for new data and fire off a new spark job to process the data, or just quit if there's no data available to process. The notebook could also take the results and handle uploading it to the database, or make a nice graph, or whatever you need it to do\n\nI could go on, but each one of those resources has a specific use that you should get familiar with. The first time you use them it will be difficult. The 50th time will not be so hard. If you have trouble try to make a flow chart where you will use each technology and keep the details high level.",

        "body": "I personally think Haskell could be an enthusiast language to learn when it comes to data engineering, but not a production language. To me, data engineering, like cybersecurity, is a tool/technology-specific field. You need to hire people who are familiar with technology stacks. Language expertise often does not bring value to the fields. My opinion is that if you are going to learn a language for the sake of employability, it has to be Go, Java, Rust, Python, or JavaScript (Pick 3). Anything else introduces maintenance problems.\n\nI think there is a very specialized sub-section within data engineering called \"software engineer (data)\" but most companies do not hire for that role. They are solely focused on algorithmic optimization and doing proofs of concepts that border on being research. Even their proof of concept are often converted to standard languages. \n\nI did a PoC featuring in Python and Nim. I think if those ideas get merged in production, it will be written in production languages like Rust or Go.",

For instance, they hire 100 people because the numbers of query optimisation show that they payoff but in the end they don't and even if they do query optimisation will not create cashflow which makes resource allocation in the end a tricky matter.",

Besides a managed opinionated runtime with nice ci and an \"implicit data mesh\" architecture, adds a transformation engine that enables runtime-agnostic code via python or sql.\n\nWith end to end lineage, metadata etc and python native, this is also a LLM-native dev tool with some impressive results. I won't spoil it, but transformations don't need to be so time consuming either. we were experimenting with adding boring semantic layer.\n\nwe are going to release the \"one man data team\" version (with limited collaboration features, think small teams) end of q1 next year.\n\nSo if you're a team of 1-5, apply for our early access linked above :)",

I'd recommend just fitting each puzzle piece into their respective, existing codebases - but I might need to hear more.\n\nAnother thought - you might have some pipeline and modeling work that applies to multiple apps, so it'd be really hard to have multiple versions of that for each app.",

You're not really going to find an opinionated all-in-one self-contained solution that is worth using because it doesn't make sense. It makes sense for app stacks because apps can have clear boundaries and be self-contained and transition through major versions\n\nA data analytics stack inherently has to have no boundaries—it has value cause you can absorb everything into one place, and it has to evolve continuously. You can't really bring a software development mindset into designing a data analytics environment (though software engineering skills and practices are certainly valuable for parts of it) \n\nThe best starter kit I'd recommend that lets you start simple and lightweight and local and then grow is Dagster+dbt. Go through the Dagster+dbt tutorial and examples to set up a monorepo that contains both projects. Until you deploy a persistent server instance somewhere, they're both just python packages you can import and run locally. I like to use uv and require them both into different dependency groups within the same root `pyproject.toml`. Using Dagster as a hub you can get really close to the full stack opinionated framework feeling \n\nfor analysis you can do notebooks out of that repo or use Evidence. Dagster can alert on result conditions",

        "body": "Few thoughts\n\n\\- How good an option moving home is depends on where you are from, what the economics are. If you're in the UAE and you feel trapped, makes me wonder if you're from a developing country where UAE is offering a good alternative.\n\n\\- People with jobs are almost always more attractive to employers than people without. Is there a reason searching for new jobs while staying in your current job is not an option? Could you search for different jobs in UAE or at home whilst still in your current one?\n\n\\- 5 hour commute is absolutely insane. Doing anything you can, even accepting worse housing options or conditions, or paying more for housing, may be worth getting back that time. Even if you had one hour back from commute, that's 1 hour you could develop your skills, or meditate and try and separate yourself from the stress of work, or search for jobs, or just relax. Giving you more personal time will multiply your effectiveness both at work, at self improvement, and at pushing your career.\n\n\\- freelance or remote work seems extremely difficult and competitive. It will probably need you to be good at optimising your offerings to clients, being a good salesman, good at negotiating more work,, etc etc. If you are struggling with stakeholder management at your UAE job, this may not be the way.\n\n\\- Real life experience >>>> bootcamps and self driven projects, unless you are very good at learning real life 2skills from self driven projects (past positive achievements in this would be a green flag).\n\n\\- Again back to the jobs thing, bootcamps, freelance, etc puts you in the desparate masses of unemployed tech. Having an actual, real data job elevates you above everyone else in the bottom of the barrel. Don't take your foot out of the door unless you are ok with it closing, or you have another door open elsewhere.\n\n\\- For your UAE job, you have to step back from your tech focus and focus on people skills, expectations management, and building alliances.\n\n1. Find smart, driven people in the org who understand you and are receptive to the problems. Recruit them as allies. Find out what they need and support them. Example from my work. Normally, cybersecurity and data have an adversarial relationship. Data wants to move data and make it accessible, cyber wants to say no, to wrap everything in paperwork. But by meeting with the cybersecurity guy, saying noone in my dept cares about cybersecurity, wants to make it happen, I want to do it, help me, we become friends. I speak up for cybersecurity in my department, he is careful with how he rolls out cybersecurity (he avoids saying \"no\" reflexively because he knows I can be trusted, and he needs to balance security vs useablity), he speaks up for my data needs as a precondition for effective security in meetings, etc.\n2. Your job sounds like a consultant job. Consultants have the problem all the time of being parachuted into crazy broken situations with clients who want everything fixed, but don't have much money and are defensive about change (dogwithfrisbeeinmouthmeme.jpg - only fix, no diagnose or make us look bad!). This is a huge industry so learn from consultants about how to come in, get the client on your side, help talk them around to fixes without making them look bad, change management, etc etc. Youtube, books etc might be a help here.\n3. Expectations management, expectations management, expectations management. You need pitch decks about what you will be doing, what might come up, and how this can help them. etc etc.",

Classifying and categorising data, re-organising or re-mapping data from one schema onto another, debugging heavy data-pipelines where expected outcomes don't match intended ones with large wait-times between executions, improving performance and knowing how to partition data sets so that complex workflows can be partitioned (without spoiling the logic) into smaller, but consistently independent sub-sets. Fuzzy matching, probabilistic matching, joining on multiple identity columns/definitions, blah blah blah - if you've soaked up some of those kinds of problems in a reconciliations environment, you'll be surprised how often they come up in different situations.\n\nAs you mention, a lot of those \"garage-clearance\" problems are at the root of what stands in the way of success in any large organisation - this is the type of work that an Enterprise or Data Architect would seek to address/solve - so if you've got the stomach for trying to fix those kinds of very real problems, that might be an angle to look into - entry might be through a Solutions Architect route, where you get to design specific systems targeted at solving specific problem areas - that was my \"in\", and I found it presented a nice wide range of things to work on, while keeping a reasonable focus project per project. What you're also noticing is that there's a set of things that separate \"what looks good\" from what's been rushed or hidden due to incompetence. A good architect needs to be able to demonstrate one from the other.\n\nIf you get the change to study some TOGAF that can help give you some useful language and tools to shape larger projects both at a Solutions level, or if you want to go in that direction at an Enterprise level. Data Architects are still a bit of a nebulous term, with no real solution/enterprise level distinction. (Personal gripe on my part, I often go into a role as a DA, but sometimes the expectation is to provide modelling and understanding support, and then in another project, I might be asked to spec out a data platform on some new cloud-based data platform - totally different tasks/roles, both called Data Architects! - v annoying)\n\nBut best of luck, it can be frustrating to find yourself mid-career in a role/situation that doesn't stretch you, or support your development - part of that you've already overcome in identifying the problem, so compared to 70% of folks, you're already making the right moves.",

I had a F500 client recently with ballooning storage costs and we were able to save *millions* of dollars annually from this alone. \n   * You should basically always be saving files as Delta+Parquet, and never CSV, CSV.GZIP, etc. \n   * Try to avoid tiny files. If you need to, regularly compact your data.\n* A few pipeline design tips:\n   * You always want to be minimizing shuffles. A few ways to achieve this:\n      * Join on partitioned keys when possible If one dataset in your join is very small, use a broadcast join (`df.join(F.broadcast(df2)...)`) \n   * Avoid unnecessary distinct or sorting actions  \n   * Perform your filtering as upstream as possible If you have inefficient partitions (e.g. way to much data within a certain key), you may have data skew causing some of your longer running jobs) \n   * By the way, you should be using partitions, especially if you have jobs that only query data for a specific time frame (e.g. partitioning by day or month\\_year) \n   * Try to incrementally process your data as much as possible, rather than doing full re-writes Generally, try to search for redundancies\n\nSpark is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot.

If you want more IaC, use Serverless or Terraform with AWS EventBridge as your orchestrator. At that point, you’re setup to build however you want, with TF-defined batch jobs, step functions, lambdas, queues, whatever you need. \n\nThe single advantage of Dagster is that you have a lot of the little pieces “handled” for you like setting up logging, tracking, versioning, and data dependencies. Otherwise, I’ve never seen a Dagster setup that isn’t a complete mess of spaghetti and shoehorns.",

But the current state of the job market makes that difficult.\n\nNext best: move internally or upgrade the responsibilities of your current role. It is worth having a direct discussion about development goals with your manager (assuming they are a reasonable person). I would also ask directly how you can move into the \"real\" dev team. The answer might disappoint you but it will help you decide on next steps.\n\nThe most likely situation is that you will be stuck in your current role for a period of time. You will need to make the most of it. The upside to this is that you are directly involved in customer onboarding and therefore revenue generation, so your job is likely to be safer than the developers.\n\nTo do that I would push standardisation of projects as strongly as you can. Migration inputs should follow target a standardised schema with a well defined spec for all fields. That then allows you to work on building tools to automate as much of the process as possible. For example, comprehensive validation and data quality checks, with automatically generated reporting outputs.\n\nYou can follow a similar approach to reporting: standardise and automate. Push back on customization. Even if it is a potential revenue stream, customised reporting is effectively low margin contract work and will be a maintenance nightmare in the long term. Focus on the business reasons and less on your personal motivations for avoiding this type of work.\n\nAnd of course work on your skills outside of work. Build an end to end pipeline using one of the big cloud platforms. This can be extremely simple from a data modelling perspective. The purpose is to get hands on experience of setting up processes and managing cloud services yourself.",

When creating tables dynamically, generate deterministic surrogate primary keys and explicit foreign keys, and use a strict naming convention so joins and lookups are predictable. Keep a schema registry and migration plan so you can version changes, and explode arrays into child tables with an index column when order matters. Finally, make loads idempotent with hashing for dedupe and emit a mapping metadata table that records which JSON path maps to which table/column so downstream consumers can trust the layout.",

It’s not meant to solve every problem, but if a company constantly brings in new data sources or its existing schemas change several times a year, and it still needs clean, consistent data to work with, Data Vault fits that situation very well.\n\nRecently I was Data Architecting in a project, where Data Vault was the solution to the client’s issues. A mid-sized company running an HR platform had thousands of clients but a small internal team, so they relied on many external tools: onboarding, contracts, bookkeeping, payments, their main app, and several new systems planned for the next year. Each tool had its own user table (some even had several users tables), and none of them matched. If you ran count(*) on each system’s user table, you got different numbers every time. Each system stored different pieces of information. Analysts didn’t know which database had the data they needed. Even when they found the right one, joining across systems caused rows to disappear, so they couldn’t trust anything.\n\nData Vault solved this cleanly. We created a single Hub_User table that lists every user across all systems. For each subsystem, we added a satellite tables that hold the columns coming from each system. Everything is connected using the same hash key, so joins always work the same way. Analysts now start from Hub_User, and they know exactly where each system’s data lives. Nothing gets lost during joins. When the company adds another tool next year, the team will only need to add one more satellite, and none of the existing reports will break.\n\nThis kind of constant change is normal in real data environments, and DV is a design pattern for that. \n\nI would say that it’s definitely not for newbies and requires discipline. But it’s true for all design patterns :)",

Talk at seminars, start a website, create video content, etc. But you also need leadership skills obviously you’re wasting your time otherwise. \n\nMy old manager did that and it got him from Engineering manager at a F500 company to Senior Director of Engineering at another F500 within 3 years. And a director role at a FAANG company in between. I feel like I have a greater amount of technical knowledge than him as an IC, but… he has charisma, confidence, leadership skills, knowledge of best practices, and a great personal brand image. And he had my back as a manager so people like me are willing to help him succeed however we can.",

The tech specs must be extremely lightweight, ideally literally code, since code is unambiguous, but point to a table of use cases they adhere to.

This way the documentation and solution design is in lockstep with the use cases and so is the codebase, and collaboration on changes can and **\\*must\\*** happen asynchronously.

But we're no longer adding new features to it. See the blog I linked in my other comment - it's very explicit on this.\nI know that's frustrating, and I wish things had turned out differently with Synapse and I'm far from the only one who feels that way. I'll talk a bit about why we made such a seemingly asinine choice later in this comment. \n\nThe tiny bit of good news is that there's a Fabric VS Code Extension for local development (the Fabric Data Engineering VS Code Extension). If you do switch to Fabric someday, it already exists there. Along with many other nice things, like Fabric Spark's Native Execution Engine to make your Spark go vroom (thus saving you time and money). \n\nIf it was feasible to keep building Synapse, we probably wouldn't have built Fabric at all. \n\nMany person-years were spent trying to fix key mistakes we made in designing Synapse (and in some cases, far earlier than that) before we went back to the drawing board and built Fabric. But that meant we had to refactor or completely redesign many huge pieces of it. \n\nSo the APIs are often different, the internals are often different even when the external interfaces are similar or the same, and bringing the \"same\" feature to Synapse would thus often mean doubling the work of building and maintaining that feature. Or worse, due to many of the mistakes / design flaws of Synapse often being the sorts of things we'd want to improve, or the reason Synapse didn't get such a feature years ago. So investing more into features for Synapse does not make sense; that'd be effort better spent elsewhere in the mid to long term. Like filling any remaining parity gaps (few are left, and there are fewer by the day), improving migration tooling, and so on. \n\nIt's very unfortunate, it's just not something I can change without a time machine to go correct the course of Synapse in the first place. \n\nHappy to answer follow up questions.",

If you're deleting everything just do a truncate first, or load to a staging table https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_TRUNCATE.html\n\nThe redshift options also hint that using glue to run spark is a waste of time - the \"tempformat\" shows it will temporarily save data as parquet then use a redshift COPY to load it in. With a four catalog table as the source redshift should be able to copy it directly and you can skip the glue job.

For example, if you want to run the feedback loop (let's call it \\`feedback.py\\`) every 6 hours, you would simply edit the crontab. This is done directly in your shell by running \\`crontab -e\\`. Then add the following line: \\`0 \\*/6 \\* \\* \\* /path/to/your/script/feedback.py\\`.\n\nThis tells your server to execute the \\`/path/to/your/script/feedback.py\\` scripts every 6 hours.  \nHow often the script should run depends a lot on how you use the feedback, and how much traffic you have.\n\nFeel free to send me a message if you need any help!",

I mean, if you don't do UI, get an LLM to set you up a React project, have it throw together a couple of example pages, read the code, and you're probably off to the races making changes in a day or two at most.\n\nDon't give up your power!",

Wait a moment? It is math now :) How fun it is....\n\nWhat about DSA? Aha, use the most fastest way....here we go algorithmic analysis. logN?

And even that obviously takes lots of practice, even for the best actors.\n\nExpecting you to know everything without looking stuff up, is expecting you to be a computer. You are not a computer. Relax. You can use the computer to look stuff up; it is fine. Now, if you have to look ... up ... every ... single ... solitary ... word ... or ... something ... like ... that ...\n\nthen at a certain point, it's going to be too hard to communicate with someone. I think it's similar with working with a computer. If you have to pause at every line of code to look something else up, then it's going to feel like an eternity to write a moderately complex program. However, if you have to stop at certain points to look up how to do a certain API call, or to look up how a certain algorithm works, etc. then to me this is just like stopping to look up a good word to use in a dictionary or thesaurus, something which I regularly do when writing prose in my own mother tongue (e.g. in order to find a better word or to avoid repeating certain words too often, in order to expand my own vocabulary in my mother tongue, etc.).",

        "body": "The reason to study C is not because the language itself is interesting, or because it's especially useful for real-world programming.\n\nThe reason is that C is such a simple and low-level language that it allows you to \"see\" the guts of how things actually work, instead of having them hidden from you.\n\nFor instance, when you start using Java you'll immediately encounter the object-oriented programming style. You'll see things like objects, classes, methods, inheritance, etc. And from the perspective of a Java programmer, all that stuff just works \"by magic\", because the Java compiler and the JVM implement everything for you. Whereas if you think about how to implement the same thing in C, you'll be peeling back the layers of abstraction and you'll be forced to learn more about what's actually happening under the hood.\n\nThe same thing applies to data structures. In Java, you can just declare an `ArrayList<Foo>` that automatically resizes itself to fit the data it contains. C doesn't contain such a resizable array type, but you can implement it yourself using the lower-level primitives such as `malloc` and `realloc`. And doing that work yourself forces you to really understand what's going on. Writing something like that in C is a way to force yourself not to \"cheat\" by taking advantage of existing higher-level constructs.\n\nEven if you never plan to *use* C for any real projects, I personally believe that understanding low-level programming will help make you a better developer in the long run. \n\n(For one thing, it helps you get a better understanding of performance. In higher-level languages, the speed of a given piece of code depends largely on the behavior of many layers of abstraction that are being hidden from you. In C, what you write is much closer to what the CPU actually executes.)\n\nBut having said that: as a student, I don't think you should prioritize learning C over the actual courses that you're being graded on. Just study it on your own as time allows.",

Go through topics slower until you've mastered them before moving on: make flashcards, write blog posts about what you've learned (even if you don't post them, just writing them helps you articulate to yourself what you know and points out any holes in your understanding). It feels slow, but slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.\n\n* Analysis paralysis - You feel overwhelmed by all the different starting points you could make. Again, go slower. Pick one tutorial or book and commit to working through it. Finishing one mediocre tutorial feels better than starting and not finishing a dozen great tutorials.\n\n* Perfectionism - Anxiety about getting everything absolutely perfect. Just because you've mastered a topic once doesn't mean you'll never need to review it again, or Google stuff about it.\n\nRemember that progress isn't linear: some days you move ahead ten steps, other days you move ahead two steps, some days you move back three steps. Consistency is the key.\n\nIt'd help us if you could tell us more about your situation:\n\n* What language are you learning?\n* What books or tutorials have you read?\n* Can you point us to code/projects you've written?\n* What are some programming concepts you have difficulty with?

While that is a big part of it, in software engineering (with emphasis on engineering), development speed is also important: How fast you can create a working solution for your customer? How long does it take to get something into the market? How long does it take to make changes to existing code? How costly will it be to maintain a product over a longer time? How simple will it be for others to work with your code? These are the main drivers for having clean architecture.\n\nYou don't need to worry too much about that as a junior, but it is important to understand when to take the time for creating the optimal solution and when to prioritize a \"good enough\" solution.\nFrom experience I can say it is easier to get to a working solution first, and then focus on performance, rather than having a performant solution that is missing features or does not actually do what the customer wanted.",

Create and drop databases. Configure and optimize all you like. \n\nSetting up a database from scratch is good practice. Learning about security and what different configurations like isolation levels will do to performance is good for you to understand, even if in practicality you will probably never make those decisions yourself - you will at least understand why things are the way they are and why performance suffers based on db configuration alone.\n\nIt's all fake data. Do what you want with it.\n\nEdit: once you've got the basics down, performance tuning is your \"leet code style\" learning. There are no data structures in SQL - but there are data retrieval patterns, and set theory plays into how to retrieve data efficiently and for what purpose a whole lot.

I think it's difficult for a true beginner to have met those criteria, though certainly not impossible.\n\nSo maybe just consider starting small. Find a project you're interested in, build it, mess with it, read the docs, etc. After you've done that you can decide if you want to try to contribute.

You’re also gonna have to go through code review, which can be both good (for learning) and bad (for actually getting your work accepted).\n- Your PRs are more likely to get shot down because your code doesn’t meet the project’s standards.\n- Established communities can be harder to break into. Gaining people’s appreciation and respect will take lots of time and work.\n\nI can’t say what’s best for you, but I gained a lot out of contributing to larger projects as a beginner. The key is to make small contributions and not rock the boat. Godot Engine was a great project for me because I am also a user of it, and it’s super modular so you can change parts of an individual subsystem without breaking anything else. When in doubt, give it a shot. The worst thing that can happen is you get chewed out by a maintainer for writing bad code.",

Or if i'm learning c, I have a custom keyboard that utilizes c to program it. Or if I'm learning LUA, i like video games, there are games that uses lua to extend the games functionality. Or if i'm learning javascript, I could use javascript to customize how my normally visited pages look to show only the things I'm interested in. Or if you're learning css/html. I could customize how firefox works and looks. Or if you're learning batch or powershell, you can program automation into your computer usage workflow to make normal routines more convenient.\n\nIt's all about seeing the payoff of what you're learning, when you are able to apply it, and see your work in action, it keeps you interested. Interested enough to explore it even further. Then eventually it starts to get boring again and you switch to another language to learn. FML",

I do 15 minutes of focused work, then 3 minutes of literally whatever my brain wants (scroll Reddit, watch a YouTube short, whatever). The key is setting a timer for BOTH. Your brain learns it can have the dopamine hit soon, so it's easier to focus. Gradually increase the work interval as you build the habit.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Treat debugging like a video game:\\*\\* ADHD brains love puzzles and immediate feedback. When you hit a bug, frame it as \"I'm going to figure this out\" rather than \"ugh this is broken.\" Keep a running log of what you've tried - it helps when you inevitably get distracted and come back.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use the hyperfocus strategically:\\*\\* When you feel yourself getting pulled into something, lean into it if it's productive. I've had some of my best learning sessions at 2 AM because my brain decided \"today we're learning async/await.\" Just make sure you're not hyperfocusing on tutorial hell.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Accountability buddies:\\*\\* Find a study Discord or a friend who's also learning. Just having someone to check in with like \"hey I'm going to work on this for the next hour\" makes a huge difference.\n\n\n\nAlso about the medication - might be worth trying different options if Adderall isn't working?

Things move quickly and change all the time. CS fundamentals apply to most coding frameworks, you can do the same thing in most coding languages.\n\nIn a nutshell, get the CS fundamentals locked down, and you are able to adapt to different things, which is great for ADHD as we get bored easily and want to move on to different things or multitask.\n\nUse AI to help motivate you (when stuck) and to start and finish tasks. My best use case for AI is really summarising my work to pick up next time, and stick to a plan. \n\nADHD is a superpower for development! hyperfocus is real. If struggling with distraction or ‘tutorial hell’, build something basic from scratch that you want and you’ll be more interested. \nDiscipline is hard with ADHD, i’d advise while getting started to work on ‘fun’ projects that you enjoy doing.\n\nMost importantly, please don’t be hard on yourself.\nLet yourself have a break if you want, treat yourself after something hard. You have got this! Keep being you and following your passions.\n\nNo one is perfect and if it helps I still struggle with distractions too. Stay curious and enjoy the process of learning, as the truth is you always will be learning your whole life, due to how vast CS is and how often things change. \n\nSorry it’s a lot, but I hope this helps in any way. ",

Imagine for a moment, a few years from now being unable to land a job because you can't solve problems without AI and think how crushing that would be. Then having to do a job you hate and looking back on this time with [immense regret because you didn't try harder](https://bakadesuyo.com/2012/02/what-are-we-most-likely-to-regret/). Trust me, the pain of discipline is less than the pain of regret.\n\nOkay, so what do you do?

You are already starting to feel the consequences of that.\n\nYou'll need a project, choose one that will hit the fundamentals and push you a little. Something like building a [text editor or 2d game.](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html) Here's a [list of projects](https://github.com/arpit-omprakash/100ProjectsOfCode) ideas.\n\nUse LLM to strategize, plan, and explain concepts. Use it to break down problems into smaller problems. Use it to compare alternative approaches. DO NOT GENERATE THE CODE! [Create a project within an AI app](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9519177-how-can-i-create-and-manage-projects) that isn't connected to your Code editor. Give it the implicit project level instructions to never give you code but to always explain the concepts as if you are learning it for the first time. Tweak as needed. Then employ every other tool at your disposal: youtube, documentation, stackoverflow, rubber ducky, whiteboard, old textbooks etc. Remember, the purpose of this project is to reconnect with the fundamentals, not to have a completed project so its okay if its going slow or lacking features.\n\nYeah, you’ll probably find a lot of the same information from searching that an LLM would give you. The difference is in the brain activation. When you’re stuck and have to look something up yourself, you’re forced into an active, analytical mindset where you have to clearly define the problem and break it down into searchable chunks. Often you'll come across multiple approaches which builds your technical understanding. And because the process is slower, your brain has time to sit with the problem and that tends to make the solution stick a lot better.\n\nThen the hard part. Stick to the plan. Program the way of our ancestors. \n\nTake it one step at a time, one line at a time, and it'll eventually start coming back to you. Also, take note of your peers and watch who uses AI for everything and who doesn't. I was very disheartened at how many of my college peers[ cheated through the entire degree](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1hsvmj7/some_recent_data_on_college_student_genai_usage/) and now they can't find employment or[ even code for that matter.](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-and-learning) I have the same degree from the same school so that makes us all look bad.",

You could make the computer do anything you could think of.\n\nI loved games and fancied myself a future game programmer.\n\nI didn't take any classes (there weren't really any back then, where I was from)\n\nI didn't LEARN programming, like sitting in front of a machine doing lessons. I wanted to try something, tried to research what I needed to do to accomplish it, and tried it out.\n\nI made many, many things along the way and most of the time, it was, \"for fun\".\n\nAs an example, in the early 2000's the MMORPG Ragnarok became popular around the world (and in south east asia). I came across some code that could extract and view the 3D models of maps and buildings in the Ragnarok data file and decided I wanted to make a program that would let you look around the map as you wanted using WASD controls.\n\nThus RagCam was born, and it was shared in some communities.\n\nI was also able to find some code to import 3D models into the then popular 3D software 3D Studio max. \n\nI also made a system tray Desktop Toy that let you \"Store Files\" in the \"Kafra Storage\" A Kafra is a NPC in the game that you interact with to store stuff, and I made a program that pops up the image of the anime-style girl in a kid of maid outfit where you can store notes and files.\n\nWhen I got into pirating (ahem, \"streaming\") TV shows I wanted to get notified if there was a new episode, so I made a local site that checked for updates. I also made a scraper that downloaded (english) subtitles based on the file name.\n\nI try to make programs that intersect or tanget my interests, which include anime, games, emulation of retro consoles, and more recently AI generated images.\n\nIt's really up to you to define what programming means to you,\n\nI'm an old soul, and for me programming is more than just a way to earn money or the latest technology and cool frameworks.\n\nIt's an interface between me and my inner self. A way to self-express through technology.\n\nMake programming fun. It's all about you.\n\nIn the corporate world, I did some fun stuff.

        "body": "## Exposition\nI'm a lot like you in the sense that I want to understand the \"full stack\" of every system I run across. For years it has got me glued to books on computer science and on general programming topics, chatting with AI about the subject, googling, watching YT videos, etc. It has helped me gain a good basis for how things work but it has also been a way for me to avoid the really hard job of coding itself.\n\n## The Problem\nWithout getting too much into meditation and casual research I've done on psychology, the basic problem is this: It's not the subject matter - programming or computer science - *it's the response to that internal state while learning the subject matter*. \n\nYou need ways to switch off that self-referential egotalk. It won't go away before you start treating it and other internal feelings and thoughts as \"information\" rather than realities that are playing out or describing \"who you are\". They are chemical events, some helpful, some unhelpful. The system that spawns them is full of messy, contradictory responses to these internal events that don't always make sense. Your brain has neuroplasticity, and whether you like it or not even your identity is a construction. Yes, we all have some properties like IQ and EQ that determine some speed or efficiency of function but again those don't determine binary outcomes. The real hindrance is the ego butting in when the analytical parts are trying to do their job or those parts tiring out.\n\nI've wired my brain to be lazy, inattentive and identify myself as stupid. The identity itself and the thoughts surrounding it is a learned set of patterns. That wiring can change, the feelings it produces while under stress can change and my image of myself can change but they won't unless I keep allowing my brain to default to those pathways and don't offer it new experiences and responses to certain difficult stimuli.\n\n## The Realities of the Field\nThe feeling of not knowing something or being confused will never change in this field. Your conscious response to that can and that will ultimately lead to your brain interpreting those signals differently. You'll even start to love the challenge of not knowing, if you can get out of your own way.\n\n## What to focus on - the narrow approach\n\n**Your real goal is learning to understand systems, syntax and data.** There are easier and harder approaches to this but generally I'd say **try to learn how memory works**. And learn it robustly. Study the virtual memory system, study file systems, study how different information - audio, text, graphics, device state - get modeled in memory. While there are millions of libraries, protocols and file formats, they have to all converge on the simple core truth of writing bytes to or reading bytes from memory. If you can nail this layer, write a few parsers that interpret file formats or networking protocols, you'll get a solid grasp of the simple fact that **software is just agreed upon patterns of bytes**. This won't trivialize learning libraries but it will trivialize a certain notion of \"newness\" from them - they aren't anything new. They may sit at several levels lower or higher on the software stack but they are all still just memory.  \n\n## On AI  \nResources are sometimes hard to come by but AI is actually pretty good for this. As long as you aren't copying code but rather asking questions on subjects that are stable and unlikely to change - how things in computer science, and the technologies that express it, work - you can get very good, very detailed answers. Plus you can go back and forth with it, trying to nail and refine your understanding. It's like taking notes with a tutor.\n\n## Conclusion\nSo don't be like me. Don't rush. Accept discomfort. Accept being stupid and having to ask. Think of the skill acquisition portion like laying bricks on a giant wall. You wish for a fast and glorious end result, you'll even settle for \"100 more bricks laid out today, look at that progress!\" but what you need and what you get by showing up and working every day is that one brick. This is a craft and the only way to learn it is by doing it. Every day.",

Isogram is a simple problem.. you can consider a string an array of characters, so you just need to count the occurrences of each item in the array, then make sure that none of them is more than 1\n\n\nMaybe one thing that would help is to write out the steps you would take to figure out if a string is an isogram in your head. You could look at the first letter, then look at the rest of the string to see if it exists anywhere else, if not, move to the second character and repeat.

Then capitalize the next character. Then capitalize the first letter ever. What are separators? space, comma, priod, exclamation, question. (unless your problem specifies no punctuations, only spaces)\n\nSo you capitalize the next character, if it's [a-z].  \n\nException: the first [a-z] is also capitalized. \n\nThat should be it. \n\n>verify if a string was an isogram\n\nisogram's definition is no repeating characters. \n\nEDIT: So when I see this problem, there needs to be a way to COUNT the occurance of each letter in the word. \n\n~~So the simplest way is~~ The way I would approach this, is have 26 buckets, one for each letter.  (use an array for implementation)\n\nLoop through the word, add one to bucket as you come across the matching letter. \n\nADD: Then we go through the whole list... If any bucket shows >1, it's not an isogram. \n\nADD: But can we go even faster? Do we need to check the whole word? No, we can say \"not isogram\" when we discover the FIRST repeated character. We don't need to got through the whole word. \n\nADD: So we loop through the word, +1 to bucket of matching letter. \n\nBut before you add 1, check if the bucket is 1 or 0. If it's 1, this is a repeat letter, then you exit the loop and answer \"not isogram\". If you made it to the last character of the word, then obviously nothing repeated, so you have an isogram, return yes.",

The advice that served me well when I started 20-ish years ago (I’m 40 now) was this: early in career, build broad base general skills and allow your curiosity to drive casual exploration of niche disciplines -> later in career build specialized skills in what you’re most interested in and what you can get a job in, both. \n\nThe way I did this: \n\n1. Python and C were my broad base languages. I learned them well and chose them because they’re used everywhere. Early on, I focused on design patterns and learning the abstract algebra and category theory that explains why those design patterns work. I also focused on getting really good at C and Python intending to keep them as my core language. \n2. From there in 2013 I noticed functional programming was gaining traction, so I decided to learn Haskell. After that I got put on a project at my company that required Scala and I excelled at it because knowing Python, C, and Haskell gave me an edge over other engineers who didn’t have all three (especially Haskell). That set me apart and enabled me to get good at Akka, Spark, and later Cats Effect, which propelled me into Big Data. Also given the landscape at this time I was forced to learn Java 🤷🏻‍♂️, I didn’t care for it and more or less endured it. \n3. At this point as a mid level engineer I’d now gotten exposure to low-level and embedded C, desktop development, server development and database programming, web development, streaming development, microservices, data science, big data engineering involving batch and mini batch processing and data ingestion, machine learning, AI, procedural OOP, and functional programming through Haskell and Scala.\n4. I discovered I liked the problems and wild-west style complexity of big data environments so I chose to specialize in that. That prompted me to focus on Scala FP for streaming (Cats Effect, Akka) and Spark (batch and mini batch), Python (PySpark, Pandas, Scikitlearn, Airflow, etc), and Go (Kubernetes and other distributed system type stuff).  In 2025 it’s still doing really well for me. \n\nI was able to learn all of this stuff by taking about an hour a day 4-ish days a week plus 2-4 hours on Saturday a couple times a month in the first 5-10 years of my career to work on personal exploration type of stuff and choosing to stay focused on one thing long enough to really know it (when I got curious about something, I would add it to a list I kept for that to give me the feeling that I would get to it even though I knew I wouldn’t - but I did pick from that list when I finished something and wanted to pick up something new).",

Data (bits) is stored in memory slots, stacked one on top of the other. \n\nWe make them behave the way we want them to behave (to solve a specific problem that demands said behaviour). A queue behaves in a circular way because that’s what we need to do, on the machine level there is no circular behaviour, like i sais, data is just stacked like books on a table.\n\nTo understand how do we create such behaviours out of memory slots and most importantly why, you need a low enough language to see what’s going under the hood, otherwise it will look like magic. \n\nSo i recommend trying to implement them in C going from integers to graphs and trees. Moving to a high level language like python will be a piece of cake and you will be better than most who started there. \n\nI recommend the book Algorithmes in C, it is quite extensive, so don’t read in bulk and if you really need to know how the machine works, start with Introduction to computing systems, it is written by the creator of the LC-3, for educational purposes. \n\nGood luck to you.",

Since you like web development and you know basic Java you have all the makings of a full stack developer.\n\nBy building projects to learn how to develop software the concepts you learn in school will make more sense how it applies. School does not really teach you how to develop software directly so you are going to have to learn this on your own in addition to what they teach in school.\n\nStart small and keep simple and add one small thing at a time. Work from frontend to backend to database for every feature you add. Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn when you need to learn it.\n\nThis might sound crazy to some, but the often dismissed TODO application is very well suited for teaching comprehensive full stack development. You just have to take it that far.\n\nHere is an example roadmap that could keep you busy for a while.\n\nStart small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.\n\nMake TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.\n\nNow for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.\n\nDo this with every small project you work on. A calculator, an address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.\n\nI hope this helps.",

And it seems to be changing more and more in various languages, while we also move more and more away from inheritance, and into the wonderful world of composition. So things are changing.\n\nBut yeah, (non-default) methods in interfaces are \"just abstract methods\".",

So debugging is about finding the point in your code where it first DOES NOT do what you intended it to do. “It should be exiting the loop here - why isn’t it? Oh it should be >= instead of >” etc.   To find that point you can start from the beginning and check values: “b should be 10 here. Is it?”  Trace the execution flow through your code examining values as you go. At some point you will find a value that you weren’t expecting and you can figure out why it got the value it got and fix it. \nAn alternate approach is to work backwards. Start from where you notice the error and see what your code did just before that. This typically means re-running each time you take a step back. In some cases you can also try the binary search method. Examine values in the middle of your code. If they look good the error hasn’t happened yet so split the second half into two sections and look in the middle again keep looking and splitting until you see your problem. In practice I kind of do a mix based on logical thinking…  I see where the error first manifests, I think what could cause that error, I use the debugger or add print statements the check my hypothesis and either look forward or further back depending. But you can almost always find your problem by starting at the beginning and tracing through examining values.  You likely won’t run into it for a while in your programming, but where this breaks down is when you are dealing with multi-threaded, concurrent, asynchronous tasks or threads where adding breakpoints or even printing values changes the order of processing and masks the error.",

Ditch the game-dev courses.\n\nBack in the day, there were two schools that offered a game-dev degree; they were DigiPen, and Full Sail. Both these schools are accredited, both these schools are collaborations WITH THE GAME INDUSTRY. The CEOs of both EA-US and Sony-US sat on the direction board of Full Sail.\n\nAround 2006, we were at the height of Sallie Mae robbing the American public blind, and ALL the universities got in on it. They fed peoples delusions of grandeur back to them, and offered game-dev degrees of their own. I sat on a couple review boards myself, and I'd name and shame if I wasn't going to get sued to oblivion if I did... They're robbing people blind. These programs are designed without any industry input or representation whatsoever.\n\nAnd by 2010, the game studios had fully reacted. These days, they don't want to HEAR \"game dev\" degree, because they know you won't know comp-sci to save your life, and you won't know game dev, either. There's still a certain respect for the two schools mentioned, but for the most part, they want a traditional comp-sci degree.\n\nIn the mid 20-teens, the Department of Education started cracking down - tying federal grant money and subsidies to both graduation rates and placement success. Ineffective programs became dangerous to schools and they had to start putting up or shutting up.\n\nWell, I can promise you MOST of the schools slip through the cracks, and this current administration has declared war on education and dissolved the DoE. So I don't know WHAT you're learning over there...\n\nAnd if you're outside the US, I'd trust your game-dev education even less. If the program isn't perfectly cohesive, that's a really, really bad sign.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but at the very least, it's not too late to turn your future prospects around. Get in on math classes, as much as you can from here on out.\n\nAs for how your interview is going to go when you present yourself to a game studio - it's going to be almost exclusively math oriented. They're going to drill you on linear algebra, calculus, and physics at the very least. Some of it will be comp-sci oriented about algorithms, some of it will be physics, some of it will be rendering, some of it is used in game dev but you'll have never seen before because they just want to see how well you adapt to new maths - that you haven't just memorized everything. They're going to grill you over this. As for any programming part of the interview, mostly they just want to know that you know enough syntax to be dangerous: reverse a string, write a linked list.\n\nHell, you don't need C++ specifically in your education. Java is almost indiscernible from C#, which itself is used heavily in game dev, and they all share common syntax and idioms. You can pick up enough C++ on your own to get by.\n\nThe studio can teach you good programming on the job, they can't teach you math and how to think.",

Examples will need to be in a language or pseudo code(which I don't think would be proficient enough). \n\nMost of these concepts are given in example code such as C and probably doesn't exist in Zig.\n\nAlthough, I think there is a reasonable chance of finding teaching material in python.",

        "body": "Tldr: I dont understand your question or what your friend is saying... because data structures and algorithms are used in literally every programming language... below is a rant clarifying what I believe is what info you're missing. At the end of the day it doesn't matter\n\n\nIm assuming by DSA you are referring to Data Structures and algorithms right?\n\n\nThose are used in every single programming language, the only difference you may be hearing about is that some languages differences and not actually related to anything about data structures or algorithms... No shade meant by this, but that is something I think someone with an AI/ML background would be familiar with so I am going to assume it's not necessarily an AI background in the sense that you an ML engineer, and possibly what you mean is more that you use AI. I only say that to preface that I'll try and explain what I mean about languages, not to cast aspersions.\n\nAnyway, what you may be hearing i suspect, especially because of the recommended languages you've received, is more related to low and high level programming languages. You know all code eventually becomes machine language, ones and zeros is the name of the game, but we dont type out ones and zeros, we use words that them selves get converted to something, then something else, then something else, then eventually something a machine can understand. In coding terms these are layers of abstractions, something \"represents\" something else, and the magic is often that you can hide complexity by having thing X not only translated to thing Y, but also do Z as well to make the statement more concise. \n\nLow level languages (like C++) are ones that you work closer to the hardware, meaning there are fewer abstractions away from giving a computer 1s and 0s. This can be a very good thing, abstractions require effort, and that means you can write code that uses less effort on the machines end and make things go fast and use less memory. However, abstractions are done for a reason, and the flip side of a low level language is that you will write a lot more code to do the same thing that another language may be able to do in a fraction of the amount of lines of code, a big pain point being you end up handling memory yourself at this level. \n\nHigh level languages on the other hand are abstracted a more layers up and hide the scary bits like memory management from the developer by handling it themselves, and tend to be much closer to readable human language as a result. Python and Java are both high level languages, but keep in mind that doesnt make them better or worse, just different. \n\nSo why isnt everything done with a high level language if they can take away all the annoying things that exist in programming? With abstractions come trade offs, the more that your code does \"for you\" the less control you have. You dont have to do annoying memory management and consider a lot of stuff when programming in a language like Python like when its OK for your app to \"forget\" something to free up memory. In languages at this level a feature that is built in handles it for you by occasionally checking the app, and deleting unused memory and freeing it up for later, its called a garbage collector, and this does not exist at the low level, and not having it can be a pain in the ass. But what happens if garbage day is on Monday, and you forget to bring out your trash and today is Tuesday...? You are stuck with the garbage until the garbage man comes around next week, in high level languages this happens to because its not a constant process and works kind of in cycles. Low Level languages can create memory, use it, and the second its no longer needed free it up for something else to use that memory. This allows more efficiency in your code, but requires more dev work, and opens up Pandora box and can lead to an exponentially amount of new bugs or issues. \n\n\nIf I wrote 2 programs in Python and C++ tonight, I could do it. But I promise you that my Python will without question be faster than my C++ code. Is Python \"faster\" than C++? Nope, I just am a novice at C++, I know enough to be dangerous, but beyond that 9 times out of 10 my Python is faster due to my own lack of experience with it. And if you told me to create an app in 10 hours or I will die, Ill choose Python every time because the high level abstractions lead to increased developer speed. NOT better app, NOT faster code, less of my time as a developer being used (which in theory could be used to make more code for some other project or learn something new)\n\n\nAs far as data structures and algorithms are concerned, they are not language specific, it makes no sense to frame it that way imo. Data structures are ways to organize data. Algorithms are sequences to process data. The programming languages are like syntax in verbal languages, DSA is kinda like forming complex sentences. So there's no correct answer to your question, because it doesnt really make sense.\n\n I suppose if you goal is to learn data structures and algorithms at a granular level and really understand how the computer really handles them, a low level language will force you to really get down to that level and put the work in to learn that stuff. If your goal is to apply data structures and algorithms more than learn the granular details, a high level language is the choice. Honestly even that dichotomy isn't a super great way to put it, its just the closest way I could think to answer your question in a way that gives you something to consider. \n\n\nAnother way to put that is that learning DSA concepts in a lower level language will expose you more closely to how a computer really uses data structures and algorithms, giving you a better baseline. However, a high level language will allow you to learn these concepts faster and more efficiently. There's no avoiding learning them, and neither path is correct. That being said... if you truly \"know\" python... to be honest you should already be familiar with a lot of data structures and algorithms, so my recommendation would be to stick with Python and fill up those holes in your skill set without having to learn these concepts and a whole new language at the same time slowing the process. Just my opinion.",

Specifically the Exception handling and the huge risk of null-pointer exceptions everywhere.\n\nAnd it doesn't get any better that Java was never truly intended to run interactive text-terminal applications, but for some crazy reason almost every school thinks that their students should be forced to struggle with System.out, System.in, Exceptions and the Scanner - which is intended for \"scanning\" through text-files (hence the name) and not for receiving badly formatted input from the user ... \n\nSo, sorry if I didn't answer your question fully, but every single thing that you mention are weird quirks of the Java language, and the way it is being taught, and I still cannot fathom why it is still chosen as a beginner language, especially when we've had Python for exactly as long, and that also runs on every single platform out there!",

Learning how it all even makes sense is computer science or computer architecture.\n\nLearning this field is building a bridge by spanning from both sides. Well, EVERY side... Then all the sides eventually meet in the middle, and it all starts making sense. It's not a sudden ah-ha moment, but a gradual understanding unless you think about it.\n\nLearning any programming language - there is a barrier to separate the language and it's products from the system. You do this, you get a program. You send text to `System.out`, and it shows up in a little window. We can talk about the `java.lang` package, the `System` class within it, the `out` static field within that, how it implements an instance of `PrintStream`, you can look up the documentation for the interface, or on that specific instance, but it is \"implementation defined\" what happens, that under the hood, a system call is made, and the data - your text, crosses a barrier from your program to the operating system that controls the terminal window and the transfer of data between it and your program.\n\nIf you want to learn about operating systems, read a book or take a class. That's going beyond Java, and your Java class has to stop somewhere, or else the conversation is going get down to electron volts and semiconductors, PN junctions, quantum tunneling...\n\nWhere's it end, Sharon? Where's it end?\n\nA top-down approach isn't helpful, because look where you are; What the hell is `System.out`? Why do I have to do it? You've seen the top, now you have to work your way down, but you're so damn distracted by the question I don't think you can see the forest for the trees.\n\nWe teach programming from the bottom up the same way Euclid taught geometry. First the axioms, then building blocks, because everything new is going to be a consequence of everything prior. You crawl before you walk, and your legs can take you to the fence. Beyond is another class, another subject, and yes, it's a topic worth learning at some point.\n\nBut you know what? You can do a lot with Java now, without having to personally survey the whole kingdom first.\n\n> Printing text, which for some reason requires me to add \"System.out.\" beforehand [...] Creating a Scanner object to read user text input, which for some reason requires me to specify \"(System.in)\"\n\nNo one is going to explain everything to you. Look it up. There's documentation. Both `System.in` and `System.out` are stream objects, and they wrap some system specific implementation details that allow data to be passed into and out of your running process. That's the fence - go take an OS class or read a book about kernel architecture, because they way this works on Windows is different than how it works on Linux, is different from how it works on NanoVM for AVR...\n\nYou don't NEED a `Scanner` to get input, the input stream has a `read` method to get you bytes, the `Scanner` is just convenient for converting bytes into different types.\n\nThere are more streams than `System.[in|out|err]`, you can make your own, so passing `System.in` to a `Scanner` tells it WHICH input stream to scan.\n\n> Catching all errors, which for some reason requires me to specify \"(Exception e)\"\n\nBoth these things tell me you haven't gotten to or don't understand inheritance. So much for the top-down approach... Did you dirty again.\n\n> Fixing a Scanner after inputting a number so it correctly takes text input, which for some reason is as simple as executing the command \".nextLine()\"\n\nThis is not a concern of teaching you Java, but of USING Java - of software engineering, architecture, and design.\n\nPresume you told the scanner you want an integer, but the data in the stream contains text, not digits. What now? You get an error - your specification cannot be satisfied.\n\nBut you didn't \"fix the problem\", you just SKIPPED over the data in the stream, looking for something you CAN parse out.",

To me, it is more about encapsulating data with applicable functions (methods), polymorphism, and passing messages between objects. \n\nIdeally, a class should contain a data structure, and have methods for setting, accessing, and transforming that data.\n\nAt the end of the day, a class is basically a data structure with a bunch of functions attached to it (or, in C terms, a struct with some variables and function pointers).  It is also syntax sugar for passing structs to functions as paramaters.  eg: if myObject is an instance of a class called MyClass, then myObject.foo(1) is syntax sugar for MyClass_foo(myObject, 1)\n\nedit: The project is somewhat irrelevant, as any project can be done in an OO way, or a procedural way, or a functional way, etc.  It is more about how you organize the relationships between data (variables) and behavior (code).  It is not uncommon these days to mix these paradigms, which Python somewhat excels at.\n\nOOP also plays well with a Model View Controller (MVC) app structure.",

You can just change the if statement to check this instead: `if self.expression and self.expression[-1] in self.operators and input in self.operators:` since `bool(self.expression)` will be false, when the string is empty.\n\nIn the case of `calculate`, the main two errors are `SyntaxError` (raised, for example when you try `eval(\"\")`) or `ZeroDivisionError`.  Depending on what input is possible, `NameError` is possible (`eval(\"x + 1\")`). Thinking about what errors can occur forces you to think about why they happen and how to handle them. You should definitely handle the SyntaxError and ZeroDivisionError in some way. If you really want, you can catch those 2 with corresponding error messages and then catch all remaining exceptions (but I'd not catch them and let the calculator crash if something really completely unexpected happens instead of ignoring it. This would be a bug requiring a fix and not an expected exception like the other two).\n\nAlternatively, you should have a look at [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) about eval. You might want to either sanitize the input before evaluating the expression or write your own evaluation function, as eval is risky to use. This is only necessary, if there is a way to get 'unclean' input. But sanitizing input is good practice.",

But you wouldn't necessarily figure that out from theory alone - you learn it by seeing similar problems repeatedly. Keep grinding easy problems. Don't move to medium until you can consistently solve easy problems without hints. Eventually you'll start to see the patterns. Question for you - when you're job hunting later and companies ask about your problem-solving skills, how do you actually prove you can solve algorithm problems? Like do you just say \"I did X problems on LeetCode\" or point to your LeetCode profile stats, or is there a better way to demonstrate you actually understand algorithms and data structures?",

And it will teache you a lot. \n\nSince you’re not a fan of front-end and you’re studying applied maths + CS, you can lean into areas that have long-term demand:\n\n**1. Strengthen one backend language deeply:** You could pick **Kotlin / Java, Go, or Python** depending on the direction you want**.**\n\n**2. Learn devops fundamentals:** You already touched deployment and Cloudflare, so the next step is:\n\n* Docker\n* CI/CD\n* Linux fundamentals\n* Nginx\n* Basic cloud (AWS, GCP, or Azure)\n\nEven basic competency in these instantly increases employability.\n\n**3. Databases + caching:** Most backend devs don’t go deep enough here. Understanding things like:\n\n* PostgreSQL indexing\n* Query optimization\n* Redis caching patterns\n* Background job queues\n\n**4. System design basics:** You don’t need FAANG-level system design, but knowing how APIs, queues, caching, and services fit together puts you on a different level.\n\n**5. Keep building small production projects:** Your CRM project is already strong. If you build 1–2 more **small, useful, real-world tools**, your portfolio becomes unbeatable, especially when paired with your degree.\n\nIf you do these over the next 1–2 years, you’re basically shaping yourself into a backend engineer with DevOps literacy, which is one of the safest positions in the market right now.",

        "body": "There's no official difference technically, but in practice theres a massive difference that depends entirely on what the code does (in the real world I mean, not what the \"code\" does in the machine), how it will be used, who will use it, what features may be added if any, and a million other things. \n\nDo you have a cool unique idea that you need to get in front of investors NOW before someone else does it? Well... maybe your prototype and your \"production ready\" app are very similar.. you'll have pissed off users running into bugs, but maybe you cross the finish line and get funding to refactor later (you wont, you will build on top of your garbage with more \"temporary\" garbage)\n\nOr maybe your code is handling how much radiation to blast a cancer patient with... Google Therac-25, one of the most famous software bugs dealing with exactly that.. If you are making something similar now, you better that testing, failsafes and a few more \"just in case are you sure this is the correct power to fire the laser\" screens in the final app are mandatory before release. \n\nDocumentation even is considered a mandatory part of the \"code base\" in some projects Ive worked on, app works great without it, but future development is always an option. \n\nI know Rust teams that build out stuff quick and fast in Python and don't care about any bugs til they have something working, then they scrap their idea and treat it as nothing more than a proof of concept (suppose you could call it a prototype), and then rebuild it in Rust. They do this to get a proof of concept out ASAP and prove its worth pursuing in Python due to how fast you can do that compared to the much more cumbersome (but faster and safer) Rust. \n\n\nAnd on the flip side of all this.... you have companies that have 0 unit tests, use a custom build script that no one can read or understand because Bob who wrote the script in a 36 hour code binge one day used his own custom language he developed in high school that uses Tolkien characters as aliases to traditional syntax, and they fired him in 2008 when the market crashed but somehow the company survived and they have an app that they have considered production ready even before Bob showed up... Users somehow are shocked through their keyboard every 3rd time they log into this app and hate it, but they keep using it so the company marches on and pretends everything is great hoping, and management will fire you if it breaks while you're there, and will doxx users if they leave a 1 star review.\n\n\nTldr; its a bunch of things, nothing specific. Hopefully the standards you set have testing, SPECIFIC mandatory features that need to exist first before new stuff is added, documentation, and have set things up in a way that it isn't a nightmare to maintain a year from now or when new coders show up. \n\nThats another reason docs are important to move on from \"prototype\", being consistent with a style guide and practices you use, even if they arent what the language specifies. If you write Python and decide to use CamelCase, thats gross... but if the team style guide says so, and your code is consistent, you use it even if it's \"wrong\". And new devs joining the team will be able to follow the style guide and be productive without issue. Apps, like companies, grow and being ready for more users isnt the only important thing, you should be ready to add new devs and set them up to be productive and keep things consistent ideally. \n\n\n\nWrote a lot and maybe seems like my comment is all over the place, but honestly thats kinda how it works. We are writing english words that software takes and translates to different words, which translates again through another piece of garbage bit of software into more nonsense words, until eventually those original words end up becoming 1s and 0s and through dark magic you made League of Legends appear. \n\nIts messy and a lot of what youre wondering may not even rely on the dev team, rather management and funding. There's a lot of \"shoulds\" that you should have before being production ready... but boss man wants that feature complete and we just dont have time to research the best way, unless you want to stay late on Friday, the client didnt pay for the 6 months of dev time needed to do it correct anyway, so do it mostly correct and do it fast...",

That's not what I mean at all. Writing a full course on OpenGL would certainly be useful *for you*, as a way to practice your writing skills and deepen your understanding. (It would also be a lot of work!) But what I mean is that if there's nothing significant to set your work apart, then it probably won't attract very much attention. So just prepare yourself for that possibility.\n\nRather than writing up your own complete explanation of OpenGL, it might be more productive to talk about your specific project. Like, here's how you *apply* the basic OpenGL concepts when building a universe simulator, and here are the interesting details and gotchas that a general overview wouldn't cover.\n\n> Once again, sorry if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to.\n\nThis subreddit has a pretty broad scope, so I don't think there's anything *wrong* with posting here, as long as you're not aggressively or deceptively self-promoting.

But if your goal is to ship products fast and you're okay with some vendor lock-in, BaaS makes sense for MVPs and side projects. Most BaaS platforms have decent docs for the stuff you mentioned (auth, payments via Stripe integration, form validation). The tradeoff is you're abstracting away a lot of the learning. For job hunting, employers value both - knowing how to build backends from scratch shows depth, but knowing how to use modern tools like Supabase shows you can ship fast. Real question though - if you're applying for backend or full-stack roles later, how do you prove you actually understand backend concepts if you only used BaaS? Like would you point to the features you shipped, or would you need to build something from scratch to demonstrate that knowledge?",

        "body": "This is really subjective but I will give you my experience:\n\nI started college in 2016, and by 2019 I began self-learning in addition to my courses to learn web development because web dev wasn't a thing at my university at the time.  My first few years covered computer architecture, databases, python and Java, data structures, and object oriented design (and design patterns in general)\n\nI started learning web dev with the basics, Javascript/css/html.  After a couple months, I started learning frontend frameworks starting with Vue (easy-ish to pickup imo) and eventually moving to React because it is more widely adopted in the industry.\n\nThen I went deeper into backend and ops.  Setting up auth, logging, APIs, and deploying the application.  This part was absolutely the most difficult for me and I had a written step by step guide walking me through the process of setting up VMs on Digital Ocean and AWS where I'd have to ssh in and setup hosting and start the application.  This process would have to be repeated (condensed a bit) whenever the backend application was updated.  Nowadays, it is much easier to host fullstack applications but this is still good to know as a professional.\n\nAnyway, all of that was another 2yrs of grinding and I did a webdev bootcamp around the end 2020.  I got my first job in 2021 (July/August).  So 5yrs doing this basically full time lol \n\nBut even then, programming is an ocean and I've spent nearly every day as a full time dev learning new things and improving the way I build applications.  You might be able to build your Spotify clone after a year or two, but I promise that another year will pass and you will look back on it as complete garbage.  And that's fine, that is the process of growth.  Just be prepared for a very long journey, this is not something that you will master in even a couple years.  It will take a lot of time, patience, and perseverance to reach your goals.",

You can do it without, but ORMs help.\n\n\nFinally, it enables other utility like data transfer object (DTO) where you have to translate between db and front end or remove/clean up objects you need for backend processing but don't necessarily want users to see on the front end.\n\n\nIn industry they're pretty common, especially on larger systems. My personal take is it's a lazy route for devs that don't know database stuff, but it does elegantly solve some problems so they have some value.",

Earning as much as possible in the shortest period of time without taking any large risks (FAANG) is probably the best strategy. You could also build deep domain expertise in a target industry, and then get hired to work at these companies anyway, and this will probably yield a better result because you won't just be doing micro optimizations for them if you go this route. You can still do this in your spare time, but I would strongly suggest you prioritize your economic welfare first rather than primarily chasing a technical ideal. You have to find a balance, it's okay to experiment and learn niche things in depth, but you want there to be an eventual payoff if possible. For example, learning Rust or Elixir is a good investment of your time, and you'll naturally develop a network to draw from if you want to start a company or join one, but something like Common Lisp has a low probability of a payoff even if it's more fun (yes, I'm bitter). I followed my interest and got a very good career out of it, but I've also seen what happens when people optimize purely for skill. As a developer in any mid to large sized company you'll basically never be given the discretion needed to fully utilize tools designed around peak individual productivity, but the money will dull the pain somewhat.\n\nYou have to develop a certain pragmatism about how you do things. I still actively pursue things that most would consider to be impractical, but I balance that with extracting as much money as possible from our corporate overlords and deep pocketed VCs.",

You can think of programming as artistic expression. I want beauty and elegance. I want to make the best software that I can.\n\nAlong with that comes learning. Along with that comes a job, because the pursuit of my craft overlaps with people's need for software.\n\nThe job is not the craft. Jobs don't pay you for beautiful, elegant solutions, they pay you for results. You have to figure out how to be a craftsman within the context of THEIR time and THEIR money to make what THEY want. You do get some push-back, though; if they hire you, they can tell you WHAT, but they are deferring to you for HOW. No one gets to tell me how to do my job, or they can do it themselves. As a junior, you get told HOW a lot, because there's still a lot of learning at the beginning of your career, but then you start developing an opinion, and eventually, it starts holding it's own. That's how you know you're ready to be a senior developer.\n\n> If you're only in this for money then you may struggle to find the motivation to continue progressing with your learning as jobs are not easy to get in this field.\n\nWho are you speaking for? Because I would say the majority of the industry would probably disagree with you. I have found very few craftsmen in my 30 years of pursuing software development. Most I've met have never given a damn, most I met literally say \"just get it done\", they say - and I've been told by them that they \"code for today\", as they see that as virtuous; that sounds to me like the goal is doing the least amount of work possible without getting fired, the least amount of work to gain status and pay, until they peak at diminishing returns. To them, their craft is corporate politics, and BOY HOWDY have I seen them master THAT.\n\nJobs are surprisingly easy to get in this field. You don't even need a formal education. Jobs are hard to get TODAY because the Trump administration is terrible for business and has ruined this economy. You won't see good job production until some time - probably ~2 years into the next non-Republican administration at the earliest.\n\n> Trying to speed run the learning process will also lead to burn out, there's no point in trying to learn everything that takes years into a month.\n\nYou can temper this with a sufficiently large ego.",

But you don't need developers for that - almost anyone with a little bit of programming knowledge can vibe code their way through the easy stuff.\n\nIt is when there are no off-the-shelf solutions, no tutorials to look up, the AI is striking out...that's when you need someone with skills. Someone with some mental fortitude to be able to work through complex problems, debug, and problem solve. Who can go looking through poorly written documentation or undocumented code. Who ultimately understands that, after a certain point, the buck stops with them - if they can't *find* a solution to the problem, they have to think through and *make* one.\n\nI think, like in an interview it is telling when a would-be developer get asked a question they've never seen before. They don't *know* the solution - but that's fine, because a lot of times you won't know the solution. So does the candidate sit down, start to think, formulate a plan, examine that plan, revise it and otherwise think through the problem until they get a solution? Or do they just shrug and give up and go \"I've never seen this problem before, so I can't solve it\"?\n\nSo, for instance, if a software developer wanted to know what the software developer mindset was, they wouldn't just post a question in a subreddit - they'd do some research. Find some books written by notable in the field and read them. Read some blog articles. Put together their own idea of what it means - and once they've put in the mental work of figuring it all out, then they might ask some others if they were on the right track.\n\n**tl;dr:** Being able to solve problems instead of just asking others/the web/AI for solutions.",

If you're still building UIs that look like MS-DOS and the Commodore 64, you're not really allowed an opinion on UI development.\n\nIn principle though, the recent trend has been for libraries to provide the functionality of common UI elements, and for developers to add the minor visual fashion changes. ShadCN, Radix, DaisyUI and HeadlessUI seem to be the most popular ones in my React bubble. This is a big change from even 5 years ago where if you wanted to build a dropdown select with styled options, you'd first spend a day building it yourself in styled-components or CSS modules before giving up, Googling a pre-built one, eventually doing `npm install bumfuck-dropdown-react` and praying that their styling API doesn't suck. Now you just pull it in from a library you're already using somewhere else, and add your own CSS. \n\nThis also works well with AI.

Which means every framework must implement them from scratch. To do that in accessible manner, they have to use aria semantics and behavior that are limited to those 40+ year old ui component concepts. For example, when you make a dialog, it must have dialog semantics and behavior, and it's going to look recognizably like a dialog in GEOS. \n\nNow what the hell is the point of that.

        "body": "I could be wrong, I've never worked with gmpy2, but I believe this is what's happening:\n\n`x` and `y` are never covered to gmpy2 types here, you are relying on the library to either handle the regular Python `int` and `float` types or create temporary gmpy2 type objects from them in order to do the math. The results of those functions will be gmpy2 types, but nowhere does any of this replace `x` and `y` with an equivalent gmpy2 type. This matters.\n\nThe source code for gmpy2 might help understand why.\n\n`qdiv` source is [here](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_mpq_misc.c#L162).\n\nYou can skip to line 210 since the first part is if you use it with only 1 argument.\n\nThe check for whether your arguments are valid is this:\n\n    if (!IS_RATIONAL(x) || !IS_RATIONAL(y)) {\n        goto arg_error;\n    }\n\n`IS_RATIONAL` is a macro defined in [gmpy2_convert.h](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_convert.h#L54)\n\nThe function works for `mpq`, `mpz`, `xmpz`, Python's `Fraction`, `int` types, and types with the `__mpq__` or `__mpz__` conversion functions (these are for writing your own custom classes, they do not get added to existing types like `float`, so they aren't relevant here).\n\n`int` is in the list, so the argument `x` is ok, but `float` is not in that list, and `y` is a `float`, so that check fails.\n\nI believe if you write `print(test(4, gmpy2.mpq(2.0)))` this should work. The reason `qdiv` does not work on regular floating point numbers. `mpq` numbers are similar to `Decimal` or `Fraction` types in Python, storing a numerator and denominator, and as far as I'm aware they're always stored fully simplified, so `2.0` = 2/1, so as long as both arguments are integers in any of the supported types, the division operation should be simple integer division for which they have a highly optimized algorithm. Dividing by a float however is not that simple, and converting a standard `float` into `mpq` is additional work. `qdiv` is an optimized function that's trying to avoid doing unnecessary work, so it simply says \"no, you can't do this\".\n\nBecause it doesn't do any unnecessary work, `qdiv` is faster, but the price is that it's more restrictive about when it can be used. If you are trying to learn this library, you should be explicitly creating variables using the gmpy2 types rather than relying on the functions to work with regular Python types and do the conversions for you when necessary.",

On the page for Multiple Precision Reals: is\\_integer() → bool: Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise. Does gmpy2.is\\_integer() say that it only checks value as opposed to type somewhere in the docs and I just missed it?\n\nI'm not a professional programmer by any means, but maybe the description for gmpy2.is\\_integer() should include that it checks only if the value is equivalent to an integer, not type? Or maybe there should be a method in gmpy2 to check type, like the normal python isinstance? I think it'd be reasonable to think that if you saw that if is\\_integer returns True if x is an integer, and used gmpy2.is\\_integer() to check if something was an integer and it returned True, that it would be considered an integer while utilizing gmpy2.\n\nAnyways, \"There’s little reason to try to use qdiv in your test code\". I'm testing qdiv and gmpy2 in general because I plan to use it on other code that I'm working on that can use arbitrarily large numbers where you could set the inputs to just be integers, and I read that gmpy2 is great for large numbers and qdiv is faster than div.\n\nI was testing inputs for various arithmetic with gmpy2 and that's how I ran into this \"whole number\" float \"problem\". It's not a problem for me to use python's isinstance function and/or use gmpy2's integer types like mpz. I'm just trying to learn more about coding mathematics.",

Like if you were reading data from a file or user input, you should ideally convert them right away so that you ensure any math being done on them is done through the gmpy2 functions.\n\nFrom my understanding gmpy2 can handle converting types very well, even converting directly from strings (so you wouldn't need to first convert input from a file or user to `int` or `float` before converting to gmpy2 types).\n\nAdditionally, I believe `mpq` can be converted to `mpz` as long as `is_integer` is true. I'm curious what you intend to use this for. From my understanding you'd need to be doing some pretty heavy math in order to justify using gmpy2, and there are other packages which might be a better fit depending on exactly what you're planning on doing. Packages like Pandas/Polars, Numpy, SciPy, etc. all implement their math internals in C or other compiled languages too.",

Macs reign supreme in dev here though. \n\nThe one thing I will say is I don’t recommend a Microsoft anything when it comes to reliability support and such. They mostly just work, but when things go wrong it’s always annoying, longer and harder to fix than the other brand laptops we get in enterprise. Other OEM’s fair much better, especially the big enterprise players like HP, Lenovo, Dell (though dell do make some junk these days for enterprise laptops to hit that low lease cost). \n\nReally though at that price point my recommendation with no other info is a MacBook Air. Best support, they last ages, are pretty standard in dev and cs circles, etc. only downside is the hardware is limited to when Apple stop supporting it so after 8/9 years they stop getting security updates… but I’ve yet to daily a windows computer that lives half that time, Macs often do. They also have by far the best resale.\n\nMy advice is really save some coins on another brand windows laptop or spend those coins on a MacBook Air tbh.",

The lectures are there to support the homework and to make sure you have the knowledge to complete the homework. In a good class, the teacher will simply have figured out good, small projects that are appropriate for the students' level. \n\nIf you are self-motivated to complete projects, and can self-assign appropriate projects, you don't need a beginner class.\n\nSince you're considering CS50x, I might hunt down whatever textbook Harvard's DSA class (or any other good CS university) uses and just buy it and go through it. Again, you have to do lots of homework programming projects. For DSA, be sure you do the math parts too. If you can implement a dozen data structures from scratch and analyze the time and memory complexity of a sort algorithm, you're golden.\n\nI would use a low-level language for the DSA class, C is good choice, but you can use C++ if you're careful about not exploiting too many C++ features. Learning DSA is learning what's going on under the hood of these higher-level languages. If you do DSA in C, you'll learn all the memory management you need. \n\nAnything beyond DSA is optional. Later classes will be specialization, or too abstract to be widely useful.",

        "body": "With composition the idea is not that it's easier to *write* — it's sometimes a bit more boilerplate in 1-2 places. But it *is* easier to read, and to refactor without accidentally breaking things.\n\nHaving said that in your example, whether the implementation of the behavior is the same or not, composition will look similar: it will make heavy use of *interfaces*. Using Go as an example (a language that only has composition, not inheritance):\n\n```go\ntype Collideable interface {\n    Collide()\n}\n\ntype Renderable interface {\n    Render()\n}\n\ntype Entity interface {\n    Collideable\n    Renderable\n}\n\ntype Octopus struct {...}\nfunc (self *Octopus) Collide() {...}\nfunc (self *Octopus) Render() {...}\n\ntype Spaceship struct {...}\nfunc (self *Spaceship) Collide() {...}\nfunc (self *Spaceship) Render() {...}\n```\n\nIn the example above, Collideable is an interface that describes \"anything that collides\". Interfaces are commonly described as contracts; they do not contain any implementation, but they describe that such-and-such object will have such-and-such methods.\n\nthe \"Entity\" interface is defined as \"anything which both collides and renders\". In order to be considered an \"Entity\", a type would have to be both Collideable and Renderable.\n\nA type satisfies an interface by implementing all of its mandatory methods. In order to be Collideable, a type needs a method called Collide, that has the same arguments / return type as in the interface. If it does, we say the type *implements* the interface.\n\nIn Go, once a type implements the necessary methods, it will automatically be recognized as implementing the matching interface(s). In the example code above, both Octopus and Spaceship implement all 3 interfaces. (In some other languages you need to do something like `class Foo implements Bar` to make the interface relation explicit).\n\nNow on to your question. Focusing on just the Collideable interface, there are 2 scenarios: Either we have a common implementation, or we don't. If we don't, then the `func ... Collide() {...}` blocks above will contain different code. If there *is* a common implementation, you can e.g. pull it out into an external function:\n\n```go\nfunc Collision() {...}\n\nfunc (self *Octopus) Collide() {\n    Collision()\n}\n\nfunc (self *Spaceship) Collide() {\n    Collision()\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use composition to create another Collideable object, and reuse it for the Octopus and Spaceship:\n\n```go\ntype Collider struct {...}\n\nfunc (self *Collider) Collide() {...}\n\ntype Spaceship struct {\n    collider Collider\n    ...\n}\n\nfunc (self *Spaceship) Collide() {\n    self.collider.Collide()\n}\n\ntype Octopus struct {\n    collider Collider\n    ...\n}\n\nfunc (self *Octopus) Collide() {\n    self.collider.Collide()\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, the above example has a bit more boilerplate, but we have successfully combined composition and interfaces to give both Octpus and Spaceship the same implementation of the Collide() method, by giving them both the same \"collider\" property internally. Both Spaceship and Octopus implement Collideable, and they do it using the same implenentation (from \"Collider\").\n\n(Note: In Go, interfaces cannot contain implementation, only a list of methods (and their type signatures). In some other languages, interfaces are also (optionally) allowed to contain default implementations of their methods. That would allow us to skip the whole \"Collider\" thing and just write the default implementation for Collide() on the interface directly. Having said that, this can be a bad idea.)",

If you think you've stumbled into a superior design that happens to use inheritance, you could consider going for it. If your discover that your design is wrong then you could refactor it into composition.\n\nIf you're not sure what to do you could err on the side of composition as a best practice. But I think it's wrong to dogmatically apply it (or most best practices) in a universal fashion.\n\nIf I wind up with several classes that all inherit from the top of the hierarchy in a default fashion and have almost all of the same methods just delegating to some member/field/property/attribute, and in particular if I'm conceptually referring to that class as a form of that delegated object class, it's a sign that I would probably better benefit from refactoring it to inheritance.\n\nSo do Octopus and Spaceship have no explicit super class? Do you think their instances ARE entities? Do they delegate heavily to a private entity instance? You'll probably have an easier time if you model it using inheritance. That's the way I think about it. I also don't mind getting it wrong and refactoring later, assuming I don't make a total mess of the system and I don't have a bunch of external systems that are going to be coupled to this particular design decision.",

        "body": "there are various ways to look at it.   At design time, sure, you usually look at 'this is a thing' vs 'this has a thing'.  But there may be more to it, and often, that is a grey line.  A thing can have a collision (has a?) or a collision can  be a thing too, that (has-a) participants .  A spaceship is not a collision, but a spaceship is a 3d point cloud that may touch another 3d point cloud and require behavior to detect that.   Or maybe a spaceship has-a associated geometry/cloud/volume?  Sometimes its just mental gymnastics around how your team thinks about the idea being expressed and can go either way.\n\nBut there are other considerations.   Collision detection is often a constantly running subsection of a game and may need to be as efficient as possible, so having it on the side in something as compact as possible may be a requirement regardless of how you feel about is-a and has-a.   An array-like container of small objects with something like (pointer, ID number, something) and geometric info (what volume does it occupy) that you can do a scene-wide check against may be necessary for performance reasons even if that means pulling the data out of the bigger objects in a bizarre (from an OOP perspective) way -- this kind of thing is why some games use parallel array type concepts when normally that would be anti-OOP.\n\nAnd it could be a poor example.  collisions are often done in passes, like center of object distance (skip if far away) followed by bounding spheres (skip if not touching) followed by simplified but correct geometry checking.  That would be done the same way for all your objects; it just happens that your octopus and spaceship have different detailed geometry in the final stage but you still do it the same way, different inputs to the same function (?) in other words.\n\nThe main thing I am rambling about though is that design can be a grey area at times, and you just have to make the best choice you can based off how you plan to use the information, which can be its own headache for something like the geometry of an object in 3d since you use that in so many places in so many different ways. It clearly belongs to its associated entity, but at the same time you may need to access a lot of them iteratively without any baggage.",

Getting a first job abroad will be extremely hard as an entry level, so just leave out those considerations for now. By the time you'll be ready for a remote job abroad, you'll find switching pretty easy. I know that you consider it to be a big endeavor, but trust the people telling you that as they are right. Also, if you want to be really competent as a backend developer, you need some cloud experience as well. Azure and AWS are the most used, so you'd probably want to make that decision as well and factor that into the language you are choosing. \n\nSecondly, just learn whatever feels more natural to you. Your first job will be in the language you learn now, and you want to get on the job market as fast as possible, so making it enjoyable and less cumbersome is a necessary thing to do.",

Reasonably, ask specific questions in both C# and Java forums.\n\nI worked in Java when it first came out.  I worked in C# when it first came out.  Both have come a long way since then.  Amusingly, C# was initially a Java clone for MS.  However, C# evolved past its DNA quickly, with Java playing catch up for a time.\n\nC# has the full support of Microsoft and tooling to match.  If you work on Windows or deploy to Azure, it is the way to go.  At this point, all of the backend stuff can run on Linux and supports containers like Docker.\n\nI don't know the current state of the Java ecosystem.  It maintains market share, but the tooling is a little less focused.  It's also notable that while the JVM is popular, the Java language has a rather tepid fanbase, with things like Kotlin garnering much more enthusiasm.\n\nI recommend C#, for the language itself, the support, the available resources, and just personal preference.  When you ask someone who endorses Java, make sure they're actually using Java and not Kotlin, Scala, or whatever else is out there.  The JVM is not Java, like the CLR is not (*shudder*) VB.NET.",

Because of Java's type erasure, you won't be able to just do something like `new BiEnumMap<Numerus, Casus>()`. At runtime, that would just be translated to the equivalent of `new BiEnumMap()` and the class will not have any way of knowing which enum classes you actually wanted to use.\n\nInstead, you will have to explicitly pass the `Numerus.class` and `Casus.class` class objects as parameters. The type signature would end up being something like:\n\n    public BiEnumMap(Class<A> clsA, Class<B> clsB) {\n        ...\n    }\n\nNote that this is the same reason why the `EnumSet` class doesn't have no-args constructor, i.e. you can't just write `new EnumSet<A>()`. The `EnumSet` class needs to know at runtime which enum type it's operating on, which means at runtime you need to either pass in the enum class object itself, or an enum value from which the class object can be determined.",

[Tarjan's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm) solves both of these at once.\n\nA strongly connected component is a group of nodes that are all mutually reachable, and the components themselves form a directed *acyclic* graph. Any walk through the graph must also be a valid walk through the components. So if there is a valid path, it will match the topological order of components.\n\nIn your first example, with the \"up\" direction disallowed, your SCCs will look like:\n\n    AAA\n    ..B\n    CCC\n    D.E\n    FFF\n\nand their reachability graph looks like:\n\n      A\n      |\n      B\n      |\n      C\n      |\n     / \\\n    D   E\n     \\ /\n      F\n\nand the topological order will be.either of the following possibilities (doesn't matter which):\n\n    A B C D E F\n    A B C E D F\n\nSince D and E are adjacent in the order but not connected in the reachability graph, that immediately tells you that no walk exists that visits every node. Conversely, if every adjacent pair of components was connected, then you could use that order to construct a valid path visiting every node.\n\nIn the special case of a grid graph with one direction disallowed, I *think* it's easier: an SCC always corresponds to a consecutive row of cells, so you can just look for branches when one row splits into multiple rows.",

I've seen it happen to coworkers too.\n\nI guess next time you're set up to fail or just feel miserable, start looking for other opportunities at that time, while you're still employed.",

Not because it's impossible to mentor new people fully remotely (I think my team did a good job of it with the new people we hired during the pandemic) but because most managers and seniors are not going to bother doing a good job of it. 6 months into the pandemic most of the new juniors I spoke to were completely adrift because their teams did nothing to teach them. You remember how there were a lot of engineers bragging about how little work they were getting away with doing while \"working from home\"?

Most of the world is dependent on few major companies like Nvidia and Google etc.. to make the best AI models and the best infrastructure for AI. Most of the world is just using the tech rather than developing it. So it will be hard to get into design for low level or PCB ASIC or really deep into AI because so many people have masters and PhD in AI and looking to get into these few companies who are actually developing AI models because it needs heavy infrastructure that most companies can't afford.   \n  \nSoftware Engineering in general is going through a lot and what needed an entire team of Engineers and Juniors can now be established by a couple of caffeinated Senior Engineers with AI tools. There is barely any real use for Juniors unless paying them like crap and treating them like cheap labor. Covid also taught a lot of the world to be remote-first and this opened doors for companies to hire from India and Turkey and countries with cheap software developer labor which take like 500 bucks a month. So many companies don't bother hiring a Junior who is new and unexperienced and paying them 10 times the amount. (this goes for remote company settings).\n\nIt is a tough spot and honestly. I am in the same boat as you and some of my friends landed a good job with really good pay but all they do is manage legacy code that seniors don't want to deal with. 7 years ago having some leetcode skills and 1 e-commerce website in your resume could land juniors decent jobs. Today there is so much competition, the need is reduced and companies don't have a lot of money to work with. \n\nI am still looking for a job tbh so I can't be your guide to success. But personally I am just learning cloud devops and automation. It gives some weight on your resume than just \"I can code\". I am applying for jobs in Europe and hoping for the best.

He said, \"You are asking what class can you take to be like Elon Musk. If I knew of such a class, then I would take that class.\"\n\nTwenty years ago, I felt stagnant. I went back to school, taking one class per semester. Twenty years later, I've completed a few degrees, and working on another.

Every semester I try to choose a class that will teach me a skill I'd realistically use. I've taken all the recommended classes and I've never used any of them. ha! On the bright side, I've enjoyed the classes, learned things I wanted to learn, and it makes my resume look much nicer, and my peers genuinely respect me for knowing lots of graduate level math, but I'd like to actually accomplish something and deliver value to the world with it.

I felt that I knew very little, the culture was kinda weird,  there were some big egos and seasoned jaded ultra senior devs that kinda left a trail of bitterness in the air. Competition, devs being passive aggresive, putting down each other, one upping each other. I didnt know it for the first year, but that company was very unprofessional and amateurish even though quite successful and big. It was a software company developing b2b solutions. \n\nAfter a while I noticed I was sitting with the same stack, same flows, almost the same user stories all the time. I felt like I was living groundhog day and definitely thought I made a huge mistake choosing this career. \nI realised I cant be working on the same product for 20 years. And I thought all dev jobs were gonna be like this and I had no ther skills.\n\nAfter almost 2 years I couldnt take it anymore, I needed to get out. I also, much like you, wanted to pivot immediately. \n \nThe easiest transition and most obvious solution for me was consultancy. \n\nI first joined a tech consultancy firm and the atmosphere change was night and day. Suddenly it was in their best interest to get me official certifications (they can sell you better to clients if you have a shiny cv), so it felt like being back at uni a bit, with studying for exams etc.\nAfter that, I got to work with a lot of different projects for different clients in different industries. The projects would be anything from delivering an MVP within 6 months internally for a client/company A to being placed as a dev on site and joining the team at client/company B - contracts could range from 6 months to a year and could always be extended or if things didnt work out my manager would pull me out earlier. It was the BEST experience because I got to work wkth very many different people that taught me loads.\nUnfortunately, change  in management + politics and the economy suddenly dried up the assignment pipeline and I was left on the bench for way too long. I decided to jump ship. \n\nI now work at a non-tech financial firm as part of their internal tech team. My team develops solutions for our non tech employees around the globe. This means many projects, some small, some big with many different focuses and tech stacks. I work primarily with people that studied computer science as a minor and kinda fell into development by chance. My role is to help professionalise their solutions. And I love it. I am not surrounded by tech mentality at all... its just finance and law. A nightmare for any brogrammer that yearns for silly valley and definitely not without its pain points. But for me its the best of both worlds, cos im still in tech, actively coding and architecting but the expectations are way lower, theres competition between finance bro and finance bro, but that doesnt affect me. Finance bros have to work Christmas but we do not, in fact we shouldn't really develop or ship anything during that time cos getting new update before year close makes finance bros very nervous haha. And now with AI in the air, our teams budget got increased, and we are encouraged to find novel ways to help make the firms employees more efficient/productive. That means a lot of autonomy to explore new tech stacks and solutions. It is genuinely fun again. A bit chaotic, but without the stress and expectation of greatness. \n\nAnyway... Just wanted to say theres better things out there. And that tech doesnt have to be too techy. Theres a light on the other side.",

One of the largest mistakes of my career.  I was promoted multiple times, got yearly 7% raises, and all that stuff so it wasn't clear that I was committing career suicide in the moment.\n\nI didn't know people working at actual tech companies to compare what was happening.  2 of my friends whet to get their Ph.D. in CS and the others I knew went to work at DOD jobs or equally shitty non-tech companies.  It wasn't until I found various subreddits that I realized what was going on at actual tech companies and how different our experiences were over the years.\n\nI was even leading teams of 20 SWEs, have my name on patents, and responsible for all software aspects of the medical device. I was working with interdisciplinary teams and all that good stuff.  The problem was I was learning learning one way to do things and that way was not how modern software was created.  It was old school 90's style engineering company with managers that have been there since the 80's and 90s doing things that exact same way.\n\nIt was top down management where they want engineers that just do what they were told and think minimally for themselves.. The company had a lot of lifers that got a job there as a new grad and just never left.  If you were not a lifer then you were early in your career and was easy to take advantage of.  There were very few middle career engineers with multiple jobs under there belt at the company.\n\nOnce I saw the light I started telling every new grad hires on the down low that they should stay for a year or 2 and learn what they can.  After that leave and get a job at another company that is more tech focused.  This company would talk about how they are growing by hiring 90 new engineers in the last year, but they don't tell you they lost 80 engineers over the course of the year so it was a net gain of 10 engineers.\n\nTake charge of your own career and don't expect any company to manage it for you in a way that's best for you and not the company.",

There might be a specific track or set of classes you take (honors, AP, etc). \n\nOnce you choose a college, choose a major, etc, there starts becoming a pretty wide range. People who are better students don't necessarily become better in the workforce, and people who were better students don't necessarily lead better lives. It's the same for everyone as they get older, not just CS grads. I have a cousin who is a lawyer and very successful. She's very friendly, outgoing, and good at her job. But she also says she got lucky and had a really great mentor at her first job. An old friend was a terrible student. He got a job partially by luck. A recruiter contacted him, he passed some new grad interviews (not tech), but they forget to check his transcripts. He did well enough in his interviews they took a chance on him once they saw his GPA. It worked out for him. \n\nAnd it's not like your first job sets things in stone. Plenty of people \"level up\" at different points in their career. A great support system is obviously awesome, but it won't always be available. And at a certain point, you're responsible for your own life and career. \n\nI've been solo a lot of my career. There are times I wish I had more mentoring. But I look at a company I used to work at. It fell apart after acquisition and leadership changes. People tended to scatter to one of three companies, all of which had people in leadership positions from the previous company. One the one hand, it's great you have a good working relationship. But it also felt weird, and there are times I wondered if people were scared or hesitant to try something new and expand their networks. I saw some places where once one of those legacy execs left, everyone started leaving. Maybe it was a sign. Maybe people couldn't last on their own. Maybe a combination. \n\nYou could also argue people later in life have more at stake (I personally don't like this argument). But some people will say they have a spouse, kids, a mortgage. Do they deserve less stability and mentoring than someone fresh out of school? You'll see some experienced people post here looking for career advice. \n\nI've given people who reported to me advice that at some point that they might outgrow the company. I'm sure there are other manager-types who would prefer their team stay put, since it makes things easier for them. \n\nYes, it's better to have a great manager, but you can't rely on that to shape your career. Most people aren't going to get carried and have things handed to them.",

Stanford probably has better instruction and network but much more expensive. Gtech has more breath is cheap but classes are consuming to graduate and network is similar to Penn so not a factor. after factoring time to graduation, cost is pretty much the same as Penn.

The network DOES matter, but it takes a lot more effort to integrate yourself when you're an online student. If you do an OMSCS but don't integrate and network or leverage what you learn to do projects you can show prospective employers, then it won't matter where you study.",

If you're a senior being demoted to swe2 or swe2 to swe1, I would find that dumb.\n\ntbh I find the whole demotion concept dumb, I would just accept a PIP and find a new position at that point.",

You're under new management, so there's no point being a nail that sticks out while they're looking to get things settled in.\n\n\nBut it's also a pretty strong warning to freshen up your CV or resume and start applying to other places. Early January is usually an awesome time to be jobseeking, so see if you get any bites. It's also still early enough that you can continue seeking with your current title -- you already have history and experience working at that level, and performed well enough that you were hired or promoted into it. So your resume will still largely reflect your assigned duties and experience for 3-6 months.\n\n\nSomething else to consider is that your manager is giving you an option here, which is *super* unusual. That sounds like they want to keep you, but budgets may be too squeezed right now for your current paygrade. As far as I'm aware, it's unusual for a manager to give this option instead of just issuing a termination. It might be that the department's budget can fit you, at least for the upcoming few quarters, if they demote and reduce your salary. Obviously your call on whether you want to voluntarily earn less to stay with them, but you do say you're not being set up for success here.\n\n\nWhere I live, unless it's an especially toxic workplace or you get a reasonable severance package, it's better to jobseek and make them lay you off (rather than quitting). If you quit, you lose access to some unemployment benefits.",

The biggest thing that’s going to hold you back is making it through resume screening, and without any internship or real production experience it’s going to be very hard. \n\nMy biggest suggestion is to network at companies where a referral actually helps you get your foot in the door and pushes you through the automated resume system. This means FAANG+ and big tech are out the door, as a referral will hold very little weight, and even if a real person reviews it, lack of experience will likely be your down fall. Connect with as many people as you can at smaller companies - even if that’s <200 employees. It might not even be a software company. Many CS majors have a “FAANG/Big tech or bust” philosophy and see everything else as a failure. If that’s you, you must put your pride away and take any chance you can get. This is a stepping stone, not the final form of your career.\n\nThe next thing is to get very good at interviewing, leetcode, and preparing for a specific companies interview. This much is obvious, but your hit rate for interviews will be low, so when you do get one, you need to maximize the opportunity.\n\nI’d also really inspect how meaningful your personal projects are. I was surprised at how much weight they pulled during my interviews/screening, and I was told by multiple interviewers it made a large impression - which also means I got grilled on them so they could verify it was real/I did it lol. If your projects are very generic, even if done well, they likely aren’t helping as much as you think. Pick something you’d really love to learn about or make - maybe hobby related  - and flesh it out a ton. The more niche/specific, the more memorable. Document well, consistent pushes, make graphs of your data and put them in the repo, reference research papers that informed decisions, etc.\n\nLastly, I’d genuinely consider if a masters is right for you. New grad applications are already hell on earth, but doing them with no internship will be a challenge and a half. A masters degree puts you back in “intern” status before you finish it, so if you put your all into the things above during intern apps, you would likely snag some. Once you’re back to new grad apps, you could have an internship(s), maybe some light research experience (even if no paper), TA positions, and a higher degree. \n\nGood luck, and give yourself some grace while understanding what you’re willing to do for the job.",

It helps you get the knowledge to get a job, and the connections while in college to spring from. You don't learn AWS or React in college or usually even modern programming languages, skills that many people spend 2-3 years on learning just to get their entry level positions, but the ability to learn those quickly.\n\nAnd should be applying to 2-3 quality positions locally a day, not per week (I wouldn't bother applying remote for a first position).\n\nGood news is that most people applying to junior roles wasted their time and are just as clueless as you. It's a tough field to break into but the payoff, a near 6 figure job with great benefits and work life balance, far better than other 6 figure jobs that require far more schooling and work and *money* to get into, is worth it. Work as hard as any doctor or lawyer or vet and getting your first job will be easy. If you don't, well it'll be very difficult.\n\nIt's not like the 70's where having a degree guaranteed a job. It hasn't been that way for a long time now.\n\nMotivation comes from how bad do you want it, and discipline. If you're hungry enough, you'll do the work.",

In the interview there will be 4-5 checkpoints, if you can get through the first 3, that typically is enough for a hire decision is the general sentiment.\n\n>can I use AI a lot?\n\nThere have been several cases where the interviewer has asked the candidate not to use AI for a particular question/checkpoint, but in general you'd be able to use AI for most of the interview\n\n>which models from the list above are suitable?\n\nI believe they added support for more models recently, to avoid being overwhelmed pick one and practice with it.  For improved accuracy, you'd probably want to go with GPT-5 or one of the more recent Claude models, for better speed e.g. for simple tasks maybe go with gpt-4o-mini\n\nthis guide should help with [your prep](https://www.coditioning.com/blog/13/meta-ai-enabled-coding-interview-guide)",

I'd personally find it hard to justify using k8s / preferring availability just for this. Also, a core principle of SRE is having an error budget that you want to actually spend (i.e. having services that are \\*too\\* reliable is \\*bad\\*). I'd be a bit apprehensive to hire a senior whose recommendation is \"reliability at the cost of everything else\".\n\n## Too much human reliance\n\n\"A justification in the PR, and/or\"\n\nPersonally, not a big fan of answers that boils down to \"let humans do this X process\". Humans are faulty, and manual processes tend to get ignored over time (e.g. people just rubber-stamping the justification).\n\n\"At each stage, monitor:\"\n\nThis also seems like an extra toil that can be done automatically.\n\nIn general, adding more bureucracy / slowing down development for the sake of needless reliability is also bad, similar to above.\n\n## Seems pretty textbook\n\nOverall, your answers give me the vibe of \"recommend the commonly recommended thing, just because that's best practice, without further thought\", like immediately jumping to k8s, specific DB, and so on.\n\nIn the system design interview, I think I'd personally like to see how you think from the fundamentals and the first principle more, rather than just giving me a list of technologies immediately:\n\n- For a simple webapp, do we \\*really\\* need to use k8s? You're signing up your team to eat a lot of dev / knowledge cost before even hearing the full constraint of the problem.\n\n- Before jumping into the details, why not verify more fundamental things? e.g. do we need redundancy across different regions?\n\n- NoSQL theoretically scales horizontally better, but is that true in reality? In a lot of cases, there is a mismatch between theory and reality. Similar to how linked list are faster than arrays on paper for some use case, but they tend to be slower in reality due to caching performance.\n\n## Random nit\n\n'“What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.' \n\nIncorrect? I'd expect the answer to be 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. I'd personally shrug it as nervousness / misunderstanding, but maaaaybe there's a small chance of interviewers really disliking it (e.g. \"this person has only ever deployed things on localhost\") since that's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong.\n\nDon't beat yourself up too much though, interview fails sometimes do just happen randomly (e.g. there just happen to be unicorn candidate right after you). From the post, it seems like you're a pretty strong candidate and the interview itself went pretty well.\n\nI think the core of the issue is that a senior SRE should be someone who knows why we need to follow mainstream recommendations, and when we should not follow them. I'm not saying you don't have that quality, but I think the way you answer the interview questions did not necessarily demonstrate that due to the textbook answer and overemphasis on reliability above all.",

One enhancement: frame your debugging narrative around measurable outcomes. Instead of just \"add alerts,\" try \"implement alerts on CrashLoopBackOff with a threshold of X failures in Y minutes, reducing MTTR by Z%.\" Concrete metrics make your experience more verifiable and demonstrate production impact.\n\n\n\nFor system design—your answers were directionally correct. The feedback about being more concrete is key. When discussing rate limiting or scaling strategies, reference specific implementations you've actually built or studied. \"In a previous project, I implemented X pattern which handled Y req/s\" is stronger than theoretical answers. Even side projects count if they're deployed and measurable.\n\n\n\nThe rejection stings, but use this experience to build a portfolio of implemented systems you can reference. Deploy a small web app with the observability/scaling patterns you discussed. Document it thoroughly. Next interview, you'll have concrete proof of these concepts in action rather than just theoretical knowledge.\n\n\n\nWhat specific areas do you want to strengthen with hands-on projects?",

Scoping works like most other languages, literally what are you talking about? The only \"odities\" that makes Python quite different is the GIL, but why would a beginner be concerned with that?\n\n>the community is full of awful code from terribly bad coders who aren't even interested in actual software engineering\n\nWhich language doesn't have garbage examples online?

It’s awesome you’re writing code still and staying sharp in dev, I agree they iOS dev is a pretty small subset of swe and a lot of us take unideal gigs at times while we keep looking. This is the way. \n2. While owning a product and making it from the ground up is a great skill itself, it doesn’t necessarily scale to large scale software development. Working on a team with a lot of members where you’re all trying to keep your branches in sync with dev or main, submitting merge requests, approving them, working to extend someone else’s code (on large teams you can spend spend more time reading code than writing it). You have to work with code that’s very unintuitive to you at times. Someone else might be architecting and providing the boundaries. You have deadlines and all kinds of non coding tasks you have to keep up with, getting pulled into meetings, people asking you for help while you’re in the middle of things, you’re asked to estimate the complexity or time it takes to roll out features, you have to constantly manage risks to changing the project’s codebase both in terms of it breaking production and interfering with other people’s work. You have to learn who to bug for specific things you need in terms of red tape in your organization and it will impede your progress at time while you wait for things, etc etc, it’s quite a bit different than solo dev work. \n\nNone of this is meant as a criticism, but you will not be a mid level dev on say a large or even medium sized team even if you spend 5 years programming on your own. You’ll merely be a really good junior dev probably. Those skills aren’t hard to learn either, but I would not underestimate the learning curve working on large teams if you’ve basically sat in your bedroom programming iOS apps for the last several years.\n\nETA: obviously you have things in place to manage risks and I’m not trying to imply that you write code and send it to prod, I just am trying to in an abstract way outline some things that working in industry on a team have that you’ll have to get up to speed on.",

So you know, I'd expect another 3-6 months minimum of study on top of that once you start getting interview experience.\n\nTry to find an unpaid internship is also my advice.",

Ignorance, youth, and naivete just easily succumbs to lies, this one in particular.\n\nEducation is the act of learning things. Education isn't bad. It's just that your education didn't end when you graduated. Right now you're being educated on tenacity, grit, the ability to adapt to pressure, the ability to evaluate previous decisions, navigating market conditions, extrapolating financial impacts, and all kinds of things.\n\nThe good (and bad) news is, even when you're hired, education will continue to not be a scam, as your education will continue in ways you did not expect, with topics that may include but not be limited to: how to deal with people you don't like, how to navigate ambiguity, how to deal with tasks that don't have criteria for success, how to draw boundaries, how to make mistakes gracefully, and more.\n\nEducation isn't a scam. I'm sorry you're going through what you're going through, but take it from someone who also struggled with a job hunt that lasted longer than the one you've been through: it is a filter, and there will be another filter after that, and another filter after that. You get to decide how you react to the negative pressure placed on you, and if you find that whatever you're currently doing isn't worth it to you: stop. Stop before you don't have a choice to stop, as the rest of your life now depends on that thing that you no longer find worth doing.\n\nYou don't get to choose what happens to you, but you do get to choose how you react. The world does not owe you anything, and I suggest internalizing that. Not getting the thing you want in a quick timeframe shouldn't lead to regret and feeling like you \"wasted\" your time, it should just make you ask yourself if you really wanted it to begin with. You sound young, and youth is, by definition, about making mistakes. I see you mentioned in the comments that you're only sticking to this because you've already dedicated time to it -- that's a sunk cost fallacy. Time you've already spent is gone no matter what you do, but the time you still have in front of you is 100% yours to choose how to use.\n\nGood luck.",

The standards are ridiculously high to the point that even coding everything perfectly doesn't guarantee an offer.

With generated code, I need a bit longer to review it and think about it to internalize the changes and structure so that in the future I can reconsider the code if it needs refactoring or is causing bugs. But all they want is more and they want it faster than ever.

On the other hand, Google @ Seattle is the smaller-ish office (like it's not Mountain View or NYC) and San Diego for Amazon... I didn't even know there was an office there. Remember that networking is super important for getting your first job out of PhD if you want to go into industry.",

My opinion.\n\nAt the beginning of your career, you're pretty much like every other CS grad, a big lump of clay that they have to teach and mold.  You might get a few more $$$ due to the higher education, but not enough to offset the extra 2 years and expense of getting the MS over the Bachelor's.\n\nAt the middle of your career, for dev jobs they're mainly interested in your tech experience and what you can do.  They don't want the lump of clay anymore, they want the refined tool for their tech stack or subject matter / industry.  So for basic dev jobs most would rather hire a person with the right experience than somebody who's never done the work they're doing but who has a Masters.  Which is when you try to get promoted.\n\nFor companies / leaders that are credential-focused, you'll be more of a promotion target.  With the MS-CS, that's team lead or architect.  With an MBA, that's management.  Whether or not you're deserving of those roles is another question, but for companies or leaders who focus on credentials, you'll move ahead of peers who lack them.  At the end of your career, that mid-career trajectory bears fruit.\n\nSo the question is, what path do you want?  If you don't know -- and it's OK that you don't know, job experience will help you figure this out -- then I'd skip the Masters for now.  Because you can always get it (or an MBA) later.\n\nIn \\~26 years in this industry, I've never seen a person with a Masters stand out so much that I wondered why and then discovered that they had a Masters.  That has happened for me with PhD's, that we give super interesting technical problems to and they come up with innovative solutions.  But I haven't seen that with just a MS-CS.",

And keep in mind that entry level DS job exists only when the economy is good . \n\nAs someone who does work with LLM models and AI engineering , I personally would raise an eyebrow if I saw AI Masters on your resume . I wouldn’t throw away your resume but I would be asking you questions like explain the Transformer Architecture and the Self-Attention Mechanism.  A very basic question to testing if you understand the foundations behind LLM.  I don’t want a buzzword spokesperson ,we have MBAs for that .",

If you're having issues w/ lack of vocabulary/articulation, chances are that your fundamentals are lacking. You can go about filling the gaps either in a top-down way (e.g. start from what you know and work \"downwards\" into lower levels) or bottom-up (e.g. start from from C/ASM and work your way up back to high level).\n\nThe former tends to be a more pragmatic form of learning. You can, for example, go from knowing about calling fetch (vs whatever is the abstraction for it in your favorite framework) to RPC/REST to HTTP spec (what different headers do, etc) or go from ORMs to raw SQL to reading about db normalization, etc.\n\nThe bottom-up approach is useful for getting stronger at fundamentals, e.g. reading source code for hashmap implementations in various languages can help you understand how they actually work wrt memory layout, complexity, etc.\n\nWith that said, senior level isn't necessarily about those. There's some level of importance in being able to accurately convey technical ideas via jargon, but equally (or perhaps more) important is communicating at an appropriate level for the audience (e.g. a junior vs a director). You're not really going to find resources on how to navigate this stuff, your best bet is imitate your seniors until it becomes natural.",

Do 2 problems at least a night (1 hr) If you have to redo easys until you get it, do that. I would say spend 10 min on ur own on the problem if you can’t figure it out watch neetcode solution - then do it and then wait two days and try and do it on ur own and then if you forget watch the solution again. Copy and paste all ur solutions in a Google doc so u can go back to them (cause you most likely will have pseudo code next to it). Keep doing this with the easys until ir makes sense to you and you can technically explain what is happening, watching neetcode solution more than once will help you because you will start speaking technically and confidently. And then when you’re good at all the problems u previously did time box yourself for 30 min to work on the same problem - pretend it’s an interview by then u will be confident because you have done this easy problem more than once. And just repeat for mediums and hards (time box 60 min) \n\n\nMaybe you should also go back to the fundamentals in the language ur comfortable using (w3 schools), relearning OOP principles and other things you might have forgotten. \n\n\nUse ai to help you study, ask it to ask you interview question and then you write the answer  or if you don’t know what the algorithm solution is doing when reviewing the solution ask it to go through each iteration. Also ask DeepSeek (ai I use) to make you a study plan. But regardless you should do hacker hour where no matter what you do 1 hr of algorithms (at least 2 problems a day). Also use pomodoro where you study for 25 min and then you get a 5 min reward to scroll or get up and stretch or lay down. I use my Apple Watch to do it because it buzzes. You could also have a big timer on ur screen if you need to see it visually.",

Yeah you can Google it on the side, but a lot of times it's easier to briefly pause the meeting and have it explained by the person doing the talking. It signals that you're paying attention and willing to learn. I've had a lot of positive feedback about my willingness to do that, from both the business folks using acronyms I don't know and colleagues who were similarly confused but not confident enough to speak up.\n\n\nHonestly it sounds like you're selling yourself short a bit. I had some excellent mentors that beat in the idea of advocating for yourself in a corporate world, and being willing to make a change if the company you work for won't accommodate that.\n\n\nThat said, I also went through a destructive leadership turnover cycle and it fuckin sucked! I was having full on panic attacks and needed to consult a therapist to get through it, and I think I've come out the other side more resilient. \n\n\nSo do what you need to do, and if that involves seeking some professional help that's absolutely okay. My therapist likes to remind me that a significant portion of her clients are there for work related anxiety. Software Engineering is a high-stakes, high-stress career field.\n\n\nOh! Also, therapy exposed that I had a sleeping disorder which caused me a lot of physical symptoms like brain fog, difficulty focusing, and memory problems. Anxiety can absolutely play a role in that too, but in my case it was physical symptoms making my anxiety worse not the other way around.",

For any concept or specific interaction  between technologies I'm not 100% certain about or haven't touched in a while, I make a little sandbox on my personal computer with practical examples that I type out (not paste from google/ai) and play around with it for a day or 2 and leave some notes in markdown in the folder.\n\nSometimes you haven't worked with a technology in depth for months, I come back to those folders in such times and its a quick memory boost, imo more than you'd get if you simply read up on it or googled a singular question.\n\nFlashcards are decent for interviews but imo not amazing for in depth knowledge.\n\n2. Intelligence can't be faked (at least when working with intelligent people), trying to sound smart isn't a cool look. The people who work with you will know how well you know your stuff in the same way that I assume *you* know how well each of your colleagues knows your stuff - usually some are a cut above the rest, no matter where you work.\n\nI think you taking the time to write this post shows you care about your knowledge which is frankly more important than how \"smart\" you are in the first place, I'm sure it's really tiring being a sole provider and most people would also have trouble finding the energy to upskill in your shoes. Not always possible, but maybe try stealing a bit of work time to read up/practice if possible, when you're less tired during the day. Best of luck!\n\n  \nEDIT: Also, some times you just wont get a promotion - regardless of how well you do, there's many variables deciding who gets promoted - so don't take it to heart. The opinion your peers and/or technical leadership have of you and you work is more indicative of your skills than a promotion.",

They too want to get stuff out on time and are frequently more flexible than you would think, especially if you push back with solid compromises. Make your concerns known quickly so folks can shift scope. Use data if you can to support your case; using only your gut will frequently get you no where. As you get more practice and work with the same people your assumptions will get a lot better when faced with stuff like this. \n\nAnother thing I started doing later in my career is try and get involved more in project planning with product just to have a jump start on things.\n\nAnyway, good luck!",

Which is nice, but it also means there's plenty of space for communication to get lost.\n\nYou work for a startup. The whole company should be able to sit down and align on these things in one meeting. If you're not sure what the current stack/setup/codebase is capable of and how it's used, sit down with every other technical person in the startup and ask questions until you get it. If you find that requirements are changing on the fly, ask to be involved in all the meetings where requirement changes are decided/discussed. Enforce best practices by documenting the infrastructure, take meeting minutes e.g. in confluence, make sure discussions and decisions are not lost or forgotten.\n\nAlso document your struggles with the changing requirements so that you can show your boss, look, I wasted X number of hours rewriting stuff last month. If there's a dollar value on the time wasted, your boss will be more likely to try to support you, because the business also can't be wasting thousands every month on wasted effort.",

If everyone hates it, do something else. Or adapt the process so it works for you.\n\n\nIf you have people in your daily standup who aren't interested in what you're doing, your standup is too large. If most of the attendees are checking their phone or laptop instead of paying attention to who's speaking, your standup is too large. If you find that happening, bring it up with the team and make smaller groups.\n\n\nI honestly feel like a sprint longer than a week is generally too long, although this varies depending on what you're trying to do. I also find this to be a general indication that your stories are too large and need to be broken down more. Agile is all about fast feedback and two weeks to a month (or longer) is too long to go without feedback. If you do shorter sprints, you do need to have much shorter ceremonies as well.\n\n\nIf you have on-call during your sprint, you should reduce the number of stories you plan to handle that sprint. Agile is all about prioritizing things and empowering developers. So if the on-call is the highest priority thing, you as a developer should take that into account when planning out the sprint. Based on past results, if on-call consumes your entire time during the sprint, accept no stories that sprint.\n\n\nYou guys aren't really an agile shop, but very few places are.",

In each case, the emblem is mistaken for the discipline it represents.\n\nManagers clutching notes and markers are seldom distant from this same pattern of thought.\n\nThere is little to be done to reverse it. Cultural change is slow, costly, and perilous, and many will resist it with quiet persistence or open force, for the familiar order offers comfort and shelter.\n\nFor a season, one may even learn to navigate - and perhaps benefit from - such dysfunction.

I'm not sure where your deficiencies lie, but I'll tell you what I needed. \n\nFirst thing is to understand what a dependency inversion framework is. Understand concepts like bean, bean lifecycle, constructor injection, application context. The spring framework is rich, learning to leverage its robust ecosystem to solve rudimentary problems is a key to success. \n\nThe second thing that helped me was understanding design patterns. This one is somewhat controversial. Some people think that they only exist to cover up for language flaws and that they lead to overly abstracted code. Those people aren't wrong but don't worry about joining the debate. Whether or not you believe in using them you will see them all over your code base. [neetcode: 8 design patterns every developer should know](https://youtu.be/tAuRQs_d9F8?si=My6PZMe7diw444c9) this is a decent intro, I'd recommend finding a modern book in java to continue this. \n\nNext recommendation depends on what versions of Java your company leverages. Java has a robust collection interface that makes it very easy to do many operations on a collection of data though method changing. The stream API. (Java 9)  Java 21 added virtual threads, a huge improvement for concurrency when using I/O heavy processes. \n\nGood luck.",

Collect some simple data on the things that matter to you. Ensure you're making regular progress on the things that matter to you, and doing things you enjoy, with some regularity. Backsliding is OK, bad days are OK. Focus on the big picture. Key thing is to understand, if you introduced a change, did it have a measurably positive effect. You could bounce into a new job and be just as, if not more, miserable. Again, backsliding is OK, but it's important to understand when you're making forward progress and when you're backsliding.\n2. Work with people you actually like. Working with assholes, absent subcontractors, and awful customers aged me substantially.\n3. Exercise. Doesn't matter what, doesn't matter when, focus on building the habit.\n4. Diet. Learn the basics of cooking if you aren't already capable. Track your calories/macros for long enough to have a good \"broad strokes\" understanding of what you're putting into your body, and what your specific body/lifestyle actually needs nutrition-wise.\n5. Have a ***social*** hobby that you engage in regularly. Challenging as an adult with marriage, mortgage, kids, indigent parents or loved ones, etc. But again, build the habit.\n\nI lean on 2, 3, 5, and my family pretty heavily during the rougher weeks. Sometimes the family is the ***reason*** for the rougher weeks and I have a frank talk with my boss -- a person I work with and actually like -- about chasing some shiny objects for a bit instead of my current priorities. Support structures are important.",

Most likely this would never come up for you and it'll probably never come up for me again.\n\nSo just pick the one that you feel like will be the happiest day job for you.

Realistic targets imo are applied LLM, research engineering, and platform style roles focused on retrieval, eval harnesses, and prompt tooling. I split time 70 percent project, 30 percent interview drills. I used timed mocks with Beyz coding assistant alongside prompts from the IQB interview question bank, and I kept a STAR story bank with 90 second answers.

No way you're going to sit through hours of calls with people, 70% of whom you can probably tell you don't want to hire within the first 30 seconds. What makes job fairs good in my experience is that the people attending are already pre-filtered (whether it's by school, industry, city, etc.). \n\nIf you open the floodgates to the general public, you won't have enough hours in the day to get to everyone. If you have some selection criteria that narrows down candidates before the event, then you've basically constructed the same set of barriers that left people ghosted and rejected in the first place. Not trying to hate, just curious how this thing scales.",

        "body": "Having been through this a couple times, my advice is to look at how much you're being paid to stay. Deals differ, but in my experience if you're going to get a compelling equity payout, retention bonus, stock grant in the new company or are seen as playing a role in the acquisition (in a way that materially benefits you) you'll probably know about it (even if not exact numbers) within a week or two. If you're not being paid anything, treat it like any new job, and evaluate it on those terms. Would you have applied for this company before they bought your current employer? Are they doing anything exciting? Are they hiring for your role + experience?\n\nAlso: executive bullshit can get especially thick after deals like this. They likely do have retention bonuses or targeted bonuses for certain milestones even if you don't, and otherwise decent people have a way of rationalizing really shitty behavior when someone dangles enough money in front of them. So, if you're hearing about the 2026 roadmap, that there will be no layoffs, or other stuff that paints a rosy picture around the future, take it with a big grain of salt. They _might_ not be lying outright (or they might be!), but they may have a lot of incentive to hold off a mass exodus even if leaving would be the better move for employees.\n\nWhat I'm reading is that you weren't really happy before this deal, you were serious enough about leaving to have offers on the table relatively quickly after the deal, you're not super jazzed about what the new company is doing (you don't mention this at all in your post), and you're probably not going to get much/any retention $ from this (sorry, but I think you'd know about it by now). I actually had almost exactly this situation earlier in my career, bought the BS, stayed, and regretted it. I like to think I'd be out the door pretty quickly if it happened again.",
