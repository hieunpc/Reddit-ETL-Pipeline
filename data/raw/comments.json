A common gap is treating pipelines like coding exercises instead of production systems with monitoring, data quality, and consumers. Big tech interviews care less about memorized syntax and more about whether you understand how data actually behaves over time.

How did you use both business and data engineering expertise to design, propose, modify, and execute a solution? How did you ensure your proposed solution *actually* addressed the business problem?\n\nI'm consulting with a company that used a large vendor to design their data solutions. None of those original solutions actually solved the business problems at hand, despite the fact that they handled all of the data, did transformations, designed and scheduled pipelines, and all of the other data engineering fun stuff.\n\nToo many technical and data folk will specify and build something very technical and impressive looking just enough to get greenlit by managers. Then they go and build said thing and deliver the equivalent to a car whose wheels are on the roof. They met all the expectations: an engine, uses gasoline, produces torque through wheels, has seats, etc., but ultimately built something useless to the business.\n\nReviewing that previous group's work, I've found that their stakeholder presentations are full of technical diagrams outlining the tools and technologies they will use, and how cool said tools are, but overall they contain little about how they will help. Using cars as an analogy (again), it's as if one advertised how great the metallurgy is in the car, what electrical connectors it uses, etc.; that kind of detail is ultimately important, the engineers are interested in it and stakeholders are impressed by it, but what *actually* matters is how the car works. Is the car safe, can it accelerate well, does it have good enough mileage, can it accommodate everybody in it, does it do what you need, and can you explain why and how it achieves all of this?\n\nHow do *you* avoid doing the above and ensure your work fulfills business problems? Can you work both domains simultaneously: both understanding the business *and* having the technical expertise to construct data solutions that solve the problem? Can you show your technical expertise while explaining the business problem, and then show your understanding of the business problem while discussing your technical expertise? Can you keep all of this together in a cohesive story?\n\nLastly, can you demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt? Can you learn new business environments/problems and then describe how you would approach finding a technical solution? Can you show that you're not a one-trick pony and have found proper solutions to things? The way my manager framed it: can you be left alone with a client such that your manager can sleep easy, knowing you will properly present and harvest information correctly?\n\nBeing able to speak both \"languages\", business and technical, puts you far ahead of other candidates. In interviews, I often find myself interviewing the interviewer, asking about the characteristics of the project, discussing their current solutions, and where they're trying to go. Then from there, I describe technical solutions, the needed labor/resources, and how the outcomes of said solutions will solve their business problems. I interweave past experience into this to demonstrate familiarity and competency. Also, don't be a know it all - when you encounter something you don't know, say so and provide your approach to developing understanding - people can tell when you're bullshitting, and dishonesty is always a major liability.\n\nAnyway, that's my two (hundred) cents.",

Could be a flat table (IMHO most common)\n\nData scientist I would explain the data vault concept so they can search the data for themself, only require that they have something that describes for them what they need.\nI need that for the data lineage. Because I need to know if something is broken in the data to inform.\n\nI hope that helps as a rough overview.",

You generate the code to download the historical weather and air quality data (backfilling) into feature groups (tables) and write an incremental pipeline to download weather forecasts, weather observations, and air quality observations. \n\nThe 1st challenge you will encounter is how to perform a temporal join to join air quality observations with weather observations. This requires an ASOF LEFT JOIN between the tables. Only a few data warehouses support it it (and Hopsworks feature store). You want that data back in Python (e.g., Pandas DataFrames) to train the model. Hopsworks provides that data via Arrow from the Lakehouse tables. If you go via JDBC/ODBC to your data warehouse, performance will be vile - Arrow (ADBC or ArrowFlight) is best for Python clients.\n\nMy book (referenced in the thread) covers these fundamental skills of backfilling vs incremental pipelines and data models - star schema, snowflake  schema data model and OBT (don't use this for ML!).",

The entire company is remote.\n\nI can generally work \"U.S. business hours\" but might work East Coast hours one day and West Coast hours the next day depending on what works for my schedule. If I need to be gone for an hour in the middle of the day, I block it off on my calendar. If I need to go to a longer appointment, I'll book it either at the beginning or end of the day, block it off on my work calendar, then let people know in Slack the day before. If I need to flex more than two hours like that, I usually just take half a sick day--I think I get 9 sick days a year? \"Unlimited\" vacation days, though. The assumption is that sick days are short-notice while vacation days are approved in advance.\n\nI usually have two 1-hour meetings on Mondays, then no meetings the rest of the week; every 4-6 weeks, I have a 30-minute meeting with my manager. There is a monthly Engineering \"meeting\", but it's recorded, so you only need to join the Zoom if you feel like watching live or want to ask questions in the Q\\&A; the agenda is provided in advance. Everything else is asynchronous, including the daily standups, Product updates, etc., unless you want to ask someone questions \"live\" to debug a project you're working on. Then, a meeting is scheduled. \"Just hopping on a call\" isn't really a thing in my team, because if you need to ask detailed questions on how to do something, that means the documentation needs to be improved, which means someone needs to write more down for the next person. So again: the call should have an agenda prepared and sent in advance.\n\nI am on-call 24/7 a week at a time, every 6ish weeks. There are rarely pages outside of business hours, though. Only a few times per year.\n\nI would say all the flexibility on my team is because everyone is senior+, so no one really requires close \"supervision\" per se. We also have tight delivery deadlines, so regardless of schedule flexibility, you won't last long if you don't get your work done.",

It costs about $200 month. Relatively simple to setup and develop, large userbase for questions and help.\n\n2. Set of different tools\n\nYou need place to store your data, some database or S3 bucket or something, it costs something but not much. Then you need move your data to your chosen storage, for example Python and some orchestration tool. Lastly some tool to show your KPI's, like PowerBI, Astrato, etc. Those cost something too. Starting from zero can be difficult to decide what you need and what to use, solutions have lots of users, help and examples are easy to find.\n\n3. Build everything yourself\n\nThis depends about your skill set, how much time you want to spend with this, how large your userbase etc. Doable but I don't recommend, others have already solved all the problems you have to solve in this, takes much time and security is always worrying. No other users, help can be difficult to find.",

A lot of the workarounds requires airflow or similar but that doesn't help us dbt cloud folk.\n\nAlso, to be clear, parse is likely a misnomer here, dbt doesn't have to touch the db on a parse normally. Compile is what is probably eating OPs compute and time. Even then it's kinda crazy how much time it's taking for them. We have 5000+ models (with thousands of tests too) and it doesn't take that long for a full compile. Like 3-5 minutes. And that's including a lot of introspective adapter calls.\n\nI've also seen other folks manipulate the hash that dbt checks so it doesn't think it needs the full parse as an alternative workaround. It does need something like airflow to do it, given I'm on dbt cloud I can't.",

But if you're doing a bit that's full refresh at the same time consider different frequencies based on day of week & hour of day.

Scalability -- build templated scripts of processes that only require inputs to run.

Ease of understanding -- simply have processes for each source that move and/or process the data. It's a bit easier to understand for other people and new joiners since there's just one thing to look at which could be a bit more scalable in the future since other people can chime instead of you bottlenecking your data team\n\nI've seen 2 work well when there isn't loads of data but a big need for data in the company. \\[1\\] works well in say traditionalindustries like manufacturing where realistically it will always be a central data or IT team trying to process probably quite a lot of data, so it depends but the key always is design first then modularity IMO",

At different layers of the stack there's different approaches.\n\nFor custom API extractor's, I wrote the first two as completely separate. Then when I was working on the third, I started by copy-pasting stuff from the first two, looked at where things were identical and put as much of the overlapping code as I could into a library. Then I made all of our future extractors use that library. We were writing them in go so this took the form of an interface which extended `io.reader` that the custom extractor would implement.\n\nFor loading, using the aforementioned library produced data in a standard format along with a schema file that could be used to generate a snowflake load statement. Then we had a single snowflake load component defined in our task orchestrator which we re-used everywhere, changing only the configuration. (We used argo-workflows as our task orchestrator instead of Airflow. I... don't recommend doing that)\n\nAnd then for transform jobs, I'd conceptually sort them into two categories. \n\n1) Transforms which you can determine programmatically from some sort of metadata. This could be standard transformations you perform on every table like an upsert, or it could be parsing fields out of a JSON document based on a schema. You should generate these SQL statements with code. You can have that code be DBT macros, use code-gen to generate DBT statements, or just generate and run the SQL statements from your application. I'm not a huge fan of abusing DBT macros for stuff like this because I find JINJA to be kind of messy, but a lot of people swear by it. Probably comes down to personal preference. As for having the code that generates the SQL statements also run it, you should avoid this unless you directly benefit from detecting and implementing schema change on-the-fly. Otherwise just having a daily/weekly pull request that you generate with a script is probably fine.\n\n2) Custom business logic transformations. I wouldn't do anything special here. If it's in DBT that's enough standardizaiton.\n\nThen once you're writing custom transformations you can kind of do whatever you want. DBT forcing everything to be SQL select statements is a pretty high level of standardization.",

        "body": ">Some joins require some of the main table, whilst other joins will use the whole main table\n\nCan you elaborate on this? It sounds like you could use some re-structuring of your tables if I'm interpreting this quote correctly. You shouldn't need every single column of your table to know what to join on. How many columns do your tables have?\n\n>I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted\n\nThat's because that's not how that works. A count statement materializes your dataframe, but it doesn't magically make that dataframe available downstream. That's what caching is for. If you have `myDF.count` and then use do `myDF.join(other, ...)`, Spark will either re-calculate `myDF` entirely (which means your `.count` statement is actually making your code SLOWER by doubling the amount of processing you're doing), or it will intelligently cache the results on its own after seeing that the Dataframe is being re-used, in which case the `.count` still didn't do anything that a cache wouldn't do.\n\nTL;DR - don't use `.count` unless you're trying to get the count. Any other use of it is a hack that can be done better in different ways.\n\n>I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact\n\nThis makes sense. With only 50-100 records, I guarantee that Spark is already broadcasting those anyway. None of your tables are large unless you have an enormous number of columns in your \"main\" table. 50k records isn't very much if you have your tables designed properly, which brings me back to my original question above.\n\n>Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without?\n\nYes, you should always use good engineering practices and write clean code. Using functions and classes has no impact on the Spark query plan, but it does have an impact on your and your coworkers' sanity.\n\n>Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?\n\nMaking your code maintainable and having a large query plan are separate issues that are only loosely related at best. Again, Spark doesn't care how your code is organized. Pulling code out into a function will not impact it at all.\n\nUse good software engineering practices to make your code maintainable. Use good data engineering practices to keep your spark plans efficient.\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter reading the post again, I have one more question\n\n>However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error.\n\nAre you doing something other than the joins? 6 joins isn't a lot and will absolutely not create a large query plan and also absolutely would not be the cause of an OOM error. Can you post a sample of what your code looks like? Because that really doesn't add up to me.",

Depending on what table i am joining i will also need to filter the main table. I do not bring in every single column from the small table but just just a few. I then repeat this 6 times. I then save the updated main table.\n\nThe way i implement the join is to get all the keys from the small table, lets say key1,2,3. then iterate 3 times and get all the key1s from the small table and join it to the main table on the left. repeat this for all the keys. And rows in the left that havent been mapped will then have a new column written as flag and map this to Yes.\n\nThe errors i get when writing it as a function / loop: The cluster runs out of memory (from my understanding of your point means my execution plan is too large)\n\nSo for my side question the main point i should be focusing on is how to make sure my execution plan is optimal? is there a guide on this?\n\n\n\nEdit: just saw your edit regarding looking at the code:\n\nSo first I get the keys from the mapping df: \n\n        valid_keys = (\n            mapping_df.groupBy(\"key\")\n            .count()\n            .select(\"key\")\n            .distinct()\n            .rdd.flatMap(lambda row: row) # we want to flatten to make a list\n            .collect()\n        )\n\n I then loop to do the joins:\n\n        # Step 2: create a dictionary that only has the join keys that we need\n        filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in join_keys.items() if k in valid_keys}\n        final_matched_df = None\n        current_df = main_df\n    \n    \n    \n        for key_name, key_cols in filtered_dict.items():\n            # Drop output columns from current_df BEFORE the join to give us the filtered df without the output columns\n            for col_name in output_columns:\n                if col_name in current_df.columns:\n                    current_df = current_df.drop(col_name)\n    \n    \n            # Get the mapping key which is the key + the output columns on the key we are joining by\n            mapping_key = mapping_df.select(*key_cols,*output_columns).where(col(\"key\") == key_name) # return the rows where the keys match\n            # display(mapping_key) will do join on key 1 then get key 2 then key 3 etc\n            # We join the mapping key row on the key and get the mapping key which includes key + the output columns\n            joined_df = current_df.join(mapping_key, on=key_cols,how=\"left\")\n            # get DF which only has the matched rows\n            matched_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNotNull())\n            # Accumulate the DF with the matched data\n            if final_matched_df is None:\n                final_matched_df = matched_df\n            else:\n                final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(matched_df)\n            # Get the unmatched rows for next iteration\n            current_df = joined_df.filter(col(\"key\").isNull())\n\nThen i create a flag if a join doesnt occur:\n\n    \n        # create the flag\n        if missing_flag is not None:\n            final_matched_df = final_matched_df.unionByName(current_df).withColumn(\n                missing_flag,\n                when(col('key').isNull(), \"Y\").otherwise(\"N\"))\n\nSo this code will be called 6x (one time for each small table)",

It's a combination of:\n\n*  Market temperature\n* You as an individual at a technical level\n* You as an individual at a personal level\n* How realistic your expectations are\n\nFrom what I read on the subreddit, people who struggle a lot tend to have very unrealistic expectations for their first role, underestimate how much work is required, as well as overestimate their own position within the job market e.g. no years experience, done one bootcamp, \"can't find a remote job paying $200k USD - job market is COOKED\".\n\nPurely anecdotal although I got into Data Engineering during the previous DE boom 5 years ago, so I had market temperature on my side.  Additionally, I was unemployed so was programming, studying, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours per week as well as applying for jobs within the country I'm a citizen of, so a lot less complications in terms of borders.\n\nBased on what you have written, there is a possible issue with borders although if the subreddit is anything to go by, a lot of US work is being outsourced to your location.  I'd definitely consider asking r/dataengineersindia as they're likely well positioned to answer your question.",

I was once interviewed by a company that worked primarily with Excel and they'd asked me if I had experience with excel because they needed an excel guy who'd automate the excel routine and they called it a data analyst position but these types of companies never really understand that Excel is a spreadsheet not a database. So in your case, I wouldn't give up on being an analyst, I'd just try to find a job that has a different approach to what you are supposed to do. Otherwise DE will feel the same way in a company that doesn't understand the difference between a BI analyst, an ETL developer or a DE. So it ain't really about switching to another role, it is more about your current employee. And don't underestimate SQL. It is one of the most powerful tools there is in the data world. If you feel stuck with SQL, go and learn PL/SQL or any other procedural language, marvelous things can be done with it once mastered. Like the latest \"marvel\" for me was pg\\_clickhouse extension, you basically can query clickhouse from postgresql, build dashboards using just 1 connection. I am more of an Oracle guy myself, but postgresql and clickhouse or duckdb offer a new world of possibilities and it is all just SQL that you are feeling bored by =)",

And AI also gives nice ideas on how to tackle the challenges.\n\nMy advice is do not focus on tooling as the primary goal..\nLook into data governance ( most boring data engineering topic IMHO, and I put it here because it is about metadata)\nData quality ( that's always a thing, and IMHO the most interesting part)\nData modeling strategy ( that is the most difficult part. ).\n\nAll of these topics you can tap in today without changing jobs and they will accompany your DE career.\n\nIf you see a job that features a tooling that interests you, go for it.there is nothing wrong in that. But see it more like a car acquisition you always wanted to drive.\nAlso when applying to position try to highlight your core data engineering skills that you already have. I think that's a better thinking approach then do tool bingo. You might also discover more interesting jobs by doing so.\n\nI hope that advice helps you and provides some motivation to you.",

So, you either will have a vendor lock or mixing different entities in one (like Hive Metastore + Hive SQL).\n\nSecond option looks nice, for example, an OpenLineage standard can be used, but the existence of lineage in catalog will depend on query engine.\n\nIf I would build a solution on open source technologies, I would prefer a second option. Something like DataHub that supports OpenLineage ingestion via REST API. But I would avoid heavily tighten \"all-in-one\" solutions and would keep lineage as an option.",

        "body": "That overlap you’re seeing is real, and honestly, a combined solution is becoming the standard rather than a \"nice-to-have.\" In my experience, separating them usually leads to one becoming stale because they rely on the same underlying metadata context to be useful.\n\nHere is how I’ve seen this play out in practice -\n\n1. The Platform Approach (Unity Catalog) **-** I’ve used Unity Catalog extensively for this. It essentially forces the catalog and lineage to live together. Because the governance (permissions, access controls) creates the lineage automatically as jobs run, you don't have to \"maintain\" the lineage separately. The catalog is the map of the lineage. If you treat them as separate tools, you end up doing double the work to keep them in sync.\n\n2. The Open Source Route (OpenMetadata) **-** If you are looking outside of a specific vendor ecosystem, tools like OpenMetadata are tackling this exact \"all-in-one\" problem. They treat data assets, lineage, and quality checks as a single entity. It proves that the market prefers a unified view. Data engineers don't want to tab switch between a catalog to find a table and a lineage tool to see where it came from.\n\n3. The Shift to Orchestrators (Dagster) - The most interesting shift right now is actually happening in the orchestration layer. I’ve been using Dagster, and they handle this through “software-defined Assets.\" Instead of lineage being an afterthought or a documentation task, the lineage is defined by the code itself.\n\n* Assets **-** You define the data asset, and the lineage is inherent.\n* Asset Checks **-** You attach quality checks directly to those assets in the graph.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Yes, a combined solution is useful. In fact, things are moving even further, merging Catalog + Lineage + Execution (Orchestration) into one view so that \"accountability\" isn't just a log you look at later, but part of the pipeline run itself.\n\nHope this helps.",

        "body": "**Yes - combined catalog + lineage is the way to go**, and it's becoming the standard rather than a \"nice-to-have.\"  \n  \nFrom working on DataHub at LinkedIn, here's what I learned: **separating them creates semantic drift at scale.** Your lineage says \"user\\_events\\_v2\", your catalog says \"user\\_events\", and nobody knows if they're the same thing. When you have 100K+ datasets, this breaks governance completely.  \n  \n**Why integration matters more than people realize:**  \n• **Metadata propagation** \\- tag one source table as PII, lineage cascades it downstream to 50 derived tables automatically. Manual tagging doesn't scale.   \n• **Impact analysis** \\- \"this pipeline failed, who owns the upstream data?\" If you're jumping between tools, you've already lost.   \n• **Trust flows backwards** \\- you can't assess data quality without tracing upstream. Separate systems = manual stitching every time.  \n\n\nMost of the modern catalogs are moving to a model of  \n\\- out-of-the-box connectors that \"pull\" lineage into the system from external systems  \n\\- support reporting of lineage INTO the system via standard catalog-native API-s/agents/emitters or vendor-neutral protocols like OpenLineage\n\n  \n**The caveat the other responses touched on:** some solutions like Dagster's \"software-defined assets\" are elegant but only work for what the orchestrator controls. Your data doesn't start in the warehouse:  \n• Production systems feeding Kafka streams   \n• Real-time stream processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)   \n• Cross-cloud data movement that never touches your orchestrator   \n  \nAt my previous company, \\~40% of critical lineage came from **outside** the orchestration layer. You need a catalog that can **aggregate lineage from multiple systems** (streaming, production databases, warehouses), not just generate it from one orchestrator.  \n  \n**The test:** can you trace a BI dashboard → warehouse → dbt → Kafka → production database in one query? That's 5-6 systems owned by different teams. The catalog is your aggregation point. Best of luck with convincing your customers and the world!",

I had deployed my own project on AWS, set up a data pipeline and a basic streamlit front-end, spoke about docker, scheduled functions, the trade-off between different database options and why I made my decisions.\n\n\n\n\nMy advice, unless you get a role as an apprentice where you're guaranteed a job afterwards, don't bother. Grad schemes say degree or equivalent experience a lot of the time, and jobs themselves definitely value experience more.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, look up the apprenticeship providers in the uni league tables. If you were really serious, I'd recommend going to somewhere like Georgia Institute of Tech and paying out of pocket for a reputable course.",

We had a bunch of automated processes scraping data from different sources feeding it into our CRM and then triggering marketing automations. Seemed straightforward enough but then we started seeing weird discrepancies in our reporting and it turned out one of the integrations was pulling in data fields from an older deprecated system that hadn't been properly sanitized. It wasn't a security breach per se but it was definitely a compliance nightmare waiting to happen. Trying to trace that data flow manually was a total disaster. It felt like we were untangling spaghetti and every time we pulled on one strand three more popped up. What really helped us was implementing a virtual data platform that basically acts like an AI data engineer. It was able to map all the data connections identify the data quality issues and flag those unexpected data flows between systems we didn't even realize were happening. Like it showed us this whole chain of dependencies that would have taken weeks for us to figure out on our own. The cool thing is that it didn't require us to move any data around. It just analyzed everything in place and gave us a clear picture of what was going on. Then we used the no-code tools it offered to build agents and workflows that enforced the correct data governance policies and automated the cleanup process. We even built alerts that would fire off if any of the agents tried to access data they weren't supposed to which gave us some peace of mind. Honestly before this our data team was spending all their time firefighting data quality issues and dealing with ad-hoc requests from sales and marketing. Now they're actually working on strategic projects that move the needle. The company that helped us out has a referral program and Id be happy to connect you. I get a little kickback if you become a customer so full disclosure there but it honestly solved a huge headache for us and it sounds like you're dealing with something similar. I can drop you a link if you're interested.",

(Like: data/year=2026/week=1/data20260104_20260111.parquet , data/year=2025/week=52/data20251227_20260103).

It’s like a mailbox where the OS acts as the mailman and figures out how to transport the mail. \n\nSockets don’t necessarily need an address - e.g. you could have an anonymous socket for communicating between processes on the same computer. In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.\n\nWhen you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!\n\nHere’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. \n\nIn practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. \n\nIt is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",

In Java it's an object (java.net.Socket) with methods for the defined operations. \n\n\nThe actual implementation will be via references to data structures in the system's networking stack, which will keep track of addresses and buffers, and handle the encoding and exchange of your data via the system's networking hardware.",

        "body": "In a traditional UNIX system, when you tell the OS \"I want to open file /home/alice/notes.txt\" the OS says \"OK, your file is file #3.\"  The number (3) is a *file descriptor*, it's an integer ID assigned by the OS.  Usually the first file you open is file #3, the next one is #4, the one after that is #5, etc.\n\nIn traditional UNIX sockets, when you say \"I want to make a network connection\" the OS says \"OK, your network connection is #3.\"  Then later you can say \"I want network connection #3 to connect to server 10.234.5.67 on port 80,\" followed by \"Send the bytes 47 45 54 20 2f 0a 0a over network connection #3\".\n\nMost of today's networking systems evolved from traditional UNIX sockets and work basically the same way, even on \"non-UNIX-like\" platforms such as Windows.\n\n> Is a socket an object?\n\nThe socket is the object in the OS's internal data structures that is manipulated when you tell the OS to do something with network connection #3.\n\n> Is the socket a number?\n\nFor the purposes of asking the OS to do something with a socket, the socket is #3...but \"3 means the connection between this computer and 10.234.5.67\" is only valid in the context of a specific conversation your program had with the OS.\n\n> Is the socket a file?\n\nThe \"numbers the OS hands out, like #3 above\" are called *file descriptors*.  They were originally made for files, but were adapted for sockets.  When you want to write the word \"hello\" to a file that you previously opened and the OS told you it was file #3, you tell the OS \"Write these bytes to file descriptor #3:  68 65 6c 6c 6f\".\n\nOne interesting decision they made was that if #3 refers to a network connection instead of a file, then *you can still tell the OS to read or write bytes exactly the same way*.\n\nA socket isn't a file, but it sort-of acts like one.\n\n(UNIX domain sockets are a different beast.  I'm not going to discuss them here.)\n\n> Is a socket an IP:port combination?\n\nNo.  IP:port combination is a setting you put on the socket for outgoing connections.  For incoming connections you set a port; the OS only gives you connections from others requesting that port.  You can also optionally set an IP address for incoming connections, sometimes called a \"bind address\".  In case your machine has multiple IP addresses, the bind address tells which one you're interested in getting connections from.\n\n> when creating an HTTP server, why do we use sockets\n\n\"Why do we use sockets to make an HTTP server?\" is like asking \"Why do we use a print statement to put data on the screen?\"  Because that's what the system provides.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff going on under the hood!  For example the humble print statement could be replaced with a syscall or a BIOS interrupt or writing pixels directly to a framebuffer or [building your own graphics card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs).\n\nBut as a beginner you don't want to think too much about the underlying layers just yet; you'll just get confused and overwhelmed.  \"Use a socket for network connections\" is the networking equivalent of \"Use the print() statement to put text on the screen.\"",

If you're wanting to deploy something with Docker then pick something that can run in a Docker Container, figure out how to containerize it or if it's already done try to figure out what they did to get the project container ready,  look into how the container is built, and then look at the steps needed to deploy the project somewhere.  From there you can begin to find where your knowledge gaps are and then go search for appropriate documentation, videos, etc. as you go.  \n\nIf you're having attention span issues then try to train yourself to do a little at a time and then come back.

MOOC Helsinki is gold so definitely stick with that.\n\nHere is a solid progression path with the specific skills you need for each stage.\n\n**Beginner Skills**\n\n* **Core Logic** You need to master `if` `else` statements and loops like `for` and `while` to control the flow.\n* **Data Handling** Get comfortable with `int` `double` and `String` types and using the `Scanner` class to get input from the user.\n* **OOP Basics** For things like a Bank Simulator you specifically need to understand Classes Objects and Constructors. You also need to learn Encapsulation which just means using `private` variables and `public` getter and setter methods to protect your data.\n\n**Beginner Project Ideas**\n\n* **Number Guessing Game** This is a classic for a reason. It forces you to use random number generation loops and conditional logic to tell the user if they guessed too high or too low.\n* **Console Calculator** Build a calculator that runs in the terminal. It helps you practice breaking your code into separate methods for addition subtraction multiplication and division.\n* **Simple Quiz** Create a multiple choice quiz. You will need to use arrays to store the questions and answers and a loop to cycle through them while keeping score.\n\n**What you need** You really just need a good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and you should absolutely start using Git for version control right now. \n\nGood luck and keep putting in the work!",

A CLI tool that grows features, like persistence, undo, or import and export, will teach you more than jumping straight to flashy apps. As you move up, projects that involve failure handling, like a small server that must recover from bad input or partial crashes, force you to think like an engineer instead of a syntax user. Also, not using AI for a while is a good call, but do not confuse that with avoiding documentation or reading other people’s code. Learning how systems break and how you fix them is where the real growth happens.",

The first thing I did was get assigned as an extra code reviewer for an MR that was written by a developer experienced in the language. I did my review first, and I had to spend time reading through his code, cross-referencing documentation for the libraries being used, and generally just building my understanding of the code. When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed. (Which is a good habit that I do for everything I review, not just this).\n\nAfter that, I did an MR of my own and had it reviewed by the person who had done the previous MR. There was still a ton of referencing documentation but I had a fairly good idea of what I needed to do.\n\nIt gets substantially easier the more experience you have under your belt.

Tutorials feel productive, but there’s nothing forcing your brain to retrieve or apply anything, so it fades fast.\n\nWhat usually works better is picking a very small goal and letting that goal pull the language in. Something concrete like parsing a file, building a tiny game, automating a task you already do, or reimplementing a simple tool you use. Then you learn just enough syntax to make the next thing work, look things up constantly, and accept that forgetting is part of the process. That cycle is what actually builds memory.\n\nDocs and references are great once you’re actively coding, because you approach them with a question instead of passively watching. If boredom is the problem, reduce scope, increase feedback, and write code every day even if it’s messy. Speed comes from doing, not from finding the perfect resource.",

The only things you really need to know are how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and maybe a little basic algebra. Many programmers go through their entire career with having to do barely any math at all.\n\n> Do note, however, that the answer is a bit different if you are interested in getting a degree in Computer Science. Many universities or colleges will have specific prerequisites you need to fulfill before you can either enter the major or graduate (calculus classes, etc). And, since Computer Science is, to a certain degree, applied mathematics, you will almost certainly end up learning about discrete math, writing proofs and other similar topics while earning your degree. You do not need to be inherently good at math in order to learn these topics (or any mathematical topic, really), but having some mathematical maturity certainly wouldn't hurt, and would probably smooth the learning process.",

Another thing that might help is Python with its very easy to understand object model.\n\nOOP requires a different way of thinking - kind of a rewiring of the brain to look at things differently. In OOP it's more a dialog between the individual objects than the sequential command patterns we are used to in procedural programming. In OOP you more or less \"talk\" to the objects. You ask them to do things for you. You ask them to change their internal state if needed (yes, the \"immutability\" topic will now come up and I might anger a few people with my mutable approach).\n\nMy breakthrough with OOP was when I got into my current job in Industrial Automation working with our DCS (Distributed Control System) and with our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. There, everything was object oriented with inheritance and I started to see the advantages and how OOP works. Our SCADA even goes further in the direction of being an Entity-Component system where each Entity can have many components with many different aspects, but that leads too far (it's basically just some very extended form of composition, not inheritance).\n\n> it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes.\n\nThis only boils down to practice, ample practice.\n\nYou will feel stuck and dumbfounded for quite some time but you will eventually reach the point where things fall into place and you all of a sudden understand. It's not as complicated as it seems.\n\nDon't give up! Keep going!",

It's a natural instinct if you spend most of your time close to the machine itself, but it's actually disruptive to learning HLLs.\n\nHLLs are designed to be somewhat implementation-agnostic; they have rules, and they trust that some intermediary layer will implement a thing that makes those rules go. Getting bogged down in how that intermediary layer might work (\\*) generally will impede your understanding of the higher-level layer. This is a skill I had to learn when learning SML/NJ: the fine art of no longer worrying about how the language represents a function, trusting \"It just does,\" and learning the language independent of its implementation. The language is just rules and math; you could implement it with pencil and paper if you had the time and patience. Once you have the language under your belt, you can start caring about how it was implemented on a Von Neumann architecture with registers, RAM, and the like.\n\n(\\*) C++ might be an exception that proves this rule; there are actually quite a few features of C++ where the reason they work that way is \"It made it a lot easier to write the compiler\" or \"Look, this language is old, and older computers didn't have enough RAM to do things like lookahead compilation or multiple passes, so it is what it is.\"",

Anyway, *everything* have a *name*, if I have blue eye, blond hair and 2 m tall, I'm a *lightower boy* \\- meh, I just figured it out, but you have the idea.\n\nThe best approach is to find synonims and similar terms, which you're familiar with. The most close synonims for an *object* is: record, structure, set of variables, and now comes the difference: with the *methods* (functions, subroutines, procedures) operating on it.\n\nIf you ever worked with files on Unix-like systems or Windows, you've already familiar with OOP. You create a File \"object\" by *open()* or *creat()*, which you can refer with the *file handle*, which these function returned. The variables of File is hidden for you, we have some idea how it looks, but we don't care as far we can call *read()*, *write()* methods to do what we want with the file, then we can *drop* or *destruct* it by calling *close()*.\n\nIn OOP, instead of file handle, you got a pointer (sometimes called reference), and you can \"call\" methods. Now comes the part where you'll understand the whole shit:\n\n`read(file_object, &buffer, length)`\n\nis same as\n\n`file_object.read(&buffer, lenght)`\n\nIn Python, you can call a method both way, although, highly recommended to use `obj.method()` variant.\n\nAnd again, as elctronics, programming is not *difficult*, but *simple and* *complex*. OOP is just as *difficult* like pull-up resistor: if you know struct, function, memory, OOP is easy-peasy, and if you know current, instable state, DCC and GND, pull-up resistor is straighfoward... but try these two simple things to explain someone who knows nothing about programming and electronics.",

That's actually great!\n\nI've come across an extremely nice real world application for OOP: a Raspberry Pi or Arduino Car.\n\nThe car had different types of motors - stepper motors for the wheels, servos for the steering, camera, ultrasound, etc. \n\nThe programming of the car was done in Python and they made classes for the different types of motors. The classes were written in such a way that the user/programmer facing part (we call it the API) was the same, so no matter whether the actual motor was a stepper or a servo, the programmer could always address it in the same way. This is a case where OOP shines. You don't need to worry what's \"behind the scene\" and only have a standardized API to work with. Also, you only need to add the individual *instances*, the actual motors, parameterize them (left and right motors naturally had different rotation directions) and you were good to go. Add another motor? No problem. Just create another instance of the respective type, tell the object where the I/O is connected, and you're good to go.\n\nEspecially in the connection with hardware (and that's why you already got Arduino suggested from another commenter), OOP is good use and fun. Takes a lot of the specific programming away and has the advantage that, no matter how many specific instances you need, you only test the class once and it works.",

Learning to code is a \\*\\*journey\\*\\*. But thankfully, there are loads of resources out there that can help you choose your path! So, it's okay if you're not totally committed to building a career, my advice would be to measure the amount of resource you devote until you know that.\n\nYou can teach yourself to code without access to any paid content or courses. It's a long road, it takes a lot of dedication and frustration, and drive to go find the answers yourself. But I'm not sure there's ever been a skill so thoroughly documented online as software development. Software developers largely love to share what they've built, and the very fine details of how it works. Youtube is full of tutorials. There are plenty of websites that will explain different programming languages or tools to you. Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. \n\nIf you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.\n\nIf you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.\n\nI won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally. I've found that everyone seems to click with different materials. But the wiki has lots of linked resources [r/learnprogramming FAQ: Getting Started with Coding](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq/)",

Literally ask someone to input a number, input another number, and select an operation to perform, then return the result. Maybe do a slight expansion on it, like remembering the last result.\n\nThen iteratively add a little bit of complexity.\n2) a to-do list console app, that allows the user to write a to-do and saves it to a file so that the to-do exists on the next run. Also let the user mark off a to-do. Again, maybe extend it slightly, like allowing the user to view marked off to-dos.\n\n3) now maybe you want a simple console app that gets data from an API, instead of a saved file. There's APIs for everything, pick a free one that interests you (many people choose a weather API, for me, it was a football one, maybe you want a recipe one) and output some information in the terminal. This is also particularly good because you have to read the APIs documentation\n\n4) now you get to branch off what complexity you want to add. Maybe you want to figure out how to automate tasks. You could try and save data from the API above into a file at regular intervals. Maybe you want to add a graphical user interface, so you look up how to display the API data, which could mean in a web browser, or in a mobile app, or a desktop app, whatever interests you. Maybe you want to get data from multiple APIs and store it in a way that you can easily check what data you want, so you create a database that gets populated by various APIs.\n\nStart with the commonly suggested ones, expand on them slightly, iteratively add a little bit of complexity you haven't tackled before for every project. What to build will kind of define itself by what you're enjoying/what complexity you can think of.",

You just start to get a feel for what good patterns are as well as what goes wrong when bad patterns are followed.\n\nBut as for more concrete tips I'd say you want to keep your API /API layer as agnostic as possible from the implementation details - your API layer should ideally be focused on defining the contract and routing the logic to internal code to fulfill the contract. \n\nYou don't want to expose internal details, raw primative implementations, or anything not relevant to the contract. This is both so external clients have a clean interface to work with as well as minimizing the blast radius of any changes to the workings of the API itself. Yeah you can implement a key value store with a dictionary but if you abstract it behind a data provider then your API layer doesn't care if you're using a dictionary or a database or a cache, and you can swap between them easily.\n\nIn addition anything that's exposed to the public internet should have protection against anything that could possibly go wrong, malicious or otherwise. This includes sanitizing inputs, protection against injection attacks, rate limiting, proper status code handling etc...",

There's no fast path.\n\nDunning-Kruger's seminal work principally has to do with how we internalize and comprehend information:\n\n    known   | unknown\n    known   | known\n    -----------------\n    known   | unknown\n    unknown | unknown\n\nIt's not their original chart but it has all the right quadrants... Mine makes a C.\n\nYou start in the bottom-right where you don't even know THAT you don't know something. There's shit rocket scientists contemplate I haven't the slightest fucking clue. I'm not a rocket scientist. I can't possibly know. Can't even fathom.\n\nThen there's shit you know you don't know. I don't know how to implement a Monte-Carlo simulation. I know I don't know that. I know Monte-Carlo is used to march approximations toward a correct result with sufficient precision. I've just never had to do it.\n\nThen there's what you know you know - this is active recall stuff. Rote memory. I know a closure is a poor mans object. I can repeat that all day. It's not very functional memory because I have to actively think about it with intent. I can write a closure, but it's not intuitive to me. I make mistakes. I can't see the forest for the trees.\n\nBut I have a shitload of unknown knowns - shit I know, but don't actively think about. We're beyond active recall. This isn't rote - this is intuition. You can FORGET you know something, and yet that knowledge passively informs you. When you see me work, I can go straight to code and produce something. Hundreds, THOUSANDS of decisions are being made not because I'm considering all this stuff in the moment, but because I've considered it all over the last 37 years. I'm not making a decision, I've already made it. I'm acting on connections and associations and relationships you haven't made yet, leaving you wondering how the hell I'm getting my work done - it's because the work was done 20 years ago at that one job.\n\nThis is what you're going to accumulate yourself. When you've fully internalized and integrated your knowledge, you can speak on it as an authority. You won't be quoting a book or resource, you'll be saying it yourself, and you'll hardly think about how you're even doing it.\n\nSo then how do you learn? It's not just time. You can sit on your ass for years and not learn a god damn thing - especially if you don't have compelling work or don't care. It's not JUST experience - but the quality of the experience. You don't learn from successes, but failures. And if you want some failures, you need to be trying to do shit.\n\n> I realized afterward that I hadn't considered concurrent access, didn't validate inputs, returned mixed types from methods, and used raw dictionaries instead of proper data structures. \n\nYou're already gaining self-awareness, seeing more than trees, but the forest for what it is. To accelerate your experiences - you need to have more of them; finish that project. Validate inputs - that's easy as shit. Use data structures, that makes it easier to validate your inputs. Add concurrency, this will apply pressure upon you to design a more consistent architecture.\n\nYou didn't do these things in your demo because you don't have the intuition to do them. If you had it, you'd have integrated all this into your solution as a matter of course.\n\nContinued...",

In school you don't really have a lot of time and you can't put in as much focus or effort into it as you would like. With work it's not like that; you have one thing to focus on, makes things a lot more manageable. At that point what really shines through is your persistence; persistence is the key thing in programming, at least in my eyes. I will say that it is hard to decide whether it's right for you or not. I guess the answer is, when you are doing it are you focused on it and are willing to sacrifice things for it? If yes, I think that's enough. Don't let school kill your confidence. If you are drawn to programming, that's a very good strength, you just need persistence, diligence, and curiosity to carry you further",

You should evaluate your life, what you can handle, and what you prefer. All advice will fall short and even you won't know whether staying/switching/dropping out was the best. If I had to make a similar decision now, I'd switch, but only because I lost much more time than I expected. \n\nThe mental distress is really what you should sort out  though. It doesn't necessarily go away if you quit your pursuit of programming, and may stay with you after you're done with education. Don't be afraid to consult a professional.

        "body": "Hello — great question, and yes! Data analytics is definitely a skill that’s in demand, and you don’t need a ton of theory or expensive courses to get started.\n\nHere’s a roadmap that works for a lot of people breaking into analytics:\n\nGoogle Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera — audit for free\nKhan Academy / YouTube playlists on Excel & basic stats\nSQLZoo for interactive SQL practice\n\nNext step is to focus on building something that hones your skill. Try analyzing something you care about (budgeting, fitness, etc.) Document your work — even simple visuals or insights go a long way. This will lead to something called “portfolio” like a folder of all your project work \n\nAnalytics folks use Excel / Google Sheet, SQL, Python with pandas, R, Tableau/PowerBI \n\nIf you want something practical and project-oriented that walks you through real exercises in data analytics, this book below is designed for beginners and emphasizes hands-on work over pure theory:\n\nAI-Powered Data Analysis for Beginners\nhttps://a.co/d/8v7IwjK\nThe book offers good ground in programming, math and stats, analytics mindsets and methodologies, using AI, with lots of examples. Many of the prompts that’s discussed are fully optimized to use lowest tokens. Full disclosure: I’m the author of the book I mentioned — sharing it because it’s designed for similar use cases\n\nNo pressure — you don’t need to buy it to start. But some folks like having a structured guide as they work through exercises and build confidence.",

Here is where Joe badly misinterprets his own thought process: “Of course!” Joe thinks. “It’s all so simple now. The key to understanding monads is that they are Like Burritos. If only I had thought of this before!” The problem, of course, is that if Joe HAD thought of this before, it wouldn’t have helped: the week of struggling through details was a necessary and integral part of forming Joe’s Burrito intuition, not a sad consequence of his failure to hit upon the idea sooner.\n\n\n\nLearning is also a good mix of strategies that are entirely general to the human species across any domain, and tactics that will work for you specifically in some specific situation. If you find some great way for you to learn concept A, it doesn't necessarily mean that it'll work for some other learner, or that it'll work as well for concept B.\n\nWhat you're asking about is general enough that we can only give very general learning advice, like [Oláfur Waage's _Learning Rust the wrong way_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL9LANLg5EA) (more about learning in general with Rust as a specific example of something to learn).",

Asking questions about the problem/information\n6. Repeating steps 3 through 5 forever\n\nThe only thing that really ever changes, aside from the specific concept, is the complexity/breadth of it, and by complexity, I really just mean the amount of information. When something is more complex, it takes longer to make sense of the individual parts and make it all make sense together, and it makes it harder to know which questions to ask to gain clarification or find information that you're missing, but it's still the same process. If you're able to memorize the information and regurgitate it on command, but don't feel like you really understand what it means, then you've most likely been skipping over steps 3 and 5, meaning you're just encountering new information and trying to commit it to memory without *using* it.\n\nIf you don't understand how something works, try to write something that uses it, and as you run into issues, start Googling away to find the information that you need. If you encounter more things you don't understand while Googling up info, follow up on that as well until you feel like you actually understand what's going on.

Sure, from one side, you'll be learning a bit less than you'd learn during your Bachelor studies as your Master studies will take less time. From the other side, you have already covered probably a lot when it comes to Databases related courses in Bachelor program. Still, a Master degree for non-CS people should teach you various topics that will be covered also in CS Bachelor program. So, you can cover that gap.\n\nI personally think that you won't get such quality from learning online. All these bootcamps and online tutorials are more like for beginners. I have checked some and they do not cover more complex topics one will learn during his university studies. They won't force you to work on your thesis project where you have to come up with something more unique than another \"X management system\" that you'd get from bootcamps. \n\nUniversity studies will also give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects in your Github. When going by online tutorials and online bootcamps your imagination will be limited. They will tell you to make a TODO app. You will make a TODO app. Nobody will use that TODO app.\n\nIf Master studies cost a lot for you then you can try some online learning and see how it works out for you. Your current career definitely will be a bonus point. But if you see that you are not landing a Junior developer or a Junior data engineer role (forget jumping into a Mid-level or into a Senior-level position) then consider going for a degree.",

AI will be/is important and will be/is generating this stuff super easy and quick, but it’s not quite that simple…..\n\nA few months ago I decided to dive into Identity in ASP.NET (basically built in .NET authentication) and .NET does so much of the heavy lifting. It abstracts all the details away, allowing you to just focus on plugging it in, creating your policies and then focusing on your business logic instead of infrastructure.\n\nHowever…. I sort of quickly realised, that if you don’t understand how it works internally, the abstractions don’t really help or make it any better. You still have to call the relevant methods in the relevant order, and understand what’s going on in order to get the most from it. The abstractions, just save you having to write your implementations… it’s not a substitute for understanding how it works.\n\nI see AI as the same. It’s an abstraction. We ask it to generate code, it does. That saves us time and speeds up development, but if we’re unable to understand the inner workings, we won’t be able to get the most out of it. \n\nThe best way to learn is to build. So build these solutions yourself, and understand how these work not because you’ll be building these yourself in the future but because it is imperative you understand the inner workings to get the most from AI generated code….",

If you don’t know what’s happening under the hood, you can’t really use them well — whether it’s [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Identity or AI-generated code.\n\nMy struggle is more about the next step after that understanding. Even if I go deep, build things properly, and really learn how they work internally — will there actually be an employer willing to take a chance on someone without formal work experience? In many cases, resumes are filtered out automatically before a human even sees them if you don’t have 3–5 years of relevant experience.\n\nPart of me knows that building something unique, finishing a real project, and showing it publicly might be a way to bypass the traditional job search. That also takes time, just in a different way. And realistically, 6 months isn’t a long time at all — maybe even 1–2 years isn’t.\n\nSo for now, I’m trying to treat programming as a serious hobby and long-term investment, and see where it leads. No matter how the industry changes, I still believe that understanding programming fundamentals will become almost mandatory, and once you have that, switching languages or technologies is much easier.\n\nI’ve also been living outside my home country for 6 years, and while things are generally fine, being a foreigner adds extra friction to everything — internships, official employment, even simple life stuff.

Would you like a framework to be as helpful as possible at the cost of control or would you like to maintain control and do it yourself is something that different communities, languages and frameworks answer differently. In my travels I have found Microsoft with c# wants to do everything and go wants to give you the most control. There are lots of in-betweens. This is a great thing to think about and weigh the cost and benefits. (Then have your employer decide your language and do it the way you don't like 😆)",

If you just do the daily leetcode you could hit something that you're just simply not equipped to solve yet. As someone else suggested, maybe spend 30 mins a day on a problem until you solve it or run out of time; then learn what the solution is and note down the problem.\n\nWhen I study for interviews I like to keep track of all the problems I get stuck on and need to look at the solution. Then a few weeks later I come back to the same problem and retry it. If I still can't solve it then I review the solution and it stays on the list until i can solve it on my own.",

When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 1 element, you should be able to see that the `if` statement is true and then Pat\\_Divide immediately returns with only that one element.\n\nWhen your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 3 elements, more imaginary people get involved:\n\n* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.\n* Bob\\_Divide gets one element, immediately sees that the `if` statement is true, and immediately hands back that one element.\n\n* Alice\\_Divide, on the other hand, gets handed a list of 2 elements, and so is unfairly forced to do more work.\n   * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists (of 1 element each) and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide.\n   * Mildred and Leroy act just like Pad\\_Divide did when Pat\\_Divide was given a list of 1 element, and each immediately hand back that 1 element.\n   * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) produces a sorted list of 2 elements.\n   * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.\n\n* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)\n* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.\n\nWhen your main() function calls Pat\\_Divide with a very long array, even more imaginary people get involved, but we don't really need to know all their names:\n\n* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.\n* Bob\\_Divide returns a sorted list of all the items in the left list (by involving other yet-unnamed family members).\n\n* Alice\\_Divide does something similar to what she did before:\n   * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide.\n   * Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide divide their individual lists into even smaller pieces, and hand them off to other family members, who eventually help them produce sorted versions of those lists.\n   * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) combines the 2 sorted lists into a single sorted list.\n   * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.\n\n* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)\n* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.\n\n(Optionally, you may later learn multitaking techniques, so that Mildred, Bob's side of the family, and Leroy can each work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. ).\n\nGood luck trying to explain recursion to the next person!",

Take a selection of playing cards, and put on the table in front of you, make sure they aren't sorted, but still layed out in a nice uniform \"array\".\n2. Then split the array in two halves - moving them a bit towards you (down the table)\n3. Split the two halves in another two halves each, so you have four groups of playing cards, and move them a bit further down.\n4. Continue until you have a number of individual cards layed out with space between them - it still looks exactly like the original array, and feels a bit silly at this point.\n5. But now, merge the two cards to the left, in order from lowest to highest, and move them a bit up the table - do the same for all the rest, so you have a collection of groups of two cards, each group sorted.\n6. Then merge the groups two and two, moving them a bit up the table, so you end up with a collection of groups of four cards, all sorted.\n7. And continue doing that, until you have only a single list of cards, all sorted ...\n\nIt is important that you actually do it, and not just try to imagine it in your mind!\n\nEvery time you move down the table, it is another call to the \"divide\" function, and every time you move up, it is a return from the latest \"divide\" function. Note how you can't return from a divide function, before you returned from the next divide-function that was called! This is what recursion is all about, and it is mindboggling to think about - but it works :)",

You just put the addIcing() etc method signatures in that class, as you only really use them to guarantee that particular methods will be available in your cake class.\n\n\nLots of languages use the principles of OOP so it's very much worth learning!\n\nOnce you've mastered OOP and are getting to grips with Java, then you can start looking at using patterns in the code such as MVC and Singleton.\n\nGood luck!

It's one of those (mostly) low-pressure desk jobs that you do to make a stable income while you do what you really want to do in your free time. That said, it will contribute close to nothing when it comes to helping a career in game dev. The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).\n\nIt is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently. As long as I get my tasks done each day, I can pretty safely bring my laptop to the office to study/work on my own projects most of the time.\n\nI will say though, \"building a multiplayer online game\" is a very, very ambitious goal shared by many aspiring game devs who don't know what it actually takes to do something like that. To the point that it's a known red flag/meme if a dev tries to crowdfund an MMO. If you intend to make games by yourself, your scope needs to be reduced \\*drastically,\\* and you'll not only learn more but be more satisfied with the process if you focus on making small, simple games. If you want to make something bigger, then find friends/collaborators to work with-- particularly people who are willing to work on something for the fun of it instead of trying to turn it into a business. It's very, very difficult to \"start a game studio,\" so you want to start by making games for fun and learning to enjoy the process of making them before you \\*ever\\* think about monetizing. Basically don't think about monetizing/turning it into a business until you \\*have business.\\* And if you want to get into programming for an existing studio, be prepared to spend years and years doing contract work to build a reputation, and to navigate a highly competitive field where you could be let go at a drop of a hat.\n\nMake small games. Fail faster. Fall in love with actually making the games, not the idea of making games. And know that game dev, especially solo, is a very multidisciplinary endeavor where each discipline within it can take years and years to master. Pace yourself.\n\nSource: IT person of 6 years who gave up game dev because I found out I don't actually enjoy the process of programming after even more years of trying and going to school for it. What I discovered was that I actually wanted to tell stories, and I didn't need to force myself to be a programmer/artist/designer/writer/composer unicorn to do that. I could just write stories instead.",

You need basic ones, and more specialised ones for programming certain things (e.g. writing a networking protocol will require you understand networking), but they diverge very early on into generalist vs specialist. IT generally isn't really a path to (games) programming work per se, it's more a path to help desk, ops, sysadmin, database admin, infra, devOps, etc. If you want to work as a programmer, providing you can already operate a computer to do basic file admin, web browsing, text editing, etc., you should just start programming right away and focus on that. If you need to earn money right away and IT jobs are all you can get right now then it's better than starving... We very much need IT people to keep the software we write up and running.\n\nFor games and multiplayer online games specifically you'll need to have good overall programming skills and pattern awareness to implement the gameplay logic. Plus OS awareness, networking, database design/implementation for the online part. Plus a good understanding of 2D or 3D graphics as applicable for the rendering part. Then there's all the art...\n\nIf you use a modern game engine you can mostly get away with just doing the art and use their abstractions for most of the other stuff. Still very much need to know most of the above though, just not as much as if you were to implement it.\n\n\"multiplayer online game\" is very ambitious, so a very rough idea of what your expectations starting from zero should be: A small/toy 2D game you could build within the next few months.

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.\n\nMost games don't check collisions this way.  Instead, like \"You can't move through walls\" or \"If an enemy touches you, you die\" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes.  Boxes and circles are the most popular (often the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate axes which makes the math super simple).  A \"capsule\" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles).  Triangles involve more math to program, but may be helpful if you want arbitrary rotation or more complicated shapes (any shape is approximately a polygon; any polygon can be broken into triangles).\n\nOften the hitbox really is, quite literally, a box!",

        "body": "First off coding is work, it doesn't produce adrenaline but rather headaches, drowsiness and fatigue. \n\nLets not 3 Mile Island the world here, C or Python, should not cause somebody to feel slow and dumb.    So the first thing that comes to mind right now is to choose one, which if you are learning is C.\n\nNot to date myself but I first got interested in computers before the S100 bus debuted, so maybe 13 or 14 at the time.   For years all I could do is read Byte and when I could find it Dr.Dobbs.   It wasn't until the Vic-20 came out, 1980, that I could actually afford a computer and that ViC 20 was barely usable.   So for a good number of years my interests where satisfied by reading what I could.\n\nIt actually took me a while to get to college and that was where my first formal training started and unlearning the VIC 20.   At the time the school had Sun workstations so that was like a step into the future.   So what motivated me, well the place I was working for was paying the bill.    Since I didn't want to go hungry anymore it was a good idea to keep working.   \n\nNow that said not a programmer per say but use the knowledge almost everyday before working.   So staying sharp with software was important.   However that required me to keep writing code, sometimes toy programs and in a couple of cases finding bugs for an Open Source project.   At work I had some focus on CNC and PLC controllers which is always a challenge, beyond spread sheets and Python code.    So even if work was NOT as a programmer, I was heavily involved in automation.\n\nNow that I'm retired the motivations are different.   For example to keep track of my investments, I have spread sheets of stock portfolios.   Now on the surface one might laugh at spreadsheet programming because it looks to be simple but I'd have to say there is as much depth there as their is with Python.   The motivation is that I need to keep this organized and understand where my next meal is coming from.\n\nIf you want to stay sharp though, who doesn't and frankly at this age you work at it, yo need to do more than stock portfolio management.   To that end I keep a couple of hobbies going and use those interest to drive software development there.   This is the key, use it or loose it.   If you want to have any usable skill at all with respect to software you need to stay in the game.  Motivation is sometimes hard to come by or even keep, so you really need to integrate programming into projects that you are interested in.   Programming itself can also be a motivator, simply learning about new languages can motivate some.   I didn't even know that C3 existed until yesterday for example and it actually looks interesting.   For most of us though we need that outside pull to start a new project.\n\nLets say you are into bicycling and those little trip computers look to be so handy.    That lust could be the motivator for a DIY trip computer for a bicycle.   Going DIY means it can work exactly as you expect, in every way it is yours.   The challenges are the motivator.   What are those challenges (just a few):\n\n1. Embedded project.\n2. Battery operated (maybe solar) and thus needs to be efficient\n3. Small custom Printed Circuit board.\n4. Limited screen size and I'o possibilities.\n5. Case size limitations.\n6. Limited program and data space.\n7. Limited programming languages due to microprocessor.\n\nIn any event the project becomes the challenge.",

So if you want to use the term \"functionally retarded\", you've come to the right person. Don't worry, I'm not offended.\n\nYou do not need to know a lot of mathematics in order to succeed in the field. C is not significantly more math-intensive than any other language. Things like pointers are tricky for beginners, but those are tricky for beginners regardless of whether they're good at math or not.\n\nModulus is something that will come up in any programming language. It's usually used to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number. It's pretty easy, conceptually. Divide two numbers. Discard everything before the decimal point. That's modulo. Like, 9 % 3: That's 9/3, or 3.0. Discard the 3. You're left with 0.0. It's evenly divisible.\n\nNow do the same thing, 9 % 4. I'm pulling out my calculator for this part. That's 2.25. Discard the leading 2. You're left with 25. Not evenly divisible. In most cases, that's as far as you'll need to go with it. \n\nSome sub-disciplines within software are very math-heavy, such as graphics/games programming and AI/machine learning. But that's mostly at the very deepest, darkest fringes, and not something you will likely encounter outside of specialized roles that will highlight the need for deeper math skills.

I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).\n\nLearning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.\n\nI found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!\n\nTLDR; Don't worry. You probably aren't bad at math, missing prerequisite knowledge and/or study methods that don't work for you might be falsely giving you that impression.",

Most of the time it's trivial or non existent.\n\n>  Such as using modulo\n\nThis one probably shows up in programming courses more than math courses.  It shouldn't throw you too much.  Write a program to check what's going on?\n\n> I'am functionally retarded when it comes to mathematics.\n\nNope.  Stop that.  Math builds upward upon foundational concepts.  If you miss one of those concepts or don't fully understand it, you're screwed.  The concepts taken slowly aren't that bad.  Don't be afraid of taking a step back and reviewing what you thought already knew.\n\nMath is a lot like programming in this respect.  There's parroting a concept and then there's applying a concept.  Understanding programming ideas and actually writing a program are two very different things.\n\n> Is C a language I should keep trying to learn\n\nSure.  It's fun.  That said, it's one of the more primitive options.  If you feel another language has something more to offer you, that's your call.  However, you're learning both programming and a programming language.  The language is not the hard part.  Once you wrap your head around programming, the language is just an implementation detail.\n\n> or would it be wise to simply use another language that isnt as math intensive?\n\nThere isn't one.  The math you run into in C is to be found in any other language.  Some languages will let you get away with being more sloppy, but I'm not sure if that's better or worse for you.\n\n> I don't have very little foundation with mathematics beyond basic +,-,*,/ problems.\n\nAgain, you generally don't need it.  Also, unlike on a math quiz, you have a computer to check your work.  You might think the formula you wrote will offer a certain result, but the computer will let you know if you're right.\n\n> I'm struggling pretty hard to get through the math related portions.\n\nI'm the programmer who sucks at math, which is why I tend to respond verbosely to things like this.  Programming really doesn't require math.  A mathematician will say it's all math, but that's their problem.  Programming requires a way of thinking and, amusingly, some folks who are very good at math kind of suck at it.  I hate seeing folks with math frustration allow that to gatekeep their possible programming glory.\n\nI got a minor in computer science, where the only higher math course required was calculus 1.  I took it twice, passed the second time.  I also tutored people in programming.  One student, a science major, had her 4.0 in jeopardy because of a basic programming class she thought would be easy.  Another student I helped out was my former calc professor, trying to learn programming.\n\nBeing science or math oriented doesn't equate to programming success.  Some of the worst code I've ever seen comes from engineers; folks who know and use far more math than most mortals.\n\nI mayn't be great at math, but I can program and have done it professionally for decades.  And, so can you.  Good luck.",

Any modern phone (with NFC support) can read tag with a URL data field and prompt you to open it, so uploading videos to youtube and writing the URL to a tag is a pretty easy way to demo that with no coding required.

Working on something your interested in can really help with that. So work on projects your interested in and use those to drive your exploration. For instance at one point I found out that JWST raw observations are available online. I feel like it would be such a cool project to try to convert the raw sensor data into a viewable image. I am not sure how difficult this would be or how interested you are in JWST but that could be a fun project. I am sure you can find some science data your interested in to do projects with.

It’s not uncommon to have a pure backend as a purely internal piece with very clean, use-case agnostic API routes (the backend backend that you already have) but have another “backend of the frontend” (e.g., SvelteKit, Next, TanStack Start, etc…) that server-side renders UI routes using the true backend, exposes specialized API routes that compose elements of the true backend. It’s overkill for many personal projects, but is the standard for enterprise software in my experience. I also just think it’s nice to have a server for the UI for a million reasons, even just to have things like environment variables without rebuilding. Even if you don’t want to hide away your true backend, server-side rendering and other server features that are UI-specific are still useful.",

Look up Bob Tabor and go through his javascript course.  It is as easy as it gets, but you won't be a developer when you're done.  What it will do is instill concepts and maybe give you some confidence, because when you are done, you'll realize, Bob Tabor makes it look easy.  But he's slow and methodical.\n2. Start on a free and easy platform like w3schools.  They are constantly adding content and I have full access (got it on sale), so I can pretty much do anything, learn new skills as they are added, get certifications.\n3. Lookup roadmaps and game plan all this\n4. Eventually I think you need to consider paying to learn, on a platform or in college.\n5. You might look into Team Treehouse\n\nI have used Team Treehouse's platform and they have what's called tech degrees.  Some companies have heard of them and people have gotten jobs after completing their curriculum.  But it's no guarantee.  Thing is, without something reputable on your resume, you won't get a job, so if you're learning for fun, great, if you're looking for a career, well, just go on indeed or elsehwhere and see how many jobs there are for inexperienced engineers and look at the requirements.  Nearly all require a degree, and nearly all are using ATSs to scan resumes, so no degree means, resume is dragged to trash bin.  Self-taught is alright, but you won't save yourself time, and you should think about paid school, just because that's the smart route.  Employers trust Professors, not youtube instructors.  I mean, it's okay to be home-schooled, but I'll tell ya, you may still be studying in 6 years on your own.\n\nSo that's my recommendation for you.  Have some goals.  Lookup roadmaps.  Game plan.\n\nHonestly, you should consider a different career, like delivering pizzas.   Something that's less resourceful than building code.  Dreams die when reality hits.  None of this is easy.  If you use Tabor and w3schools, maybe they instill the confidence for you to move onto harder learning, because that's beginning stuff, and you need to get into intermediate and advanced concepts and learn far more than HTML/CSS/JS to get a job (or to show anyone you're serious).   My guess is, you'll give up like everyone else.   But if you are driven and surprise us all, please check in with progress reports.   Use all the doubters as your motivation.\n\nRemember, failure is not only an option, it's expected.",

They are also not designed with long-term maintainability in mind. Python does not support async, making it a poor choice for UI. They also scale terribly; every line of code will inevitably slow down the application\n\nUsing JS is a no-go if you intend to support mobile. WebView-based solutions like Tauri or Electron drains battery like a mf\n\n.NET is pretty much designed for exactly the kind of thing that you want to make; supported on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and various others.\nI'd also recommend looking into [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/), as MAUI does not support Linux desktop (currently)\n\nOther reasonable alternatives would be Java, D, Rust or C++\n\n> Any pitfalls I should be aware of?\n\nNever use floating point to represent money  \nDon't depend on libraries or frameworks where there's a big chance you might end up paying huge licensing fees some time in the future with no escape\n\n> Would you choose differently for a solo developer?\n\nNo. The \"productivity\" of a developer is subjective and entirely reliant on how familiar the developer is in the language, rather than a language having some supposed inherent productivity benefit. Especially not when the alleged productivity is from dynamic typing which is just outright nonsense\n\nI'm of the conviction that programming language matters a whole lot more than many people are willing to admit. Just picking something solely for the reason that it's familiar is poor reasoning for anything other than personal hobby projects that will never end up on someone elses computer. It's not subjective; languages makes different trade-offs, and specifically JS and Python trade off basically everything just to have a simple syntax which is not something that you want in a financial application or any long-term project where you expect a lot of changes and new feature requirements\n\nI was involved in a buyout of a company where the code base was Python. They went bankrupt because their solution ended up costing way more money than they could possibly hope to make. Even just for the infrastructure. Each transaction has a set price, and if the cost per transaction is higher than what customers are willing to pay, then that's game over. A lot of companies go bankrupt this way, it's just not talked about because it's depressing",

One company we worked with had a NSFW mode on their site, so I usually worked with that toggled on whenever it was possible. Otherwise, browser extensions can also be useful to blur/black out images as-needed, and on staging sites where we did a lot of our dev work we wouldn't test with actual NSFW content, and instead use whatever bland imagery/videos we had on-hand. This actually works out better in most cases; If you're troubleshooting compression issues on UGC, it can be handy to test with specific images/videos so you can see differences in compression in a more controlled format.\n\nNow, when troubleshooting production problems? Yeah, sometimes you can't avoid seeing some.. Stuff, and even if whatever it is \\_is\\_ your kink, you're there to work, not jack off (especially if it's a production issue that's costing the business money).\n\nGiven I primarily do front-end work, the hardest part for me can be focusing on the issues no matter what is being displayed front-end center..

When you lose one of those things, like your job, it really helps if you don't spiral and remember you still have leverage, and keeping learning.\n\nThe failure mode for some many people in this field is basically: job loss -> identity collapse -> loss of continued learning -> inability to frame leverage for new jobs -> out of field. They have everything they need to keep moving forward, but the ideal of accepting the chaos and moving incrementally through without the shield of formal employment is too much.   \n  \nYou have the skills, you have the experience, you just adopt a resilient mentality. It's okay to take a break, and of course none of this is far, but also, no one is coming to rescue you.",

If you report this to his next level or HR, he will get fired. So this can mean one of the following:\n\n  \n1.  If you are a good performer, and expecting a salary raise, your manager want to give you that raise, but he feels unable to negotiate with upper management, so he is nudging you to get an offer and then use that as a leverage for your own sake. \n\n2. Your manager has insights into upcoming downsizing and he is okay if you go. He is pretending to \"match\" your offer but giving you a chance to secure a good position. \n\n3. Your manager for some dark reason is working against the interest of the company. He is either disgruntled. \n\n4. Perhaps he is really concerned for his future, and sees that you have become relaxed at work place and not growing your skills, so this is his clever way of making you realise that you are still not good enough as an all rounded engineer. \n\n5. Perhaps he is really concerned about your future, and general nature of the industry and the need to be in the habit of interviewing. \n\n6. Your manager is just plain stupid and doesn't know how to do his job properly. \n\n  \nI think it is a combination of 1 and 6.

I thought a lot about it and realized i didnt want to do the upskilling work necessary to be appealing in the tech job market— this led me to realize that the industry work in general may not be for me. \n\nSo as a CS major— be very introspective about whether you are willing to do the work you’ll need to do to get internships and jobs rn. Even if the job market gets better, it will still be just as competitive in my opinion— from here on out just the degree won’t be nearly enough. Ask yourself if you’re afraid of doing the extra work because you’re doubting yourself *or* if it genuinely just doesn’t interest you. It was the latter for me, so I switched. \n\nLastly, look at any data your current college puts out about career outcomes, and look on Linkedin to see how people who graduated in CS from your college recently are performing. Talk to any upperclassmen you know about their struggles or successes in finding internships, because if you dont get an internship during college, the only thing thatll help you in the postgrad job search will be luck and an immense grind on applications and a project portfolio. Ask yourself if you enjoy CS enough to do that. A lot of people are! I was not.",

Not UML diagrams or factory patterns. I work at Prepfully and from what our ML coaches tell me, companies like Meta and Google focus heavily on ML system design (think designing a recommendation system end-to-end) rather than traditional software patterns.\n\nLeetcode is still important though, especially for the coding rounds.\n\nYour time is better spent on ML-specific design (feature stores, training pipelines, A/B testing frameworks) and leetcode.

It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). \n\nThink about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. \n\nHowever, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.\n\nYou can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on. But the bubble will only pop when investors lose faith in a major way, and there’s not really any telling when that will happen. There are some signs it might be soon, but it won’t happen until it does.",

The issue is that GenAI isn’t useless, but it’s **hard** to use correctly, and while it can boost productivity to a certain degree, it isn’t going to have the headcount reduction ROI that the bean counters want it to. Spend some time learning how to use the tech effectively, while maintaining your standards. If your company gives you the flexibility, look into spec driven workflows like speckit or BMAD. They might feel heavyweight at first, but they are 100% necessary to avoid slop at the moment. And they don’t guarantee good results - the merely increase the likelihood of a good result.",

Burnout is a fickle beast. It might help just getting a new day-to-day, or it might make it worse due to pressure to perform in a new role. It ca go both ways.\n\nIn my case, it helped, but there are no guarantees.\n\n> Did you feel more exposed during layoffs? \n\nI didn't, no.\n\n> How did you make your value visible when outcomes were less tangible?\n\nWhen I'm in a more architectur'y or tech lead'y roles it is more about mentoring and communication, so the more you're seen around the teams, helping out, answering questions and just being someone that enables those around you, then that is mostly enough.\n\nMaking other teams succeed is also a success for you. Just make sure that you're actually a part of that success and not leeching of it (looking at you middle management).\n\nIn higher positions you also get to start initiatives you believe brings value, and that value can be measured in some way. But again, don't be the guy that just starts stuff just to boost their resume. Do something that the others will actually like (or at least have good support from the ones that will be affected).",

The biggest factor, to me, was not in the role itself but the people that surrounded me. \n\nI made one switch after being burn out due to boredom and ended up in basically the corporate trash pile of non-performers that had managers who found it easier to move them to this new effort than to terminate them. I had an impossible situation of kicking something off with a bunch of people who had poor skills, poor follow through, and poor attitudes. I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. \n\nI went from boring to extremely not boring. But one type of burn out to another. Having a mountain of work to get done that grows much faster than you burn it down, constantly pivoting to emergent tasks that had to be resolved immediately and had me up until 3am writing documents and building slides, dealing with nasty people on the regular… it really wears you out. I’d much rather have the burn out from boredom over that.",

Basically, narrow in on one of the many hats you wear and create a new floater role for yourself. This alleviates you from your current daily grind and gives you a fresh new grind and a new bought of imposter syndrome. \n\nFor example, you could be the retail industry expert floater who is brought in to talk about macro industry outcomes and not just technology design. This would mean more high level executive vision discussions and more delegation of execution & architecture details — more soothing for your fried brain, but comes with a learning curve. You know, trade offs. This might set you up for a leadership role in a real industry instead of tech where you can actually own something. \n\nOr you could coast in post sales / enablement.

On days where I didn't fell like writing yet another cover letter I'd convince myself to just find 3 job ads I liked and leave the tabs open, which would turn into starting the cover letter, and eventually into applying to all 3. Also, start using an AI assistant to help, like copy+pasting the role text into it and getting a score for your profile. Networking helps a lot, I suck at it so I can't help, but you should try to expand your Linkedin friends list. Speaking of Linkedin, forget Easy Apply, I haven't heard of a single person who got hired through it. A really good advice I found was, find Linkedin Easy Apply jobs and then apply through the company website. Good luck",

Not exactly a CS MS, but a technical degree with some rigor nonetheless (like a CS MS).\n\nGenerally speaking, degrees like EE, CS, CE, ME, etc. are all fungible. Nobody really cares which specific degree you received as long as you can pass the interview. As you get further in your career the fact that you have a degree becomes completely irrelevant, unless you need to check the box to meet requirements for a job. A CS degree might be a more natural fit for today's LC style interviews, but an EE major that takes a few electives can easily be on-par and any major that grinds LC problems will have a massive advantage.\n\nI've interviewed a large number of folks over the years. I can think of 3 personal projects out of well over 100 that were actually interesting to me. Most are obvious resume fluff and might as well just not exist.

Hiring teams care most about experience, impact, and skills they can see. OMSCS can help if you want deeper fundamentals, certain niches, or a resume boost for some companies, but it won’t replace strong, relevant projects. Best option if you can manage it: do the degree slowly and still build 1-2 solid projects that align with the jobs you want. That combo gives the best return.",

If you've ever experienced this you'll clearly see they know exactly how to make it happen and point the finger at the department they want to offshore..if you're still around doing support when they bring the new people in you'll see a DRASTIC difference in the quality of the specs and work before it gets to the dev/engineer. They basically make the engineer do everything and when they try to point out that requirements or whatever is someone else's responsibility they'll spin it around. Unless you have an awesome boss who also knows politics you're fucked",

Picking up “slower” hobbies. For me specifically, the gateway drug into slower hobbies was painting. Having a hobby/skill that takes a long time to develop and see results from is what you need to get out of the lowest effort dopamine cycle of social media. You need to do something that delays your dopamine payoff for much longer than minutes to start training your brain to not expect it all the time.\n3. Diet and Exercise - this fits in the same category as #2 in that it’s a slower payoff activity, but I think it deserves its own mention because being able to physically see your progress is huge motivation and doing it just puts you mentally in a better space.",

The way most companies set salaries is using market reference points - the market is roughly geographic and industry tied, though companies can kinda pick and choose who they think is competing for the same workers (software engineer at a FAANG and programmer in the IT department of a paper company are probably not in the same survey).\n\nSo, junior dev in some industry group and city has a median of $X. A new grad offer might be 80% * $X and the company might say that the salary band for junior is 80%-120% of the market reference. Each year they get a new market reference and also adjust target points - performance based. So if the market reference is at $110k and you're at $91k, they might bump you up 2-5% on the target. If the market reference goes up, you might get a juicier raise. If it goes down, you get less of a raise. You'll have a target point and an effective point - they won't cut pay if you're target is lower than your effective, but your raises will be smaller.\n\nIf you start getting above 100%, the raises are often lower. At that point they're thinking \"get promoted to get more money\" - part of the reason for the wider bands is to be able to make offers to people being hired away from other jobs.\n\nIf your friend got 5 years of really good raises, I'd bet on a rapidly climbing reference point (2010-2022 were pretty good years) along with being below the midpoint target, then some pullbacks in reference point and being above target.\n\nManagers don't typically know what the reference points will be and also don't really know how you'll perform relative to expectations.",

As a simple example, let's take variable assignments:\n\n    x = 1\n    y = 3\n    y = x\n    print x\n    print y\n\nWhat would the output of this block of pseudo code be?  Among students new to computer programming, a variety of answers are common:\n\nSome, intuit overwrite semantics and answer:  \n1  \n1\n\nSome, intuit swap semantics and answer:  \n3  \n1\n\nSome, intuit move semantics and answer:  \n0  \n1\n\nA good teacher will have a series of test questions designed to ferret out these mismatched mental models, and correct them.  Once students have good mental models of how languages behave they can finally start learning.\n\nSo I doubt that you are cooked.  You probably just need a bit of guidance.  If you're struggling with a particular concept, go talk to your teacher.  Write out the different possible code snippets you're considering to achieve a particular task, and have him explain why they do or don't work.\n\nHave you tried sitting down, and just writing some simple code to see if you understand things.  I would suggest using a language that offers a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) so that you can try things out interactively without getting bogged down.  A google collab notebook, or a Jupyter notebook can be great for this.\n\nI got started writing software when I was in 4th grade on my Commodore 64.  Started out just faffing around with loops to repeatedly print things like \"I am the greatest!\" on the screen.  I played around with sorting algorithms.  I created a program to display the Mandelbrot set (it took about 12 hours to calculate on the C64 when written in BASIC). I even learned to use raster-interrupts and bank-switching to create a double-resolution interlaced display (albeit at an eye-watering 30Hz).",

What’s annoying is I told them in the phone screening “job looks like a good fit but I have no experience with this particular framework” lol",

I’m guessing it’s not thattttt much different for 8 years if you worked somewhere like Amazon so clearly you have good skills even if dated \n\nSoftware engineering looks way diff than it did 8 years ago though.

If you're the oncall engineer, you may need to wake up and fix things if shit hits the fan, but it's supposed to be a rare occurrence. If it happens every few days, the system you're supporting sucks and needs some serious re-engineering with a focus on reliability.\n\nNormally, any system with 24 hours uptime will require some level of oncall support, but they're not that bad.

I had multiple instances of middle of the night calls being put on the spot in front of higher ups for unfamiliar systems. Worst case was a week after joining a new team, hadn't even gone through onboarding yet lol. \n\nThe FAANG was much better. Engineering had a lot of power in determining what's actually important. So I got a lot of tickets, but they didn't have to be settled as soon as I got them. I had 2 instances of staying up overnight, and both times multiple engineers across my organization worked on the issue since it touched all of our systems.\n\nIn both instances, I was expected to be near a computer or phone. Telecom you had a 15 minute window to answer a page before it's escalated to backup then manager. FAANG had a window as welp and provided me with a separate phone which helped keep me on top of oncall.",

Make a list of your teammates, and rank them from 1-3 on trust, higher is better. 3 means you both banter about your personal life and support each other when management does dramatic things. **Note: If you have none of these people, stop here and start building those relationships.**\n\n2. Grab some time to shoot the shit with your high trust buddies one on one. Tactfully ask how the company promotes, evolves people, and grows. Get specific, examples, resumes, etc.\n\n3. Use this information to make a case for why you should be paid more. **Note: Typically management cares about outcomes (customer satisfaction, revenue, cost, logos), not inputs (time, energy) or outputs (code, features, etc). If you don't have outcomes, you almost certainly don't \"deserve\" a raise.**\n\n4. Apply to other companies in the area and start working with recruiters. This is your reality check. **Note: If you aren't getting in the door, you now know you _can't_ earn more elsewhere. If you aren't getting past the interviews you now know where your weaknesses are.**\n\n5. Get decently far into the interviews (interviews are between 3 and 5 rounds long, once you're getting to finals (and not necessarily passing them) you should feel pretty high conviction you can land a new job.\n\n6. Tell your manager, in writing, at least 24 hours before your next 1:1, that you'd like some feedback on how to improve here. Mention your most impactful project and your least impactful project. This will signal to your manager that you're highly coachable (asking for feedback).\n\n7. At this 1:1, listen, ask non-defensive clarifying questions (e.g. \"Oh, so that wasn't as impactful as I thought. I'd like to do better next time around, how would you prefer I approach that situation when it comes up again?\").\n\n8. After the 1:1 take notes, reflect, and integrate all the knowledge you now have (peer's input on how promotions are handled, your performance in interviews, your manager's perception of you, your manager's ability to guide/help you grow)\n\n9. 24 hours before the next 1:1, tell your manager, in writing, that you'd like to discuss what growth at the company would look like in their eyes. **Note: This is the start of the negotiation. If there is a formal performance review process your manager will almost certainly shunt you to it. In that case this meeting is about learning the rules of that game and how to play it well. If there isn't a formal review process and your manager is good they will lay out a path, if they're bad, they'll wander around the subject.**\n\n10. Take notes, reflect, integrate. Your goal here is to answer this question: Do I leave, play the promo game, or wield power (threaten to leave) to get more money?\n\nAt this point you should know what you want and need to do.\n\nGood luck kiddo!",

This movement of telling people to always negotiate is bs. Negotiation comes with leverage, if you have no leverage you have no room to negotiate. If you're worth more, a better company will hire you and pay you more. If you didn't get a raise from your performance review, don't expect one by asking.",

A high growth startup is the type of environment I would expect to progress quicker assuming I’m contributing at a high level.

        "body": "Yea, I enjoyed c++ game development for a while. Completely self taught myself graphics programming through The Cherno, LearnOpenGL, and Game Engine Architecture Volume 3, since my college classes did not really cover it in particular. Made the switch because I desperately needed something more fulfilling job wise than game dev, which was drying up way back in 2018 just about. Way before Ai and outsourcing has caught on. I enjoyed C++ so I did that. Then fast forward a bit more I dabbled in web dev a bit (did use Ai to initially learn, and figured it out in about a month), did that a bit longer but really did not like it. So, basically just learned I love working in C++. From there just continued building little c++ projects and am now actively working on my engine which is in a presentable state, but nowhere near complete (if it ever will be). Recently been diving into embedded for job opportunities, since even graphics development is a big challenge in my area. Been screwing around on my Nucleo board, and building circuits and what not. The job doesn't require embedded, but is definitely embedded oriented. So, I have a bunch of little nick nack projects in c++, my engine, and this sample embedded project just to show I am interested in embedded. At the end of the day, I have quite a bit to talk about in an interview. I bet they would maybe be surprised for someone to explain how they developed a fairly large project, made design decisions, and just know the full ins and outs of the project they built, especially from new grads. At least, that's just under the presumption that a lot of candidates may be going full fledge into Ai and not understand a lick of what they are doing. Regardless I feel as though I do fit the role, it is super duper entry level after all (they listed wanting someone with some form of knowledge in at least one out of every language under the sun basically), but was just concerned how fast they expect you to adapt to something more complex than you have ever worked on before. My engine is three projects, with about 100 files, but that's a drop compared to a companies code base with thousands just on one project.\n\nEdit: All of that just to say I am currently waiting to hear from them, though they are located near me in bumb-fuck nowhere. So, there may be a couple qualified candidates, but not many. On top of that, they have five roles open for the position, so just increases the odds.",

If you can then confusion generally into just solving technical problems, that’s a lot of our profession.

I will say it makes sense in class but the number one thing for me is if a problem waits till a meeting you waited too long. I’ve seen that a lot too. Status every day people bring up problems they had all day the day prior. One of the juniors on my project is like that so I check in on her most days to see how things are going and chitchat. \n\nI think some of it for folks is a sense of anxiety over performance, but there’s a saying that bad news doesn’t get better with time. Don’t understand something you’ve been looking at for an hour? You might annoy someone mildly but that’s just bc they are focused. Come in a meeting and say you struggled for 8 hours the day before to understand something that takes 5 minutes to figure out? That kinda thing happening often will completely ruin people’s opinion of you on a team. They’ll see you as unreliable and unprofessional. \n\nYou won’t have problems with this I’m sure, I’m just tryina tell you what I think you have to be conscious about. \n\nAlways remember that your whole team is shipping together.

Prioritize completing work that is measurable if you can. saves money, record all of that. Learn lots. Find opportunities to lead if you can.\n\nYou'll need to try and break out of comfort zone. Use that sales experience. \"Fake\" it. Not literally. But just be outspoken, be agreeable, put yourself out there. \n\nOnce you've built up some good job experience, metrics, more confident. Try and find that F500 chill remote job, where you can be left alone and just coast. \n\nIf the job sucks, has little growth or opportunity, toxic culture. Then do enough to stay afloat and put energy to applying to another role.\n\nEdit: Push to be tactical now. Apply apply apply. Try to get anything that meets your absolute needs (enough pay, remote, etc) while staying interesting enough of a position. \n\n Dont be overly strategic yet.\n\n Be strategic once you get the job. Plan, get to know your peers, get to know the culture, be strategic. Find your place, make a plan. Evaluate your goals/plan as time goes on. You may not want to leave after a year.

Although I did get one phone interview from Capital One, where I talked to the recruiter but she told me that I would get rejected from the position since I didnt meet the baseline requirements of a 1.5 year minimum for the position. She gave me her number and told me to apply again in January since that is when I would meet the requirement. I am going to text her soon now, and apply to the position she tells me to apply to, but I am wondering on whether I should put this startup I had a big part in founding, and getting off the ground. Its only 3 months in and its steadily growing traction. I obviously don't get paid by it yet so need another full time job on top of it. Should i include it on my resume? I think I have done some cool things while working on it and it rounds out my skills well. My only concern is whether this would dissuade recruiters from selecting me for an interview since it may seem like I wouldn't be able to put the time commitment into the paying full time job. For the record, I've done a pretty good job on balancing both and still am able to perform well at my current job. Just concerned on whether this is a plus or a con to a recruiter. I would love some feedback on this and my resume overall. Thanks!\n\nresume: [https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu](https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu)",

What used to be a PM + 5 engineers in the future might be 2 PMs vibe coding + 1 super deep engineer supporting with human effort. \n\nThere will still be a need for hardcore deep tech people to do truly novel / hard things. But there will be so much opportunity for people who actually have product / business skills to create prototypes and find PMF before that point.\n\nFor you as someone who doesn't currently have those deep skills, this is a fresh slate. On the tech side you would be competing against people like me who DID spend 10 years coming up the old way, hands on. Whereas on the product side, I think a lot of the engineers are hopeless and even demonstrating luddite behavior as they see their jobs threatened. That seems like the path of least resistance for you.\n\nIt does depend on your nature a bit also. Personally I have always enjoyed both the product and engineering sides. I gravitated to the tech side because it was more valuable and the limiting factor. I very much feel that shifting now the other direction for a lot of types of software products.",

Sure they’re more inclined but CS for embedded is perfectly valid and you aren’t seen as a lower tier candidate because your degree is highly relevant. Ofc this depends on position, you have no clue about PCBs or pure electronics but for an embedded software position it’s more than enough. \n\nI’m a CS grad, and in my BS I had about a 40% overlap with the CE program.
