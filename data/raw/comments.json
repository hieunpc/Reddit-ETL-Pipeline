It's not a \"commercial open source\" project with an \"enterprise version\" or \"hidden proprietary features,\" like Delta and other similar projects. The project itself is not very popular or exciting, and Apache Spark is often considered \"not modern.\" However, I know that half of the identity resolution projects at a real-world scale of billions of entities rely on GraphFrames' implementation of the Connected Components algorithm. If one needs to cluster graphs on a scale of billions, compute centralities, etc., GraphFrames is the solution. GraphFrames is the only known to me open-source project that can handle such a scale without requiring separate infrastructure. It takes up almost all of my free time, around six to eight hours per week (unpaid, of course), but I'm happy to work on something interesting. What could be better than taking a scientific paper with a distributed graph algorithm and putting it into Scala code? After my routine paid job of moving data from one place to another and doing boring ETLs, GraphFrames contributions are like fresh air to me.",

Because of this tendency, I think the book is important to read before entering DE *and* to revisit often in your career. Tools and techniques make it easy to lose sight of why you exist as a DE in the first place; as important as knowing the ins and outs of spark or airflow is, the business doesn't care about how you did it. They care about value and they care about cost. If you don't know that, you kind of don't know anything. This book teaches you to think on that level.\n\nAs an aside, knowing the fundamentals of DE is now more important than ever, because a lot of hyper-specific tool knowledge can now be delegated to AI (obviously you should educate yourself on tool fundamentals).

It is like comparing \"Ford vs a V8\" -- what? That's not even the same category of thing.\n\nDo a comparison of Iceberg and Delta Lake in both Databricks and another execution engine so you can compare the difference of the two formats. Or change the comparison to be Databricks vs a more self-managed Glue.\n\nAlso \"without vendor lock-in\" seems like it has little real basis. Delta Lake can be read and written by multiple different execution engines. Databricks code is still just SQL and/or pyspark, and it reads/writes to cloud storage that can be access by other execution engines. There's no more or less lock-in between Databricks and Glue -- they both have their custom extensions to pyspark and their own catalogs.",

It's probably a symptom of where I've worked: 1 other IC in my team the entire 6 years ish I've been there.  End-to-end, to some extent, has been the job.  For a while I've been able to weight the proportion towards admin/engineering/come-architecture work because of some team changes around me, and seniority, I guess.\n\nBack to the blurry line, though.  If a data engineer \"does pipelines\"... WTF even is a \"pipeline\"?  Isn't it just input to output?  What's the output of a data engineer?  Varies wildly, I'd say.  Probably also very dependent on team makeup, like mine.  If output is data at a cleaned/\"silver\" state where an \"analyst\" or \"modeller\" comes in to then make it star schema or something else: well, for me in my place, that's not worth much.  50% value kind of thing.  Good for the self service analyst who wants to just get it into Excel.  Maybe you don't want to build enterprise reports with it, though, for example.\n\nSo, if a \"data engineer does pipelines\" is part of the definition of an engineer, and that pipeline involves extracting data from an SQL server or an API feed into some kind of staging area in a warehouse or data lake....  I repeat my thinking, that's half the job at best, and worth that much.  In that case we would do some general analysis of the raw/source data; set up some options in config/metadata; set up the automation; and that's kind of that bit done.  The rest is *analysis*, *modelling*.\n\nSo, I guess I do arguably quite a lot of analyst work as an engineer.  Sorry for the waffle.",

Just develop an agent give it enough tools and just have a BA write the prompts. You can crank out 10 or even 100 agents this way. The agents will quickly do something that looks like what you want, but the last 20-30% of the features will take (as with other tech) 80% of the time and skills. Then layer on data integration from enterprise systems, testing, deployment, hosting, observability, alerting, human in the loop etc and you quickly exhausted a lot of companies skill sets (especially smaller companies). Also the run cost and token cost of such agents are a lot higher than agents that are properly designed for a specific workflow.",

In reality, AI projects fail more often because of messy data pipelines, lack of inline governance, and the need for structured, semantically rich inputs, not because the model itself can’t generate text. You still need engineers designing pipelines, validating outputs, handling temporal misalignment, and making sure the AI actually produces actionable results rather than just plausible-sounding responses. It’s not about slapping ChatGPT into a workflow; it’s about building reliable, production-ready systems that can scale, and that takes proper evaluation, monitoring, and observability, basically everything CoAgent (coa.dev) focuses on for enterprise AI deployments. If your clients understood that upfront, half the “myth-busting” calls wouldn’t even exist.",

You need to learn each domains dialect, what data they use, why they use it, and how they refer to it, and rationalize between them.

I suppose, do I ever know confidentially what I will be working on in 6 months? Let alone predict it for someone else, let alone a *new* person?

Though eventually you won't need them as you get more familiar. \n\n>The culture / it's people is a hit or miss\n\nThis *does* vary a lot by company.  Everywhere I worked has had a distinctive culture. \n\n>riding an emotional rollercoaster because of the work load / tension from the amount of p1 or escalation incidents that have happened on the short span of a month.\n\nThis is probably, mostly, because you're new.  \n\nYou don't know how their stuff works. You don't know where to look (or where it's pointless to look), and you don't know who to ask about X (or who it's pointless to ask about X).  This will get better.  Restarting this process is the worst part of job switching imo. \n\n>Are jobs supposed to feel like this?\n\nConceptually, everything you described seems very typical. \n\n> I'm contemplating whether if its worth to stay given the brutality of the job market or just find another job. \n\nOf course, go nowhere until you have another offer.  \n\nIf you can get another (seemingly better) offer - great.  Keep in mind if you leave this place after say, 6 months - what if the next place is also unexpectedly not what you want?  Are you going to feel stuck for awhile, cuz you don't want **two** 6 months stints in a row on your resume?\n\nPersonally, I'd relax on job searching and plan to stick around at least >= 1 years to learn things well there, learn what your options are there, and have it be a 'safe' tenure on your resume.  But I know people who have done some rapid, consecutive hops, and done well too, so grain of salt.\n\nSidenote: Maybe watch Office Space if you never have?",

This is most often done when rapidly prototyping in a tool like PowerBI. \n\nOBT also works better for some niche storage / warehouse types.

Don't force yourself to use OOP. For ex, a file like 'helpers.py', why would you go for class class-based approach? This could make the code less readable.\n\n  \nOther than that, learning OOP is pretty straightforward after you learn the basics. Go for any YouTube tutorial - would be more than enough.",

Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the \"choosing batch\" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...**\n\n  \nBatch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern. \n\n\n\nThe use case we up against still does **not require streaming**, It's more about cramming a growning amount of ETL into the off business hours.

Almost all data pipelines I build leverage small micro-batches with event & temporal triggering:  \n\n   * Data streams into files on s3, persisted once either a time or size threshold is met.  Max time is typically 1-15 minutes, depending on the feed.\n   * Once it lands all further processing is typically event-driven leveraging s3 event notifications and parallel processing kubernetes, ecs, lambda, or whatever.\n   * If downstream apps need to run against newly-arriving files, they can subscribe to s3 event notifications for when they do.  These can also be translated to load timestamps & ids if the apps want to query the database rather than just read the s3 file.\n   * If downstream apps need to run against a certain newly-arrived period of data (ex: the most recent day/hour/etc) then a specific agent is responsible for periodically querying the data and is solely responsible for dictating when a given period is complete.  And then it sends out a sns message and apps can subscribe to that.\n\nThe net results is that it's extremely resistant to data quality problems from late-arriving data, it delivers data as quickly as it's economically feasible, most of the system is fault-tolerant and self-healing, and you don't have bloated daily processes failing in the middle of the night and lengthy outages, you deploy during the day, you know immediately if there are problems, and it doesn't take 8 hours in the middle of the night to know if the fix worked.",

We use tools to change the content and structure of our data so that a push to each branch is idempotent. For example, our transformation layer uses a dbt ci similar to what is described in their [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) (modified for our specific workflow). Our consumers build either off of UAT or PROD, depending on the stage of the feature we are building for them. \n\nUnlike typical git workflows for stateless applications, our data engineers need to merge to each branch sequentially. It looks like this:\n\n1) Merge Feature to DEV - check if DEV Environment data passes tests\n\n2) Merge Feature to UAT - consumers connect their dashboards/scripts/aimodels to UAT environment and report back on what they need changed\n\n3) Merge Feature to PROD - once consumers are happy, we release to prod, which has some additional checks and needs a senior data eng to sign off\n\n  \nMajor downside of the approach we have not been able to resolve is that PROD/UAT/DEV branches will have a different commit history.",

If your team includes the DEs, AEs, and DAs then I could see there being a struggle to deliver some layers (medallions) to UAT but not others. On the other hand, if your a team of Engineers delivering to Analysts, I think its easier to point to milestone/wins that enable the analysts.

This matters more in a larger org, but dev can move ahead and work on features that are not ready to be UAT-ed. This allows consumers to do a more thorough job of validating, which I often think of as \"I need to go talk to so-and-so who knows the business more to see if these results look right\", and if so-and-so is busy for the next week then at least engineers can move forward on the dev branch.",

There are some people (usually from a Java background and sometimes C++) that seem to think all production code must be OOP which it sounds like you have run into. This mindset leads to odd things in Python, like classes with only one method other than init (just write a function) and classes with only static methods (just put the functions in a module).\n\nPython often lets you write simple clean code by just putting functions in modules or passing them as arguments without classes. In a lot of DE code, functions are often only run once rather than many times across an application so there is less utility for OOP than there is in SWE.\n\nOOP is worth knowing of course. Some examples from the last week I've had is writing my own Operators and Hooks in Airflow which requires you to inherit from various base classes, another would be managing database connections. I have also written code using the connector design pattern to allow easy connections to many different cloud storages for a pipeline.\n\nPython is a very loosy goosey language in OOP terms so I'd stick to Python specific resources or you will get confused. I'd recommend \"Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design patterns in Python 3.8\" by Dusty Phillips. You don't need to read all of it, if you know what an Abstract Base Class is and why you'd use one and why composition is favoured over inheritance then move on to Arjan Codes' design pattern videos on youtube.",

I would ask where they like to document (nowhere), explain the value of people understanding their data more, and bullet point your things. \n\nUse a phased approach to gather the “full chain”\n1. Source data: Ask engineers/data generators to fill out DBT Source YAMLs. They are technical, and probably won’t mind the interfacing. Also ask for existing docs, design reviews, and the code. AI should be able to read the code and tell you what it’s doing. \n2. Transforms: Same thing with analysts/wh users. Describe the table/views/columns and ask them to state their assumptions. Their data is a lot of work and valuable! We’re moving towards making data products. \n3 exposures: approach business owners and those reporting to business and at this point just ask for the reports/models/ which see important and a URL which can get you to the report, or to know what is being referenced. “If you tell us what you’re looking at, we can ensure it’s not impacted by warehouse changes and upstream data evolving”\n\n\n1. The data portability alone is worth it. DBT docs are accepted everywhere - you can pull them into warehouses, data vendors, data catalog tools, and it has its own free portal you and put oh GitHub pages.\n2. Get SQL writers to use DBT templating. Big org win. Otherwise you can rewrite their tables with a script and show them a lineage graph, and then they will start using DBT\n3.

To your questions:  \n1) Yes, everything is stored on premise: the processed API query result in a Delta Table and from thereon a duckDB database, both located in \\`data\\` in the workspace. \n\n2) I added the bronze Delta Table as a source in dbt ([here](https://github.com/moritzkoerber/local-data-stack/blob/master/dbt/models/01_bronze/xetra/sources.yml)). The result of the silver and gold stage are both written into a table in the duckDB database, which is a \\`.duckdb\\` file (no \"raw files\" like in bronze). I believe duckDB does not support an incremental write into external locations/Delta Tables through dbt at the moment.\n\n3) Yes, I simply query the gold table from the database. I added the duckDB database as resource in Dagster and by this it can be easily used in assets. [Here is the code](https://github.com/moritzkoerber/local-data-stack/blob/master/src/local_data_stack/defs/assets/presentation.py#L28).\n\nThat's great feedback, I did not realize how much I did not describe appropriately.

We packaged it and exposed it through a FastAPI endpoint. It was deployed on k8s with a load balancer for horizontal and elastic scaling. The main app called the endpoint with the payload and we answered with a float (the score).  \nUsing FastAPI background tasks, we sent asynchronously the payload, timestamp and score as a JSON to S3 (we could also have published it to Kafka). Then, a small ETL orchestrated by Prefect imported the JSONs into ClickHouse. The API was capable of answering the request in \\~100ms. It was fast enough for the small product we had back then.\n\nComing back to Flink: I believe that for usecases that requires statefulness, it is indeed the best solution. You could also use Spark, even though it will very likely be slower. Another good fit is TImeplus/Proton (waaaaaaay easier to setup than Flink, the tradeoff being the flexibility on the choice of the pattern).",

What matters is demonstrating how the data enables business decisions - and for a data engineering role, showcasing things like IAM, RBAC, monitoring, and reliability is far more impressive than just processing a big file.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I work with Snowflake, dbt, lakehouse patterns, and DuckDB daily, and even then I only have about 30% of the technologies listed on my resume compared to yours.

Seeing the capex peak will be an important sign to pay attention to, it would likely signal they’re ready to start deploying headcount to use that hardware to grow revenue.

Roles were found through contracting companies in the cloud vendor PSO programs. The company would bill the resources(DEs) at 200-250$/hr to clients, and contracts would generally be 3 months to a year. Contractors were mid-senior DEs and paid 100-225k. Companies were all US but across sectors from retail to tech.\naside: Negotiate people! I had access to the numbers and contractors that were doing the same role, same tasks could have 75k spreads in salary. Also change jobs, you don't owe any company anything and it's how you really bump your salary. \n\nProjects I did as a contractor with PSO included:\nBuilding a CLI wrapper around GCP's CMLE that allowed data scientists with local PCs, with graphics cards, to have a containerized workflow that would work locally and a flag of '--cloud' would run the same job on CMLE. Crazy reduction in spin up times, validation of flags and savings on cost of spinning up clusters with hundreds of graphics cards for 10 minutes to fail during startup. \n\nLots of data migrations. \"Get this Oracle DB into the cloud like bigquery... no its license expired and we don't have the ability to do CDC or replicas to avoid pulling too much during working hours oh and you need to use a vpn tunnel that is 25mb/s.. no we don't know what data we want so get everything... how does cloud work?\"\n\nHelped a startup convert their Data Workflows that executed in an on prem location to separate compute from storage, then containerize compute, then migrate storage to the cloud, then migrate remaining compute to the cloud. (Not distributed compue. Python/Java ETLs).\n\nAnd really, listening to a ton of meetings that cover insider Political BS(Which team owns what data, who should have permissions, VP wants method A but acquired company does it method B and wants to keep the current method, etc). Realizing when your contract is just to 'validate' some execs preferences and agreeing. Also constantly pushing back on Realtime data everywhere.",

Statistical tests (KS, PSI) still work on samples. For categoricals, stratified sampling helps catch rare value changes. For partitioned tables, profile only the latest partition(s) instead of full history.\n\nIn terms of frequency, I run lightweight profiling (schema, basic stats) on every run, and save detailed stats for a few runs per day. Tier by importance—critical tables every run, others maybe 2–3x daily.\n\nI built a profiling tool that does adaptive sampling (random, stratified, top-k) and handles partitions. It stores results over time, so drift detection still works even with sampling and less frequent runs. \n\nTrino supports TABLESAMPLE directly in queries (SELECT \\* FROM table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (2)). For Spark, add .sample() before your profiling checks.",

I'd probably manage the transformation logic with dbt, but most data warehouses will support scheduled queries and/or views if you don't want to introduce an extra tool yet.\n\nThis has the advantage that, in the flattened tables, you can include only the fields you currently have a use for, while still storing all the unused ones in the warehouse as raw data.

There's also going to be a balance between things which you or other colleagues already know how to do/use and things which you need to learn. There's also going to be a balance between complexity, future-proofing, maintainability and the minimum viable product.\n\nIf you can generate a set of solutions to present along with an indication of what you think the trade-offs between those solutions might be, you will make your superiors very happy. It's ok if you don't know the answers, or if their assessment of the trade-offs would be different to yours. Being wrong about something is absolutely fine so long as your process is transparent.",

Practically speaking, it's a 1 stop shop for analytics. So it has tools for ETL, operational databases, OLAP optimized query engines, reporting (Power BI being the reporting part) and so on, all as part of one suite.\nLike the Microsoft Office Suite, but for data.\n\nYou could build the whole solution you describe inside Fabric.\nBut then again, we're not the only offering of this kind on which you could do everything within.",

Think of it like database for data entry application. Generally, if your sole focus is to unify data and generate insights, you'd focus on OLAP not OLTP database. Snowflake is an OLAP database and it has lower barrier to learn than other similar service.\n\n\nFivetran acts as your data loader. Sure you can use snow-cli to load the data yourself. However, I find Fivetran make this process easier in many ways.\n\n\nAfter the data has been loaded, you'll need to transform those raw data into a ready to use data. Maybe it's for user to use it directly (hence, self-serving analytics), or it's for analyst and scientist. To transform them means you will have to create new column or entirely new data from the existing ones. For this case, use dbt.\n\n\nDocument and update the transformation in git.",

Like, are you just ingesting a few tables from one system, one business process... Or an entire enterprise worth of different business processes, tens of systems, etc? And what kind of source data formats - just SQL databases, or less-structured APIs, etc?\n- how much transformation, data cleansing, etc etc will need to happen between raw data and final semantic models?\n\nRemember you don't have to follow a literal bronze/silver/gold structure - people often take medallion architecture too literally. If your use case is simple with one SQL source, you might only need a raw/bronze kind of layer to land the data, then straight to gold/final in one hop. If your use cases and data are complex you might need more than three layers, and you might differentiate one layer to multiple workspaces thematically, even just within prod.\n\nFor small teams and simpler scenarios, you also don't _necessarily_ need separate dev and test environments. Depends on what tools you're using within Fabric, how you're testing, who is testing, how deployments are managed, how often things are changing, etc. Sometimes, testing can reasonably happen in the same workspace you develop in, then you just promote to prod.",

And it will be your responsibility to manage the lifecycle of the secrets.\n\nOn a VM, hopefully you'd have a Secret Manager by the cloud provider easily integrated to access the credentials.  \n\nIf you're not able to run a simple DockerOperator or KubernetesPodOperator or use k8s Secrets effectively on said managed Airflow instance, I'd seriously question the value of that offering.\n\nAnd beyond that, just install OpenVPN, open the VPN connection and execute dlt.",

This will populate an object in the Databricks catalog that allows you to query/explore the DB as though it were a native table. Downside is that performance can be rough as you relinquish control over the query in favor of a simpler interface. Spoiler: this is using JDBC under the hood\nRelevant docs: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/query-federation/sql-server\n\n\nThere are other ways (sqlalchemy for example), but these two options have worked well in my experience.\n\nIf you're pulling multiple tables from the same db, set up a class or set of functions to allow yourself to reuse them for any datasets you need to pull. This way your workflow can read like a series of simple steps ex: get_max_cdc_column, fetch_new_data, add_metadata_columns, write_to_delta. Added benefit here is you can quickly whip up new ingests by passing different args to your functions.",

Then one Databricks DLT or Auto Loader pipeline per DB using apply\\_changes for upserts, with a jobs cluster or serverless and autoscale. Use Trigger.AvailableNow for micro-batch or continuous if latency matters.

In your case, that sounds like AP\\_Number level, since you want to reprocess specific APs without touching the whole EQP.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On avoiding reprocessing:\\*\\*\n\nTrack what you've already processed with metadata (timestamp, checksum, or version) stored somewhere lightweight - could be a simple metadata table in your warehouse, or even a manifest file per batch. When new data arrives, compare against this metadata to determine what's actually new vs. what you can skip.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On the Part\\_Number optionality:\\*\\*\n\nSince Parts are optional and variable per AP, I'd process at the AP level and handle Parts within that processing step rather than trying to partition by them.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Alternative approach:\\*\\*\n\nWhat if you partition by ingestion batch (timestamp when client sends data) rather than by the hierarchical data structure? Each batch could contain multiple EQPs/APs, but you'd process the whole batch as one unit. Downstream, you'd have the full data hierarchy in your warehouse with proper keys for querying.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Question for you:\\*\\*\n\nWhat drives the need to reprocess individual APs? Is it data corrections from the client, or something else? Understanding that might help determine the right partition strategy.\n\n\n\n(Side note: your client moving to database storage sounds like it'll simplify this significantly - might be worth investing effort there rather than over-engineering the S3 ingestion flow)\n\n\n\nCurious what you end up doing - hierarchical data ingestion is always interesting to solve!",

A simple bash script is all you need to do this. You will want the environment to be stable and unchanging. The best way to do that with servers that do not have internet access is by packing your environment in a tarball (without your custom libraries installed) and unpack the env and install on the machine\n\nAgain all of this, tarball unpacking, install of library are just all a bash script. \n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk.",

The upside of this is that it's a common pattern that most of your customers will understand. The downside is that they have to write code (ie do work) to get the data out. The shape of the data is limited to what you serve over the API. It also puts a bunch of extraneous load on your servers and db (we've seen APIs be taken down because they were being scraped aggressively for BI purposes).\n* you can let your customers download CSVs. Like the first option, this will take work on your side to support and operationalize. The upside is that it's a pretty well understood pattern. The downside is that your customers might get annoyed quickly because this is a manual process: if they want data with any kind of regularity, they'll have to do this over and over again.\n* you can upload the data to an S3 bucket (or other object storage like R2 / GCS) and let your customers read it there. This is similar to giving them access to a database that you own, but gives you better cost and load protection: they'll be using their own compute to read it so it's less likely they'll blow up your bill by reading the data (though they can rack up big egress fees if your dataset is large).\n* you can share data directly to your customer's database or data warehouse. The upside is that the data shows up directly where they're ready to consume it, and they have to do zero work in order to get the data. It's also much more secure than letting them access your database directly (for example, they can't take your database down by accident by putting undue load on it). The downside is that it can be more or less cumbersome for your team to implement, depending on whether you build it in house or use existing tools. If you decide to use tools for this, assuming your data exists in places other than that RDS instance, you can leverage some of the native sharing functionality of some data warehouses (eg Databricks' Delta Sharing, or Snowflake's Data Sharing). Alternatively, you can use a vendor like us ([https://prequel.co](https://prequel.co/)) that will let you write data from your database instance directly to your customer's db / warehouse regardless of what stack they run.\n\n*Full transparency: we're a software vendor in this space.*",

The one case where we still see this with abctl is when it’s running on a VM that’s below our minimum recommended resources - in that scenario, performance can degrade in exactly the ways you’re describing.\n\nThe other factor here is your specific use case: Postgres-to-Postgres. Postgres isn’t a great database for moving large amounts of data, so even outside Airbyte, this pattern tends to be slow.\n\nNormally I’d suggest our Flex product, which handles these workloads much more gracefully, but I understand you’re looking for something that’s predictable in cost. In that case, I think the best next step is to understand why the Cloud version isn’t performing well for you - since Cloud should not exhibit any of the problems you’re seeing on abctl. If we can diagnose that, there’s a good chance we can get you to something stable without changing tools entirely.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’m happy to take a closer look at your Cloud account with our team. Please dm me with your details so I can get back to you on official Airbyte channels.",

So if you can't explain in the most technical terms encryption vs encoding, you can at least talk about how your application encodes values, why it's important for the application and where you use encryption.\n\nPersonally I'll generally take the developer who can talk me through what they'd improve in a project over the guy who can tell me what each gang of 4 design pattern.

I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then it took me 6 months to learn to walk again. When I reported back to my job when the surgeon ended my FMLA and I could prove I could descend down 2 flights of stairs in less than a minute, my office was on the 3rd floor of a 5 story building. I had to prove that in case of a fire in the building and couldn't rely on anyone to help me down the stairs. \n\nBut as I made it back to work after 6 months, my termination papers were waiting for me as they had already replaced me. \n\nI say that to say that every in person interview I have ever been to in the last 41 years, I was always offered the job. I've been been to 4 in person interviews this year and none of them have contacted me after I left the building. \n\nBut all 4 interviews have gone the exact same way that your interview has gone. When I sat down with other employees for a technical review, all 4 interviews with them would ask odd ball questions that had nothing to do with programming. Most of the people I had interviewed with I saw a sheet where they had to google for these odd ball questions. \n\nI'm also a back end developer and one question I was asked is how would I use a Friend Class in C#. Now Friend classes are mostly used by testers, not developers. I've never ever used a Friend class in production. But the guy asking the questions wanted an answer, I made up some answer of how I would track down a bug that was happening in a Entity Framework class and returning invalid data. I said I would use the a Friend class to inject various variables into the Framework class to possibly see where the problem is coming from. \n\nNow it would really be a lame company to work for if they were using Friend classes in production, and I would bet that they were not.  But the guy interviewing me said \"Well, that isn't what we would do.\" The interview then ended. \n\nThe manager would return to the conference room and I would be walked out the building. More than likely it was just a gotcha question to say that we interviewed US citizens and none of them were qualified for the position so we need to apply for more H1B visa holders, or something similar. \n\nAll 4 interviews where similar things.

It is not even close to being the same.\n\nTreat it as a learning experience and understand that preparing for technical interviews is very very different. Remember that interviews are intentionally designed to expose what you *don't* now. Good interviewers rarely focus on what you *do* know. Interviewing is a skill and you should definitely focus on it if those skills are weak.\n\nI would actually argue that with these concepts.. the theoretical foundations have to be there, yes, but how it's applied in real world scenarios is far more important. The edge cases, the pragmatic approaches.. the theory only goes so far. And the only thing that matters here is experience. You won't really understand hashing until you've screwed it up. You only really understand securing an API until there you cause an unauthed API incident, etc. Having text book theory about all of these with no real world use is actually worse. Best to be honest and say, \"I don't understand the inner workings entirely, but this is how I have used it, and this is what I learned, found interesting, found tricky..\"\n\nThe other thing you nailed, was your understanding about your communication style. You need to develop clear, concise, confident, vocabulary about these concepts, it has to be second nature.\n\nOf course, any seasoned dev can google/stackoverflow/llm the answers and patch something together in a real job context. But can they think and speak on the spot and come up with a clear approach to a complex problem?  Interviewers look for \"architectural sense\". Are they just slapping ideas together, or can they actually build and piece together a system, that works? Can they document and write a spec, without help?\n\nYour ability to communicate ideas, problems, solutions, and tradeoffs, as a dev is more important than your ability to code. Maybe not at first when you're getting started, but certainly in mid career, and late career, it's everything.\n\nThere are plenty of resources and courses online to learn about just about everything. It needs to become an obsession on your part, to consume as much knowledge as you can AND then apply it in personal projects, over and over again, from scratch, from frameworks, from everything, until the skills are cemented. It's brutally tough, I get it. There's so much to learn and specialize into.\n\nBut in this job market and hiring climate, only the obsessed, people who truly love this stuff, will make it. There is no room for casuals anymore. The bar is so much higher than it was a decade ago, but there is also ten times more resources/avenues for learning/getting started.",

Armed with this knowledge, I wrote a guard clause around the function that crashed and ensured that the value was non-zero (but instead really really really small) and this fixed it. And this wasn't even advanced debugging, this was literally backtrace viewing, stack frame traversing, and register inspection.\n\nThe moral of the story is - it still pays to learn low-level computer science, assembly, C, and of course debugging tools like GDB and valgrind.

Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.\n\nSelf-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google \"X roadmap\" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.\n\nWith self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. \n\nAlso, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.\n\nAnd then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. \n\nNow, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. \n\nAlso, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money. \n\nI will put it so: how will you stand out as a self-learner from the crowd of university graduates, vocational school graduates, and junior developers changing their company? Why a company should hire a self-learner over a guy who has a degree? If you can figure it out for yourself, then sure, go with a self-study. But if you do not have a strong plan to have an advantage over degree holders, then go for a degree.",

Did you omit it for the format because of time/space constraints?\n- You claim \"don't learn SQL like it's 2010\", but then never use any features post SQL'99. From skipping through I didn't see a single CTE, window function, recursive query, lateral join, json data, tree data, vector data or generalised indexes. This is really basic stuff. Sure, it's not an SQL course but a database design course - but these features are capabilities of databases nowadays that can be used.\n- you seem to do this implementation agnostic, but some stuff here is highly database dependent. Postgres does not have a tinyint type, text data behaves very differently on MySQL vs Postgres. Of course that can't be fully addressed in these videos, but with a full video on string types to wave this away as \"text may be better on any length\" is... weird.\n- ~~same with date types, a datatype introduction there should have timezones in it.~~ - nvm, it does mention it in the constraints video\n- NULL algebra is relegated to one of the last chapters it seems, but it's a gigantic footgun.

I focus heavily on entities, relationships, cardinalities, constraints, and conceptual/logic design. Because of that, relational algebra, window functions, etc aren't core to the curriculum for this class.\n* I also intentionally keep the SQL examples **implementation-agnostic**. If all you want to learn is vendor differences, you need to look elsewhere.\n* For the data types videos, the goal is to give beginners enough intuition to make reasonable design decisions, not to provide an exhaustive catalog of every nuance across engines.\n* As for NULL semantics, that topic *is* included, but it shows up later because students need some conceptual grounding first. By the time they get there, they’re ready for a deeper discussion of null traps.\n* As for \"A table is used to represent a single entity\", it helps beginners learn in the 1st lesson. Nuances like junction tables are inappropriate in the 1st lesson, and are covered as the course progresses.\n\nThese choices are mainly for pacing and approachability, especially for students encountering databases for the first time. That said, your points about relational algebra and modern SQL features are fair for someone looking for a different style of course, and I appreciate you raising them.",

Computer science is the science of examining these problems and methods (algorithms) of solving them.\n\nSoftware engineering is the discipline of writing software systems. One activity of that work is programming (writing the actual code that accomplishes the task), but there is a lot more involved such as understanding requirements, and design. It turns out that if we just start coding from our heads we inevitably run into problems so there are strategies and best practices that aim to reduce the likelihood of things going badly.\n\nRegarding job prospects software developers often have degrees in either discipline and in many ways they end up overlapping so it doesn't matter too much which one you pick, what matters is that you put in a lot of effort to actually become good at your job.",

Kernel Stack - You don't want to share privileged kernel details with userspace accidentally, so the switches to supervisor mode swap stacks.\n\n2. Signal/Exception Handlers can be told to use a separate stack, because signals may come when your out of memory. You can sigaltstack() to set this up. Check out man sigaltstack.\n\n3.

I quit my old job to move to a major tech hub (this was before I had kids -- it would be much harder to do this now) because, you know, you should go where the money is. And by \"move\" I mean \"sleep on the floor of the one guy I know in this city\".\n\nI was very quickly disabused of the notion I'd get hired as a software engineer because 1) I had absolutely no worthwhile experience to speak of, and no one is hiring you off a portfolio.\\[0\\] 2) I was objectively unqualified, which I can now say with the benefit of hindsight. I wasn't competent enough to understand how actually incompetent I was.\n\nAfter sleeping on my friend's floor for a scary six months of unemployment and failing to get hired as a software engineer, I changed my approach from \"What can I do to get someone to hire me as a software engineer?\" (because that clearly wasn't working) to \"What can I do to get on a path that will allow me to take meaningful steps toward my goal?\" and this basically unlocked everything for me.\n\nI made lists of what I deemed the \"right\" companies to facilitate my growth. These were:\n\n1. Companies that were smallish but definitely growing. Successful startups or just post-startup-phase companies. Places like this, you're going to get asked to flex out of your zone all the time, and internal mobility is very high relative to the Googles or Metas of the world.\n2. Companies where software engineering was in the DNA of the company: whether it was a strong engineering brand, or the customers were engineers. I wanted to become a software engineer, so I wanted a place that had software engineering top of mind (ie not like, a photo-sharing app or dog-walking-as-a-service or whatever).\n\nAnd I guess (3): a place where my past background might be at least slightly relevant, to leverage in some way the value of my past life.\n\nAnd from there I made it my goal to get \\*any\\* role in one of those companies. I would have taken a role in the kitchen.\n\nI got hired as a non-technical customer support agent at what was the dream company on my list. And I spent the next few years proving to them that I am awesome and capable of bigger and better things, and after a few years transitioned internally to a software engineering role, which I would have ABSOLUTELY NOT ever been considered for as an external candidate, largely because I was not competent to do the job. It's much, much easier to become competent while you're inside the house. When you're on the outside, you're largely flying blind and it's very very easy to waste energy. Inside, you will get \\*precise\\* intelligence about what you need to succeed.\n\nAnd I've been here ever since. Dream job.\n\n\\[0\\] unless it's literally insane or you are some major tech influencer / Techerati Twitter / library-maintaining celebrity / etc",

But the good thing is, this moment will pass. If you genuinely are interested in tech, just keep on pushing, it’ll be worth the effort. if there’s a simmer of hope to pass the test, study as hard as possible to pass it. worst case scenario, you have to retake the class but you now know everything in all future exams. \n\nAs for your career in tech, you have to do side projects and internships. As long as you keep these up, you’ll be fine after graduation. Many graduates lacks experience needed to land a job, which is already over saturated. If you don’t like tech, then you should find what you want to do. since you’re only on your 3nd semester, you still have a bit of freedom to explore while you take all the prerequisite aa classes. \n\nOn the side note, you should have financial aid no? You could also look for jobs in your school like desk help. you could study while getting paid. College isn’t for everyone, there’s different ways to make money. But it is an investment. Like a gym, you have to put in the work to get results you want. If you want a certain job, college  is a great place to get there.",

The hardest part to work in and deal with has absolute crap for documentation.  \"It's obvious, the code documents itself.\"  Our smartest guy struggles with it, and it's the only part LLMs really struggle badly with.\n\nAnd of course, even if you're using descriptive function and variable names, it's still not good enough.

And why are we multiplying it with this input value anyway?\n\nOr, in a SQL query, you'll see me doing \"where exists\" to filter, instead of \"where in\" or even just a straight inner join.

        "body": "The value of taking notes isn't the note itself, it's having written it in the first place. You are exercising your mind by writing it.\n\nIn the industry, documentation is scarce. The point of you writing your documentation is to get you to think about what you're doing in your homework. You're practicing structured thinking and discipline. It's helping you more than you realize.\n\nThe only reason I write documentation is when I'm publishing an API. Clients rely on accurate documentation when consuming 3rd party code. The documentation is either correct - or it's COMPLETELY DEAD. If your documentation betrays the client, they'll never trust the documentation or the product ever again. You wouldn't, if it were you.\n\nBeyond that, there are design documents that describe system architecture at a high level. This is for internal consumption for my colleagues. I don't rely on my own documentation.\n\nThe last layer of documentation is the source code itself. The program documents itself. Abstraction hides complexity and tells us WHAT - this is the most important; an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. The implementation tells us HOW - and we really don't care. `std::for_each` could be in terms of `for`, `while`, or `goto`, I don't give a fucking shit. Comments in the code tell us WHY, and provides context.\n\nOutside of your class requirements, you never write documentation that tells us what the code tells us. If I see:\n\n    template<typename T>\n    std::span<T>::iterator median(std::span<T>);\n\nI don't need to be told the `median` function computes a median. I need to be told the parameters are a sorted range and the return value is within the range, because I can't express that in code. I need to know the rounding function used, as it's consequential. I don't care how the median is computed, otherwise.\n\nThere are a TON of bad comments, and they should tickle your intuition that something ain't right. The problem with comments that tell me what the code tells me is who is the authority? The code or the comment? This matters when the code and the comment don't agree - which they usually don't. A comment might be a heading, telling us where we are and what the next segment does. We call those \"functions\". Break your code up. Let the compiler elide the calls and composite the function for you. It's a sign your functions are too big.\n\nAnother way comments and documentation warn you of bad code is that the whole thing is bad. Getters and setters - \"Gets the thing\", and \"Sets the thing\". Bad sign. Getters and setters are not OOP, if you're busy learning that, they're an anti-pattern. It's a sign of boilerplate - which there should be none. It's redundant. You have a misunderstanding of applied software engineering, and this code can't be justified when there are equal or superior solutions.\n\nUse bad documentation as a test for code quality. It takes time and practice, and a development of a deep understanding of idioms, paradigms, patterns, and our craft. It'll take years, and you're just starting.",

I cant remember the last time i touched std library in UE5 for instance. \n\nI think if your goal is to “learn the language” then working with an engine is not necessarily the best approach (in isolation).

The reason I (for example) can read documentation now, is that I have mental models ready. Just yesterday I had to read the cods for a linear algebra crate in rust, and for a database ORM (also in rust). Reading those today feels familiar, and I can anticipate where I am going. I know most of the terms used, I have done the relevant math manually and programmed it before. Everything fits into the models I have built in my brain neatly. \n\nComparing this to when I first started writing ray tracers at university: I just passed linear algebra, and had no pracical experience. Everytime I read an unfamiliar word, I had to go back, and refresh my memory of that specific thing. \"How does XYZ relate to ABC again?\". The more unfamiliar words, concepts and language features you have to keep in your head, the harder it will always be for you to read documentation, or to plan and write complex code. \n\nThere are basically two ways to learn this stuff: Theoretical and Practical. \n\nTheoretical covers stuff like lectures, and classes, but also online courses, reading a book or a tutorial. This can help you gain information a lot faster, since it is (hopefully) well structured and presented in a proper way to learn. \n\n Practical is things like coding, but also exercises you would do for class or for a course (or in a book). This will solidify the knowledge you gained from the theoretical part. It also forms shortcuts in your brain. After you have build the third backed with APIs, you will instantly know what to do when you start your fourth. You will have a folder structure figured out, some patterns you want to use, and how to name the endpoints. This is the type of knowledge you only get by implementing the same concept repeatadly, you cannot really get this from theory alone (and people who only got this from theory alone most often have really weird, and mostly impactical, solutions to certain problems)",

Basic script can pull from that.\n\nBasically what the script does, at a new machine. Can we linux or MacOS. I install git, pull the repo. Then the script checks if Brew or the package is there, else it installs it. \n\nFrom there there are a few choices ( a complete personal install, a few types of server/CLI setups. So that i can set up my machine or just some basic CLI stuff. But let’s say my own machine. It start with installing the terminal stuff from brew and importing all config files and creating the symlinks.\n\nThen if i tell it to do a full run it also downloads things like Vscode/Neovim, extensions and all other apps i have. Then the some happens for there configs. \n\nThen all my key binds and alias and preferences are there. ( on servers as well, loaded into my profile. But more basic )\n\nThen i have one main script for creating different projects and Dev environments. It basically launches with ‘newproject’ and can be started with a flag like -python. Then it offers me a few choices, if i also want CI/CS files, full test suite. \n\nIf i so a complete run of a script i end up with a folder setup thats git initialized, a main.py a unit test setup and all the basic venv/pip installs i always have, a simple CI/CD file that can start on github runners etc. This script alone takes about 10 sec to complete.\n\nFull script depends a little on the download speed and machine speed of course. But a full install is under 10 minutes. And if i log onto a new server i want a few things, like Z/FZF/Tmux and more things like my aliases, this takes a few seconds and it means every server acts the same for me.\n\nYou are a developer, the basics of such a script should take not much longer than setting up a Env. So make a start, iterate on it.",

Computer science hasn't changed significantly in the last 5 years.\n\nNote that this is teaching computer science, not programming and certainly not software development. They are different fields. You could finish this whole course without knowing how to write a single line of code, but you'd know a ton about how a CPU and RAM works. The course's programming module seems to lean heavily on a book called Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) which is known as a maths-heavy academic textbook with little practical application in the industry of writing code. \n\nOn the other hand you could take a software development course, learn how to build a full-stack web service and deploy it to the cloud, but still think a computer is a magic box where binary happens.\n\nYou could compare it to a racing driver vs a car mechanic. It would benefit both to know how a combustion engine works, but knowing about catalytic converters doesn't make you drive faster, and knowing about racing lines doesn't help you fix cars.\n\nThere's no \"wrong\" career path here, but software developers who know fuck all about CPUs are far more employable than computer scientists who can't code.

There are many (many, many) ways to accomplish this, so it's hard to give a good recommendation without it.\n\nI will recommend Python for the programming language, Flask for the web framework, and Waitress for the server. Python is about the simplest language to learn, Flask provides tools for building a web service in Python, and Waitress acts as a go-between to accept browser requests, turn them into calls to your program, and send the results back again. I would also recommend Flask-RESTful (I would structure the form submission as a REST API call). All of these have very good documentation.\n\nNote that as a security measure Waitress only responds to the 127.0.0.1 interface (your local-machine loopback) and cannot bind to ports under 1024, so you would usually bind to port 8000 or 8080. For local testing or demonstration this is quite sufficient; if you want to serve pages to other machines, you would usually install nginx as a reverse proxy.\n\nYour laptop very likely already has Python installed, but it is a good idea to make sure it is up to date. If you open a command-line window and run \"python -V\" it should respond with something like \"Python 3.12.3\". The current stable version is 3.14.0, and that is the one you should be running unless there is some specific reason you can't. (On Windows! On Mac or Linux, don't go monkeying with the system-provided version.)\n\nIt is recommended to start by setting up a virtual environment, to prevent something you're adding from interfering with things you've already installed. You can do this by running \"python -m venv my_app\" followed by \"my_app\\Scripts\\activate\". You can now install the modules by running \"pip install Flask flask-restful waitress\" and start work.\n\nCheck the Flask getting-started docs; it will walk you through writing a minimal web app. Use templates; you can probably drop most of your existing html code into template files and use it from there with minimal modification and without cluttering up your code. Check the Waitress docs; they will show you how to call your app and get it running. Try to keep everything as simple as possible until you get a minimal version up and running; you can always gild it later.\n\nGood luck! 🍀",

        "body": "For what you are asking to do, there isn't much special about a server.\n\nYour laptop is a PC and is perfectly capable of being both the server and the client for what you are proposing.\n\nThere are lots of things you can do to make it more ubiquitous- for example if you could get a static IP allocated and have it added to a DNS, you could look it up from any computer using the network name (e.g. https://www.myserver.com/).\n\nBut if you can't do that (the more likely scenario) you can just look up its dynamically allocated IP address and use that instead (e.g. https://1.2.3.4/ or whatever address you are assigned in place of 1.2.3.4).\n\nMore importantly if you want people to access your server running on your laptop from another computer you will almost certainly need to open the port that the server is listening on.\n\nFor example, let's say you setup a \"web site\" using apache tomcat on your laptop. Apache tomcat, by default listens on port 8080 (for unencrypted traffic and 8443 for https if memory serves). So, if you opened up your browser and entered http://localhost:8080/mystery, then assuming your web app is called \"mystery\" you should see the index.html (or index.jsp) of your site.\n\nNow if you determine that your IP is 1.2.3.4 (it won't be, but let's assume it is) you could go to another PC and enter http://1.2.3.4:8080/mystery then you will likely get a \"host refused connection\" error. This is because the firewall on your laptop isn't allowing anything from the outside to get through - unless you set up the firewall to allow external traffic using port 8080 (or 8443 if you want https) to get through...\n\nNote, if you do open any ports, only open the one or two that you allow and when you are done close them. In fact I would open them when I needed them to be open and close them once I've done the demo from the other computer.\n\nThere are plenty of other potential things you may need to take into account. For example, it will be much easier if both computers are in the same \"subnet\". If you don't know what that means, then just connect to the same wifi AP and hope that the configurations are such that they connect to the same subnet (e.g. try not to use a professors laptop and your student laptop - this is unlikely to be an issue as it is unlikely that there will be such configuration issues,  but you never know for sure unless you try it and know what to look for when it doesn't work on some computers ).",

If like, 4/5 programs on your computer are using iostream, it kinda makes no sense for each program to store it individually, right? That wastes a ton of space. \n\nThe solution is dynamic library files (these are \".so\", or \".dll\" files). A dynamically linked program will be compiled in such a way that when it needs access to a library, it will access the compiled library code at run-time from the library file instead of having it baked into the executable. \n\nOf course, you could just bake the library code into the executable as well. That's static linking, and it's common when you're writing a program for a system with limited space. It also means your entire program is all in one piece.\n\nAs for dynamic/static typing, that's talking about the data being read. \n\nAll data has \"types\". Data can be an integer, an unsigned integer, a character, a boolean value, a floating point number, a double floating point number, etc. and all of those are stored & interpreted differently by the computer - as far as it's concerned, everything's just 1s and 0s. How does your compiler know which is which? Two solutions:\n\n1) You just tell the damn computer what you want. This is static typing. If you want \"i\" to be an \"int\", you fucking call it an \"int\", end of story. It's what you do in C, C++, Java, etc..\n\n2) You take a chill pill, and have the compiler/interpreter guess with how the rest of your code uses that variable.

        "body": "To add a little more detail, linking relates to calling methods. It’s something you barely think about while coding. You just call one, but how does that actually work? Code is also stored in memory at runtime and instructions have memory addresses (line number offsets from the start of the executable file). To call a method, you create a new stack frame for it on top of the stack, set a return pointer to hold the line you are currently on, then jump to the first line of the function you called. At the end of the function, you set a return variable in the caller’s stack frame and jump back using the return pointer. \n\nSo, how do you know where to jump? If it’s a method in the same assembly, that’s easy. If it’s in another assembly, you have to determine the jump address. That’s linking. Assemblies have a table of jump addresses at their start so it’s possible to read and set these addresses. Static linkers set this at compile time and if the actual assembly used differs at runtime, interesting things can happen. Dynamic linkers use a runtime to load assemblies and will resolve these jump addresses at that point. Note that virtual methods that support polymorphism have an expanded table of jump addresses by concrete type since they can overload methods. The runtime selects the jump address based on the actual type at runtime. See v-tables for more information.\n\n\nTyping. All memory storage ultimately has a type. It has to since types are literally encoded differently and processed by different cpu components. You can choose to set that type yourself at compile time (statically) or let the runtime take its best guess (dynamic). The later is rarely necessary with objects in languages that support ad-hoc tuples (like js grab bag objects). With primitives or collections of primitives, it’s not a good practice. With types, you want strongly typed code that lets the compiler do as much validation for you as possible. Anything it doesn’t check can still break as an exception at runtime.",

        "body": "at a high level, there are 2 types of embedded systems.  I used to work on large unmanned systems, and we used stuff like PC104 computers with serial ports.  The line of code you reference in your question would be an invocation of a library function, and that library function would talk to a driver, and that driver would send voltages out the USB port that produce the required signals to tell a motor to run or an actuator to move or the like, or it might read a camera video stream or a lidar or gps output.   This is not much different from coding up a laptop or something, these computers had a full operating system and mouse/keyboard/monitor support for diagnostic efforts and so on.   Its 'barely' embedded, in the big picture of that world, but we made many a 'robot' (mostly, unmanned aircraft and later, watercraft) with those tools.  \n\nThe other level is where you do more of that hands on, sometimes actually wiring devices together yourself and sending voltages to them with some agreed upon way, often directly setting an address to a value using a C or assembly like language.   I did a lot less of that, as it is slower to produce the product and a lot more weeds to get into for each individual component.   For example we had one 'smart' actuator that ran code, but you had to wire it up a certain way to accept a program and then wire it up a different way to run the program installed on it automatically when it got powered on.   There was extensive documentation for making that work.  \n\nI would start with a simulation.  keep the stuff that would be hardware isolated so you can replace it, and build a sim where you drive your robot around and have it do the things you want it to do all in just pure desktop code.  Then if you want to build it, you can pick out the hardware and change out the isolated code to interface with the motors and sensors and all.   We had full simulation for all our vehicles, crude but it got the job done, to test our control systems and such safely in a virtual world.   Eg if your robot is going to navigate a maze, get the logic for that done in a sim, if its going to avoid obstacles, do that in the sim... get it all working best you can before a live test.",

Their intent would be clearer if they'd called the function `toggleAutoPlay` too.\n\nYou don't need the if statement at all if you use code like this:-\n\n    let intervalId;\n    \n    function startAutoPlay() {\n      intervalId = setInterval(function () {\n          const playerMove = pickComputerMove();\n          playGame(playerMove);\n        }, 1000);\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Stop';\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = stopAutoPlay;\n    };\n    \n    \n    function stopAutoPlay() {\n      clearInterval(intervalId);\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Auto Play';\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = startAutoPlay;\n    };\n\nInstead of checking state variables and branching, you just make the click event point to the right code block in the first place,  Personally I'm not a big fan of the choice to put the looping function inline either, there's a lot to be said for a few extra lines of code and the additional clarity.",

In the `else` statement, it stops autoplaying.\n\nWe don't know the state of `isAutoPlaying` at the time someone calls the `autoPlay()` function. It's initialized to `false` but that will change over the course of the app running. `autoPlay()` isn't called immediately. We don't actually see *where* it's called in this code, but my bet is it's tied to a button click event. So when the app starts running, it's `false`, and then the first time `autoPlay()` is called it will call the first branch of the `if` statement and set `isAutoPlaying` to `true`. The next time it's called, `isAutoPlaying` will be `true` and run the `else` branch instead, resetting `isAutoPlaying` to `false` again.\n\nQuick edit: The statement `!isAutoPlaying` doesn't actually change the value of `isAutoPlaying`.

Then look up database \"normalisation\", you really want your data in at least 3rd normal form (it's not that difficult). This is the main thing that will prevent future problems above all else.\n\nIt's also a good idea to look at the permission model of Postgres, as you'll need an app user to connect with and you'll want to restrict that user in certain ways, e.g. the web app should never be able to drop databases, as an obvious example.\n\nEdit: It's worth noting that if your site is small you don't necessarily need to move to Postgres. SQLite will run a modest site just fine as long as your use case is fairly simple. Much easier to move now than when you have users and data though!",

Start with just one type of hand, e.g. a flush.\n\nWhat's the definition of a flush? It's a hand where all the cards are the same suit.\n\nOne possible way of doing it is to say: \"a hand is a flush if: it's all hearts, OR all clubs, OR all diamonds, OR all spades\". And then write code to check each of those four conditions. This approach will work but it's a bit tedious.\n\nIf you think about it for a second, then it should be obvious that \"a hand where all cards are the same suit\" is equivalent to \"a hand where all cards have the same suit as the first card.\" So you don't need to write four separate checks for the four possible suits.\n\nAnd so on. You can repeat this kind of analysis for each type of hand. For some of the hand types, you will need to examine multiple possibilities, e.g. for two pair, you'll need to check the different possible cards that might make up a pair. For a straight, you'll need to check whether there's a straight with aces low (5-4-3-2-A) or aces high (A-K-Q-J-10).\n\nThere are many possible ways to implement this. If you're a beginner, I would suggest that you first focus on getting something that works *correctly*, even if it's ugly or verbose, and then look for ways to simplify and optimize it. And you should write lots of test cases to make sure that your code behaves as expected.",

So, how I would've done that is this - I'd create a Card class, so i don't have to store suit and value as a raw dictionary, instead i can assign those to a card's attributes through constructor, e.g.\n\n```\ncard1 = Card(❤️, \"Q\")\ncard2 = Card(❤️, \"7\")\ncard3 = Card(♣️, \"J\")\n```\n\nAlso, I'd override comparison dunder methods in Card class, so that i can compare two cards like this:\n\n```\ndef __eq__(self, other):\n    if self.suit != other.suit:\n        print(\"Can't compare cards with different suits\")\n    else:\n        return self.value == other.value\n```\n\nAnd \"less than\" dunder method, so i can tell if the card has higher or lower value:\n\n```\ndef __lt__(self, other):\n    if self.suit != other.suit:\n        print(\"Can't compare cards with different suits\")\n    else:\n        return self.value < other.value\n```\n\nI would also wright a method to compare suits, so i can understand how cards relate to each other.\n\nAnd also, think about how you, as a human, identify that you have a flush, for example? You will take a look at you two cards, check their suits, ignoring their value, then you'll take a look at the table to compare those card's suits to the ones that you have on hand, and IF total amount of cards with the same suit is 5 - you have a flush! So all these hands definitions can be converted in to the functions where if all requirements are met - you've got straight, full house etc.",

That's why we made better CAPTCHAs. When the best OCR could outperform the worst human, we changed techniques. Pick the stop sign. Solve the math problem. Slide the puzzle piece. These all got defeated in their own way. It didn't remotely require \"AI\" in the buzzword context we use it today.\n\nThe modern ubiquitous reCAPTCHA - owned by Google - is more focused on behavioral scoring than solving a challenge. You won't get specific details on how it works, that's by design. Security through obscurity is still important.\n\nMimicking imprecise human input is not exactly difficult, and still doesn't require \"AI\". From what I understand reCAPTCHA is as much about browser fingerprinting, IP reputation, web history, logged in Google account and many other signals, as it is about checking if the mouse shakes while you move it. Cloudflare does something similar. These signals are relatively easy to defeat at the individual level, but harder to scale. Which is really what most websites care about - not a couple bots creating accounts, but a troll farm creating hundreds.\n\nGoogle constantly improves detection with machine learning. Google doesn't publish the efficacy of reCAPTCHA. They may not even have accurate figures themselves, because identifying real world bots is exactly the problem. [Independent research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12108) suggests reCAPTCHA v3 may be the most effective CAPTCHA and highly accurate. If your project requires a greater degree of confidence to prevent automated abuse, you should look at alternatives to CAPTCHA, eg. ID checks or payment details. I'm pretty sure every alternative has much more friction than CAPTCHAs, which is why they're largely still used.",

The server can take a list of prime numbers, and select 'n' random prime numbers from that list (repeats allowed), quickly compute the product and send it to the client. The client then needs to factor the product into it's prime factors and send those back to the server, which is a lot more work than computing the product.\n\nThe tricky part there is finding hard enough problems to meaningfully deter bots, but not force users on potato (crappy) computers off your site.",

UNIX pros will have no trouble typing the above command, but after a few times of using it they will probably start to hate it. New users, of course, will be lost trying to type the above.\n\nImagine your program worked like this instead:\n\n    ./my_awesome_program -o my_output.txt my_input.txt\n\nIn general, that's much easier to use, for newbs and pros alike. But of course you'll have to write at minimum some code for processing the arguments (see Python's argparse, for example), and code for opening input files, opening output files, checking for errors, etc. However, such code is definitely reusable across projects, though, so once you've written it once, you can and should reuse it in many different such command-line tools, not only to prevent code rewriting, but also to enforce \"consistency\" in your CLI apps.\n\nBTW, even for programs that accept input parameters by naming files, it's a popular convention to also allow an option to read from standard input. This is particularly useful if the input the user wants to process comes from another file. Typically this option is called \"-\":\n\n    ./some_other_program_that_produces_output | ./my_awesome_program -o out.txt -\n\nSo in that way of calling the program, the output goes to out.txt, and the input comes from standard input (specified by the - argument for the filename), which we can see comes from some other program (but your program should not know nor care about that). Python's argparse may have an option and/or example for handling this as well (see the manual).",

Do Something: On my course, there are a lot of people who do nothing outside of University. As long as you're taking up a part time job or working on side projects, you're already beating a lot of the competition. In my interview at my internship, they prioritized my soft skills and what I learned in my prior role as a Restaurant Supervisor, and it's why they took me on.\n\nMake the most of your free time at University too.

That also answers to your \"And what parts did you actually have to code? Frontend? Backend?\" part. If it would be just backend then it would be just an API. Unuable for regular everyday users. If it would be just frontend then it would be stateless and there would be no way to interact with other users. A fully functional CRUD application needed both backend and frontend even in early 2000s. Just then you had more likely no frameworks and you were using the regular language itself.\n\nThe comment in that thread says it took couple months for Zuckerberk to make it. Which is realistic time for a single person team. Because you won't be just writing the backend and frontend but also deploying it, setting up a database, figuring out its hosting, do some elementary security testing, etc. \n\nA random beginner could not do it. A person had to have a knowledge in creating CRUD web application. Which would be doable for a person who had spent months in learning it (do keep in mind, writing that early Facebook took couple of months already by itself), trying out smaller projects, and then going for that bigger project. Doable for a CS Bachelor student (2nd-3rd year or such). \n\nThe current Facebook for sure is not duable for beginners nor for students. It has whole separate teams working on different parts of the system.",

But the more mutable state you have the more bug-prone you inherently are and the harder it is actually parallelize your program, not to mention that people are undisciplined and leak internal state everywhere anyway…\n\nAnd as the video you saw points out OOP=Inheritance+Encapsulation. And inheritance is in general kinda pointless… Composition is better mechanism of abstraction and parametric polymorphism/parametric types (think of C++ templates) are way better way of code reuse, there has been at-least million PLT texts written on this topic, they aren’t that hard to find either. So that’s why in lot of people say that OOP is essentially just a method of encapsulation.\n\nAlso as someone in this thread pointed out, everybody defines OOP bit differently, for what’s it worth I recently saw this definition and kinda liked it: ”compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model”",

        "body": "Object Oriented Programming is based on an ideology, whereas Functional Programming is based on mathematical principles. I'll tell you right now that FP is consistently smaller, faster, easier to maintain, and scales better than OOP. You REALLY should focus on FP.\n\nThe principles of OOP do not cause OOP, they come out of OOP as a consequence. So you can use abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance as standalone idioms, or in other paradigms - Functional Programming has all these things, too - and you can still completely miss OOP.\n\nOOP is all about message passing. It's also known as the Actor Model of computation, which you might want to read up on. There's an old tome called Theory of Objects you might want to track down and read, you might want to Google Alan Kay and Carl Hewitt. You might also benefit from dabbling in Smalltalk for a bit - Squeak is a modern implementation.\n\n---\n\nIn OOP - you send messages to objects, and the objects decide ENTIRELY how to handle that message.\n\nYou do not call `car.accelerate();`, you instead create a message, \"I wanna go faster\", and you pass that to the driver, and the driver decides what to do with that. MAYBE they accelerate the car, maybe they maintain a more consistent speed by moving to a less busy lane, maybe they take a shorter route, maybe they're already doing everything they can and have to ignore you.\n\nJava doesn't have a message passing interface like Smalltalk an C++ do, but you can build something - make a `Producer` and `Consumer`, both derived from `Runnable`, that share a `Message` queue. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level construct. In C++, it's standard streams.\n\nYou are giving the object - the actor, autonomy and agency. You are not giving up control. You don't need to command the object what to do and when to do it; it's your object - you built it, you designed it, you've just relocated WHAT and WHEN to somewhere else in your design - when you construct the object. Want a more aggressive driver? Give it more aggressive characteristics as a part of it's construction parameters. Now when you pass it messages, you know it will drive as predictably as you have prescribed.\n\nObjects have no public interface beyond the message passing interface, maybe some necessary boilerplate per your language. You don't GET or SET anything - members are implementation details. You don't push or pull information, you can send it messages with new information, or you can submit a question or query and maybe get a response. Normally objects are constructed in terms of other objects. A car that is accelerated - you don't QUERY the car for the speed, the transmission sends a message to the speedometer, which could be a text output, it could be a widget, an analog device, a HUD...\n\nSo in OOP, you assemble this graph structure of objects as your nodes and message channels as your edges. Your inputs are a source, a monitor, a motor controller, a log file... These are sinks. Things in the middle of the graph can be both sources and sinks - you can make objects that produce their own messages, consume messages, and produce other messages as a response. Perhaps a motor controller is producing heat, speed and power consumption on its own, but also responds to control inputs to speed up or slow down, and acknowledges it received the request.\n\nI dunno, use your imagination.\n\nOOP is GREAT for graph theory, which means it's great for distributed systems. Bjarne invented C++ because he wanted to build network simulators (could have just done it with a matrix - linear algebra is great for solving for networks), but its performance is quite damningly limited. It's ability to scale is also limited - you can scale your graph horizontally all you want, but eventually the size of the network becomes the most limiting factor and you can't get additional performance.\n\nYou can abstract any problem into the OOP domain. That doesn't mean it's a good fit. You can make a text character an object and pass it a message asking it to capitalize itself. This is how Smalltalk works, since everything is an object. But consider the overhead... OOP, Smalltalk presumed a smart compiler, an investment in the paradigm could make the object oriented nature compile out, leaving optimal machine code behind. I don't suppose that's flawed, but it would be an investment in this unique programming paradigm. You're basically trying to get the paradigm out of the way so you can get back down to the lambda calculus formula of computation that the program should actually be.\n\nSo in any of these languages, you can create User Defined Types, as classes certainly are, but that doesn't make them object oriented. Without that autonomous agency, without message passing, it's just more imperative programming, where you're taking direct, explicit control of what happens, when and where.\n\nAnd think about it, once you have an object that accepts messages - you have abstraction aka complexity hiding; you don't know how the object is implemented and you don't care so long as it behaves as it should in lieu of the message. You have encapsulation, which is that bundling of state and functions, aka you can build it internally in terms of stateful behavior. You have polymorphism, which is the ability to interchange any object for any other and they each decide what a message means to them. And you have inheritance, which is an implementation detail, but gives you type hierarchies for when that is sometimes useful.\n\nYou weren't TRYING for any of that, but you get it for free.",

That is, if an A objects contains a B object that contains a C object that contains a D object, then BW argues that A needs to know all the dependencies of B and C and D.\n\nExcept, of course, *nobody actually writes OOP this way.*\n\nIn real life OOP we use dependency injection. Which is a big fancy term that just means pass in an argument. An A object doesn't need to know the dependencies of B, it just needs to take an already-constructed B as an argument. And from that one small simple change, the hierarchical structure that BW spends his whole video criticizing just disappears.",

The front end's entire existence is built upon what your back end provides it. You will need to make available what the front end needs, which often involves knowing a decent amount about front end development. \n\nE.g. You're working with a server-rendered app and the front end suddenly needs some back end data globally available. You *could* create an endpoint and have the front end devs request the data from the back end when the JS runs. But... you just sent the page to the client, and it's a single context, right? So you could just render some JS into the page to define some global data, avoiding the unnecessary round trip, and tell front end devs they have the data already. (I'm not saying this matters per se, just an example of some knowledge of front end helping you make a back end decision. There might be reasons you *want* an endpoint instead).",

I don’t care if a backend dev knows the intricacies of flex box or what browsers css-grid works in, they should know that giving the UI a huge garbled mess, and telling them to just sort and filter it all out in the UI, that’s not only a jerk thing to do, it’s MUCH slower to do almost any of that in a browser on a 5 year old phone than to just do it on the server (could also be a vulnerability based on what it is).\n\nAs another person said however: if you do have to make a change in the UI, you should know what you’re doing, within reason. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you may screw things up and make the other devs mad at you and please don’t do that. You’re supposed to be a team. If you need help, always ask.

There are some uses of LLMs that can be okay, but it seems like they very frequently introduce more problems than they solve, and in the worst cases lead people into trying to run a sub-4-hour marathon by riding a moped.\n\nTheory is generally good, but it's possible to be productive without knowing a lot about it. Trying to learn every theory seems like you'd never get around to producing anything, but just get stuck in academia forever.\n\nYou need to learn to prioritise. Possibly you also need to talk to a therapist or doctor if you're having issues with feeling like something \"messes up your mind\".",

Not relating to interviews, but to getting deeper and deeper until you loop around and feel that you got nowhere.\n\nFirst of all, wanting to know the fundamentals of everything to the core is not bad, but it is dangerous.\n\nYou have to realize this is an impossible task, and that should be the most important basis before any action. Nobody knows everything, but many pretend they do, even beginners, beware of gurus and savants, do not compare yourself to them, because you would be comparing yourself to an illusion.\n\nNow how to choose, when to dive deep, when to stop, when to not dive at all. I cannot answer that for you. But I can tell you my solution. Focus on projects.\n\nI always had this problem, but it never shows up when I have time pressure from a client. When there is time pressure and the main goal is not to learn, it is to get the project done, then I magically start to prioritize things properly.\n\nI have side projects with no time pressure, usually they get nowhere, but I do not expect them to.\n\nIf I am working by myself for myself, I have to create time pressure and reinforce it all the time, or else I get into study loops or refactoring loops or planning loops.\n\nMy suggestion to you is to not direct your learning toward interviews, at least not as the main focus.

Set a timer for that period of time, like 30min. When it stops, you stop. Add to that initial list of things you planned to research later.\n\nYou won't memorize everything (and don't need to), and often times simply going through the main material, only learning enough to continue on with said material, will help you build a foundation to reinforce the rabbit holes you'd be digging through later. If you start with the rabbit hole first, then you may wind up with collapsed tunnels as you have nothing to tether that knowledge to. That'll result in digging those same tunnels later, wasting your time.\n\nDo just enough to build a basic mental model of the theory and your material. Only focus deeper when you need to.\n\n**If you need a different perspective:**\n\nBeginners in art require a lot of quantity to produce quality, and as they get more reps, the more quality becomes important. Starting with only one painting that they focus all their quality on often stunts their progress compared to those who've done a healthy mix of both. You're focusing way too much on quality. Lean more towards quantity for now.\n\nProgramming is solving problems by building solutions, like a trade. You need to build a lot of projects to get better at programming so you have something to tether theory to. Learn what you need to build those projects and occasionally a step beyond, and that experience will reinforce the times you dig deeper.\n\nYou *can* focus a lot on theory to make *learning how to build projects* a smoother process, but theory isn't the thing that makes you a programmer. Just like how knowing the properties of a hammer, how to make sandpaper, and different types of trees doesn't make a carpenter learn how to build a house, memorizing every definition, theory, syntax, etc, isn't going to be the thing that makes you learn how to build a program.\n\nYou actually only need very basic theory to start building programs, just like a carpenter can start building incredible things with a hammer, nails, wood, and a saw. Keep to your priorities, as you'll likely be hired as a programmer, not a computer scientist. \n\nWith that said, **chase the fun**.\n\nI actually enjoy digging into things and learning theory/CS concepts, so I like to mainly do that with little bits of project-building sprinkled in. That's severely limiting the speed of my growth as a programmer, but it's what keeps me interested in programming in the first place. It sounds like you're the opposite of me as you're getting overwhelmed, so chase what's fun for you.",

Most beginners get stuck because they jump from syntax straight into “real projects” without actually learning how to think through problems yet.\n\nWhat helped me early on was treating it like leveling in a game. First, get comfortable solving tiny problems on your own, not with speed, just with clarity. Things like loops, conditions, arrays, and functions should feel boring before you move on. Once that foundation stops feeling heavy, start recreating small tools you already understand: a calculator, a todo list, a simple CLI game, anything where the logic is familiar. That’s where your brain starts connecting the dots between “writing code” and “building something.”\n\nLeetCode and the competitive stuff makes more sense *after* you’ve built a handful of small projects and can reason through the steps of a problem without panicking. And choosing what to build becomes easier once you’ve stumbled through a few mini-projects and noticed what feels fun to you vs. what frustrates you.\n\nYou're not behind....you’re just at the stage where the real learning starts. Keep the momentum and focus on understanding, not rushing. The speed comes later.",

Always an element of awkward timing with things like this. Maybe the external service should be idempotent so that it can be notified again without causing issue. If we don't control that, then depending on how we know that the external service has been notified (e.g. response, webhook etc.) we could enqueue the state update then, which retries until it succeeds. Or we could hold open and append to a write-ahead log which is usually very fast, then reconcile later. All sorts of possibilities.\n\nI haven't seen the setup of course, but my thinking was that the previous (Received?) state + presence of a state update task in the job queue (which can only happen on receipt of confirmation of notification from the external service) is enough info not to re-send the notification, else the state change has succeeded so you wouldn't anyway. A separate flag or an extra state could be used too. Definitely no need for \"sub\" states (within states).",

They don't care.\n\nOne way would be to review their code and to ask questions about their code. Try to understand. Get them to react. As long as you keep a positive learning attitude, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nLet's mention the \"good code\" part. What is good code? Code that works? Code that achieve high quality? Medium quality? Where do we draw the line here? The threshold is set by the reviewer/company. This is an idea. For some good code is just what works. For other there needs to be tests. For others it requires maintainability.\n\nWe have a bunch of best practices and guidelines to follow to help you do better code (solid, dry, kiss, DDD, hexa/clean...). A lot of opinions on what works and what don't. And knowing what fits or not is generally a matter of experience more than knowledge.\n\nNow, if people at your company are not helping you in any way, I doubt you can think of yourself as an intern (whatever the title). An intern must be managed and led by someone. So if you ask questions and don't get answers, get ignored and such... You are solo. So make the most for yourself.",

Make a function that contains exactly the amount of complexity that you brain can handle, give it a clear name that describes what it does, test that it works, and then never think about how it works again. Use that function in other functions. You don't WANT to store a whole lot of logic in your working memory. You want to reduce the amount of logic you need to think about at one time by creating fewer, fatter units of logic that you can think about instead.",

During my first master's degree, I noticed that I had lost my ability to manipulate things in my mind and got back to chess for that reason. It improved significantly for things outside of chess. I'm not saying you should start practicing calculation in chess, I'm just saying that this is trainable, so it will come over time.  \n\n> My workaround is to comment the hell out of everything, for example \"// 'r' now contains a pointer to 'rects_' from rect_packer which has x, y, h, w, etc. data\" because even though it's so obvious at the time when I come back to it in a couple hours or a couple days I have to click through all the files again just to re-understand what is doing what.   \n\nYou should have better variable name then. The variable, function and method names should ideally be clear enough that you can read the code and understand what it does, what each thing contains.  \n\n> To hopefully improve this ability I'm working on the Trachtenberg method and doing 3x3 digit multiplication which seriously over clocks my mental CPU but I can manage, however I'm not sure if there is something better I can do to improve the \"concurrent logic buffer\" size in my head.   \n\nI don't know this method nor its goal. But if you are doing it just for the reasons mentioned in this topic, it's a waste of time imo.  \n- Be more dilligent with your variable names and code structure. Do not hesitate to break down things into smaller functions that you reuse (one benefit of a very small function is that you can wrap a few lines of code into a single function call. That function name can then be explicit about what that part does, making the whole code more readable).  \n- Things will come with practice. Don't think of yourself as unable, or dumb, or whatever. It will come, just keep practicing and learning and doing, make your own life easy when you can (for example, good variable names, again, is a way to make your life easy). You're fine and you'll be fine.",

When you say you look up documentation for JavaScript, are you talking about looking up DOM APIs like addEventListener, querySelectorAll, and so on? None of those are actually part of JavaScript, they're part of the web platform which has tens of thousands of JavaScript APIs. Or if you're on the backend then you've got the thousands of APIs in Node.js, Express.js, and whatever else you're using on the server side.\n\nSo if your JS code is using the web platform or Node.js but your C program is \"pure C\" that just reads and writes files, for example, then it's not a fair comparison.\n\nI'll bet that if you write C code for a Linux kernel driver, or a GTK+ or Win32 GUI application, for example, you'd look up documentation just as much as when you write JavaScript.",

In either case, you're going to have to have threads wait on each other to catch up before continuing.\n\nAs for what \"synchronizing threads\" means, it means what it does on the tin. Threads don't run at consistent speeds, and they run independently of eachother. This means when you run two threads, the order they finish in can vary at run time, which can be bad if one relies on the result of the other to do its job. This can also result in two threads using the same resource at the same time, even when they shouldn't - imagine two people being able to book the same seat at a movie theatre because they both clicked \"book\" at the same time.\n\nTo synchronize threads, you give them a way to communicate, and that's where Mutexes & Semephores come in.\n\nMutexes are a shared resource that can either be \"locked\" or \"unlocked\" at any given time. If you wanna use it, you have to lock it so no one else can use it. You also have to unlock it before moving on lest you fuck everyone up.\n\nSemephores meanwhile are kind of like hall passes, where mutliple threads can use the semephore at the same time, up to a threshhold; useful less for strict ordering, and more making sure multiple types of thread (ones that involve heavy processing for example) aren't running at the same time, gumming everything up to a standstill.",

Then lower it by half of the increase until it is a problem. EG, the current value of X is 16 and it works. The last value was 8. Make x (16+8)/2=12. Now its too fast so make x (12+16)/2=14.

There's gotta be a tipping point where engineers on the whole get sufficiently pissed off and start fighting back by unionizing, staging walkouts, etc. Whatever it takes to get some power back aside from \"well maybe the market will be better next year, fingers crossed\".\n\n\nIt'll be interesting to see just how far companies push the idea that AI efficiency gains enable lower engineer headcounts. How low can it go?",

Because they’re usually working with patients, working with a computer sounds much “easier”. And to a certain extent it is, I never want to be hands-on to save someone’s life, fuuuuck that. Also, hospital office politics tend to be really bad. In our industry, sometimes people move up or away and take their shitty behavior/patterns with them. In healthcare, that shit is set in stone. People stay a long time and power structures rarely change.      \n   \nHowever, they don’t understand how competitive and mercenary-like our industry is. Annual industry-wide layoffs for no reason at all. Offshoring. Widespread age discrimination. PIP and up-or-out culture. Immense pressure to show impact or be cut. Ridiculous multi-round leetcode hiring process. Constantly learning or else the industry will leave you behind.   \nSo our working conditions are relatively more relaxed, our industry is the complete opposite. We have 0 job security.   \n   \nDon’t get me wrong, I am happy I choose this career. I make good money and work from home so no one will cry for me.

Most of my coworkers were previously systems analysts at a competitor company, so I assume that's a similar role.\n\nBasically look for roles for techy people that aren't necessarily programmer roles.

So learn the basis of Azure, AWS, or GCP to the standard that a dev is expected to. You don’t need to go super into the weeds, but get an understanding of CICD Pipelines, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.\n\nThis is pretty much the bare minimum knowledge for devs with a few years experience nowadays at least for web devs.\n\nDo that then study some system design methods (neetcode has videos for it as well as leetcode) and a few DSA questions. Don’t go too overboard on it though like many here will, if you aren’t trying to crack Big Tech, a good chunk of companies don’t even ask leetcode.\n\nFrom there just apply and hope for the best, the market is as good as it was 3-4 years ago.\n\nEdit:\n\nBiggest thing is probably to not ask this sub for advice, it’s full of unemployed people, students, and sky is falling doomers that can’t see what their weaknesses are",

They begin profit maxxing and cost cutting\n5. Around this time, the veterans from step 2 start to get pushed out or move on \n6. Business people squeeze the last dollar out of the product and everyone just kinda hates it now. It’s stale\n7. Business people get frustrated as they can’t make money. They leave. \n8. Thing falls back into relative obscurity for some time\n9. Go back to step 1\n\nExample: Pixar. Bunch of people make a 3d animated film, first of its kind. Then business starts inserting itself and the movies quality begins to get worse (after around wall-e I’d say). Right now animation in general is on the upswing and I think we’ll see more good American animation soon",

Maybe some specialist engineers make a ton of money but the majority make a fairly middle class amount of money. \n\nAs others have pointed out the biggest issue right now is in the US and perhaps some other well to do countries where everything is expensive software engineers want to be upper middle class if not straight upper class compensation. But their job is also incredibly easy to have done anywhere else in the world and the rest of the world now has reasonably talented programmers unlike a few years ago where there was a significant skill gap in most cases. As such why would you ever pay someone 160k or something like that, when you could pay 15/hr instead? Its basic math. Do I think US based SEs will start having to be paid 15/hr? No. But I do think they will have to meet people in the middle somewhere.",

Neural networks don't scale very well, and the explosion in their usage from 2010 onwards was basically only enabled by improvements to GPU hardware.\n\n\nThose improvements have plateau'd, both due to shortages of silicon, and due to how little headroom there is to make hardware breakthroughs at the moment. We've basically hit the point of diminishing returns for the everyday consumer and for business use of LLMs and GPT systems.\n\n\nWith that in mind, I can't predict the future, but for the time being, LLMs and GPT systems are *a convenient excuse* for the layoffs required in the post-COVID recession conditions. Businesses don't like to scare their shareholders and stakeholders by saying \"the market sucks and we shrunk\", so they spin it as \"we adopted AI, so the 40% reduction in forces is actually 40% efficiency!!!\" LLMs and GPT systems also took off right when crypto startups needed an exit plan and a way to unload *thousands* of GPUs.\n\n\nSo you'll need to prepare to job-hunt in a very large recession, and the AI / ML sector is currently experiencing a hype bubble. Obviously, some of that hype is totally valid -- they are fantastic at classification problems that don't have formalized training sets. But, a lot of the hype is business people and end users not quite understanding the shell game going on. And there's plenty of grifting because people think they'll be able to sell their \"bottle imp\" before it's too late. LLMs and GPT systems will remain, and they're *really* cool. But not $10B+/year cool, and in 10 years it's **astounding that they are no closer to AGI than when they began promising it \"next year\"**.\n\n\nAs a new grad, you'll need to keep yourself sharp until you get your first role in the industry. And when you do, **have a backup plan because juniors are the first staff to be laid off when money gets tight**. Don't be too proud to find part-time jobs to pay the bills for the year or two finding CS jobs can take in a competitive market.",

There really hasn't been anything new in the software world (outside of Gen AI) in quite a while, and what has been done before is quickly becoming so saturated, that there's not a whole lot of reason to make more of it. Software has eaten the world, but it turns out the world was not as big of a meal as what was once thought.\n\nFor example, you see posts like \"wow Gemini 3 can make a threejs game!\" or \"look at this fancy UI GPT-5 made!\" and they are for sure impressive if you are completely unaware of how commonplace it is for people to make stuff like that since well before generative AI took off.\n\nLook at [Deepmind's game examples](https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind/playables) on Youtube, you have:\n\n1. A very basic dungeon crawler in threejs\n2. A starfox-like\n3. A subway surfer clone with a pirate theme\n4. Astroids\n5. A space invaders clone\n\nAll of which are impressive if you've never made them and have no clue how to, but none of which are new or innovative. People have no new ideas and AI is exacerbating that issue because if it has been done before, eventually an AI can be trained on the output and imitate it.",

For data analysis, focus on understanding the business needs and how to interpret that data to assist in that (which is essentially the point of your dashboards in the first place).",

Hell, I was.\n\nBut remember, graduating with a CS degree equips you with a tool belt that goes much further than just being able to write some JavaScript. Unfortunately we can’t all be on here posting about how our big name company is giving us 225k a year or whatever. BUT! You are definitely still employable.\n\nTo my new grads out here losing hope: the outlook may be discouraging but the tough people outlast tough times. There is a lot of crazy stuff happening in the world right now that unfortunately does affect the current parameters of your situation, but these are temporary circumstances. Remember, your degree is literally based on problem solving.\n\nMy last suggestion is to open your horizons a bit, which I’m sure you’ve done already. There are a lot of companies that aren’t specifically the “big names” we see here, but are big names in their own industry. This is also how you find some neat niches to grow your specialities in. Right now, you should be open to anything. You just want your foot in the door— any door. Except for doors with red flags. Always run from those. GIS is a really cool industry that never gets talked about on the main stage. Do with that information what you will.\n\nNEVER GIVE UP!",

But I understand that’s not even the TC so it’s not really a 1:1 but is there a way to know the min I would be offered without actually seeing the offer?\n\nIt depends on what you're trying to maximize for.  You can absolutely just say \"I won't accept less than $160k\" and filter out opportunities this way... the downside is if they actually were willing to pay $200k you might have unwittingly lowballed yourself (after all, if you're happy with 160, they can just offer you that or a bit more).  But the upside is you don't waste your time if they're actually only willing to pay $120k.  Revealing nothing on your end first lets you maximize the possible offer but at the cost of maybe wasting your time.\n\nIf the range is big you could also ask something like \"what's the difference between a $130k candidate and a $200k candidate?\"  Usually if it's that big it has something to do with leveling.",

Do you think you're 10% better than what the job description is asking for? Maybe the JD asks for 3 yoe and you have 4. Maybe the JD says \"remote anywhere in the US\" and you live in San Francisco so you would expect to earn above average. Maybe you worked at FAANG and the job posting is at a smaller company that won't get a lot of FAANG applicants. In this case, sure, expecting to earn above 145k is totally reasonable.",

There is lost time people could be doing real work. Online assessments cost money. They have no real reason to give anyone benefit of the doubt, especially when they have tons of candidates. \n\nYou have to remember there is an imperfect human being on the other end.

Choose this if you think the specific project they are doing will be really good experience to get you the next role in 2 years. Don't worry about being a job hopper, all a recruiter/hiring manager needs to hear is \"I'm looking for a company to settle at long term\" to clear that up.\n\nOption 2 sounds good if you have enough knowledge and experience to handle that environment, or don't mind attempting to learn it. If the tech side of the company is just starting that also presumably means they will hire other engineers soon-ish too? And of course consider if you think this work experieence would be better for a potential next future role after this (even if its 5+ years later). Would you mind sharing the company name in DM?",

If tech culture just keeps putting big tech on a pedestal then we might as well call the field dead because a vibrant and aggressive upstart small to midsize market is what drives demand.

They can't tell what's impressive and what isn't, so they default to assuming it's all entry-level. Mention the most advanced courses, but cut things like \"Computer Science I/II\". A short list of courses that sound more impressive is better.\n\nThe skills section needs serious trimming. That LeetCode level notation doesn't mean anything to most hiring managers. It's not an industry standard, and honestly it reads like you're trying too hard to quantify something that your GitHub and projects should already demonstrate. Same with the soft skills list. Saying you have \"time management\" is meaningless when you could just show it by describing how you delivered a complex medical AI tool with proper NLP pipelines and error detection.\n\nYour language list is creating a credibility problem. Eleven languages including VB and Prolog makes it look like you've dabbled in everything but mastered nothing. Recruiters know that's not realistic for someone graduating in 2026. You'd be better off splitting this into \"proficient\" (languages you've used in substantial projects) and \"familiar\" (things you've learned but haven't built much with). Don't bother listing languages where you're only familar that are unlikely to be relevant for the types of jobs you're pursuing to keep the length reasonable. That honesty will make you look more competent.\n\nThe Task Scheduler project is actively hurting you. Your first two projects demonstrate real engineering thinking; then you list a project whose features are \"arrays, scanners, and conditional statements.\" That's literally week-three CS101 material. Removing it entirely would strengthen your resume by raising the average quality of what you're showing.\n\nYour game project description has a weird gap. You did a great job explaining the design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy), which shows architectural thinking, but you completely forgot to mention what you built it in. Unity with C#? Unreal with C++? Custom engine? The tech stack matters way more to a hiring manager than knowing it was inspired by backrooms-style horror games.\n\nMore generally, every bullet point should pass this test: would a junior developer find this impressive, or would they think \"yeah, that's just normal programming\"? If it's the latter, cut it. Your resume should show the ceiling of what you can do, not document every step of your learning process. \n\nYou'll have a bit more empty space, but that's better than getting mentally downgraded for a bad relevant to irrelevant ratio or preventing the reader's eye from catching the important parts in the 10ish seconds they're going to skim it.",

        "body": "Informally, calculus is the study of how functions' outputs change, both locally and globally, when you change the input. In terms of direct applications in CS, standard examples include:\n\n1. Determining the numerical sensitivity of an algorithm or function to small floating point perturbations. This would include, notably, numerical linear algebra, which underpins all statistical and machine-learning oriented algorithms.\n2. Optimization algorithms, in which you study how to find the minimum solution to some equation and/or constraints by using calculus. Would be useful in any industrial engineering-type software.\n3. Classical Big-O notation, which describes growth rates as a function of input size. Useful for understanding whether your algorithms are prohibitively expensive when scaled up.\n4. Simulation of physical motion or physical behaviors, as used in computer graphics and visualization, scientific computing, signal processing and other similar physics-oriented domains.\n\nIn summary, I would say that calculus does indeed play a foundational role in the study of many core CS algorithmic domains. Note that these algorithmic domains don't necessarily have a lot of overlap with the kind of work you might do in industry, unless you're working on cutting edge stuff. But nonetheless if we're strictly talking about computer science as an academic subject, then absolutely yes calculus plays a role.\n\nHowever, if you're talking about very specific techniques in calculus like how to compute certain integrals by various substitutions or other random stuff like that, then no, those skills are mostly ways for students to exercise their quantitative and mental reasoning while learning the concepts.",

From my opinion, it’s only really worth it if you can make significantly high salary, such that you can buy your way out of American problems. This is significantly harder for someone with a family, as your expenses will be higher and you will be impacted by more specific issues than someone who is single (Schools, Health care costs, etc). Even in a lower cost region like Baltimore, I wouldn’t move for anything less than 100-300% salary increase over your Canadian salary. \n\nIf you’re really committed to this \n\n- Don’t focus on the L1-B visa, Consider TN. Apply externally to jobs in cities with tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle). With your YOE you should be able to get some decent high paying jobs (200k-400k). These should pay enough for you to support your family with 1 income; so even if your spouse can’t secure a visa, it’s still manageable. \n- Plan for potential private school expenses. Public education varies based on where you live, so either plan on paying more rent in a high income area or paying for private. \n- Plan for a short stay. Both L1B and TN are employer tied. So you WILL (not maybe) eventually find yourself having to come back to canada quickly if your employment ends. \n- The tech market is tough right now, but from what I’ve seen it’s still pretty competitive for senior level roles. \n\n\nTbh, \n\nConsider moving within Canada. There are definitely senior level jobs in Canada that pay way more than 100k, you may just have to move to Toronto or Vancouver. Also, 100k CAD seems low for senior even for Canada.",

What matters more is being comfortable with the tools, understanding the concepts, and having a few solid projects that prove you can actually do the work.\n\nThe market is rough right now, so having something structured behind your transition can make a difference. I’m doing a master’s in a tech field for that reason. It’s not required, but it helps add credibility when you’re coming from a non-technical major.\n\nSelf-learning absolutely isn’t a waste of time.

Every vibe coder's a gangster until their project reaches the kind of complexity where the LLM is incapable of doing anything other than looping through the same sloppy \"solutions\" that cause different errors. And then what? Now they're stuck (often with a pile of tech debt) because they never built the experience needed to move forward without the model holding their hand.\n\nAnyone who's actually built software knows that the last 10 percent of a project can take just as long to build as the first 90 percent of it. By outsourcing all the thinking to an LLM, especially without understanding the code being written, you're setting yourself up for failure when the model inevitably hits its limits. And good luck telling your client that the feature they'd like added or the bug that needs fixing can't be done because ChatGPT doesn't understand its own code.",

It was a HUGE issue for them but to me and my company it was not a big deal. Yes a bug but a minor one only effecting 1 small client, had a work around and the same client refused to listen to us and we told them multiple times done do what they were doing.  In this case dont make that list of cost codes as big as you are doing it.  Our system could not handle 60-70k. It was designed with most being 3-4k and could handle 10-20k but at 60-70k it really starting struggling and even crashing.

You know beforehand and you call them out when you see them coming. Giving stakeholders a heads up is good. No heads up when people are counting on you is really bad.\n\nIn general though it sounds like you just need to spend some time so be sure to get AI to summarize docs for you and help you with coding as well. This will limit the number of surprises but surprises always happen. If you never hit surprises then the scope of your work isn’t big enough for you and you’re ready for more challenging work. Not communicating changes in assumptions and no requirements that were found would be a problem but people will give some leeway to new developments that were discovered. \n\nProd issues? Everyone makes these mistakes. I caused one a few months back and even the most senior members of my team have done this too. Again if you haven’t done this then you haven’t worked enough or the scope of your work is too little. It happens to everyone. For these take charge and learn from them. Everyone makes these mistakes and can learn from them. \n\nI’m a manager turned IC again and I can say this: you want a good relationship with your manager too so play the political game. The manager is generally on your side because if you do well so does the manager. A lot of these issues can be communicated with the manager to help unblock you. \n\nCan’t give estimates right away? Yeah no one really can unless they’re super familiar with the subject matter. When your work becomes more ambiguous as your level goes up these can be more difficult. What I do is I give a large estimate (adding to my current estimate) or tell the people involved when I can provide an estimate and why I can’t I do it now.",

Or just build a recursive descent parser.\n\n\nMost engineers these days will do a half-assed solution with regex that won't handle a lot of corner-cases. Or they'll write some stupid fragile DSL that will be destroying productivity on the team years after they leave. This sort of thing leads to security issues on the internet on a daily basis.\n\n\nI've been doing a personal project with [boost::spirit::x3](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/libs/spirit/doc/x3/html/index.html) to automate generation of cereal serialization functions, python and emscripten APIs for C++ code and once you get over the gratuitous operator overloading abuse common in many boost libraries, it's really nice to use. So at least on C/C++ projects, there really is no excuse to reach for a regex when you could rattle off a small and well-tested parser instead.\n\n\nemscripten is pretty nifty too. Someone compiled imgui to webasm with emscripten so you can just run your gui [in your browser.](https://www.dearimgui.com/webdemo/master/example_emscripten.html)",

I was applying to 5-20 places nearly every day while also working on projects. It may not seem like I was sending out a ton of apps, but I decided to not use A.I. and I also live in Oklahoma (not really a bastion of opportunities with regards to tech).\n\nWhen I finally gave up, I started looking elsewhere and I quickly I landed a job in finance working on mortgages. It obviously isn't my dream job, but I took enough mathematics classes that they figured I was worth the risk and could learn finance efficiently. My pay isn't terrible either\n\nYou can always pivot. I know a few other computer science grads that pivoted to finance when they realized finding a tech job was going to be nearly impossible in their area.",

She was able to negotiate relocation with them, and it all worked out fine. It’s definitely possible. Heart goes out to you though, this market is so hard rn.",

The business stance is that code doesn't have to be pretty, code has to get the job done. And a working project that looks like shit now is pretty much always worth much more than a promised project in the future whose only differentiating feature is that it \"looks better\", \"will be more maintainable\" or \"doesn't carry the same technical debt\" (Spoiler alert, it will carry about the same technical debt.)\n\n\nWant to improve your designs without introducing [YAGNI](https://wiki.c2.com/?YouArentGonnaNeedIt) violations? I've found that [test driven development](https://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment) or at the very least development where you write a method or two in your classes (assuming you're an OO shop) and then write some tests to test them will highlight deficiencies in your design without you designing a bunch of extra stuff you're never going to need. If you find yourself with some down time, you can also go back and write tests for older code if it's possible to do so. A lot of the time older code is heavily coupled and can't really be used outside its existing context, so it can be difficult to do that.\n\n\nIdentifying pain points to fix when you have some refactoring time can also be helpful. You can often clean up a bit around code you're working on without it taking too much more time and without impacting a huge amount of the code base. Incrementally improving quality of the code is a lot easier to pitch to management than throwing the entire code base out and starting from scratch. That's another thing that junior level programmers often want to do, generally before they've even had a chance to understand the code base as a whole.",

At a time when I should be becoming more senior in my career and settling into a company I'm currently left unemployed and having a hard time fighting the feeling of burnout and lack of motivation. AI has slightly compounded those feelings.\n\nI have a good feeling I'll make it through and land an amazing job somewhere that I'll love and grow in but right now being unemployed kind of sucks. I think it's pretty typical for developers to go through layoffs as the field moves pretty quickly and developers need down time to brush up on their skills and stay current but I just can't find the motivation to do that at the moment. \n\nI've been in that six month employment window where you're still being judged by management and your colleagues. If you go into a role burnt out you're not going to make a good impression, in all likelyhood you're probably just going through some type of burnout.\n\nId try as best as you can to get plenty of sleep and go outside for walks, maybe some more rigorous exercise like biking or hiking if you can. Stay away from technology for a few weeks or maybe months and then come back to it with some fresh perspectives.\n\nThis is also why managing your money well as a developer is so important because you never know when you'll need to rely on your savings, it's just a very common thing to be laid off in this profession. Hopefully the market stabilizes soon but who knows what's down the pipeline with the addition of AI",

There are mass layoffs despite wildly successful quarterly results. People are clearly working harder and longer than ever despite AI \"efficiency gains\". In a recent on-site interview, the SVP of the company (a fairly successful series B startup) told me he believes 100% of code will be written by AI. I said maybe 90% just to at least sound like I'm playing along a bit, and said AI need human reviews and verification. He didn't seem to buy that and asked me why he'd trust my code over an AI's code. That left me speechless and not particularly amused.\n\n\nThe whole career just feels hollow now.

When I got an offer, the requested start date was less than a month before the planned bonus payout date. \n\nIn my case, the problem was that while my employer had paid out bonuses transparently in the past, the new owners offered no visibility into what they would do with bonuses, and based on every other aspect of their management of the company since their acquisition, I had every reason to believe that they might shaft the employees. \n\nAfter accepting the offer, I brought up this dilemma with the hiring manager. He would wait a few weeks if he had to, but of course, he emphasized that he needed me ASAP. Ultimately, I decided I had to look forward and accepted the start date before the bonus payout. My previous employer did end up paying a decent bonus that I missed out on.\n\nI've been at this job for two years now, and in my opinion, there was no actual rush where a few weeks would have mattered, but as soon as I mentioned it to the hiring manager, I realized that it was now a test of my commitment to the new job. In hindsight, I should have just lied and made up some excuse about why I couldn't start until the payout date.\n\nRegardless of the specifics of my experience, my advice is to look forward.",

I only completed the first two, and they skipped the final step and moved me forward anyway.\n\nYour English seems fine; they might have legitimately decided that if your spoken English was as good as it was, that your written English would be up to par.\n\nI find it far more worrying that 2/3 of the process are focusing on something that should be mostly irrelevant.\n\n>I started as *Software Engineer*. Then later they said I might be placed into front-end. Then they said they do front-end, DevOps, software engineering, etc. and **they** will decide which department I'm going into. They literally told me **\"you have no choice\".**\n\nThat's fair, I suppose. The company has open positions to fill, they decide where they want you to be. You are free to accept or to walk away. Not nearly every company is like google, where they need so many people that there can be a degree of choice, and an entire matching process.\n\nAnd it is not uncommon, especially at the beginning of a career, that they will see strengths and weaknesses in you that might not align with what you imagine yourself doing.\n\nBut rejecting an offer is a perfectly fine choice.\n\n>4. **The salary dropped mid-process.**\n\nThat is outright terrible.\n\nEspecially if they are not certain of the role they are going to offer you.\n\n>They keep mentioning 5-month training period, but they haven't explained what exactly it includes, how it works, or what kind of guarantee (if any) there is afterward.\n\nAnd this is where it starts to sound like a scam to me.\n\nIf they don't have a precise role, how can they have a training program?\n\n>6. **They want my passport, social card, and bank account details before showing a contract.**\n\nI don't know where you're from, and what is usual there. Nobody in what is widely considered \"the western world\" would think that is normal or acceptable. This is where I would start to run for the nearest exist - but maybe you live in some dystopian hell hole where this is what employers do. You have my sympathies.\n\n>Everything combined makes me unsure whether this is normal or a big red flag.\n\nBig red flag. I just can't tell if it says bad things about your country, or just this company. Ask someone local to you.",
