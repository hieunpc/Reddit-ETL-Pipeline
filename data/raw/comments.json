If nothing broke you would still be doing work but it shifts to boring preventative stuff. Data contracts. Upstream alignment. Cost control. Schema evolution. Access rules. Quality checks before anyone screams. \n\nThat work is harder to explain to managers so it gets undervalued. Mature teams stop celebrating hero fixes and start measuring how quiet things are. Some teams make that visible with domo dashboards. Others track it through snowflake usage or monte carlo alerts. Same idea. Prevention not firefighting.",

        "body": "I choose for Data Engineering pretty early in my career and I'm very happy I did so.\n\nWhen you're a Data Scientist, one of your key goals is to extract meaning from data. You run models and try to get insights. It is very often the case though that the data either doesn't show what you would like, or it kind of does, but with pretty low certainty. Even more often the data is so bad that you couldn't really draw any conclusions from it.\n\nThis puts you in a bind. You have to go explain your conclusions to the sales guys and they can't work with 'it sort of shows X, but also kind of Y'. They need to sell a product and they will. So they'll massage your conclusions in ways that you might even not agree with. Or you'll be pressured to massage the data, which I've been asked to do. I always covered my ass with emails although I luckily never needed them.\n\nAs a Data Engineer on the other hand, there is no discussion. Either the data is in the required spot in the required form or it isn't. At the end of the day, your product is finished and whether or not someone can actually do anything with it downstream is not your concern. It's a very liberating feeling and it means I have barely any stress related to work.\n\nI'm not the only person I've encountered who feels similarly and I've even met a few Data Scientists who made a similar switch later in their career for similar reasons.\n\nAnother saving grace is that Data Scientists are a dime in a dozen nowadays. With the AI boom everyone and their cat tried to get some certification somewhere and the quality varies wildly. Data engineering isn't as sexy and there's much fewer people in the field I have the impression. I started before the AI boom, so having seniority at this point in time is very helpful as well.",

I naturally gravitated towards technical specifications and engineering solutions.  I was interested in maths, but having done some statistics courses, it wasn’t a mountain I wanted to climb.\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t over think it.  People swap between DS and DE all the time.  A large company will probably help you transition, pay for training etc because they know there is a great deal of synergy between these teams.  ie.  DE’s will productionise DS models so knowing both sides isn’t a waste of time.\n\nWhere I currently work, DS is seen as a ‘luxury’.  They will increase headcount when times are good, and conversely, DS’s are the first people out the door when times are bad.  This is because they generally work on ‘optimisations’, I guess just like how you would pause remodelling your house if you lost your job and didn’t have income coming in.  DE on the other hand is much more stable.  They need people to keep existing pipelines running, even if new things aren’t being built.  It was how I ended up in DE, I was made redundant as a DS but told I could stay on if I switched teams.  I thought I’d do this while I searched for a new DS position, but I found my proclivities more suited to DE, so never left and never thought about switching back.\n\nGenerally the people who make the best DE’s have done Computer Science or Engineering degrees that involve data transfers like Telecoms.  The people who make the best DS’s have done Science or Mathematics degrees.  Maybe start out in the field where your degree gives you the best foundations?  Otherwise it will be an uphill struggle to get timely promotions.  Make a start and see how you go.",

Lot of A/B tests to see what works and what does not. Something could sound efficient on paper but not as much in business. Experimentation is important in data science.\n\n- Less focus on infrastructure as a data scientist. ML ops or data ops takes care of it most times.\n\n- Accuracy is important in data engineering.

I’m assuming by mid-level you mean a title like senior data engineer in my response.\n\nThis is the arguably the hardest point in your career to progress. As many point out you can go IC or PL route. PL route tends to make a higher bonus but you can still make very good money as IC so both are viable paths. I know many engineers who have stayed at the level you are at their entire career. Only a few percent move up from here. This is because a new set of skills are required. You are no longer just coding 8 hours per day. This looks different depending on the company size but these roles are responsible for architecting solutions and leading others in the solution implementation. I do both in my role on a smaller team but often these are split into a Principal Architect and a Manager role.\n\nSo to move into these roles you need to demonstrate you can architect solutions and lead others via your work experience. Unfortunately almost no one will tell you that simply doing great work in your role doesn’t make you eligible for a promotion to the next one. Unless you demonstrate the skills required for the next level you will not even be viewed as a viable candidate by others. In practice this usually looks like partnering with business stakeholders to define a problem or need, designing a solution that addresses that problem or need, and organizing a team of engineers to deliver this solution. As a manager I could complete all the work which I delegate myself but instead I focus on turning business requirements into tasks, delegating those tasks to our engineers, and filling knowledge gaps so the engineers can complete the work.\n\nI could keep going here but I think I’ve made the main point. You must proactively make the choice to stop spending 100% of your time implementing and spend some of it addressing these other requirements. Then you will get noticed for promotions or for external job openings.",

Leading projects, owning roadmaps, or being the person who explains tradeoffs to non technical folks can change how you’re perceived pretty quickly. Consulting can be a fit if you enjoy ambiguity and communication, but it’s a different lifestyle. I’d test the strategic side inside your current world before making a big reset.",

If it generates enough business value that you'd carry on (perhaps putting in place a migration plan) - then it's probably fine as a choice. If you're so cost sensitive that a small rise in costs would cause problems, then it's probably not the right choice.\n\nGenerally being heavily invested into Snowflake doesn't concern me too much. Most of the transformation logic is SQL. Unlike say python, or a lot of proprietary solutions SQL code written today will still be good in 20 years time. There aren't any libraries to end up unmaintained. If you *really* need to you can port to another database technology and most of your transformations will port over perfectly. You might need to spin up a solution for tasks, and change your ingestion methodology, but all that business logic will be fine still.\n\nUnless you go completely open source, and want to take on board the substantial overhead with doing that, I'd say it's pretty good value. Vendor lock in mainly comes from the fact that it's really good, rather than vendor lock in from being proprietary. Very little of it is highly proprietary unlike a lot of other ETL methodologies.\n\nWhy aren't you at least using internal stages? There's far less overhead in using COPY INTO vs INSERT unless you're inserting a trivial amount of data. External stages and pipes even less overhead and cost.",

        "body": "SCD2 is built into the table schema, the code base is based on Merge or UpSert + delete tracking.\n\nI suggest you look at \"Timestamp\" column type if available on your platform, or look into MD5() function which is quite universal, to do \"hashing\" of data, and use a staging layer.\n\nWhen you design properly a SCD2 table in a bronze layer, and have a staging layer in a \"raw\" layer (you should always have a staging layer!) - then a SQL view with the hashed values (the PK columns, the entire data row) then SCD2 becomes a breeze to do. Breeze because you compare two tables, you have one PK column and one HashDIFF column (or TimeStamp from a source DB) that tells you easily what to do.\n\nOften it is deletion tracking the most difficult - because if you get differential data, how do you know what no longer exists in source? In such cases you need an extra pipeline logic just for delete tracking. Mentioning as this is often overlooked and it comes back to bite you at the end.\n\nFor example, you load new data (from a full source or differential source) truncate/load into a staging table. Make a view to create all the extra columns you need, like using MD5() in the view. Use the staging view to do the UpSerts or Merge based on your bronze layer SCD2 historical table and the staging. \n\nFor delete tracking sometimes you need a new pipeline to get a full from source but only the PK column(s), not all the columns, so the file is smaller and the process is quicker. I use a different staging table, a different pipeline, just for this. Or if you are lucky, you can get CDC from source DB and then you have 100% of all changes. If only we had this all the time.\n\nSo basically you read the same data twice, the first time the data are usually files in a datalake or a file share, but it could also be a remote database that you ODBC / OleDB into to run a query. This is usually for on-prem, but I have used ODBC + MySQL remote DBs to gather info, it works really well, and no ELT/ETL tool required - it's all SQL in a stored proc.\n\nSome people create in the staging table all the extra fields to manage for SCD2 and the tool they use to consume the raw data into staging, adds the values to the extra fields, row-by-row. I do NOT like this method, as it puts intelligence inside the ELT/ETL tool making it difficult to manage. An ELT/ETL tool should be simple, just do mapping, Lift & Shift, ideally never fail - just get the data to staging table(s) and let the next level deal with issues. CSV is hell on earth, I use the BLOB technique on foreign CSV files and parse with SQL.\n\nFWIW, this topic (SCD2, 3, 4, hybrid...) is taught in actual classes world wide, maybe look into taking some basic ETL/ELT & BI courses, at least Udemy. My first SCD2 table I did back in 1998 - just to give you an idea on how old this logic is, the actual invention I don't know who - but probably Kimball in the 90's. I had a great database teacher that was ahead of  his time.",

The first thing I prototype is the semantic model with a few top level KPIs and whatever is the minimum that allows them to engage with that. Usually connecting the semantic model to Excel does the trick, otherwise a bare-bones dashboard that displays just an auditable view of the KPI.\n\n\nIt's tempting to skip the data work and go straight to the dashboarding because it feels more agile to get the bells and whistles delivered, but ultimately it costs more in rework and burned credibility and clarity that it saves. It might feel heavy and unrealistic to do the modelling early, but that's because you're caught in the sugar rush of delivering good-looking, quick, but ultimately poor solutions.",

By doing this pattern you have a clear reference to every parent model you are using at the top of your model.\n\nYou then perform the transformation steps, including the joining of those referenced tables as the next cte (or several ctes depending on complexity).\n\nThen you read directly out of your last cte - preferably with little transformation in the final step.\n\nAll of this is to make things as readable and organised as possible.\n\nIf you were to start transforming each source in the initial cte, you wouldnt be reading a simple, single line bringing it in to the current model, but reading more complex transformations that you would need to spend more time figuring out what that piece was doing and where it began and ended.\n\nEdit to add: this way you can tell at a glance at the top of your model all the referenced sources.  Each of them as a single line cte with no complexity thrown in.  After you have brought in each source as its own cte, then you start a new one with a name indicating the source and transformation step, etc.\n\nBy bringing in your sources, transforming each, joining, performing joined transformations, aggregating, etc, each in a little code block cte, you are mimicking how programmers would use methods in code to logically break code into chunks.\n\nIf you also read up about layering data models (medallion architecture), you’ll see how dbt likes to break it down further into separate models.  This allows you to perform the simple single-model transformations, such as renaming, casting, etc at a ”silver” stage, and more complex transformations such as joining or calculating the values in two tables, aggregating, etc in a later, “gold” model.  This takes the organising and simplifying of models from within a single model/step, to a process.\n\n——-\n\n   /*\n      Model header and configuration \n    */\n\n    // bring in referenced models and sources\n\n    WITH orders AS \n    (\n         SELECT * FROM source_orders \n    ),\n    customers AS\n    (\n        SELECT * FROM source_customers\n    )\n\n    // transform table\n\n    transform_orders AS \n    (\n        SELECT \n            col1 AS col1_rename,\n            col2 AS cast(col2 AS string),\n            .....\n        FROM src_orders\n    ),\n    transform_customers AS\n    (\n        SELECT customer_id\n                      ,UPPER(customer_name) AS customer_name\n        FROM src_customers\n    ),\n\n    cust_orders AS\n    (\n        SELECT *\n         FROM. transform_customers AS c\n             LEFT JOIN transform_orders AS o\n                 ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n\n    )\n\n    // select result\n    SELECT * FROM cust_orders",

And the retrieval side. Spark or SQL have no built in functions to do anything with the image data directly, so it will always be a two step process to do something with the images after retrieving with an sql or spark statement. For example ocr the content of an image. You retrieve the image data from iceberg and then need some eg Python code to load it into an image object and then use libraries to ocr the image. Same process if you would store the URL to the image in the db, step 1 retrieve the url step 2 load the image and ocr with Python.\n\nI would think the performance and infrastructure compute would be more favorable with images in blob storage. You just need a much smaller spark cluster to process the iceberg files and faster retrieval of the URL and image due to much less data volumes to process.",

That contract can be stored in a JSON structure and shared with your upstream source - and then be the basis for their testing and yours.  Nothing else will provide as much DQ guarantees as this.  And it can be a simple library call to hand over a row/file/table to a utility for checking.\n   * Anomaly-detection is also valuable to do prior to transformation:  does your input always have 10 million rows and suddenly you only have 65?  Regardless of whether the rows are formatted correctly, you probably have a partial file.  Or how about if one of those columns is historically NULL 1% of the time, and that's ok, but now it's NULL 100% of the time.  Something has changed...\n\nI like doing the above because each of these can typically work with raw data, can catch a ton of problems pre-transform, and isn't much work.  Then once you get into the transforms you'll need to do more of the above, but in that case it'll be for items you couldn't check with raw data - like joins that fail because there's suddenly no matching rows, etc.",

        "body": "'Pre-pipeline data validation' just sounds like shifting left, no? I'm assuming when you say pipeline, that you are talking about a data ingestion that gets incorporated into your larger existing analytical system. That matches my experience with the schema + CSV issues you are describing.\n\nEverything looking fine on the surface but more subtle, complex assumptions about the data being broken post pipeline deployment is something I've run into often. I've had varying degrees of success in trying to proactively identify issues like this. There are a few things that worked for me, particularly when the data source is an external partner. My experience is also in smaller companies where end to end analytics is entirely my responsibility and there is limited support from other colleagues. With that in mind, this kind of validation is imo a balance between getting the pipeline into production quickly and making issue identification and maintenance as easy as possible.\n\n**Before building anything / requirements and assumption refinement:**\n\n* Get all info about the data source you can\n * Ask for data dictionaries and/or entity relationship diagrams -> only commonly seen these available in finance but solves 99% of these problems before they happen\n * Figure out all your critical assumptions and ask about them explicitly (primary keys, important relationships, etc.)\n* Identify key internal stakeholder(s) that have the business context to clarify expectations\n * Who can be your point of contact for escalating + investigating issues down the line\n * Identify what aspects of the data being ingested are critical to *your own* business' processes\n     * Primary keys and most likely a subset of columns/fields rather than everything\n         * That a field exists, is an enum of X possible options, etc.\n     * Things that if your assumption about the data become wrong or broken, then the data becomes unusable or detrimental to the business\n\n**While building:**\n\n* Codify your critical assumptions\n * If these are broken pipeline FAILS -> clear alert that mentions you as pipeline owner and your internal stakeholder with a clear business-centric message\n * Subset of critical fields that must have some characteristics\n* Quarantine/identify your non-critical assumptions\n * Should NOT fail the pipeline so that business critical data can still flow\n * More of a nice to have\n * If a non-necessary or unused field starts breaking assumptions -> alert that mentions only you as pipeline owner with clear technical context, allows you to create a backlog task which can be prioritized appropriately \n\nThere's plenty you could do to abstract and reuse a lot of this functionality in whatever your ingestion/orchestration tool you are using but personally I have been unsuccessful in advocating for this internally.\n\nI am making plenty of assumptions about the latency requirements, criticality of the data to your business, and that you have some kind of semi-mature ingestion framework with alerting capabilities. This also assumes your destination tables are pre-defined with the pipeline and you aren't using some kind of lakehouse pattern which I have less experience with. There are definitely tons of options for approaches to this so I'm curious what others have to say.\n\nI'd be happy to discuss more specific tools here but tried to keep it relatively high level and already wrote an essay. Hope this helps!",

Both are tough and have complexity in it that may not be obvious to the users of that data. \n\nA pattern I've seen that did okay was to take anything that didn't fit into our target schema, we just threw it into an additional column called `invalid`. From there we can at least write some additional SQL that looks for any records that contain something within `invalid`.\n\nAt the very least this would provide you (or whoever is using your ingested data) the knowledge that _something has changed_, without knowing exactly what.

But from there what I had to do was have the SDK attached to the API and both the API & SDK just share the same DB instance and pass the code instance around. But if I couldn't do this, one thing I could do is create an http wrapper to allow for outside requests to hit the DB (sort of like a lightweight API around the DB server) with all the same auth and stuff of course. But... this gets impractical sometimes. Again this only works for one instance though, it's not practical for multiple instances. So beyond that it may be worth exploring other options as others have mentioned. But just my thoughts though.",

And if there's no one who knows how to design/build/manage a BI layer, it's also bound to get messy over time.\n\nThe thing is, if you only have bad reports, that's what the business will make decisions on. That and whatever they can come up with on their spreadsheets and side/shadow controls. I have no way to say I'd this is a minor issue or a huge risk, it may well be that the BI Eng who was laid off got enough working that the core operation is covered, and you'd only miss some opportunities. There are so many ways that BI can generate value, and so many ways it can be useless that it's impossible to say what your case is.\n\nYou do have the right gut feeling, but there's little hope of fixing the issue(s) without proper ownership and knowledge. From what you described, it looks like you don't even have someone who knows how to get BI requirements right. For example, if someone comes asking for a report on how many cars and how much spaghetti, you don't throw it as a ticket into the backlog - you ask about the decisions they're making, how the relationships between these things work, what's the desired outcome, how they'll use the information, along with frequency, level of detail, quality and possibly what other questions (at least what data domains) we're talking about. After that, you have to determine where this data is (and it might not be anywhere), how to source it, how to structure it for the specific kind(s) of analysis and decision they want to make, and then you have to figure out how that relates to the rest of the data model you already have. And then you may be able to build something.\n\nEven skipping half of what I described, you can't escape some of it, and you need to know what you're doing. You also need ownership from the business, because this will need to be operated and maintained, and that comes with a cost. If there's no ownership, maybe on one wants that cost.\n\nBasically, start by finding someone who can explain why this matters, and then see if they can put enough value on it to justify the DE position. Just remember that, if you start asking questions, people may assume you're taking ownership. If you think that's a career move or a problem, I also don't know for sure.",

Not a big deal for a small/solo project, but at scale it can introduce unintended changes if upstream schemas evolve (new columns, renamed columns, type changes) and can impact downstream models silently.\n* Your models appear to be **full refreshes** (not incremental), meaning tables are recreated on each `dbt run`. In that setup you generally don’t need: `now() as last_updated`   to track row creation/update date This information is already available through **Clickhouse** **system table** called `system.parts`.\n\nOverall: not a complete end-to-end project yet (missing orchestrator and probably lots of other bricks !), but the foundation and structure are solid, nice work setting this up !",

Move data through them with ETL (or ELT).\n\n-I had to model my data using the Kimble method for my curated version (dimensions and facts). It definitely helps with Power BI reporting. There are lots of resources for this online.\n\n- Consider how your API works. When you call it, what does it give you back? Is it a full data set, or do you pass it a date and it just gives you back a smaller set of data? Which columns in that API call do you need and which are definitely not useful to your business (don't get rid of them in raw in case the business wants them in future, but think about if they are needed in cleansed). I was able to use watermarks to record when the pipeline last ran. I can pass that watermark to my API so it only gives me the data that has been inserted or updated  since then. That's handy because you process a much smaller data set.\n\n-Think about what happens if your pipeline fails at each stage. Draw it out on paper if you have to, think about why parts could fail and how you would fix them or deal with the next pipeline run.\n\n- Spend some time thinking how your pipeline will handle deleted data. If someone deleted a record from November in your CRM, how does it need to be handled in your reporting? Does the business still expect to see it in the reporting or are they happy it should be removed. I use MERGE to handle these in SparkSQL.\n\n- How often does the business want your pipeline to run, and at what time?",

As you mentioned schema changes are common, but relatively easy to detect. Most often I experienced renaming of columns, which manifests as a missing column in your expected schema and a new column at the same time. The pipeline cannot resolve this issue and will most likely fail if the missing column is used in transformations. You can detect schema changes with DBT-tests with dbt-expectations package or you can use great expectations package or dlt (data load tool) when using Python. Those tools also allow for detecting other type of problems, e.g. for categorical fields additional values that are not expected. You can also define simple tests or expectations that a column shouldn’t have NULL values, or fields need to be of a specific types and and and …\n\nAnything you can envision will happen eventually. And most often it requires human intervention to be fixed because most likely you need to talk to other people to either fix it at the source or you need to adjust the data pipeline to handle the new case. Your time is best spend in investing in detection and observability so you can spot the reason for the failure quickly.\n\nOne way to minimize your disruption (and this is used in more mature organisations) is to create data contracts with your source system owners. In this document you describe what tables are you pulling, schema information, frequency, expected values, date time boundaries …. Then you can create a test data set that you can use to test your data pipeline when you make changes.",

Downstream of all of this, of course, when processing the load of cleansed data to production systems, the many pitfalls you might run in to there and need to report alongside the original raw picture of data to clients and internally. My favorite is a client we have who has a massive hierarchy for their enterprise that is sent to us via web services so that we can marry it up to our hierarchy for them in our system, all sent as this massive multi megabyte json beast. Most of the issues with them are mapping them to the right corresponding place within the hierarchy, and it’s a lot of reporting what isn’t set up by our enterprise so we can successfully consume the data at a later date. After corrections, we automatically reprocess raw data for these clients for just the failures.\n\nI often run in to structural or data quality issues that I need to gracefully handle.",

Sure you can merge bronze + silver in one layer but be ready to face more problems when there are outages, pipeline breakdowns etc. \n\n2. Partition by hour might be overkill ?! Partition by Day should be good. It would be roughly \\~25mb or so per hour.  Iceberg  can use hidden partitions so you can literally pass the timestamps or hourly based timestamps in your query. In short users don't have to know the partition column well in advance and you can modify it. Maybe have another column which has timestamp it is getting written to silver ( the timestamp of the micro batch. Say 200 files per 60mins is roughly 15-20 files every 2-3 minutes)   \n  \nHandle you duplicates, idempotency , business logic etc in this silver pipeline. If anything fails always read the bronze and retrigger the pipeline. \n\n3.  Once you write to your silver you ask your client what is the latest timestamp it has and see if you silver has anything new and if yes send >= that timestamp from client ( rough idea). \n\nKeep in mind about backfills. If your mini jobs fail multiple times you should be effectively able to delete those partitions and run the pipeline again and retrigger data to your other service. \n\nWhen you decouple like this you would ensure that if ever Silver or REST API service breaks the bronze still holds true. You can always read from the latest offset if your bronze break. \n\nThe above is my appraoch.",

If you are receiving full snapshots you do conditional inserts on hashdiff by key so that you don't write the same data twice. That combined with compressible formats means you only keep actual changed data, which means it isn't sized much larger than SCD2.\n\n> Also, using always the timestamps doesn't force you to run an analytical function over the partition sorted by date to obtain the latest record ?\n\nIf you used only the raw vault to query then it would, yes. But part of the BV batch is running logic like those window functions to find the latest version(s) by key to create derived tables.\n\nOn each batch you can take your fresh raw vault data and determine how it would splice into your current SCD2 history, and update that table. The SCD2 table could materialise all the data, or it could be just the keys pointing back to a specific row in the raw vault. Just the keys can work if you need to save space, as doing an inner join still allows predicate pushdown into the raw vault data unlike with filters on window function ordering.",

Then you need machinery to feed all these tables unnecessarily, and pay for all that compute work. It is just not a framework that is optimized for the cloud native tech. It is pointless in that sense. Also, lots of data engineers you hire will ask to leave the project after 6 months for the amount of endless work that the framework demands. All that under the escuse of it being very robust and adaptable to business logic. Well lots argue that is rather preferable having work maintaining simple models that need to be adapted a bit here and there once in a while than having work on a weekly basis for creating tables all in the same way. It is robotic work that nobody likes to do. Data Vaults advantages can be achieved with much easier to maintain frameworks.",

Being brainless though does not mean it is not time consuming. Because despite it not being complicated, it becomes complex quite fast, hence the scaling problem. Then you end up feeding your data marts with endless amounts of joins coming from your data vault layers. Basically you shift the intellectual efforts from the raw layer to the data mart layer, but in the middle of the process you just wasted unnecessary time building the data vault, when you could have started directly on the data marts or building some bronze and silver layers, which are much more flexible and easier to maintain.\n\nOh and i forgot to mention the pickiness of having surrogate keys everywhere, which is something that blocks any optimization from the modern sql engines of snowflake for example.",

Newer data processing framework or libraries are simpler to use and more scalable without a cluster. \n\nTHE RACE TO THE BOTTOM:\nThe big data journey started with Hadoop and then Spark came along. Both technologies require clusters of computers with a lot of setup and maintenance. So Hadoop had it moment but mostly disappeared. It wasn’t the right technology for most of the need for enterprises, unless you are Google. Then cloud data warehouse (redshift, snowflake) became popular, but pretty quickly companies had to pay more than they wanted for pretty simple data processing in most parts. But snowflake at least offered a managed service that took away the infrastructure management away from users. A lot of companies still using snowflake for their BI needs and even analytics. Fast forward to data lakehouse architectures. Now we can do the same than in snowflake on files in s3. The clear winner out of this phase was Databricks due to their integrated approach covering end-to-end processing needs. Compared to other approaches it is simpler and managed. Cost of Databricks is cheaper than data warehouses, but we still pay a premium for compute. Now the datalakehouse evolves with on-process DBs like duckdb that offer same performance with much simpler compute for most use cases. This phase is work in progress and lead by DuckDB. But it promises lower cost at similar performance and simpler data stack compared to the 15 year old spark technology. But no end to end platform yet.\n\nData stack is evolving. Throughout the journey performance is increasing slightly or remain the same as the price is of data processing is getting cheaper.",

That brings in other dimensions:\n\n**Standardisation and skills**  \nUsing one platform for most workloads simplifies hiring, onboarding, and design decisions. Running DuckDB *and* Databricks or Snowflake already means duplicated mental models, tooling, and operational overhead. Spark skills are also far easier to source today than DuckDB-specific expertise.\n\n**Usability across roles**  \nA data platform isn’t just for DEs. Analysts, analytics engineers, QA, data scientists, and software engineers all need access. Most don’t want to reason about Python internals or query-level optimisation. Platforms like Databricks and Snowflake work because they provide a shared abstraction layer with escape hatches when needed.\n\n**Operations and integration**  \nA “simple VM running DuckDB” isn’t simple in production. You still own OS patching, security hardening, monitoring, backups, scaling, incident response, and integration with IAM, logging, and alerting. That operational load is labour-intensive and expensive.\n\n**Compliance and risk management**  \nEnterprise systems must comply with GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, SOC2, BCBS, etc. Using a certified platform drastically reduces audit scope. Saying “the platform is ISO27001-compliant, we only audit our data logic” is far cheaper than proving compliance for bespoke VM setups.\n\n**Support and continuity**  \nAt scale, systems fail in non-obvious ways. Having access to vendor engineers who understand the internals matters. Enterprises also care about platform longevity; they expect core infrastructure investments to last 5-10 years, not depend on a small ecosystem or a few experts.\n\nOther concerns I’m deliberately not expanding on here include cost attribution, blast-radius reduction, workload isolation and concurrency control, data governance (lineage, column- and row-level security), and long-term exit costs.\n\nBy the way, I think DuckDB is excellent technology, that's not really the problem here because the question isn’t whether it’s fast or cheap in isolation, but whether it minimises risk, effort, and cost at the organisational level.",

Yes, passthrough had some limitations, but it also allowed you to mount storage without baked-in creds, rely on hyperscaler storage security model, and have multiple engines respect a single security model (think what Fabric OneLake aims to achieve today). For many of us, the model was clean, elegant and worked extremely well because it encouraged an *open* Lakehouse.\n\nWhile Unity Catalog solved some real governance problems, it conveniently became the ONLY path forward for a growing set of feature. There were real tradeoffs made between openness and control, and Databricks obviously chose the latter. Call it “enterprise readiness” all you want, but customer lock-in and monetisation were the primary part of the equation.\n\nThe irony is that Snowflake, once held up as the closed/proprietary villain, is now, in MANY practical ways, the more open platform.",

But even then, after you have your prototype running, you should build a relational database based on your MongoDB database.\n\nI was led astray. I was one of those naive newbies. I chose MongoDB for my project. At first, I liked it: when I needed to add a field to an object, I add it in my code and it just worked. It felt like magic at first.\n\nBut after a while, I found out any query more complex than a basic join is a nightmare. Unreadable mess. Absolute degeneracy. My code was full of 100+ lines long unreadable queries decorated with comments like \n\n    // no way in hell this is the correct way to write this, but it works so DON'T TOUCH IT\n\nI thought \"surely I am missing something. Surely there's a way to write the queries more nicely. Surely with more practice, it will get more readable\". But after a while, I realized this was not happening.\n\nAnd the indexing. If you don't have properly set up indexes, the costs skyrocket. And you don't get any sort of warning that the database is manually searching through the millions of entries, checking them one by one for a match, multiple times per query. And even if you have indexes that by all means should have been used, sometimes they just don't get used, without any apparent reason. Optimizing queries is hell.\n\nAt one point, I had to bite the bullet. I knew I could not keep it at this state much longer. It took me 2 months of tedious work, rewriting everything to Postgres, migrating all the data that accumulated over time. It sucked. But the relief of finally deleting the wasteland that my MongoDB has become was like getting that really bad tooth that has been decaying for 5 years finally pulled. It was awesome.\n\nJust use Postgres. If you are working with data of undefined structure, just use JSONB.\n\nAnd to show you a concrete example, here's a query from my codebase back when it used MongoDB (yes, all this is a single query). Don't try to understand it. Just marvel at it. \n\n    // sorry.

Somebody else controls it. Example is a web scraper - you’re not in charge of the website you are scraping. Schema-less is a big thing here because it lets you store “anything” in the DB. Also, NoSQL is much more beginner-friendly, which is why you see it so much in courses and tutorials.\nOf course, it has some great horizontal scalability features and a lot of other stuff, but that's not important for beginners in this field (at least, not yet).\n\n2. If I have complete control over my object model, I would always use a relationship database since I’m already familiar with SQL. Also, if I have a lot of data to process (like GBs or TBs), I’ll avoid MongoDB or any NoSQL database.\n\n3. It's usually a great choice. It lets you shift your focus to the app and its logic, spending less time on data structures, schemas, etc. In real life, at some point, you'll need to learn SQL because it’s much more common than NoSQL, but for personal projects and learning Mongo, it's a great start. \nMongoDB and Atlas created one of the best developer experiences I have seen",

You'll also need to understand its failure modes in edge cases; for example how _exactly_ the retry behaviour of the driver is in case a server instance happens to disappear mid-transaction, and when the application needs to catch that and retry itself.\n\nEven if it's schemaless, for most regular applications, you still need a schema. If the database doesn't enforce it, your app layer needs to enforce it. If you don't, you'll end up with _a lot_ of uncertain code all over the place and a lot of `if..else` trying to compensate for vague schemas. Ask me how I know, it's hardly maintainable after a while.\n\nFor most regular apps which need a relational data store, I would not recommend Mongo. At least not as the primary database. It can be useful for storing a large pool of unrelated, fairly unstructured data which is mostly accessed individually instead of serving aggregate queries. Spontaneously I could imagine YouTube storing data about its videos in Mongo; they're mostly accessed individually, each document can sprout various metadata, most documents are accessed fairly infrequently, and there's _loads_ of them.",

I can teach a toddler to write letters, doesn't mean the toddler can write words. And it doesn't mean the toddler can write a syntactically right and meaningful sentence.\n\nWriting is easy. You just put letters one after another. Learning the words is harder, you have to know the words. Making a meaningful sentence is very hard.\n\nIt requires you to have an idea to express, then choose the right words, in the right orders, with the right nuances to get your listener to understand you.\n\nThis is all about code here. Learning \"for\", \"if\", \"while\", \"switch\", \"function\", \"null\"... All those keywords that have a specific meaning. You know most of them.\n\nI guess that if I asked you to write a loop over an array you could achieve it. The issue comes with complexity.\n\nYou don't know what to express and even if you know what to express, you aren't experienced enough to know how to express it if the complexity rises.\n\nFrom my point of view, if my take makes sense to you, you'll have to work through that. It took me 2 years to get that mindset. It takes more or less time for different people depending on where they start and how efficient their learning process is. You need more time, more practice.\n\nMake projects, complex ones. Do some more DSA. Work the problems in your brain, try your solution on the computer, get the result, fix and restart the process. Look on the internet for information and solutions, but don't copy directly, understand and inject the solution in your code, try it, see it, feel it, deeply.\n\nOn another note: feeling dumber than you thought. \n\nI don't think you are stupid, but I don't know you. It's relative to what you think and expect here. I think you just had a revelation on the Dunning Kruger effect. Feels like science, not sure it is, but the intuition is pretty on point IMO. \n\nThe less experienced in something, the more confident you are in it. \n\nYou hit the reality check. And you placed yourself on \"the mountain of stupidity\". But it doesn't mean you are stupid, it's just a biased view. Something we all do. Don't blame yourself. Being aware of that make you smarter than a lot of people. Use this to understand where you stand more than trying to blame yourself.",

We **can** pass large values (complex structs, arrays, etc...) as function arguments. But they will be copied. That can be a lot of copying, especially if we can't anticipate the size of arguments `my_func(int arg[12])` vs `my_func(int arg[9999])`. \n\n3. Since function arguments get copied, and large copies are expensive, it's cheaper and faster to pass the address (pointer) of the data as a function argument.\n\n1. Very low level programming can involve jumping forward and backward to memory addresses. We can do math on the pointer itself to get to different addresses. You may never do this yourself, but pointers gives us access to this capability.\n\nWhy are you experiencing this in C++ when C++ is supposed to be modern? Because C++ was designed to be compatible with C and the preexisting C libraries. C was designed like this because it was one of the first successful abstractions above assembly and written in an era when compute, storage, and memory was very expensive (cost and compute cycles).\n\nEdit: I mostly mentioned functions + pointers and not pointers in general, but my goal is to justify the utility of pointers and mentioning their benefits with functions is good enough.",

        "body": "One thing I think you’re wrong in is saying “But it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road.” \n\nI often times have no idea what I’m getting into and reading thru a repo can suck sometimes. One of the best pieces of advice I got from my first manager was something along the lines of “I don’t care about dev. We have it for a reason and no one depends on that data. Go break it. That’s how you find out how it’s working and how you find issues. We can always redeploy dev “. And that changed my learning perspective. Instead of feeling like I need to understand the docs cover to cover, I now feel empowered to take a look at the architecture and app dependencies and then just go fuck with it. \n\nFor example, the past 3 years I’ve worked almost exclusively with serverless architecture in AWS using python. But I just joined a new team and we are shifting the application to EKS using a Java library. No fucking clue but I spend the last 2 days reviewing architecture, in the console, and googling/gpt every step of the way when I run into something I don’t know. Now I have a tool belt of knowledge to aid the team in solving some of their problems. I still have a ton to learn, but after 2 days, I know what questions I need to ask.",

Small companies, especially non-tech companies, pick a very mainstream language and then hire programmers who already know that language. They hyper-focus on knowing the right language because they want to hire people who can do the job now. These companies almost never pick obscure languages, they're more likely to be using an aging language like PHP.\n\n2. The most cutting-edge tech companies don't care what language you know now. They hire really great people and then teach them the language they use, or ask them to pick the right language for each new project. To get a job there, knowing the \"right\" language doesn't help, being really good at building and problem-solving is what they care about.",

You don't need algebra, calculus, etc unless you're working on software that uses that stuff.)\n* \"Am I learning the right language?\" (Learn Python to start. But if you're learning something else, that's fine.)\n* \"Do I need to get a new, more powerful computer to learn to code?\" (Absolutely not. The cheapest desktop or laptop is more than enough.)\n* \"I want to learn a second language at the same time but I've heard that's bad.\" (It's fine. You can learn more than one thing at a time. There's no actual research or studies that state that learning.)\n* \"I feel like I always have to look stuff up. I can't memorize everything.\" (That's fine. Everyone is constantly looking stuff up.)\n* \"I heard X is slow.\" (That's not really a concern for your needs, and probably isn't even true in the first place anyway.)",

Larger enterprise jobs often use C# and .NET, and some smaller tech consultancies will also use it, because it's cross platform and maintained by Microsoft, which means frequent updates, good documentation, lots of support, and built in support for cloud.\n\nC# is probably an ideal language to learn.

Always had an interest in programming and computers but never really pursued it. I'm by no means an expert in the field and job markets are different everywhere but I don't think I could have made it without my degree. I got my job through one of my University's work experience programs as well as the small network I made from participating in extra curricular activities. I was hired part time before I finished my degree. It really is just a piece of paper at the end of the day but I feel that the experience of going to uni and the network I built made it worth while. Not to mention the feeling of accomplishment when I graduated. It was a hard 4 years but I enjoyed it and really felt I earned it. \nBest of luck and good work on the sobriety, my friend.

Programs are long term projects.  The goals the project has on day one will not be the same goals the project has 1 year in.  New things happen, assumptions on what is important might change, and you need a cycle to manage this reality.  Waterfall strategy only works short term, agile strategy is what separates success stories from failures long term.  This is, again, something that comes with experience.\n\nAs far as what technologies survive long term?  Well, bash and linux scripting, javascript (specifically async), sql (on the administration and optimization side), and react state as a design pattern I feel are all key.  Linux in particular hasn't changed much since I learned the basics 20 years ago.\n\nGood ideas will persist and better ideas will replace them over time.  This is just how it goes.

At this point I consider it to be absolutely stupid to introduce CS to students with IDE's.   To much basic material gets glossed over that often results in  students not understanding what is happening underneath.\n2. Frankly this applies to trying to write any software as a GUI application, there is too much to learn to be distracted by GUI's.\n3. So what we need to do is to get back to basics.\n4. This means building software with command line tools and maybe a simple GUI text editor.   \n5. I'd suggest following a CS program that uses C++.   You already supposedly have some CS under your belt but I'm really wondering if you learned anything.   But the point here is that as each point is explored in class you just write code that leverages that technique in as many ways as possible.   The usual first program is to write your name to the screen, often followed by simple looping.  Explore looping for hours then continue with every other concept discussed in the program.   the idea is to totally understand the ins and outs of every concept and be able to use with muscle memory.   \n6. Then start writing simple command line programs that solve things you understand well.   Try to tie in these programs with hobby's or other thigns you know well.   The point is you understand the the technology so you know what is right and you know the end result you want to see.   An example would be writing a program that takes resistor band colors and returns the actually resistance value.    Another example would be to display your favorite Chili receipt on screen.   The idea is to start out dirt simple and grow from there.\n7. Once you fell comfortable building command line programs from abstract requirements then start building  GUI apps.   At this point you will  likely want to shift away from C++ to a common platform programming language.   For example on Apples systems that would be Swift.   In some ways you will be starting over as Hello World is a common first GUI program.   You will also need to become familiar with more advanced data structures and methods.\n8. Once you get past the introductory step you need to start crafting your own apps while you follow a platform specific program.   Again the idea here is to take something you understand well, a hobby or something other and create programs that solve a problem within that domain.    You can even start over with a receipt program but this time one that stores multiple receipts and allows more interaction.   The idea is to get more and more complex.   As you learn more and more you will realize just how bad the first receipt program was and can refactor it as much as possible.   You really should have several programs under various states of construction.",

A Native app (Swift/Kotlin) outpaces Cross-platform (React/Flutter) or WebView because it has direct hardware access. Performance suffers when developers clog the Main Thread with heavy tasks (like parsing JSON) instead of offloading them to Background Threads, causing UI stutters. Finally, optimized apps use Local Caching to show content instantly, whereas laggy apps force the UI to wait for the network and re-render everything from scratch, draining both battery and data. I usually see a big difference between a native application and a Cross-platform, and even more so I see how poorly WebView works.",

From there you can do that again with something else. Soon you will be able to come up with your own ideas and you will know where to start.

        "body": "Other than \"which language do I learn\" this is the most common programming question. The answer is to build projects and start small. \n\nLook, there's no way to just leap from tutorials to building complex software in one bound. \n\nSo, start small. First, choose a project with a tight scope, like a Todo app with user accounts. \n\nThen, get a Trello account and start writing out individual tasks. You want to make these tasks super simple at first. One might be \"create a webpage with Ultimate Todo List as the title.\" Your next task might be \"Create a CSS Page and make sure it's linked to the webpage.\" Then do the same with JavaScript.\n\nIf you run into something you don't know how to do, make a card for learning how to do it. You do not need or want to fully master new technologies at this stage. You want to learn the bare minimum to incorporate it into your project.\n\nIf you get stuck, try to look up the specific thing you want to do. For example, if you're trying to make a checkbox the user can click, look up that specific thing. If you're unsure how to store your list of items, look that up, but not until you're working on that task.\n\nAnd then you just keep going. Try to complete one or two cards per day. This is almost exactly how professional software is built, btw. Only we break the cards into batches we can complete in two weeks and call it a sprint. \n\nRemember, the cards aren't complete features, they are small tasks. \n\nIf you know Git (and you should) make a repo for your project and get in the habit of making a branch for each card. Once you complete a card, merge your branch into main and start the process again. Your Main branch should always be a working app with whatever features you've added so far. \n\nStart small, complete one or two small tasks every day, rinse, repeat.\n\nIt's not just a way, it's the only way. Software is built one small step at a time.",

Some people get more mileage by doing a short pass in C first to see the sharp edges directly, then Rust feels like a structured way to avoid them. Others prefer Go for fundamentals around concurrency and simplicity, but it will not push you as hard on memory and invariants.\n\nScope wise, I would pick tiny programs with one learning objective each and a hard ceiling on features. Stuff like a simple log parser with a strict state machine, a tiny key value store in memory, a CLI that does one thing well, or a toy HTTP server. If you catch yourself designing frameworks, stop and write tests for behavior instead. That is usually the point where \"learning\" quietly turns into \"architecture as procrastination.\"",

That maps well to how real systems break.\n\nThat said, Rust is not the only way to get there. If you ever feel like you’re spending more time appeasing the compiler than reasoning about the problem, stepping sideways into something like Go or even plain C for a bit can help. Different languages surface the same fundamentals from different angles. There’s value in contrast.\n\nThe biggest trap to avoid is “exploration creep.” Pick problems that are almost boring. A tiny file indexer. A toy key value store. A CLI that parses input, mutates state, and fails in predictable ways. Stop the moment it works. Do not add features. The learning comes from finishing and reflecting, not from polishing.\n\nYou’re already thinking about this the right way.

They all have their pros and cons, but ultimately none of them will teach you.. you have to teach yourself.  I wouldn’t worry about finding the perfect resources.  The goal should be to learn enough to take the training wheels off and start building things on your own.\n\nThird :  It sounds like you have tried a bunch of things already.  Different languages, web, etc.. I started out in a similar way.  I just wanted to “learn programming”..  I was making progres, but it was a bit scattered.

It’s a coding challenge in December where the creator releases one puzzle a day like an advent calendar, although this year he only did 12 days. \n\nEach day you’re given a Christmas themed puzzle to solve and some input data and you have to write a code to solve it in a language of your choice. The puzzles get progressively harder as you go. The first few days are usually fairly simple list comprehension style but as you get further you have to use DFS, regexes, Dijkstras, interpreting JSONs etc. So it’s a fun way to practice DSA with a bit more of a story than Leetcode. \n\nAs an example one of the puzzles from 2024 you’re given input data which is a large grid of #’s and .s plus one ^ . The ^ is the start postion of a guard. The guard walks in the direction she’s pointing until she hits an # when she turns right. You have to work out how many unique cells the guard visits before leaving the room.\n\nThe challenge goes back to 2015 and you can play all of the old puzzles for free so I find it a really fun way to practice. Once I’ve solved a puzzle I look at how other people have solved it in other languages and find ways I can improve my code.",

The other was a 20 year tenured dinosaur using the same slides he'd been using since the 2000s, mumbling his way along while we were left to decode the remains.\n\nIn both cases, algorithms were only touched on to a theoretical capacity in lecture - only word problems appeared in ungraded work which nobody did because the graded stuff took priority. In neither case was the learning experience long lasting. In both cases it was the same procedure: Survive the semester and try to prep for the next batch of courses.\n\nBeyond those courses, our projects rarely required algorithm work. The closest I've ever come was implementing A\\* pathfinding for a turn-based tactics game I made for a game programming course. Best course in my 4 years here.

Upcoming is RISC-V and 64bit ARM (also available from Microchip). Old 8bit standbys are PIC and AtmelAVR that can be important depending on your notion of \"embedded\" (not every toaster and microwave is running Linux-ARMs yet),. There are also 16bit processors that are optimized for motor controllers if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nOnce you get the hang of any one of those then the others follow pretty easily so look at the market you hope to enter. Anything with wifi or ethernet will probably want ARM or newer. Motors will be the 16bit DSP engines or specialized ARM devices (often slightly more than the typical assembly instruction set). Light bulbs and toasters and hand-held appliances will probably continue with 8bit which is easily mastered.\n\nThe important point is having something to practice on until you are comfortable with how it works.

The mnemonics and their meanings are entirely dependent on the machine instruction sets of the target processor. So, if you know PDP-11 assembler language, you don’t really know ARM-64 or x86 or MIPS or whatever. \n\nIf you find an embedded job, you’ll be using the processor your employer chose. If you start a company to make an embedded project, you’ll choose the processor. So your core skill will be getting your coding process up and running quickly on whatever instruction set.\n\nIf your time is worth anything, you’ll hammer out most of the embedded code in C. Both GCC and LLVM have really good facilities for turning C code into astonishingly well optimized machine code for your processor of choice. It can prolly generate smaller and faster code than 99.9% of programmers ever will be able to. I’ve worked with a couple of the 0.1%, those folks are amazing. But they still use a lot of C.\n\nAssembly comes into its own for small chunks of an application that are time- or power- critical. And often the assembly code is embedded in some sort of pragma directive inside .c source code files.\n\nThere’s still a lot to learn by programming machine instructions directly. Learning how registers, stack pointers, program counters, and other machine concepts work is helpful. You may as well do it for whatever machine you have readily at hand. \n\nC compilers generally have options that make them generate “listings” with the generated machine instructions displayed. That, combined with the instruction architecture document for your processor, will teach you a lot. \n\nEspecially, compare the generated code with optimization turned off (-g) and on (-O).",

        "body": "You just finished your first semester. I'd say that for now look into different courses/paths your university is going to introduce you into. We can throw at you all kinds of tech stacks but what if you pick DevOps over web application development? Or you pick mobile app development over IoT/embedded programming? Perhaps you go for telecom technologies instead?\n\nYou having finished your first semester is a bit early to make you pick a path and target one or another company. Unless you clearly know what you want to do.\n\nAlso, your break is going to be what, 1 month or less? It will not be enough to go over all the different paths one might recommend to you.\n\nI'd say that if you haven't done yet, then learn to use Git. It will be used regardless in which field you'll be working at. Learn to make pull/merge requests, learn to make feature branches, etc. That knowledge will be needed also in your coming semesters. Try it out with some hobby project (whichever medium: mobile app, a script outputting to a terminal, a website, etc.)\n\nThen, you do can map the different technologies that are used by companies in your area. Search by \"junior developer\" or \"junior engineer\" or \"junior software developer\" or such. Yes, you are targeting internship but you'll be working with some tech stack. Even when it comes to very simple tasks they give to interns. You can make a list for mobile app development, a list for web application development, a list for IoT/embedded/hardware programming, etc. Might be that some of the technologies you will learn during your courses. But definitely can be that you might have to learn something on your own or they will teach you during the internship.\n\nAnother thing that you can do is mapping down all the different companies that are taking interns in first place. You can learn all the different programming languages, but when you have no company to apply to then perhaps you are picking a technology that has no internships in your area. For example you might be learning Python or Java but if companies in your area are taking only interns to embedded programming then you'll need C and C++ instead. So, make a solid plan first before you start picking programming languages, frameworks, etc.\n\nYou can also look into companies that are hosting open door days, hosting tech talks, etc. Yes, these are not internship events but if you are social enough, you might find internship via connections you make in these events.\n\nMore realistic approach (instead of looking for internship via tech talk events) is looking if your university has a programming/robotics club. And then join that. These clubs will introduce you into different interesting projects, into different club organized events (but also company visits), and you'll get connections.\n\nThis is what you realistically can do during your break. You'll have much clearer idea of your options when you start actually applying for internships. Whereas your course mates will be in your current shoes, looking aimlessly for internship offers, not knowing what to do.\n\nSure, it helps if you have a hobby project and you have it in Github and perhaps even hosted somewhere or running on some device (depending of its nature). Then a company will see that you can actually work on a project.\n\nBesides an ability to work on a project you also should improve your group work skills / soft skills. This is why I suggested to join some programming related extracurricular activity club in your university. Software development is a group work, usually. Yeah, there is freelancing but you are not targeting it as an intern. An intern must be able to work in a team. I have had different bad experiences with new hires who just do not function in a team. Sure, you can have all kinds of technical skills but if you do not function in a team then it will harm your own progress, it will make you a blocker when it comes to handling tasks, etc. A good intern is somebody who is proactive, shows an interest towards learning, is willing to work in a team, is a good listener, etc.",

Hell, I didn't even start a votech until 25.\n\nOne thing I can suggest to you is to take a step back from programing, and use something like [draw.io](http://draw.io) to map everything out. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you can get a good idea of what's where. Then the implementation is going to be easier, and you can see right off the bat what you can trim. \n\nIt's also a good exercise in mapping out your edge cases. When you are building something that moves and interacts with the world your primary focus is on not missing a single edge case because people can be hurt and property can be destroyed. Ya dig? Your project isn't likely there yet.\n\nI keep several things. A note book, my phone, a couple docs. Then when I'm going through stuff, I make sure I didn't miss these edge cases I noted down everywhere. I generally deal with industrial systems, particularly utilities like ammonia refrigeration, steam boilers, large electrical power systems, large pump systems, etc. So it's not as important for you.\n\nOnce you have a solid map and the data laid out, what you can/can't do will make more sense I'm sure. Just the fact that you say \"I'm not sure if I'm good enough to do that\" is the first step - you are making sure you are working within your limits, but not afraid to push them. That's wise.

And I have basic knowledge of their hardware. You have the right idea, but keep in mind that Waymo AND Zoox already have the entire map of the city already loaded into their system, plus information that's not on the map, like updated lane markers, where are the pullover zones, and so on. Mapping is only used to \"validate\" areas of the map that doesn't match what they already \"knew\" about the area. They do NOT do autonomous mapping. In a new city, they have safety drivers go down each block to do the initial mapping. They also have GPS as backup, and for Google, Streetview as another backup for 3D AR mapping. \n\nYour little bot does NOT have any of these secondary / tertiary locator means in the school interior. So you can be inspired by Google / Waymo, but you cannot copy their approach because you don't have their hardware nor their secondary / tertiary nav data. (You may be able to code workarounds by adding QR codes or RFID beacons to door frames or fixed distances, and use those to help your bot locate itself, but that's up to you)",

        "body": "The best source for learning OOP is learning Smalltalk. Squeak is a modern Windows implementation. Don't go crazy learning the language like you're going to make a career of it - if you're fast at picking up syntax, you'll probably do the most learning in just a few hours. Smalltalk is a single-paradigm, OOP language. It is **THE** OOP language most modern OOP has derived from.\n\nThe principles of OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; but these principles (idioms) don't *MAKE* OOP, they each exist in nearly every other programming paradigm - imperative programming has all of these idioms. These principles *FALL OUT* of OOP as a natural consequence.\n\nOOP is the paradigm of message passing. I don't move your arms for you - nor do I COMMAND you to open your umbrella, I just have to tell you it's raining. You have autonomy and agency to do whatever is appropriate in response. You could ignore me, you could open your umbrella, you could tell me to buzz off, you could call the police.\n\nObjects are a black box that can send and receive messages. In C++, standard streams are the de facto message passing interface, and you have to integrate some of it's interfaces into your implementation - for us, we have implementation level control over the details. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level feature built right in, which is convenient, which was conventional for the 50s and 60s, but Bjarne took certain issue with that - hence he made C++ the way it is.\n\nAn object is implemented in terms of state and functions. Your state is typically member fields and objects. Encapsulation *isn't* about tightly coupling functions with **DATA**, it's about classes modeling behaviors by enforcing invariants in member state. Data is bulky and dumb - data doesn't DO stuff. State is an implementation detail. A car has an engine, and so the throttle has to pass a message to the carburetor to accelerate. An engine has an RPM, which is just a number. In C++, you'd mix these types and concepts, in Smalltalk even numbers are objects.\n\nSmalltalk is very dynamic and has no type safety. You can ask an integer to capitalize itself; at runtime, it can either ignore the message, or respond with a `:dontknowmessage`, or defer to an exception handler. C++ allows for type safety - another reason Bjarne invented C++, but there's a fair amount of syntax to go with it.\n\nVery few multi-paradigm languages get OOP correct. The 1990s were TERRIBLE for OOP. Eternal September came in 1993 - when more people entered comp-sci than the industry as a whole could absorb and mentor them; OOP was oversimplified to the point of being wrong, but the egotistical blind were confidently leading the blind, who couldn't have known better.\n\nAs a result, you get \"C with Classes\", which is what I'd call most all of it - even in Python. It's actually a strictly imperative style that doesn't have an OOP bone in its body. Getters and setters are a consequence of the C type system, and are often seen in frameworks - but if you're not writing in C, if you're not writing a framework, they're an anti-pattern. Classes model behaviors and enforce invariants - a car can accelerate, turn, stop and start... They can't get make, get model, get year. The car doesn't use those properties to implement it's behavior. Those properties can be associated with the car in a map or table.\n\nThere are many kinds of polymorphism, and late binding (virtual functions) are just one of them. Javascript has this in spades since you can just ASSIGN additional functions to instances - they are not strictly bound to a prototype. There are several kinds of static and dynamic polymorphisms - function overloading, type erasure, multi-dispatch, overlapping types, indirection...\n\nThen inheritance principally models IS-A aggregation or HAS-A composition. There are other types, like C++ has LIKE-A. While neat, inheritance is often misunderstood and misapplied - for everything you might think you want to use it for, presume you're wrong, first.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a book on the subject, the seminal tome is `A Theory of Objects (Monographs in Computer Science)`. Good luck meeting anyone who has ever heard of it, let alone read it. When I tell you you'll likely never meet a developer who has the first clue what OOP is, I mean it. This is our industry's singularly biggest Dunning-Kruger.\n\nNote that Java has no de facto message passing interface. Not like Smalltalk. Not like C++. Many languages, like ECMAScript, Java, and C# are so fundamentally wrong about OOP they'll tell you that function calls ARE message passing. Absolutely insane. If that were the case, then Assembly is a first-class OOP language.",

You have a choice: be a dummy like everyone else and call everything Object Oriented - making the term meaningless, or actually understand what it is.\n\nI'm warning you that almost everything you're ever going to hear about OOP is wrong. You'll be told that OOP is:\n\n    public class car {\n      private int speed;\n\n      public int getSpeed() { return speed; }\n      public void setSpeed(int speed) { this.speed = speed; }\n    }\n\nAnd this is wrong. But everyone SAYS this is right. There is nothing OOP about this code whatsoever. The principles don't make the paradigm, the paradigm makes the principles. In Java, you need to make messages and a mechanism for passing them between objects.\n\nYou can create objects in Java, but Java isn't inherently Object Oriented. Having objects isn't enough. Fuckin' C has objects - it's explicitly in the language standard, but no one thinks of C as Object Oriented.\n\nI want you to have a chance of understanding what OOP is.\n\nYou won't understand OOP until you study Smalltalk and original materials from the OOP era before the late 90s disaster. You cannot understand the technology without understanding the history.",

This is why keeping track of things and being mindful is very important.\n\nWhen I was starting out, I didn't understand a lot of things, both about coding in a general sense, but also the nuances of what I was working on, the problems I was facing, and how to best resolve them. There was problems I couldn't solve, ideas I couldn't put into reality. Now, I am able to do them, even if I need to refer to documentation or the occasional reference of similar code to get an idea of how to resolve my problem.\n\nThis is true with other skills too. 10 years ago, I could never model and animate for video games. Now? I do it as a hobby, I'm not the best, but I do decent enough that people enjoy my work. It was hours and hours of having fun, creating art, studying other games and their animations, learning some foundations & theory.\n\nThere wasn't any single magical moment. I had to be mindful, step back, and realize how easy and fast it was, and that even if a project was difficult, I understood enough to begin working on it.\n\nIt is okay if you find you have gaps in your knowledge, those are areas to improve in.

Thus, the code that calls the function with the pointer is also responsible for telling us how big it is.

It's how you talk about it that makes it float.  So here `scores` is a pointer when it gets to the function. We've told our program the type referenced by that pointer is float.  To be clear, it could be a single float at the memory location or thousands.  Once you pass that pointer, the actual size gets lost.  As, hopefully, seen in that trace above.",

Key terms in bold.\n\n    float arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};\n\nThe **name/symbol** `arr` **aliases** the **address** (assigned by the compiler) of some **storage** (allocated somewhere at compilation time or runtime) that has a specified **value** (or values in the case of arrays) of a certain **type**. A **pointer** type is a type that stores addresses as values (pedants: yes, I've read the standard and this is good enough here). Example with address annotations in parens:\n\n    float a(0x01) = 0.1f; // addr 0x01 (alias a) contains value 0.1f.\n    float *b(0x05) = &a = 0x01; // addr 0x05 (alias b) contains value 0x01 (a's addr).\n\nName/symbol, address, storage, type, and value, are distinct things. Names mean we don't have to write addresses (though you can, and do in embedded). Storage for a single object (not in the OOP sense, object = datum here) can of course be larger than a single address. Value is what is in that region of memory when read at a given time. Books can be written here (E.g. *Modern C*, Gustedt), this isn't supposed to be exhaustive.\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. It's the address of the first byte of the first element in the array.\n2. Those are expressions that yield results of pointer type. Dereference and addressof operators can be thought of as inverses, yes. The reason you can write a function that takes a pointer and then pass an array is because of the language semantics, no doubt influenced by what is happening on the hardware. When passing by value in C++, the values of the arguments are copied into the target function's stack frame (usually, compilers are clever and will elide things). How do we efficiently copy an array here? We don't. We say that arrays \"decay\" to pointers in this scenario, and we copy a smaller fixed-size pointer value instead (fits in a register, nice!). Referencing the above, we've copied the (base) address of the storage of the array into the storage for the function parameter. We have a pointer value that we can dereference and/or do pointer arithmetic on. **Whereas the original name/symbol (arr) aliased the address of the first element directly, the parameter stores that same address as a value. In this situation, the language doesn't force us to explicitly take the address using an expression and then pass it, it effectively does it for us.**\n\nHopefully that makes sense. I do recommend both K&R C and Modern C if you want to go beyond this summary. I simplified and left things out.",

        "body": "We have to go back to C for an understanding. K&R developed C on a PDP-6, which typically had ~144 KiB of memory. They thought arrays were too large to be passing around by value, like you could any other value type:\n\n    void fn(int pass_by_value);\n\n    int main() {\n      int value_gets_copied_on_the_stack;\n\n      fn(value_gets_copied_on_the_stack);\n\nSo they decided that they would 1) pass by reference as a language feature to be more efficient, and 2) hide the reality from you:\n\n    void fn(int array[123]);\n\n    int main() {\n      int gets_passed_by_reference[123]);\n\n      fn(gets_passed_by_reference);\n\nIn C parlance - a pointer references a value. What you DON'T see is how the parameter type decays:\n\n    void fn(int *this_is_the_reality);\n\nThe array itself doesn't decay - instead, it implicitly converts. You will not be informed, you will not be told, you will not be warned, and there's nothing you can to to prevent this. Again: LANGUAGE FEATURE. Notice the compiler completely strips out the array size.\n\nThanks, K&R, for whatever the fuck this is about...\n\nThe array is of type `int[123]`. The parameter is of type `int *`. The type system does recognize the array as a distinct type - where the size is a part of the type signature. We can even capture that in C:\n\n    typedef int[123] int_123;\n    typedef int* int_ptr;\n\n    void fn(int_ptr pointer_to_int);\n\n    int main() {\n      int_123 array;\n\n      fn(array);\n\nSo what exactly is going on with pointers? The term is: Type Erasure. We are intentionally losing information about what the pointer points to. This can be powerful. Are we pointing to a single element or the first of an array? One past the end of the array? Heap or stack? Local, global, or member? Cast?\n\nWe don't know SHIT about what that pointer is pointing at, other than that address right there \"is an int\". As far as the code and compiler is concerned, that's all we got. If you're willing to make some assumptions, you can write some abstract code that can do some interesting things. You can access, you can iterate, you can delimit, you can reinterpret...\n\nBut unlike any other type in C, this means that when I pass an `int` by value, I'm working on a copy that exists on the stack, but if I pass an array by value, I'm reading and writing the original array in place. And remember that C didn't even GET `const` until C99...\n\nType erasure is useful for writing all manner of abstractions. You can look at how `bsearch` is written and used, for an example. If you had to know what kind of thing you were pointing at, you'd have to have a local `int` pointer, a member `int` pointer, an array `int` pointer... It becomes an alias of limited value - often we want to operate upon a type without wanting to know too much detail.\n\nOh, there are more specific pointer types...\n\n    struct s {\n      int i, j, k;\n    };\n\n    int main() {\n      s instance;\n\n      int struct s::* ptr_to_member_int_of_s = &instance.i;\n\nFeel free to get more specific if it serves a utility. Such things are used less often.\n\n---\n\nSo we've lost type information. Is there a way we can preserve it? Yes.\n\n    void fn(int (*array)[123]);\n\nThe extra parenthesis are necessary. This is still C; `array` here is a pointer, which means it can be null. C++ gives us references:\n\n    void fn(int (&array)[123]);\n\nI hate the syntax. Luckily, this is what type aliases are for - since pointers are a distinct type:\n\n    // C++ using alias...\n    using int[123] = int_123;\n    using int_123* = int_123_ptr;\n    using int_123& = int_123_ref;\n\n    void fn1(int_123 &pass_by_ref);\n    void fn2(int_123_ref also_pass_by_ref);\n\n    void fn3(int_123 decay_to_ptr);\n\nDon't get fooled by aliases. They don't make types, they only name them. You won't get value semantics for array parameters just because you've aliased it.\n\nThis makes your code safer. Type information is preserved, you are referencing a more specific type. It also means the compiler can optimize more aggressively. But the size is a part of the type, so `fn1` and `fn2` won't work with ANY other type. `int[234]`? Go fuck yourself.\n\nContinued...",

When you apply with only knowing C, the non-technical HR recruiter will probably gloss over your resume.

Being able to turn an idea into something working without depending on others gives you a lot of speed and clarity early on.\n\nRegarding Rails vs full-stack JavaScript, it really comes down to focus. Rails is great for learning how a product is put together on the backend and lets you ship quickly because it’s very structured and opinionated. JavaScript can feel messier at first, but using the same language for both frontend and backend is powerful if your goal is to build products on your own and understand the whole stack.\n\nIn practice, the language matters less than finishing projects. While building theORQL, what helped the most wasn’t choosing the “perfect” stack, but learning how to build, break things, debug, and iterate quickly. Those skills transfer no matter what you use.",

        "body": ">I have never felt so dumb and overwhelmed. I can't even solve basic array problems. I've been trying to study the patterns like sliding window and two pointer and can usually identify when to use them.\n\nFor this kind of stuff, then for me it's essential to have a well-illustrated example, in order to really understand. For example, you used the term \"sliding window\", which gave my brain a vague inkling of what you're talking about, but not yet enough to have a \"picture\" in my mind of what you're really trying to solve.\n\nThen I used Google and found this Answer which is illustrated beautifully: [What is Sliding Window Algorithm? Examples? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples)\n\nAnyway, as the Answerer points out, calling it a \"sliding window algorithm\" is really a misnomer; it is a useful technique, though.\n\nSo, how does one get better at using this technique? Well, you've got to practice it, of course. The example shown in that Q&A is a pretty good starter problem (find the maximum sum of n consecutive numbers); you can adapt that to almost anything (e.g. find the lowest average of n consecutive numbers, find a particular small sequence within a large stream of numbers, etc.).\n\nFor this example, I'd see the \"sliding window\" approach as an optimization of the brute force approach. That is, solve it first with the \"brute force\" approach (which will still be 'efficient' in computational terms, but will be a factor of n slower than necessary), and then solve it again with a sliding window approach.\n\nSolving a problem twice may sound lame or may sound like unneeded extra work, but in a situation like this will be satisfying because first, you'll be able to measure exactly how much faster the better approach is, and second, you'll have a \"testing client\" against which you can test your 'better' approach. For something like this, it's usually easier to make  a mistake in the implementation of the more clever approach, so a handy testing method is to make a testing driver that solves your problems using both approaches.\n\n(I.e. the test driver tests some sample testing inputs against the 'dumb' solution way, as well as against the 'clever' solution way) and then stops if two clients give different results (which indicates that ONE of the approaches must be wrong for that particular input). Usually you'll end up with a bug or two in the 'clever' way, but by systematically comparing with the 'dumb' way, you can normally lay such bugs to rest in a fairly straightforward way (debugging will still be work to do it, of course, but it will never feel like you're totally stuck, because you'll have the alternate version to compare against).\n\n>I've seen many people say they took courses or they learned it in college, but I just cannot afford an expensive course let alone going to college. Does anyone have some advice?\n\nRobert Sedgewick et al's course on Algorithms is available free of charge on Coursera, the last time I checked (for auditing it); it's a pretty good course. You'll need the textbook to do the course properly, but I suppose you can find a low-cost edition, use a library, etc. if you cannot afford to buy that book.",

After completing those two parts, I was well-prepared for the slog through the algorithms course. \n\nGood luck on your learning journey!",

I usually switch to docs once I know roughly what I want to do and just need specifics like syntax or edge cases.

It wouldn’t make sense to read the whole documentation from front to back before you open your text editor. Similarly, you wouldn’t want to implement a brand new project each time you completed a new section of their docs; that’d be too many projects.\n\nYour best bet is to have a loose idea as for you want to build, and then implement the things you learn as you go. And ofc you will learn stuff you don’t need, but you can try those things out and then leave them behind.\n\n*disclaimer*: if you are fairly comfortable with the material you’re trying to learn (if you are already familiar with it or similar tech) then you may actually just read their documentation and not need to implement to practice.",

Having the frontend skills, even if you don't enjoy it, may be the factor that gets you an offer. I should mention, I am a full-stack dev on paper, but the work my team does focuses on backend and backend infrastructure, with ocassional frontend work. What I'm trying to say is that you can be a full stack dev and still have minimal front-end work.\n\n>Would switching to backend now be a mistake, or is it better than forcing myself to continue frontend?\n\nWrap up TOP if you're still working on it, but I wouldn't go looking for another frontend course afterwards, if anything, just go as far as needed with a framework like React or Angular, but no need to become an \"expert\". Just make sure you're in a good spot to do full-stack apps.",

Each team can ship the services they own independently of other teams, which allows them to iterate faster and respond more quickly to issues.\n2. Security isolation. Isolating functionality reduces the blast radius if a component is compromised. If a monolith is compromised, then the attackers potentially have full access to everything.\n3. Reliability isolation. Similar to security isolation, reliability isolation means there is a smaller blast radius when a component fails. Following from #1, devops will also be easier when your teams only need to understand the components they own and deploy instead of needing to understand the whole monolith during on-call incidents.\n4. Scaling mismatches. Monoliths that contain multiple functional paradigms (for example both async batch processes and synchronous requests) can be very difficult to scale, performance tune, and cost tune. It is easier to scale and performance/cost tune systems when functional paradigms are isolated into separate services.\n5. Licensing/distribution issues. This one is probably the rarest in this list, but sometimes you need to isolate components due to billing/licensing/other business agreement purposes. Especially for per-cpu licenses, which kind of overlaps with #4.\n\nIf you don't need anything in 1-5, then a monolith is probably fine.",

Unfortunately, I've seen diminishingly few video lecture series that are organized in this way (i.e. none). Sometimes, video lectures on platforms like Coursera have a limited amount of this kind of organization, e.g. \"pause the video and try to work out the solution\" type of stuff, but usually the problems presented in that kind of video situation are very simple \"fill in the blank\" or \"answer a conceptual question\" variety.\n\nTLDR: Get a textbook.",

You can't tackle any larger project, can't work together with others, etc. without understanding how a small part of a problem solved with code contributes towards solving a larger problem.\n\nIn practical terms when you get a DSA exercises if I were you I'd just invest a little more time into planning, before doing the actual coding.\n\n- If it's more of a linear problem (you can tell if the problem reads like a sequential recipe) you can add markers or paragraph breaks where you think sub-problems start and end\n\n- if the problem description is more \"wild\" and all over the place instead of just trying to pull the problem apart through line breaks it's probably better if you create a list which on level 1 contains milestones and on level 2 contains the actual sub-tasks.

If ypu want a good pattern here is a good one KISS. Keep it simple, stupid - it means what you do, do it as straightforward as you can. \n\nA good example is what redux do. In react if you have a state, and need to share it between few components you need to pass it as props through they common parent, but it is a bit hard and really unobvious, so redux was made so you have a common state where you can reach in for the data to a singleton.\n\nThis solution is better because it simplifies something that is used often and that isunobvious to do.",

Always be ready and willing to do the work that your experience tells you needs to be done.\n\n\nTake just one item from the list above, like reviews. A person who just \"knows a language\" often thinks, \"Hey, the code works. Why do I need anyone to review it? Why can't I just commit it and move on to the next thing?\" A good developer can explain *in detail* why reviews are needed, could teach a half-hour seminar on how to conduct an effective code review, and supply painful memories of times when poor or nonexistent reviews led to costly mistakes and recrimination.",

While they are trying to help people, the company was still run in a way that I didn't find that great as an employee.  They sell candidates on the idea that their work is going to help sick people and how it is a privilege for you do be working there.\n\nIt's such a privilege that you should take 20% - 30% below market to work there.  That money you leave on the table is said to be reinvested back in to the company, but it really just goes in to the CEO's theoretical pockets.\n\nYou would think that you can at latest create great devices for patients to use with rich features and so forth.  The reality is you meet bare minimum FDA standards for a safe product and go no further.  The problem at the companies I worked for is that you were not selling to the end user.\n\nYou are making money from insurance companies on things like disposable components that you change each treatment. A dialysis machine is expensive and the vast majority of people on dialysis are paying for it with insurance and not out of pocket.  That means investing on making a really nice UX is not any priority.\n\nAt the companies I worked at they don't make extra money investing a lot of time and effort on a well thought out UX, weather that is the UI or the physical device. From what I saw you give them the bare minimum and call it done.  All the time and money is really in the patient safety aspects of the device.\n\nAs long as you don't kill people having them need to click some extra buttons to start their treatment or wait a little longer for treatments to complete is ok, because when you have kidney failure the choices are using the device or die while you wait for a kidney transplant.\n\nThis could just be the companies I have worked at and not what other companies do.  And the old idea that shitty companies won't make money and go out of business wasn't my experience.  These companies have been around since the early 80's and making money hand over first.\n\nAll of the devices were designed in a way to require constant payments from insurance companies through components that needed to be replaced periodically, if not after each treatment.  Oh and who makes these components with custom connections that only fit our devices?  Oh we do, so buy them from us!\n\nYes after 20 years or something like that when the patent experiences it is a free for everybody to use, but at that point the company has already released other medical devices, with new patents, and different special connections.  So it's just a constant cycle of making money.\n\nSo are these companies evil?  No, no directly.  Though I don't think they are making the best product they can for the end user either.",

For careers that last decades, expect to do several different things.\n\nAdditionally, being capable of working at \"the edge\" is a skill in and of itself: high conceptual fluidity, creativity, curiosity, et cetera. The folks working on an emerging field like AI will probably be the same folks working on the next thing, and whatever that is it will require people to be adaptable and self-learning engineers.\n\nAll that said, nobody knows what's going to happen next. AI is certainly a powerful tool for software that won't go away, but if the bubble pops know one knows how that will affect the field. We might see a hiring boost, since companies will finally realize they won't be automating engineers away, or we could see even more money drain out of the ecosystem.\n\nIdk, \"no one knows the future\" is sort of the fun thing about this field.

If you just let other companies hire and train up juniors, then you can snap up the good ones that make it without the training costs.",

Remember you were once a junior who was mentored by seniors early in your career, jumped many ships & became what you are today. You & I were lucky as organizations were hiring juniors, mentored for months to add value. It's nothing short of hypocrisy when you say they take time to be productive as if you & I were adding value right from day one.\n\n\nWhoever says junior Devs aren't worth the cost must do reality checks.\n\nThe real problem is offshoring, over expectations on AI & greedy organizations who care nothing for young blood & fresh ideas rather only interest in saving costs & shareholder appreciations. \n\nI say this as a senior engineer.",

        "body": "This is going to be a copy paste of a reply that I gave to a similar question. It’s my honest experience. No at least where I am, it’s not just a small companies thing. Here it goes:\n\nI can offer my perspective as a junior. Got a job a year before graduation.\n\nTLDR: It’s still possible to make it, but you need a degree *with* internships. If you want to guarantee yourself a job, it’s going to be *hard* work, unless you’re a genius. I’m not a genius. Caveat that I’m Canadian, the market might be better or worse where you are.\n\nMore details to give you an idea: \nI left my previous stem degree in 2022 when I realized that it wasn’t likely to yield a stable job. I started the CS degree in 2022. I’d programmed a bit before, always liked math and it seemed like a field with a bright future. I jumped in. \n\nThings turned sour for my cohort very quickly. By late 2022, many internships were rescinded, postings on universities’ coop programs dropped dramatically, the layoffs *started*. I was pretty dismayed by this to be honest, I’d left a degree that I loved in large part for improved job prospects and now there was a very real chance that it had been a poor decision. \n\nMy family and I are really not rich (lower middle class at best) so I didn’t have much a choice, I wasn’t sure what else I could do either so I decided to work *hard*. I got perfect grades, I worked on eyebrow raising side projects, I TAed a math heavy class (thanks to my previous background in my other degree), I prepped for interviews. Got my first internship in my first year of the CS degree. Had to move to a different city temporarily for it. I didn’t quite like the particular field that it was in but it was really important for my CV, I finished it and got a good review. Didn’t want to stay in the city I moved to, so I decided to find another internship. \n\nKept doing all of the above mentioned extracurriculars and still kept my grades very high. Meanwhile, things kept deteriorating for most of my cohort, the “best” students got internships, the majority did not. Keep in mind that I’m in coop so internships are *mandatory*.\n\nPrepped harder for interviews. Got a bigger company for the second one. If my first internship taught me anything it’s that if you want to be kept on after in this job market, you better be really good. I hit the ground running at this one, lost track of the hours I put into upskilling for it. I also took classes to not put off my graduation date. By the end of the 4 months, I was shipping year end deliverables. They were pretty happy and kept me on. Salary is about 80-90k TC. Quite good for a new grad in Canada. It’s been a huge relief and I’m immensely grateful for it.\n\nEnd all be all, success story in adverse job market conditions, but I want to be honest with you. I haven’t had a life for the past 2 and a half years or so. It’s literally all been school and working on side projects and interview prep and TAing. Now it’s working and still going to school. My relationship blew up and I haven’t been able to date because I just don’t have time, I don’t see my friends often. My own family that I live with doesn’t even talk to me often because I’m always in my room working one way or the other, they’re understanding and supportive though.\n\nI don’t want to complain at all because this is a thousand times preferable to being poor, but I want to highlight that this is what it takes to *guarantee* yourself a job now. You have to be the best of the best, whatever best means to the job market. Most of my cohort has not gotten internships and quite a few universities are working out deals with students: decreasing the number of internships, loosening the requirements of what classes to take when, actively involving themselves in our search. The situation has continued to devolve, at the entry level, things are not improving but actively getting worse.",

Being full stack is ideal and will allow you to maximize opportunities. Two best languages to learn for backend development are still java or c#, but you’d likely need some professional experience using them for it to be worth putting on a resume. I’m not sure what “full stack direction” means, but it seems like you’re primarily a frontend dev, which typically doesn’t pay as well. The vast majority of companies will not be using a JS framework for a backend because the language is not robust enough for large scale backend development. It’d be really valuable to learn a statically typed backend language like java and c# along with some SQL. Companies really want those kind of things",

This includes making it easier for authorizing officials to approve the use of AI in high-consequence development. Things move more slowly in the defense space, and with good reason: there's a lot of well-warranted concerns about agentic AI, for instance. That being said, the major AI firms are working closely with government partners to secure FedRAMP approval and the like. In the meantime, I know people who are concerned about not getting exposure to new tech in their job, and you're not alone in that.\n\nAnyway, I'll tell you what my manager told me, which is that your career development is ultimately your responsibility. It's very easy to feel like you're stagnating if you're not intentional about professional development. That's true no matter where you work and no matter what stage you're at in your career. \n\nIf I were you, I would have an earnest conversation with your manager to identify opportunities for you to develop your skills further. And by skills, I mean that very holistically; it's not just about learning specific technologies, but also soft skills like leadership and other complementary talents. For example, I'm looking into taking a statistics course since that's something that comes up often in my work. I also have set a performance goal to read at least two articles on relevant topics each week. Regardless of whether you plan to change careers, you can be cultivating a transferrable skill set; if you don't, these anxieties are likely to follow you wherever you go.",

The only difference is the tools in your toolbox. Engineering majors do a much better job teaching this than CS.\n\n- you’re better prepared for data/noise analysis. P99 metrics, understanding distributions or finding a root cause for skew etc are all covered in EE, and I notice people with pure CS struggle with it\n\n- harder to self teach: my labs had $100k+ worth of equipment to learn on, whereas I was able to self teach software development using online resources. \n\nRE harder for AI to disrupt: I don’t agree with that as we’ve already seen LLMs used for spice simulation, verilog, etc. you can represent a schematic as text just like a program.",

This is speaking as someone who has worked as a mechanical engineer (product designer) and an electrical engineer and currently works in software; software is leagues ahead of the other fields in terms of pay and benefits. Software also lets you work wherever you want; as a meche for example, a large part of the job markets is located in the middle of the country in relatively less desirable LCOL areas, and these companies are often boomer-led and have outdated work practices.\n\nThis sub tends to glorify other fields similarly to how it glorifies the trades.

Also in each engineering type you specialized in your career and those all have their own swings. \n\nLet’s take civil for example. You have transportation, structure, utilities, water resources as some big sections. Utilities, and water resources tend to be the most stable as they have long contracts and steady work.  Plus they can and will do work for other sections. Transportation is boom or bust. If the local DOT slows down or shuts down work they are in a bad spot and harder to cross train. Structure is very heavy tide to construction so boom or bust. \n\nYou see sections in cs like that as well but we can and do jump industries fairly easily so it is much more wild. I am in my 4th industry in my career and most likely not my last. Every time I changed jobs I change the  industry I am working for.  My wife is on her 4th employer but same base industry the entire time in civil engineering (water resources).

My general approach, was to focus first on my own skills (the masters), then focus on the job skills (becoming tech lead), then finally optimize for hiring skills (LC + Systems Design + Behavioral). If you just focus on the interview skills, it's going to be difficult to really come across as an experienced engineer without the projects and wins on the job to back it up.\n\nHere's how I did it:  \n1. Take jobs at increasingly larger or better paying companies. You might not go \"small\" -> \"big tech\" in one jump, but push your limits and apply to scale-up companies with solid VC funding and lots of ex-big-tech employees.  \n2. Take every leadership opportunity you can, especially those unpaid \"tech lead\" or \"team lead\" spots. You're paycheck doesn't reflect the extra responsibility, but you're experience will be considerably better, and that should come across in interviews.  \n3. If you don't have a CS degree, go get your masters. This will accelerate how fast you grow as a junior/mid level engineer, and get you the technical profeciency to be a senior much faster. Plus, for a self-taught guy like me, it removes any sort of education difference.  \n4. Continue learning. Read books, work on projects, do whatever, just keep learning.",

Either you know what the impact is, or you don't. It is ok to ballpark and \"saved X dev hours\" is a type of claim I've seen many times.\n\nFor some things, we call them \"zero-to-one\" initiatives, where the impact of completion/rollout of the feature is self-explanatory (e.g. \"there was no two factor auth, now there is\")\n\nThe real catch is that metrics solely for STAR format's sake won't necessarily look good, and it's a backwards way of thinking about things. E.g. \"saved dev hours\" sure, but to what end? Do they actually deliver more features or does the time end up being spent on other ancillary tasks w/ same overall velocity anyways?\n\nMetrics are supposed to provide finality to an overarching story that has actual metrics, so that the narrative sounds coherent rather than an aimless rambling. Just tacking on whatever metric to the end of a project doesn't necessarily make for a compelling STAR format story, just like adding sprinkles to the top of a poop cake doesn't make it a nice cake.",

They ballpark a number based on what they know and slap it in there expecting nobody to dig in too far.\n\nI think having actual real metrics comes easier working at some companies vs others.  If you are at a company where the SW team comes up with their own work then part of that is justifying why it's important to do.  More times than not metrics are likely to fall out of that.  \n\nAll of my 15 YOE has been at R&D companies working on greenfield medical device projects, think dialysis machines.  It was very top down management style where you do as you are told at the product level. SWEs have control of code level design, but not really the direction of the product\n\nSo asking me to justify why did I implement X major feature over 1 year is on the level of asking why did you put as gas and break pedal in a car or why is there an infotainment system in the car.  It's there because it's expected to be there if you want people to use your product.\n\nSo asking me to put in metrics on my resume is pretty hard since we are implementing things on the project for the first tome and not iterating and improving something.  Why did we need some feature comes down to the product owner saying this is what is needed based on conversations with X/Y/Z important person at the end of the day.\n\nThere is obviously all shades of grey between the two extremes I gave as examples.  Frankly I have no actual metrics on my resume.  My bullets are along the lines of:  I accomplished \\[X\\], that provides \\[Y\\] value, by doing \\[Z\\].  It works ok enough to get some visibility, but I don't have companies banging down my door to get me to interview or anything like that.",

Usually it's called \"real time programming\" or High performance computing (HPC). It involves supercomputer or regular computer to solves problem or process immense amount of data. Or it could be low latency code. Anything that is not web based usually will be subject to a tighter ressources allocation and thus performance being more important. Think of something mass produced, throwing 50$ more for better ram because you produced shit code and the price of the product is around 50$... It's just not acceptable.\n\n\nA real life example:\nSicentific computing is usually very computing heavy for things like simulations or lots of dimensional processing (think RGBs processing but on 280++ channels instead of just 3). These sometimes have tight performance requirements such as processing before another data package is generated. \n\n\nMy job is essentially that. I take bleeding edge reasearch code in python made by physicist and optimize the shit out of it so it takes little to no time to process. Initially the processing time was 18h ++ per dataset and now it's down to sub 2h making it so that we process faster than we acquire. This means it's processed in real time and you can have the results immediately which is neat for aviation decision, threat detection and all stuff highly critical.\n\n\nUsually it will require you to work with people of other domain which is very fun I think. You become good at physics, geospatial and other math heavy domain which makes leetcode feels even more stupid (because the time/space complexity is not all you look for in performance computing and usually one of the easiest thing to optimize). \n\n\nOverall, it's a very rewarding field as you may be recruted for satellites, geospatial, lots of physics project that are bleeding edge, quantum computing, etc. ",

You're not being paid to sit around and twiddle your thumbs. You're paid to solve problems, and do so efficiently. That means the problems you can solve on the job will at most be slightly above your certain skill set; not in a different league altogether.\n\n>There is no pair-programming so you can't exchange ideas or receive guidance on how to solve or implement them.\n\nThis is where you talk to other people and ask for help. Also, \"pair programming\" is not how people usually work. You can look at the odd problem together, or talk through a piece of code - but, no companies are not paying two people to do the job of just one person.\n\nOverall, there usually is room to grow - you can pick the hard tickets, you can make suggestions for projects or initiatives, you can refactor things to be better, .... all of that is where you grow.",

You should relax!\").  **If you're ambitious, never listen to anyone who tells you to relax.**  Take that as their own personality or goals being incongruent with yours and shed their advice like dust off your shoulder.\n\n\\- Then took a few grad school IT (\"MIS\") and Statistics courses\n\n\\- Moved to SF Bay.  The combo of Digital Marketing, SQL & R / Statistics knowledge from grad school classes helped me land a data integration job in a marketing company\n\n\\- Was tough to break into 100% Software Engineering w/o some real programming projects and a portfolio, so I created a prototype full stack app.  **(I lived in a tent** while working at cafes/libraries; **on a rural ranch** while doing **landscaping part time for rent**; and **later, in mexico after camping on a California beach became too tough** due to people waking me up for trespassing)-- my Dad's advice of \"How much do you want it?\" echoing in my mind when I'd need to encourage myself.  As well as motivational music, and motivational speeches, regularly playing in my headphones while building the app for about 6 months-- 2-3 months of that involved just learning, 3-4 months was knowledgeably building or trial/error building)\n\n\\- Two weeks later, landed remote job doing full stack clojure (programming language)\n\n\\- 2 months later, hired as a digital marketing / data engineering consultant\n\nAfter that last job, it was all down hill-- had recruiters regularly contacting me.  Applied to jobs and landed interviews decently easily.  Worked a variety of contract & salaried full stack jobs.  Even got into a DevOps job by continuing to learn new skills at work and in free time.\n\nThen the industry took a big shit in 2022-2023 due to a confluence of: AI, H1B, Tax law changes, Covid money running out.\n\nI got laid off.

For one, very surprised to not see Chip Huyen's Designing ML systems book on the preparation side. I would strongly recommend that as a must-read. It focuses on the entire ML development lifecycle. I also think a lot of people overlook the fundamentals of stats, linear algebra, etc. These are especially important for measuring model performance. It's great if you can talk about system design, but I always expect candidates to be able to talk about if a model makes sense for a use case in the design round before we get into whiteboarding.\n\nAlso, outside of MAANG I actually see a lot more system design and knowledge questions than actually coding questions outside of maybe a leetcode easy for basic competency, so depending on the role you are targeting I would de-prioritize coding in favor of system design and model fundamentals. \n\nBest of luck finding and landing an MLE role",

It sounds to me like you are thinking in terms of android apps that are front-ends (effectively, websites). Thus, your logical conclusion is that to gain 'more depth' and employability, you should develop expertise in all parts of the application (i.e., backend).\n\nI want to challenge that point of view, and emphasize a few job-niches where smartphone apps really leverage the local computing power of a Snapdragon-level processor. In these cases, the app is not only a *part* of the project, it is *integral*. The android expertise you have is incredibly valuable for this use case.\n\nTake [ATAK-Civ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ) for example. It is a micro-ecosystem of apps and plugins that are used as tools for first-responding and security. Companies develop ATAK plugins using standard android tools, to do things like build software controllers for drones within ATAK, or stream health data from smartwatches of field operatives.\n\nAlternatively, Android (the operating system) is used by some companies for their own non-smartphone products. I recently interviewed with a company that builds treadmills. The treadmills use stock android for their OS and applications to serve standard functionality to their users and control hardware.\n\nThese are small companies, sure. There are hurdles to finding these, especially since you're not in the US. You will have to do research to find such companies. And they may pay less than a large company like the one you're at, because the scale of the revenue they generate is going to be intrinsically smaller (the other side of that coin is that the revenue is shared with fewer individuals, so you may actually get paid pretty well anyway). But they are working on *cool shit,* and they want experts in the tools to help them do so.\n\nSource: I am one of those guys working on cool shit",

Like Postgres + CRUD queries in a common language is useful for fullstack and backend.\n\n>i know that if going down the cybersecurity route I can get some certs such as sec+ or something\n\nCerts are worthless for jobs that require a CS degree. Tech support with no degree, yeah, A+ is a good idea.\n\n>being able to eventually either work remotely or transition to more of a freelancer to have more freedom\n\nRemote jobs are no longer common and get the most applications. Two remote jobs I had transitioned to 3-4 days in the office. Else we were laid off. Freelancer is a bad idea. You'll cut your pay by 5x living in a rich country. The work experience is not seen as legit by recruiters either. You could just be making it up.\n\nI had a problem with small businesses not wanting to a sign contract and saying they'll just pay me at the end.\n\n>but AI the most although I had more of a natural aptitude to networking/security.\n\nComments are right. No one will hire you for an AI job without a graduate degree or 5+ years of directly applicable experience. Can see the job postings for yourself. I was looking at AI jobs just last week and couldn't apply to any.\n\nCen learn 1 of Azure, AWS or GCP and get the database to work in it. If you know one, you can usually get a pass on the other 2. Real world isn't the classroom. You can do just fine if you didn't like the class.",

And looks like you’re doing that already. \n\n\nWith my job and what worked for me was asking my team leader if there were any areas where he felt I was lacking or could improve. The company had fortnightly 1 on 1 with me and my team leader so I could have regular private conversations and ask about my performance. \n\nFor “stepping up” for that getting ahead in your own time management is good, if I was running short on work and would have nothing to do soon, I would shoot an email to my team leader giving him an update on my progress, that I should be finished soon and ask if there’s anything specific that he wants me to work on next. \n\nAnother good thing to do is shared knowledge. This isn’t something everyone can do in the first year. In my job we recently started trying out a new tool to help speed up debugging part of the software we use, because I had less work I had more time to allocate to learning the specifics and how to set up quickly and link it up. Because of this when senior team members had the time to sit down and go over it, I was able to “train” them on the new tool and pass on everything I learned to speed up their onboarding on the tool. \n\nJust because a team member is senior to you does not mean you can’t help them. Also they won’t know everything. If a senior is asking questions about what will and won’t work, sometimes it’s good to jump in and ask/offer to test the question for them. “I don’t know but I can try and find out for you” has been a great response to many situations at my job.",

The problem right now is that there is no strong signal you can do a job someone is actually paying for. Degrees get you past HR, but projects get you hired only if they look like real work. Generic advice like \"learn a new tech stack\", or \"biuld apps\" don't easily map to real business problems or existing teams.\n\nThat said, I'd recommend doing the following:  \n1. Focus on one of those areas (iOS, dbs, cyber).  \n2. Do projects that directly replicate an existing job function. Not a cool app, but stuff that maps directly to job skills.  \n3. Write them up like professional work.\n\nYou're not too late, but the market isn't going to meet you halfway, you have to make yourself legible as someone who can do the work. That's going to be challening, but the first task is to figure out what exactly the work even is. Use job postings, complaints, and look at the work juniors are assigned, and build a small system into a project that does that.",

That only matters if you're talking to an actual engineer, or engineering manager, who knows the difference between \"wrote HelloWorld in Rust\" and \"on the Rust board of directors\". Most HRBPs/recruiters don't know the difference, and speak \"years of accredited education\" and \"years of professional experience\" exclusively, and those are the people deciding whether your application/resume ever lands in the inbox of a manager with an open [req](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453).\n\nBe sure to emphasize the internship and accredited education in your resume first and foremost. The portfolio, or interesting GitHub personal projects, can and should be a footnote below things recruiters/HRBPs are specifically looking for. I'll also add that tinkering alone, by yourself, on a project is not nearly as useful as collaborating with a team on a project. Because in the real world, most engineers work as a part of a team or teams to get stuff done. Consider contributing to well-known open source projects. Understand that step 0 of contributing meaningfully to most open source projects is: You understand what the project is, and who its end users are, on a deep level. That can take anywhere from days/weeks/years depending on the complexity of the project. And \"I was part of SIG release for Kuberenetes 1.31\" is easier for a recruiter/HRBP to grok than \"look at this chatbot I made, isn't it neat\". It's especially easier to grok if that recruiter/HRBP is staring at a req with the word \"Kubernetes\" in 5 different places.\n\nFor extra emphasis; Fix your resume first before you spend time chasing shiny open source projects. Also, the job market just extra sucks right now -- sorry about that. Not much to be done about organizations shy around adding headcount.",

Lasted 7 years, very good money, same client, remote back then, but...\n\nDespite management claims to the contrary, rebadged IBM'ers didn't seem to have much luck in the assignments marketplace. Never quite found out if there was some mystery field in the HR DB2 table or not, but when her assignment was finally over there was little interest from other IBM locations (remote 100% back then). Same with her few remaining rebadged buddies. \n\nThat was about the time Ginni decided to RA much of the US staff but at least they had decent severance so she got another job quickly and collected severance as well. This was a decade ago, things may have changed since.",

You don't really have a choice, just curriculum wise, you will eventually meet your maker if you believe in memorization as a true learning form. Computer science in that way breaks a lot of traditional learning isms about college in general. Because there IS some very real applied form of it (programming) unlike a lot of other fields that would require more set up.\n\nAnyway, i feel you. The only way to move forward imo is to have one foot in college and one foot out. When you're in school, listen, do the assignments, study etc. When you're out of class, be working on your side projects, doing leetcode, learning some other tool etc. It isn't easy. But it will work!",

You should probably ask yourself how do you actually learn skills.\n\nFor most people, some combination of spaced repetition and recalling things from memory is usually how they retain information. So, transposing to coding, you may need to build the \"muscle memory\" in layers, e.g. first memorize syntax, then memorize specific API signatures, then eventually memorize semantics of the APIs.\n\nSyntax can be learned by just coding a lot and running the code to validate that the syntax is correct. API signatures can be memorized via exercises called Katas (basically do the same thing from memory multiple times) or just using them frequently enough. Semantics start to become easier to memorize once the \"lower\" layers become more second nature.",

And admittedly, the market is, I think, still pretty fucked for juniors at the moment. Questions I usually ask juniors are related to the above questions. But then also I tend to focus on ability to problem solve, take constructive criticism, and ability to work with a team. So I’ll ask questions like;\n\nTell me about a time you were unsure of how to approach a solution. What did you do?\n\nTell me about a time you and a coworker had a disagreement about something, how did you resolve it?\n\nThings like that. First one tells me about your problem solving skills and is an indicator of how recognizing you don’t know what you don’t know. I also ask seniors this except in a way that shows they have the ability to mentor juniors. \n\nThe second one is important because in software there are a million ways to solve one issue. Some better than others, but they’re all a solution regardless. It will let me know how you approach these kinds of situations that come up a lot of times in code reviews and architecting out solutions (no I don’t expect a junior to do this) \n\nBut as a junior, we’re expecting to have to hand hold for a\nGood bit to get you comfortable and get you onboarded.

I recommend if you are aligned for Certification then IIT/IISc/IIIT brand are ok. I am not very keep on certification because in interviews your practical learning experience matters.

Btw, front-end devs dont do UI/UX design. Someone else does that and the FE devs just implement the design given to them.\n\nOnce you feel comfortable using whatever language and library you choose, the next steps are to at least have some basic level of understanding of containerization (docker and kubernetes), cloud engineering (AWS or Azure usually), and CI/CD pipelines (github actions). If you can build a full front-end app, containerize it with docker, and deploy the kubernetes pod to a azure/aws instance using github actions, you should be a really really strong candidate in your interviews.

Honestly, people manage to get CS degrees and jobs without knowing some of this stuff. But if you do go through them all, (maybe needing some research to fill in gaps that course even has) you'll definitely be prepared to start learning CS!",

        "body": "From what I have observed there three kinds of CS students:\n\n1. Most students arrive knowing little to nothing about programming. Maybe they've heard of Python or seen some code, but they've never written a program. This is the *normal* baseline, and intro CS courses are designed for exactly these students.\n2. Some come in with casual exposure. They have built a small website in HTML, played with Scratch, or took a high school programming elective. This gives them maybe a slight head start in the first few weeks, but it evens out quickly.\n3. A small percentage are already hobbyist programmers who've been coding for years. Yes, they exist, but they're the minority. And here's the thing: their presence doesn't hurt you. You aren't competing against them, and professors design coursework knowing students have varied backgrounds.\n\nThe people who struggle in CS usually aren't the ones who came in with zero knowledge...they're the ones who discovered they don't actually enjoy problem-solving, debugging, or the iterative nature of programming. And that's totally valid! Some people switch to Business, Data Science, Engineering, Finance, etc. So just because you begin knowing nothing (which is expected, you are there to *learn* after all), does NOT mean you are guaranteed to fail.\n\n**My advice:** Don't ask \"will I be behind?\" or \"should I be scared?\" But rather ask \"do I enjoy figuring out how things work?\" and \"am I curious about building things with code?\" If yes, you belong there just as much as anyone.\n\nHere's a secret advantage (well, not really secret): CS is one of the few fields where you can preview it before committing. Spend a few weeks with free resources (CS50, Python tutorials, codecademy, etc) and see if it clicks. Build a small todo list in Python or a small static website. If you enjoy it, great! If not, you've learned something valuable before investing years.\n\nGood Luck :)",

It's typical that you would work at the level you're trying to move to for 6 months to a year before getting moved. This applies more to promotions than lateral moves.\n\nAnother option if you're focused on a lateral move is applying internally to another team - for example if there's some sort of internal job board and you see a dev role open on a team you would want to move to, you can apply there. Your application allows the manager on that team to talk to you about a move - without it, they'd have to talk to your manager first and would want to avoid being seen as \"poaching.\"",

Lots of companies use those technologies.\n\nI had Q write me a regex and JMESPath expression yesterday. Very handy for that sort of thing. Q got the JMESPath expression wrong the first time, but after some additional feedback Q was able to correct it. Back in the old days that could've been an hour or two worth of work, which was instead addressed in <15 minutes.\n\nOur intern attempted to have ChatGPT build a Terraform module from scratch by copy+pasting the Jira I wrote for them into it. Laughably bad and difficult to read. I didn't even bother with written feedback in the PR, just sat them down for an hour to talk about how sustainable software gets made. Also reprimanded them for putting proprietary info into a random chatbot. Q and Copilot are our blessed tools.\n\nThe people thinking they can ChatGPT their way through college are in for a bit of rude awakening, but there's nothing wrong with knowing and using AI tools as part of your work. I use Q a few times per week to save myself the drudgery of pouring over Stackoverflow articles, or to troubleshoot a specific stacktrace or error message that doesn't make the problem immediately obvious.",
