It’s like your first programming language, hard at first, but after that, new languages (or tools) are mostly syntax and platform differences.\n\nIn data engineering, the core problems never change:\n\n* Where is the data stored?\n* Where does compute run?\n* How do I move data or compute efficiently?\n* How do I model and serve the data?\n\nWhether it’s Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, or Spark-on-whatever, you’re solving the same underlying problems with different interfaces. Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.\n\nMost content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. \n\nAlso, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster. \n\nI’ve worked across multiple stacks as a consultant, and my approach has stayed the same: understand data, compute, movement, and modelling. The tool is just the means to get there.",

Some candidates tried inviting an AI \"note taker\" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \\*asked\\* if they could do so).\n\nWe then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.\n\nBut every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate \"You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?\"\n\nEvery single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.\n\nI can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",

Snowflake/Databricks mainly give you less platform wrangling in exchange for cost and lock-in. Since you’re new, get one or two sources all the way from Bronze to Gold first, then add pieces only when you hit real pain.",

However, IME for very complicated jobs, the catalyst query optimizer behind Spark performs better than the other two - if you have more than 10ish non-broadcast joins in a given query, I would rather trust spark. You will need to spend more time on a dev setup (e.g. unit tests are awfully slow without a spark connect server which you fire up each morning), but you also get some goodies such as Spark UI/History Server and a really powerful and stable API.\n\n\n- As you are using Delta, I would be cautious with duckdb. Afaict, write support is not yet there, and even for reads I had undocumented not-implemented errors bubble up from the internal c++ code (on1.41 if I remember correctly). The API there does not yet look super stable.\n\n\n- On the off chance that you are in a corporate environment where your development machines run windows, strongly prefer polars over spark. Delta spark on windows is possible but a pain because of the Hadoop dependency.",

Remote is often misunderstood as \"work anywhere at any time\".  Remote more accurately is rephrased as \"work from anywhere within the country you have working rights during specific hours which have been stipulated in a contract\".\n\nYou also have the situation where if you work in the evening and there's nobody there with you, there's a strong possibility you're doing fuck all/maverick shit which is about to murder production tomorrow and there's nobody there to help.\n\nThat being said, no harm in asking.  You have to be okay with accepting this is really unlikely though.",

The entire company is remote.\n\nI can generally work \"U.S. business hours\" but might work East Coast hours one day and West Coast hours the next day depending on what works for my schedule. If I need to be gone for an hour in the middle of the day, I block it off on my calendar. If I need to go to a longer appointment, I'll book it either at the beginning or end of the day, block it off on my work calendar, then let people know in Slack the day before. If I need to flex more than two hours like that, I usually just take half a sick day--I think I get 9 sick days a year? \"Unlimited\" vacation days, though. The assumption is that sick days are short-notice while vacation days are approved in advance.\n\nI usually have two 1-hour meetings on Mondays, then no meetings the rest of the week; every 4-6 weeks, I have a 30-minute meeting with my manager. There is a monthly Engineering \"meeting\", but it's recorded, so you only need to join the Zoom if you feel like watching live or want to ask questions in the Q\\&A; the agenda is provided in advance. Everything else is asynchronous, including the daily standups, Product updates, etc., unless you want to ask someone questions \"live\" to debug a project you're working on. Then, a meeting is scheduled. \"Just hopping on a call\" isn't really a thing in my team, because if you need to ask detailed questions on how to do something, that means the documentation needs to be improved, which means someone needs to write more down for the next person. So again: the call should have an agenda prepared and sent in advance.\n\nI am on-call 24/7 a week at a time, every 6ish weeks. There are rarely pages outside of business hours, though. Only a few times per year.\n\nI would say all the flexibility on my team is because everyone is senior+, so no one really requires close \"supervision\" per se. We also have tight delivery deadlines, so regardless of schedule flexibility, you won't last long if you don't get your work done.",

A lot of good data engineers started exactly where you are, analyst first, then thrown into DE work.\nThose two books are solid choices, especially The Data Warehouse Toolkit. That already puts you ahead of most people watching random YouTube playlists.\nA few practical suggestions that usually help in this transition First you should lean hard into SQL beyond analytics use. Window functions, performance thinking, indexing basics, and understanding how queries behave on larger tables matter way more in data engineering than fancy Python at the start.\nSecond, focus on systems, not tools. You do not need to master every framework. Try to really understand things like how data moves from source to warehouse\nbatch vs streaming at a conceptual level\nidempotency, backfills, and schema changes If you get those ideas, tools become much easier to pick up later.\nThird, build small but realistic projects. Not Kaggle-style analytics, but things like:\ningesting CSV or API data into a warehouse\ntransforming it with SQL\nhandling schema changes or bad data Even simple pipelines teach more than watching videos. For courses on a budget, I would look at Data engineering content from freeCodeCamp and similar channels, but selectively, some Udemy courses can be decent if you wait for sales, just avoid anything that is purely tool-driven without explaining why things are done\nCloud provider docs and tutorials can actually be very good once you know what to look for. since you are already doing DE tasks at work, that is huge. Pay attention to what breaks, what is painful, and what people complain about. That real-world friction is where most learning happens.\nYou do not need a formal degree right now to grow into this role. Curiosity plus hands-on exposure beats structured programs more often than people admit.\nIf you are enjoying the work and asking these questions, you are probably on the right path.",

How much data are you joining per row, as in what is the content of the columns you're joining (if this is big this also causes problems)? Are you increasing the number of rows with these joins? Also, what is actually failing when it does? Try to see what's going on using the Spark UI while it's running to see what's taking so long, or what's going wrong.\n\nI think repartitions and partitions will mess up your performance. Repartitions will be pointless because I think Spark will reshuffle with the next join anyway, and persists make it more difficult for Spark to optimize the entire plan and may take up space on memory / disk, which you may already be lacking.\n\nIf column renaming seems to mess up your execution plan try to do all of the column remaining before the joins (so rename columns for each dataset first) and/or do all the renaming at the end. I don't see how your action plan would result in anything other than a bunch of BroadcastHashJoins with no shuffling in between this way, given all of the joins are joining small tables to a large table on the same unique ID.\n\nAlso check how much memory each executor is using and how the data is distributed across your workers. If your data doesn't fit in your cluster's memory it will become very slow either way.\n\nAll that said, if you're doing 27 joins on 820k rows with max 64 cores it might just take a long time either way.

Even if each side is small, Spark’s optimizer might not treat it that way. Tools like AQE exist to reshape joins dynamically, but in practice they are not always enough, especially if Spark does not recognize your joins as equi joins.\n\nWhat changed the game for us was three things combined:\n\n* Using explicit broadcast hints instead of letting Spark guess, for example `broadcast(df_small)` Forces a BroadcastHashJoin rather than a nested loop join.\n* Reducing the logical plan spike by collapsing intermediate transformations. This means fewer repeated `.withColumn()` calls.\n* Using DataFlint’s plan diff tooling to see where broadcast dropped out. That exposed the real culprit.\n\nYou can tune memory, partitions, and caching, but none of that matters if the plan never selects an efficient join algorithm.",

The problem was OP was changing the vars and that is one of the assumptions for partial parsing.\n\nI have thought of making a package that splits out dbt projects into smaller jobs/selectors to improve compile speed to make this easier in more circumstances. A lot of the workarounds requires airflow or similar but that doesn't help us dbt cloud folk.\n\nAlso, to be clear, parse is likely a misnomer here, dbt doesn't have to touch the db on a parse normally. Compile is what is probably eating OPs compute and time. Even then it's kinda crazy how much time it's taking for them. We have 5000+ models (with thousands of tests too) and it doesn't take that long for a full compile. Like 3-5 minutes. And that's including a lot of introspective adapter calls.\n\nI've also seen other folks manipulate the hash that dbt checks so it doesn't think it needs the full parse as an alternative workaround. It does need something like airflow to do it, given I'm on dbt cloud I can't.",

I don't think this information is really a hard requirement for getting started though.\n\nData engineering is just so incredibly broad. So much of your day to day job is dictated by what size company you end up applying at as well as the industry. For example, Kafka is a foundational piece of tech for a high percentage (forget the actual number) of fortune 500 companies. But it's also totally overkill for many smaller companies who may not need near-real-time analytics or near-real-time data processing.\n\nI'd say to become very comfortable with SQL (postgres and one data warehousing dialect such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery), Python, and dbt. While some may classify dbt as an \"Analytics Engineer\" tool, I think it's a great bridge between the worlds of data analyst and data engineering. Plus it's very common at companies of many different sizes.\n\nThen become comfortable with some form of orchestration tool such as Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or some equivalent of those. For Airflow, there is a MWAA local runner docker image that might be useful for running a local version of Amazon's managed Airflow instance. Just search \"github MWAA local runner\" to find the repo which should have instructions. This is way easier and cheaper than running a real airflow instance.\n\nMaybe just read up on data ingestion tooling such as Airbyte, Fivetran, or Meltano, just to fill in that gap so you understand how transactional data gets loaded into a data warehouse (ELT is a good term to know/research).\n\nAt that point, I'd say the knowledge you've acquired is transferrable to most tools that small to mid-sized companies would require (or at least desire) for an entry level data engineer position.\n\nGood luck!",

Someone saw this post and sent to me so here I am writing my first Reddit reply lol\n\nLance does support most of the catalog on the market, check out this page: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/) I guess I did a bad job marketing these features. I did publish a few blogs, but mostly under the context of integration with compute engines, like [https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/](https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/) and [https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/) . For all the supported catalogs, you can basically use Lance side by side with your Iceberg datasets.\n\nBut I think you raised a great question - \"anyone actually cataloging their lance datasets? or is everyone just yolo-ing it\". I did these integrations because we do have real customers using them. But I do see a common trend that data engineers in enterprise corporations that have data lake, data warehouse or data lakehouse setups, and trying to integrate Lance for AI features tend to want catalog support. For the frontier labs AI engineers, they tend to just prefer having storage-only solution and yolo-ing it.\n\nTo bridge that gap, I also did one catalog within Lance, the Directory Namespace: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/) . It is basically a catalog living in a directory, backed by a Lance table, so everything still stays purely in storage. It is also compatible with just a plain directory of Lance tables, which is typically how people start using lance format, when they do pip install lancedb and create a table. \n\nIn general, most of the users I interact with treat embedding as a part of real data assets. You can definitely store multiple versions of embeddings generated by different models for different use cases or just compare their effectiveness and switch over time. That is actually one key use case for Lance, which is you start with a table with just a single column, maybe images or videos. You continue to do data evolution - add embedding columns, caption columns, feature columns over time, and they accumulate and become a very wide table. That becomes your entire multimodal data asset. Check out some case studies with for example Netflix [https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/](https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/), Runway: [https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/)",

There's a creative tension there that needs some judgement to negotiate, and sometimes, there'll be a shift or some contextual thing that changes that means suddenly it's time to tweak your implementation model again. You need some freedom to be able to do that - but it should be constrained - go too far off-piste and nobody will understand what you're up to.\n\nBack to the question, if you've got multiple dev streams working in the same area, it pays to have a canonical representation that they can all agree on (whether they're human or machine) to support data-sharing and integration later on - therefore, there has to be some design-first approach to data - at least at some level.\n\nIf your approach to that is to all agree on some canonical higher-level model, then you can handle implementation-specific choices by always providing a well documented mapping from your system's model back to the canonical one and get the best of both worlds.",

My career since graduating in 2019 has been built on Spark, and I absolutely love it, but it's going to be a bit complex to learn thoroughly unless you're already comfortable with Scala or Python. Snowflake (SF) would probably be much easier to learn as SF is more of a SQL-first paradigm; I'd recommend learning **Iceberg** in parallel to SF.\n\nMaybe look into experimenting with real time streaming solutions as well like (Kafka / SQS) + (Spark Streaming / Flink / Golang) to stream table changes (CDC) from an RDBMS (e.g. Postgres) into an Iceberg table that could be queried via Snowflake.\n\nAlso be sure to know when to use a row-based file format (e.g. Avro) and when to use column-based format (e.g. Parquet).\n\nFrom there you'll have a solid starting point in the SQL + Snowflake + Iceberg world and can branch out to the Spark + Databricks + Delta world if required or curious.",

        "body": "Had this exact naming debate when I consolidated three separate orchestration systems last year.\n\nHonestly the term depends on what you want to communicate:\n\n\"Job Control Framework\" or \"Job Control Tables\" is the most established. Goes back to mainframe batch processing. If your metadata drives what runs and when, this fits.\n\n\"Pipeline Metadata Store\" is more modern, emphasizes you're tracking pipeline state rather than just \"jobs.\" Works well if you're in a dbt/Airflow world.\n\n\"Orchestration Control Tables\" if you want to be explicit that this layer is decoupled from your actual data models.\n\n\"Run Manifest\" is borrowed from dbt. Better if your metadata is more about \"what happened\" (observability) vs \"what should happen\" (control).\n\nI'd skip anything with \"connector\" unless it's actually handling source system connections. That term is overloaded now, half the modern data stack thinks connector = Fivetran/Airbyte-style ingestion.\n\nQuick side note: if you're manually querying these tables at job start to figure out dependencies and last-run timestamps, might be worth checking if your orchestrator exposes that natively through its metadata DB or API. Saves you from maintaining two sources of truth for job state..and a huge future headache.\n\nWhat orchestrator are you on?",

But it's a way to get you practical experience on something end-to-end without being too high stakes.\n\nIf you really want to practice before you join, build a DAG in Airflow just to understand how it works. Meta uses Data Swarm as an orchestrator which is most similar to Airflow, but they've abstracted so much as to make it trivial to create a new DAG. With Data Swarm you're not even really building a DAG, you're just building the config and the back end logic is doing most of the work for you. \n\nThey also have a custom visualization software, so play around with the free version of Looker or Tableau. Most onboarding projects are going to be something like \"take this raw data, build a denormalized / aggregate table, build a dashboard on it\"\n\nIf you can do those things, write good SQL, and write basic Python, you're already ready for the job.",

Theory rarely ever applies in the real world, the data and how you get it dictates what you do and in this field most cases, you have 0 control over the source of the data. Which means almost nothing operates like it should and you just have to get the data as accurate as possible, as efficiently as possible space, and processing wise.\n\n  \nTo me, Bronze always matches source, or at least as close to it as you can possibly get. If it doesn't, you are going to have a horrible time running down why things don't match up. Snapshotting like option A is really only good for if you need to see how things have changed over time, or doing day to day comparisons at the Bronze level and I'd rarely ever want to do that because that's honestly a waste of space and processing. \n\n  \nAs for Option C, I would avoid anything that makes data right after the fact and there's a point in time where non-dirty read data is inaccurate.

The concerns are contradictory, if you know what I mean. \n\n\nI'm a DE and I don't think AI can take my job in the next 5 years. Nobody is gonna tell AI what the data looks like for security reason and also it's just spouting things based on probability not actual logic so the procesing logic and domain knowledge still need to be done by human. If anything, it might generate more demands to build data warehouse to train AI models, which are separate use case from the existing analytics and financial report use case. \n\n\nThe real concern is the market downturn and if the AI bubble bursts, people might stop hiring altogether because they want to cut cost (which has nothing to do with AI as a technology but AI as a balance sheet problem).

Also, if you ever want less lock-in later, keeping transforms in dbt + storing raw exports (GCS) makes migrating much easier than relying on tool-specific modeling.",

Lineage is a huge part of this because it shows not just how data flows from a transformation perspective, but also how systems connect.

The Platform Approach (Unity Catalog) **-** I’ve used Unity Catalog extensively for this. It essentially forces the catalog and lineage to live together. Because the governance (permissions, access controls) creates the lineage automatically as jobs run, you don't have to \"maintain\" the lineage separately. The catalog is the map of the lineage. If you treat them as separate tools, you end up doing double the work to keep them in sync.\n\n2. The Open Source Route (OpenMetadata) **-** If you are looking outside of a specific vendor ecosystem, tools like OpenMetadata are tackling this exact \"all-in-one\" problem. They treat data assets, lineage, and quality checks as a single entity. It proves that the market prefers a unified view. Data engineers don't want to tab switch between a catalog to find a table and a lineage tool to see where it came from.\n\n3. The Shift to Orchestrators (Dagster) - The most interesting shift right now is actually happening in the orchestration layer. I’ve been using Dagster, and they handle this through “software-defined Assets.\" Instead of lineage being an afterthought or a documentation task, the lineage is defined by the code itself.\n\n* Assets **-** You define the data asset, and the lineage is inherent.\n* Asset Checks **-** You attach quality checks directly to those assets in the graph.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Yes, a combined solution is useful. In fact, things are moving even further, merging Catalog + Lineage + Execution (Orchestration) into one view so that \"accountability\" isn't just a log you look at later, but part of the pipeline run itself.\n\nHope this helps.",

When you have 100K+ datasets, this breaks governance completely.  \n  \n**Why integration matters more than people realize:**  \n• **Metadata propagation** \\- tag one source table as PII, lineage cascades it downstream to 50 derived tables automatically. Manual tagging doesn't scale.   \n• **Impact analysis** \\- \"this pipeline failed, who owns the upstream data?\" If you're jumping between tools, you've already lost.   \n• **Trust flows backwards** \\- you can't assess data quality without tracing upstream. Separate systems = manual stitching every time.  \n\n\nMost of the modern catalogs are moving to a model of  \n\\- out-of-the-box connectors that \"pull\" lineage into the system from external systems  \n\\- support reporting of lineage INTO the system via standard catalog-native API-s/agents/emitters or vendor-neutral protocols like OpenLineage\n\n  \n**The caveat the other responses touched on:** some solutions like Dagster's \"software-defined assets\" are elegant but only work for what the orchestrator controls. Your data doesn't start in the warehouse:  \n• Production systems feeding Kafka streams   \n• Real-time stream processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)   \n• Cross-cloud data movement that never touches your orchestrator   \n  \nAt my previous company, \\~40% of critical lineage came from **outside** the orchestration layer. You need a catalog that can **aggregate lineage from multiple systems** (streaming, production databases, warehouses), not just generate it from one orchestrator.  \n  \n**The test:** can you trace a BI dashboard → warehouse → dbt → Kafka → production database in one query? That's 5-6 systems owned by different teams. The catalog is your aggregation point. Best of luck with convincing your customers and the world!",

Use acronyms when it makes sense. \n\nIf you haven’t already, take an online course on Medallion and Kimball architecture.",

(“EU data must stay in EU”, “India must stay in India”, etc.). “Each country in its own region” is usually not the real rule, it’s the vibe.\n\nIf data residency is actually required, then yeah: you can’t do Firebase → Bq → Snowflake US for everyone and call it compliant. The sane pattern is raw + PII stays in-region, and only aggregated/anonymous data can move cross-region (if allowed). Practically that means separate regional stacks (EU BigQuery dataset + EU Snowflake / or whatever) and your Airflow just orchestrates per-region configs. \n\nStart with 2 regions (EU + US), keep schemas identical, and create a “global” layer that’s aggregates only. Biggest footgun is mixing PII across borders and hoping to “fix later”, get the rule written down first, then architect.",

If that’s the case, I’m increasingly recommending to materialise results NOT on the warehouse, but on an iceberg table, possibly with a REST catalog that allow for git-like management and branching (e.g. Nessie). \n\nThis way, you remove versioning issues from the map (just use iceberg and catalog’s versioning features and best practices)\n\nFor table data access, you can use the iceberg table as external table in your data warehouse (ok if you have infrequent access or if it’s ok to have a bit of latency) or load the latest version of data in bulk (replacing the existing table) on a single work table on the warehouse if you need high availability or low latency for reads through the warehouse \n\nThat said, there are 100s of variants and approaches :) if you have some specific needs just drop some more info on your need and stack, I think a lot of people may be able to help",

I assume *you* guys care what version is in the wild, same as any need for source control.\n\n  \nDepends what you're using, I guess.  As u/chronic4you  said, if you're using Delta Lake then versioning and metadata is part of it.  I can't comment on Iceberg, we don't use it.  We do use Delta Lake, and in my case, we wouldn't have differently-named versions knocking around in terms of production.  They just get replaced.  But we don't run parallel releases and stuff like that.  For capturing version metadata in Delta Lake, you could use custom commit messages when altering/replacing tables.\n\n  \nThis is kind of something I've been thinking about a bit, too.  The potential for drift between the DDL code that *is* source controlled and the object in the catalog that the DDL defines concerns me.  I don't really have a solution.\n\n\n\nIf you're using simple SQL tables for example, good luck to you.  Times past I've had various permutations of \"x\\_dev\", \"x\\_revision\", \"x\\_update\", and even \"x\\_new\" sitting in the database alongside the proper table.  Good times.",

What I'm trying to say is that even though you'll find a ton of \"software engineer\" job postings, there is no such thing as a company hiring for a \"general SWE\" (it's always one of the subsets and most likely backend).\n\nThe exception are companies who post for software engineers and make it clear in the job title or description that the focus is data. I've found things like \"Software Engineer - Data Warehousing\" or \"Software Engineer - Data\".

In those cases, directory-level partitioning on a timestamp is usually sufficient and cheaper, because partition pruning is extremely effective and requires no ongoing reorganization.\n\nLiquid clustering starts to make sense at this scale when:\n\n* Queries frequently filter on high-cardinality keys (e.g. account\\_id) in addition to time.\n* The table isn’t strictly append-only (MERGE/UPSERT, late data, corrections).\n* Access patterns evolve and you don’t want to constantly redesign partitions.\n* You want to avoid over-partitioning while still getting good file-level pruning.\n\nSo the question isn’t “can liquid clustering handle 100 TB?”, but rather whether the workload actually needs it. For a truly raw, time-sliced dataset, partitions alone are usually the right tool. Liquid clustering is more justified when the table behaves less like raw ingestion and more like a shared, multi-consumer analytical dataset where time alone isn’t selective enough.",

Are they fine at that point that the roll-up for ID=1 will change to the v6 value?\" -->** We have two sets of these gold fact tables.  One set will always be updated, so it will always get the v=6 record when it comes.  The fact table I was writing about in the post will remain at v=5.  Business reason comes from our Financial Controller.  When the data comes in, we expect that after X days after a reporting period, if there are no upstream data changes, we consider it official.  There is an audit requirement to keep a permanent record of this official data for that time period because this is the data that was reported.  There is a main gold fact table that will always be up to date and that's used for other purposes, but will always be accurate.\n\nWe are implementing 'write controls' on the gold layer partition to limit this, but it won't be perfect. We're also going to store the snapshot of this data that can never be written to outside of the gold layer.\n\n**\"I'd be more concerned that the record can be updated and they don't want you to propogate the data up through the layers.\" -->** Generally, yes.  But we have a pretty unique requirement here.  We are fully propagating to gold but also maintaining a separate snapshot that will keep that snapshot in time for reporting purposes.  (They need to report on what was reported at the time as one requirement even if what was reported used an older version of the same record).,",

I'm sure they still collected their crippling tuition, though, didn't they? \n\nThat's not your fault. You're not in charge of the school. I'm an Engineering Manager and a self-taught coder, and it grinds my gears every single time I interview a new CS grad and find they can't code. I don't even know how many times I've seen it. \n\n2. Your idea for learning to understand code completely is misguided. Your goal should be to build and deploy a working project. Something super simple. Do it in the next three days. Then immediately go to work on a slightly more complicated project, which you should also deploy within a few days. Then add a database and deploy that within a few days. Etc. Your big problem isn't that you don't understand everything about code, it's that you can't code on your own. There is a huge difference there. It isn't even the same topic. \n\nKeep learning but consider all lessons to be an expense you have to pay to build a project. All projects should be as inexpensive as possible. Learn the bare minimum to get building again. \n\nWhen you've built and deployed at least two non-trivial full-stack projects and you feel comfortable with a programming language, a full-stack framework, a database language, a testing framework, and a deployment strategy, then you can start researching better design patterns. \n\nThen build another project. \n\nI'm sorry to hear that your school let you down so completely. If there is a bright side, it is that all of us become self-taught eventually. Good luck with your studies.",

        "body": "I'm going to go out on a limb and argue this: It's not programming, it's the way school taught you how you should learn. \n\nSchool education is built on spiral patterns and a tonne of scaffolding. Both of these together make the natural position of learners so that it is clear what they should do to solve a given problem, so if they don't know what to do the assumption is that it is your fault. When in reality, learning is complicated, messy, and difficult. \n\nI'll give you an example. In maths, let's say that we are learning how to move variables around an equation. We provide the proof, completed worked examples, worked examples that are partially solved with hints, partially solved worked examples without hints, simple problems that are basically worked examples without hints, and some problems that can be breadcrumbed through multiple worked examples above. The end result is that you probably can go from start to bottom without encountering any trouble. Teachers might make questions that are tricky, compound, or both, but you've probably encountered *everything* before. \n\nThe problem is that you've never learned how to synthesise something new (to you), and that's what you are trying to do here. \n\nI'll give you an example. You might have learned how to make an object. You might have even learned how to assign a variable to an object.  But when you have to make your own simple data structure that stores a bunch of data like an array, but can dynamically add and remove stuff without empty spaces or resizing arrays ... well, all of the steps to smash your face into designing or inventing a linked list are really, fuffing, hard.\n\nSo, what happens is that learners sit there and go: \"Man, I feel that fancy maths is easier than this because I always know what I'm doing,\" because they've hit a problem that could have a dozen or more possible solutions. Instead of simply accepting that they don't know and starting problem-solving, they just feel bad.\n\nI'm also going to extend a programmer's olive branch: I've been programming for twenty years. I'm not bad at it. I've built all sorts of complicated systems in multiple languages. Yet, every single day I'll be coding something, and I'll mutter to myself \"holy fuff I'm stupid\" because I couldn't solve some problem. I also couldn't tell you how long I have smashed my face into problems trying to understand how to build it, only to discover that once I learned the underlying systems, it was actually pretty simple (after I did a lot of work to learn new stuff). \n\nThis is natural. In fact, I often wonder if you don't feel like this regularly, you probably aren't programming. \n\nedit: Lastly, I've been learning how to write novels. Not really to do anything with, but just to tell stories. I'm constantly frustrated at how hard it is to express what is in my brain in words. It has been a year, and I've learned heaps, but I'm still not good at it. Sometimes I forget that just because I am good at programming, networking, writing formal documentation, and teaching, it doesn't mean I will, or even should, automatically be good at other things like creative writing. \n\nSo, be kind to yourself.",

Having a mentor and someone to be accountable to also Legos a lot.\n\nGood luck!",

This can be programming it to send automated texts to your parents when it realises that you won't be home by 9pm, it can be a reminder to drink water every 3 hours and so on.\n\nAs a human you write computer programs to make it help you in random small tasks, eventually you automate and get used to writing all of these programs that you move on to other bigger tasks in your lives. You one day realise 'wait a minute i would like a simple website about my new bakery that im opening up' so you do just that. \n\nYou make multiple games and you realise that manually writing physics is a pain for each game so you decide one common code that handles this physics for you and call it the 'game engine', the name is all fancy but at the end of the day its just a bunch of code doing physics.\n\nYou find it difficult at the moment because you're not starting bottom up, you don't start with a basic necessity in your life that needs to be solved and work from there. You start with knowing zero programming as you mention in your second and blindly just copy paste tutorials which are more complex and use stuff that you do not have the prerequisites for. \n\nYou think you got far because you copy pasted the tutorials but the truth is you have to accept that you know very little about programming and start writing simpler programs until you get the basics right.\n\nCodeforces / Leetcode / <insert similar sites) is meant for two kinds of people - Folks who just enjoy puzzle coding and folks who are into competitive programming / want to pass interviews at companies where leetcode is asked\n\nI don't think you are at the stage where you enjoy programming so much that you should be getting into the hobby of puzzle coding? The problems there are deliberately difficult on purpose because its meant to be competitive and you need to go in having practiced a huge bunch of algorithmic ideas and topics. Its like you wanting to take a leisurely walk to get fit but accidentally ending up signing up for the local extreme parkour club. Both achieve the same thing but are meant for different kinds of people with different kinds of mindset",

Another thing that might help is Python with its very easy to understand object model.\n\nOOP requires a different way of thinking - kind of a rewiring of the brain to look at things differently. In OOP it's more a dialog between the individual objects than the sequential command patterns we are used to in procedural programming. In OOP you more or less \"talk\" to the objects. You ask them to do things for you. You ask them to change their internal state if needed (yes, the \"immutability\" topic will now come up and I might anger a few people with my mutable approach).\n\nMy breakthrough with OOP was when I got into my current job in Industrial Automation working with our DCS (Distributed Control System) and with our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. There, everything was object oriented with inheritance and I started to see the advantages and how OOP works. Our SCADA even goes further in the direction of being an Entity-Component system where each Entity can have many components with many different aspects, but that leads too far (it's basically just some very extended form of composition, not inheritance).\n\n> it often takes me hours what my developer colleagues can do in minutes.\n\nThis only boils down to practice, ample practice.\n\nYou will feel stuck and dumbfounded for quite some time but you will eventually reach the point where things fall into place and you all of a sudden understand.

It's a natural instinct if you spend most of your time close to the machine itself, but it's actually disruptive to learning HLLs.\n\nHLLs are designed to be somewhat implementation-agnostic; they have rules, and they trust that some intermediary layer will implement a thing that makes those rules go. Getting bogged down in how that intermediary layer might work (\\*) generally will impede your understanding of the higher-level layer. This is a skill I had to learn when learning SML/NJ: the fine art of no longer worrying about how the language represents a function, trusting \"It just does,\" and learning the language independent of its implementation. The language is just rules and math; you could implement it with pencil and paper if you had the time and patience. Once you have the language under your belt, you can start caring about how it was implemented on a Von Neumann architecture with registers, RAM, and the like.\n\n(\\*) C++ might be an exception that proves this rule; there are actually quite a few features of C++ where the reason they work that way is \"It made it a lot easier to write the compiler\" or \"Look, this language is old, and older computers didn't have enough RAM to do things like lookahead compilation or multiple passes, so it is what it is.\"",

        "body": "So, I wrote [a few chapters on OOP in a free book](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I tried to think of the ways we incorrectly teach OOP (because that's the way we learned OOP.)\n\nI think the summary I can provide is:\n\n* A class is like a blank paper form template. You go to the doctor's office and fill out strings for your name, phone number, a list of allergies, etc. This form is a *class*; everyone fills out the same fields (i.e. the member variables) to represent a real-world thing. Each filled-out form is an *object*, a specific concrete thing.\n* I hate the isolated \"Car\" and \"Shape\" and \"Animal\" classes you always see in tutorials. What a \"Car\" class looks like in real code depends on what software you are making: a used car ecommerce site, a traffic simulator, a racing video game, etc. Meanwhile, the same real world person would be described by different classes: `Customer`, `Patient`, `Employee`, `WeddingGuest`, etc. Ask yourself how a paper form would describe the person in each of these roles and what fields it would need.\n* A common mistake is to write classes a certain way because we heard that they \"should\" be written that way. If you feel like classes and extensive hierarchies of classes are causing more bureaucracy than organization in your code, go without classes. (If you can; a complete rewrite has its own problems.)\n* For a second, forget about OOP: imagine you have **a bunch of functions and they all have the same data structure passed to them as an argument**: that's your class. That tells you what the member variables and methods should be. I have an example Python tic-tac-toe program done [with and without OOP in the book.](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html)\n* Inheritance is overrated.\n* For a moment, stop thinking of inheritance with genetic or grandparent-passing-away metaphors. Imagine you need a new class that is very similar to an existing one, but you just one to change one or two methods, so you copy-paste the code entirely and just change those methods. This is what inheritance does, but instead of copying-pasting code, you leave that out and make a subclass and then only specify the methods you change.\n\nAnyway, in general we explain OOP badly, and it is a bit (but not entirely) overrated. Don't feel bad for finding it confusing.",

Anyway, *everything* have a *name*, if I have blue eye, blond hair and 2 m tall, I'm a *lightower boy* \\- meh, I just figured it out, but you have the idea.\n\nThe best approach is to find synonims and similar terms, which you're familiar with. The most close synonims for an *object* is: record, structure, set of variables, and now comes the difference: with the *methods* (functions, subroutines, procedures) operating on it.\n\nIf you ever worked with files on Unix-like systems or Windows, you've already familiar with OOP. You create a File \"object\" by *open()* or *creat()*, which you can refer with the *file handle*, which these function returned. The variables of File is hidden for you, we have some idea how it looks, but we don't care as far we can call *read()*, *write()* methods to do what we want with the file, then we can *drop* or *destruct* it by calling *close()*.\n\nIn OOP, instead of file handle, you got a pointer (sometimes called reference), and you can \"call\" methods. Now comes the part where you'll understand the whole shit:\n\n`read(file_object, &buffer, length)`\n\nis same as\n\n`file_object.read(&buffer, lenght)`\n\nIn Python, you can call a method both way, although, highly recommended to use `obj.method()` variant.\n\nAnd again, as elctronics, programming is not *difficult*, but *simple and* *complex*. OOP is just as *difficult* like pull-up resistor: if you know struct, function, memory, OOP is easy-peasy, and if you know current, instable state, DCC and GND, pull-up resistor is straighfoward... but try these two simple things to explain someone who knows nothing about programming and electronics.",

I'll often just pull up someone else's code and reference basic things like syntax, commonly-used libraries, etc. but there is no teacher like trial and error, especially since you get very quick feedback on what you did right or wrong.\n\n**Edit**: To give an example, I recently had to learn a new language for work. The first thing I did was get assigned as an extra code reviewer for an MR that was written by a developer experienced in the language. I did my review first, and I had to spend time reading through his code, cross-referencing documentation for the libraries being used, and generally just building my understanding of the code. When the other code reviewers and testers also did their passes, I read their issues to see what I had missed. (Which is a good habit that I do for everything I review, not just this).\n\nAfter that, I did an MR of my own and had it reviewed by the person who had done the previous MR. There was still a ton of referencing documentation but I had a fairly good idea of what I needed to do.\n\nIt gets substantially easier the more experience you have under your belt. I've coded in more than a dozen languages, so at this point picking up a new one is pretty simple as I already know how to \"think like a programmer\" which is the core skill that we need.",

Tutorials feel productive, but there’s nothing forcing your brain to retrieve or apply anything, so it fades fast.\n\nWhat usually works better is picking a very small goal and letting that goal pull the language in. Something concrete like parsing a file, building a tiny game, automating a task you already do, or reimplementing a simple tool you use. Then you learn just enough syntax to make the next thing work, look things up constantly, and accept that forgetting is part of the process. That cycle is what actually builds memory.\n\nDocs and references are great once you’re actively coding, because you approach them with a question instead of passively watching. If boredom is the problem, reduce scope, increase feedback, and write code every day even if it’s messy. Speed comes from doing, not from finding the perfect resource.",

Traditionally this training teaches auto mechanics, HVAC installers, even electronics technicians, but many training centers provide computer programming. My son actually took two years of programming in high school before going to college. \n\nAs far as continuing education in programming, there are a couple avenues. First you can attend a community college for two years to get an associates degree in computer programming. That's not as expensive as a bachelors degree in Computer Science but it gets you half way there. Most universities will accept an associates degree as the first two years of a computer science curriculum.  \n\nThe advanced math comes into play if you want to get a bachelors in Computer Science. Most degree programs are either in an engineering school or a business school.  Some colleges make you choose an area of concentration (mine was physics) Business curriculums do not usually require calculus while science and engineering tracks require calculus, differential equations and linear algebra. \n\nA Bachelors in computer science will serve you well and keep you employed, but an associates in computer programming will also help you get work. \n\nDon't listen to nay-sayers who predict programmers will be replaced by AI. AI makes programmers more efficient, that's all.",

The only things you really need to know are how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and maybe a little basic algebra. Many programmers go through their entire career with having to do barely any math at all.\n\n> Do note, however, that the answer is a bit different if you are interested in getting a degree in Computer Science. Many universities or colleges will have specific prerequisites you need to fulfill before you can either enter the major or graduate (calculus classes, etc). And, since Computer Science is, to a certain degree, applied mathematics, you will almost certainly end up learning about discrete math, writing proofs and other similar topics while earning your degree. You do not need to be inherently good at math in order to learn these topics (or any mathematical topic, really), but having some mathematical maturity certainly wouldn't hurt, and would probably smooth the learning process.",

It’s deeply integrated into engines, has way more learning resources for games specifically, faster iteration, and teaches fundamentals you’ll reuse everywhere. Yes, you’ll shoot yourself in the foot sometimes, but that’s part of understanding how things actually work under the hood.\n\nRust is great, but the borrow checker adds cognitive load that’s not directly helping you learn game logic early on. It shines once you already understand memory and systems programming. For a beginner building terrain gen, gameplay systems, engine-level stuff, C++ will feel more straightforward and less “fighting the language.”\n\nShort version: start with C++ for game dev fundamentals, then Rust later if you want safety and modern design.

It's syntax is newer, and the language itself is much newer, which introduces a plenty of benefits. Firstly, it doesn't have the burden of having as much layers of backwards compatibility - C++ is filled with legacy code, and deprecated methods. Rust, on the other hand, is much fresher in that sense.\n\nOkay, I realized I am probably going on a tangent, so here's the list of the stuff I love about Rust over C++:\n\n* Beautiful error messages\n* Immutability by default.\n* Less verbose syntax (try to read the c++ std library, you'll get what I mean)\n* **THE ABSOLUTE BEST** tooling - `cargo` is really just a life saver. Don't even get me started on installing dependencies.\n\nOne notable flaw I can point out is the borrow checker, since it can be confusing and you have to sacrifice some convenience in order to keep the code safe (but at least Rust doesn't allow unsafe behavior unless you explicitly want it)",

I dont want to discourage the idea, but you should be advised that the comparative lack of tooling and ecosystem might overshadow the other benefits of Rust\n\nby contrast C++ is native to the unreal engine and already integrates beautifully with its visual scripting language, unreal blueprints.

Instead, invest your time into actually becoming better. \n\n> The only thing is I don't know if there's like specific actionable steps I have to take consistently to get to that level.\n\nYou will need at least some experience, so it's always a good idea to keep working on a project (not many small ones, but a single bigger one), because that's how you gain insight on what makes things easier or harder to work with. Many tutorials make it really easy to work within a certain paradigm, but the paradigm falls apart as soon as you apply it to a real world example with real world requirements.\n\n> Is it just based on the number of years you work on building software or simply the environment where you can get feedback from top tier engineers?\n\nI've been mostly working on my own, even as a Junior and never had a Senior who would teach me good programming practices. For me it's been mostly about reflecting about my work, about **why** things become difficult and how I could avoid these traps. I started to watch many different talks from software conferences on youtube and while many of those talks are about fixing symptoms of problems instead of identifying problems, there are some that help you understand why you end up having certain problems. \n\nSo you need both, a number of years of experience to reflect on, and actually reflect on the experience. \n\nAlso, in any case: do not listen to people saying things like \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\". They likely have no idea what they are talking about and they don't know what that quote actually refers to. Usually these people think that they lose about 5-15% performance when they follow their programming paradigm and think that's an acceptable price, but they actually lose at least factor 30, in many cases even factor 1000 performance (Yes, things taking 2 seconds when they could be done in 0.002 seconds).\n\nA good way of structuring your code will also give you good performance as a free benefit.",

Part 1 would be a preparation for the exam done at home with whatever tools they want (ai, colleague,...) and they could take any code they would have done  to part 2 (which was the actual part cut from Internet).\n\nThe first part had exercises centered around getting every child from a node in a tree (and going deeper till getting the last).\n\nThe first exercice from the second part was going up the tree till the first node was found and then, the exam was basically going down the tree either from top or from a specific node with the eventual join here and there on another table.\n\nAll that to say : if you understood your code from the first part, second part should have been no problem at all.  \ngoing up a tree being so close to going down but a lot less complicated to implement - It's a sole loop.   \nAnd once done with going down and up, every other exercise could be done with some copy past from your own code\n\nWhen the result was in, most of the student had the first part nailed in tight.  \nBut some would have no idea at all about what was what (one exercice asked to check the depth of the tree and one of the student thought that just taking the node.parentId was the answer. Not to throw shade at the guy (I'm pretty sure he's one of the smarter) but he clearly didn't understand the first part that was, most likely, generated (or copy pasted from a student. But since I checked every file before allowing them to bring them to part 2, I have some idea.)\n\nIn essence, ai didn't write bad code. That's not the point.\n\nThe point is, they used it in a way that didn't make them grow their understanding of what they were doing.\n\nThat's the part I'm really critical when in comes to ai use in learning... But in general too. No matter if you're a junior or a senior. If you don't learn, you, at best, stay at your level.",

Learning to code is a \\*\\*journey\\*\\*. But thankfully, there are loads of resources out there that can help you choose your path! So, it's okay if you're not totally committed to building a career, my advice would be to measure the amount of resource you devote until you know that.\n\nYou can teach yourself to code without access to any paid content or courses. It's a long road, it takes a lot of dedication and frustration, and drive to go find the answers yourself. But I'm not sure there's ever been a skill so thoroughly documented online as software development. Software developers largely love to share what they've built, and the very fine details of how it works. Youtube is full of tutorials. There are plenty of websites that will explain different programming languages or tools to you. Github is a massive source of real code that drives real projects which you can read and download and involve yourself in the discussions of. \n\nIf you're looking into a career, I recommend finding a university within your state with an accredited computer science program. The degree matters a lot when it comes to job prospects unfortunately. I also think it's a medium quick way to actually develop serious development skills. I know for me personally, I was on the self-taught path for many years and just very stuck. It was my degree program with the help of professors and peers that finally unlocked things for me and got me over the tough parts of learning development. You'll find no shortage of universities that offer remote degree programs in computer science as well. This is an expensive path, but its the most reliable path to a career.\n\nIf you're not sure what you want yet, and you're just out to explore maybe try joining some community projects. Hackathons, game jams, competitions. Even if you don't feel like you're ready, just be honest about your level and express that you're there to learn and you're bound to find loads of people just like you who would be glad to learn along-side you. That's a great way to 'explore' and get a sense of what actual development is like even before you have the skills yourself. Even if it means you're joining a discord call just to watch and hear how more experienced developers are working it'll give you a sense of what its actually like once you're in the middle of things.\n\nI won't recommend any particular course or source of information personally. I've found that everyone seems to click with different materials.

This is both so external clients have a clean interface to work with as well as minimizing the blast radius of any changes to the workings of the API itself.

Mine makes a C.\n\nYou start in the bottom-right where you don't even know THAT you don't know something. There's shit rocket scientists contemplate I haven't the slightest fucking clue. I'm not a rocket scientist. I can't possibly know. Can't even fathom.\n\nThen there's shit you know you don't know. I don't know how to implement a Monte-Carlo simulation. I know I don't know that. I know Monte-Carlo is used to march approximations toward a correct result with sufficient precision. I've just never had to do it.\n\nThen there's what you know you know - this is active recall stuff. Rote memory. I know a closure is a poor mans object. I can repeat that all day. It's not very functional memory because I have to actively think about it with intent. I can write a closure, but it's not intuitive to me. I make mistakes. I can't see the forest for the trees.\n\nBut I have a shitload of unknown knowns - shit I know, but don't actively think about. We're beyond active recall. This isn't rote - this is intuition. You can FORGET you know something, and yet that knowledge passively informs you. When you see me work, I can go straight to code and produce something. Hundreds, THOUSANDS of decisions are being made not because I'm considering all this stuff in the moment, but because I've considered it all over the last 37 years. I'm not making a decision, I've already made it. I'm acting on connections and associations and relationships you haven't made yet, leaving you wondering how the hell I'm getting my work done - it's because the work was done 20 years ago at that one job.\n\nThis is what you're going to accumulate yourself. When you've fully internalized and integrated your knowledge, you can speak on it as an authority. You won't be quoting a book or resource, you'll be saying it yourself, and you'll hardly think about how you're even doing it.\n\nSo then how do you learn? It's not just time. You can sit on your ass for years and not learn a god damn thing - especially if you don't have compelling work or don't care. It's not JUST experience - but the quality of the experience. You don't learn from successes, but failures. And if you want some failures, you need to be trying to do shit.\n\n> I realized afterward that I hadn't considered concurrent access, didn't validate inputs, returned mixed types from methods, and used raw dictionaries instead of proper data structures. \n\nYou're already gaining self-awareness, seeing more than trees, but the forest for what it is. To accelerate your experiences - you need to have more of them; finish that project. Validate inputs - that's easy as shit. Use data structures, that makes it easier to validate your inputs. Add concurrency, this will apply pressure upon you to design a more consistent architecture.\n\nYou didn't do these things in your demo because you don't have the intuition to do them. If you had it, you'd have integrated all this into your solution as a matter of course.\n\nContinued...",

If you understand those, switching stacks becomes much easier and less scary. Think of projects as a way to expose gaps, not as proof you should already know everything.",

I worked in C and C++ professionally until 2013, when I switched to Java with a spring in my step and a song in my heart. So when I say I disagree with Mr Spolsky, it’s not because I’m defensive about not knowing C or pointers.\n\nI guess if you want to contribute to the Linux kernel, it’s got to be C and you need to understand pointers like you understand your native language. Ditto drivers. But 99.9% of programmers aren’t getting that deep in the weeds with things. Even in 2005, they weren’t. People can’t come out of undergrad knowing everything. You’ve got to pick what’s important to get started.\n\nAlso C is hard in a lot of stupid, picky ways that have nothing to do with intelligence. Mostly it’s not portable the way a lot of modern languages are. Programs that compile and run fine in one environment won’t in another because the libraries are in a different directory, or you’re using different compilers, or different versions of the compiler, or different levels of optimization (it shouldn’t matter, but I’ve seen cases where it does.) Or all kinds of stupid crap. \n\nThis was already a serious obstacle to collaboration and knowledge-sharing in 2005. It’s gotten way worse as more knowledge is shared online. It’s why Java was such a hit—the intermediate bytecode step meant that it works the same everywhere. (I mean, you *can* find incompatibilities between the Oracle JDK and IBM Semaru or whatever, but you have to be doing something really obscure.) And the creator of Stack Overflow should know that better than anyone!",

Try analyzing something you care about (budgeting, fitness, etc.) Document your work — even simple visuals or insights go a long way. This will lead to something called “portfolio” like a folder of all your project work \n\nAnalytics folks use Excel / Google Sheet, SQL, Python with pandas, R, Tableau/PowerBI \n\nIf you want something practical and project-oriented that walks you through real exercises in data analytics, this book below is designed for beginners and emphasizes hands-on work over pure theory:\n\nAI-Powered Data Analysis for Beginners\nhttps://a.co/d/8v7IwjK\nThe book offers good ground in programming, math and stats, analytics mindsets and methodologies, using AI, with lots of examples. Many of the prompts that’s discussed are fully optimized to use lowest tokens. Full disclosure: I’m the author of the book I mentioned — sharing it because it’s designed for similar use cases\n\nNo pressure — you don’t need to buy it to start.

Great chips but all you easily had for programming was the built in BASIC.    By the time I got to college, almost 10 years later the college was teaching with Modula 2 at the introductory level.  Note the phrase \"teaching with\", if you are learning to program the language is really a tool to learn concepts.   By the time one would finish the full program a student would have been exposed to at least 3 mandatory languages.\n\nPeople often ask why?   The answer is pretty simple out in the real world you may end up working with a number of languages.   The problem with BASIC is there is very little real world use of BASIC anymore, even gaming has gone to Lua for scripting.\n\nNow what do I suggest for beginners, that is easy C or C++ for the equivalent of the first 3-4 semesters of a Computer Science program.   Why low level languages?    This is again simple, you can be forced to building data structures at a low level.   Personally I See languages like Python as damaging to the development of good programmers as it hands user modern concepts and unfortunately most programs designed around Python don't dive into how things work.   The other reason is that properly done, by mandating the command line for the first few programs (2 semester equivalents) you also learn how compilers and linkers work, at the user level anyways.   The command line is important because there are Python programmers out there that can't even create a directory at the command line.   So I'm not a big fan of people learning programming with Python.\n\nHowever I really believe that most programmers need to learn Python at some point but properly educated that will be a piece of cake.   The reality is Python has been relative simple for a scripting language.   At some point a programmer will also have to learn the languages suitable for the platform at hand.   The problem is platform languages are a moving target, you need a good understanding of the basics of computer science to adapt to what is new.   Languages like RUST or Swift are literally works in progress, it is a continuous learning challenge to remain effective with these languages.",

A population of 4119.4 means that there is only 4119 people currently in the population, but anytime soon a new one will appear. And a population of 4119.7 means the exact same, but RoundToInt will round the previous result to 4119 and this one to 4120.\n\nSo, use Floor or `FloorToInt` whenever you want to use the population in any other calculation - and also use `ints` for all other population-numbers, like `previousPopulation` and `deltaPopulation`. Basically you'll have \"population used in calculating the population\" as a float, and \"population used for everything else\" as an int, calculated by flooring the previous float!",

You likely developed an understanding of what music sounds like long before you picked up a guitar, so you can intuitively track your own progress to a degree. You have likely no understanding of what good code looks like or what being a good programmer entails, otherwise you wouldn’t ask this question.

The JVM starts out in a \"bytecode interpreter\" mode, and only switches to JIT compilation when it detects that a certain piece of code is heavily used.

My friend isn't a fullstack dev, and it isn't necessary if you want to get into a specific discipline like mobile dev.   Sure, it can be helpful to learn client and server languages, but you don't have to and it only adds time to your learning, which isn't ideal if you're self-taught.   Best thing IMO is get a job, then learn what they want you to learn.",

Use Backend-as-a-Service:\n\n* **Firebase** \\- Auth, database, storage, hosting. Free tier is generous. Perfect for solo devs.\n* **Supabase** \\- Open source Firebase alternative, uses PostgreSQL\n\nThis lets you focus on the app, not server maintenance.\n\n**When you need a real backend later:**\n\n* Node.js + Express (JavaScript, easy transition)\n* Python + FastAPI (clean, simple)\n* Basic REST API concepts\n* PostgreSQL or MongoDB\n\n**The practical path:**\n\n1. Learn Flutter basics (2-3 weeks)\n2. Build a simple app with local storage (todo app, notes app)\n3. Add Firebase for auth + database\n4. **Publish it** \\- even if it's simple\n5. Learn backend properly for your second or third app\n\n**Skills that matter more than people think:**\n\n* Git (version control)\n* App Store / Play Store publishing process (it's annoying, learn it early)\n* Basic UI/UX sense\n\nDon't overthink it.

        "body": "There are 13 years between C++98 and C++11, there are 15 years between C++11 and C++26. It's always a good idea to work from the latest standard. C++23 IS THE latest standard - C++26 will go to final vote to ratify in March this year.\n\nC++11 is old and was incomplete even then. They missed shit like `std::make_unique` - which had to be added in C++14, the `chrono` didn't finish until C++17, which is when we also got `filesystem` and `variant`, and finally type punning was defined. We didn't get library support for type punning until C++20, which is when we also got the `ranges` library - a god damn revolution in implementing algorithms. C++23 gives us `#embeded` to bring us to parity with C, type-safe formatter strings, UTF-8 support, and more container types. Starting with C++11 also leaves almost all of `constexpr` on the table.\n\n1) Install the latest compiler package from your vendor of choice.\n\n2) Always direct it to use the latest ISO-strict standard it supports. The compiler will default to an earlier and non-standard tolerant mode. When C++26 is ratified, it'll be a following software update that suddenly you'll get the new features.\n\n3) Keep learning C++. We all learn variables, functions, loops, conditions, pointers, user defined types... You're still going to slog through all the basics. There's no point in limiting yourself to a specific standard in this journey. You'll arrive to the latest standard when you're ready for it and it's ready for you.\n\n4) It takes time for compiler vendors to catch up. Microsoft with MSVC is still scrambling to implement C++23 features. All the vendors are struggling with modules. Don't be surprised when stuff is missing. It's not actually a big deal. But keeping up with software updates means you get to capitalize on their latest additions day-of. C++26 also comes with some changes that are worth being there.\n\n5) Most teaching materials are going to teach you the same basics. For the most part, the rules of C++ have never changed since before the C++98 standard... Except when it does. And that's the thing about fixing on a specific standard - there are very standard version specific rules you don't want to get bogged down on. Template deduction, initializers, `auto`, constexpr, move semantics... A lot of that gets nuanced changes over versions, and there's always breaking changes between spec versions. I think it was C++14 that finally said you can't specialize standard library template functions, and fuck, I had a code base predicated on that.\n\nUltimately, the differences between the specs MOSTLY won't really matter until you get through the introductory materials. C++26 does change that a little bit - because it's going to require catching the use of uninitialized variables, which was formerly undefined behavior. That's going to send ripples all the way back to the beginning of learning C++.",

The important thing is to check that the written documentation or learning material is written for at least C++14 or preferably higher. Learning C++ is a long journey where the really advanced stuff takes years to even start with. The later language versions modify and add progressively more advanced features. The language is old and has lots of traps and strange quirks. Every solution has at least 3 different ways to write it and each C++ version makes them easier (usually) to write. So teaching from a modern source is quite important.",

Done right the first few semesters of a CS program should be covering concepts that are applicable to most if not all programming languages.   If you are learning on your own your goals should be to obtain the same level of understanding.\n\nHere is the thing, you don't know what languages will be in demand by the time you are good enough in any one language to even apply for a job.   If you learn well you should be able to adapt to what ever language a project requires.\n\nFrankly I don't see C++ as a good language to develop apps in as it has been eclipsed by more modern languages.   What it is though is a very good language to teach the principles of programming.   So is it a decent place to start, yes with one qualification, the program you follow should have at its goal teaching you from the ground up.    \n\nAt some point while going through a decent program, you should start to invest time in learning another language and hopefully seeing how the technology transfers from one language to another.   If you have the goal of a specific platform like MacOS then start to learn Swift.   \n\nAt some point you should also pick up Python, however if you do it right Python will be a no brainer.   In fact you will have a better understanding of how Python works if you have followed a CS program and actually did some data structure development, memory management and the like in C++.   You spend some time at that level and you instantly can grasp what is happening in almost any language.",

However, working on middle-ware also means that you don't get to make any consumer-facing applications, and hence, that could be very dry in comparison. Unless you're in the gaming industry, where C++ is huge.\n\nOf course, all this is a very over-simplified generalization. C++ can do most things C# can as well, and the situation really depends on the company you work for.\n\nOn the other hand, C# is more general-use, just like Java.\n\nWhat's clear is that, in developer surveys over the past 20 years, C# consistently ranks as one of the most satisfying languages to use, while C++ usually has a poor reputation (it even has an unofficial mascot of a diseased rat with its leg blown off). That means C# tends to be more enjoyable to work with day to day.\n\nedit: gaming use case for C++",

You have made a good choice (generally, but see my next paragraph) on naming things, which many beginners suck at. \n\nMy main criticism would be the name of the function `generate_board()` - I don't think that's an accurate description of what it does. The board is already \"generated\" and present in the `board` array. This function just *displays* it, so I think a name such as `display_board()` would be more accurate.\n\nThere are many areas for improvement once you learn more and gain more experience, though. \n\nFor example, your `check_winner()` function could be split up to make it shorter and more readable, e.g. create a function `bool is_tie()` which encapsulates the tie determination and returns true or false appropriately, then call that from `check_winner()`.\n\nYou could try separating the game logic from the input/output. By doing that you make it easier to change how the game looks (such as making a GUI version, where the logic is the same, but the display mechanism  is entirely different). \n\nFor example instead of `check_winner()` printing the result, it could return a value that indicates the state of the game.

Here's feedback from beginner stuff to more advanced:\n\nThe good:\n\n\\- Input validation with cin.fail() - many beginners skip this\n\n\\- Clean separation of functions\n\n\\- Consistent formatting\n\nThings to improve:\n\n1. Avoid global variables\n\nRight now board, playing, size\\_of\\_board are all global. This works but doesn't scale. Pass them as parameters instead:\n\nvoid check\\_winner(std::string board\\[\\], bool& playing);\n\n2. Use char instead of std::string for single characters\n\nstd::string for \"x\" and \"o\" is overkill:\n\nconst char X = 'x';\n\nconst char O = 'o';\n\nconst char SPACE = ' ';\n\nchar board\\[9\\] = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};\n\nMore memory efficient and faster comparisons.\n\n3. Use std::array instead of C-style array\n\n\\#include <array>\n\nstd::array<char, 9> board = {' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '};\n\nThen you get board.size() instead of the sizeof trick.\n\n4. Tie detection bug\n\nYour tie check breaks early if it finds a SPACE, but that's wrong - game isn't a tie if there are empty spaces. Should be:\n\nbool is\\_full = true;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {\n\nif (board\\[i\\] == SPACE) {\n\nis\\_full = false;\n\nbreak;\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif (is\\_full) {\n\n// it's a tie\n\n}\n\n\n\n5. Use ternary for turn switching\n\ncurrent\\_turn = (current\\_turn == X) ? O : X;\n\n6. Consider an enum for players\n\nenum class Player { X, O, None };\n\nPrevents invalid states and makes code clearer.\n\n7. Magic numbers\n\n3 and 9 appear everywhere. Define them:\n\nconstexpr int BOARD\\_SIZE = 9;\n\nconstexpr int ROW\\_SIZE = 3;\n\nOverall solid for a beginner. The logic is correct (except tie check), code is readable, and you handled input edge cases. Next steps would be wrapping this in a class and adding a simple AI opponent.\n\nKeep building!",

What you can do is to have functions that don't touch IO at all, and just take parameters and return values. For example, `generate_board` returns a board object (or sets a global variable for now, if you haven't learnt classes yet). `set_cell(x, y, state)` sets the value in the cell, `check_winner` returns the winner. Then you'll have a method called `render_board` that renders the board on to the screen. \n\nSeparating your program into various parts helps in testing (later), and also you'll be able to easily change parts of your program without breaking the other. For example, you can use the same tic tac toe logic, but instead use a GUI window.",

When your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 1 element, you should be able to see that the `if` statement is true and then Pat\\_Divide immediately returns with only that one element.\n\nWhen your main function calls Pat\\_Divide with an array of exactly 3 elements, more imaginary people get involved:\n\n* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.\n* Bob\\_Divide gets one element, immediately sees that the `if` statement is true, and immediately hands back that one element.\n\n* Alice\\_Divide, on the other hand, gets handed a list of 2 elements, and so is unfairly forced to do more work.\n   * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists (of 1 element each) and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide.\n   * Mildred and Leroy act just like Pad\\_Divide did when Pat\\_Divide was given a list of 1 element, and each immediately hand back that 1 element.\n   * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) produces a sorted list of 2 elements.\n   * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.\n\n* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)\n* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.\n\nWhen your main() function calls Pat\\_Divide with a very long array, even more imaginary people get involved, but we don't really need to know all their names:\n\n* Pat\\_Divide divides up that array into 2 lists `left` and `right`, and hands one list to Bob\\_Divide and the other list to Alice\\_Divide.\n* Bob\\_Divide returns a sorted list of all the items in the left list (by involving other yet-unnamed family members).\n\n* Alice\\_Divide does something similar to what she did before:\n   * Alice\\_Divide divides that list into 2 lists and hands those lists off to Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide.\n   * Mildred\\_Divide and Leroy\\_Divide divide their individual lists into even smaller pieces, and hand them off to other family members, who eventually help them produce sorted versions of those lists.\n   * Alice\\_Divide then calls `merge` (or should it be `conquer` ?) with the sorted arrays Mildred and Leroy gave her. The `merge` machine (or perhaps it should be the `conquer` machine?) combines the 2 sorted lists into a single sorted list.\n   * Alice\\_Divide then hands back that sorted list to Pat\\_Divide.\n\n* Then Pat\\_Divide takes the 2 sorted arrays (one from Bob, the other from Alice) and combines them with the `conquer` machine. (Or perhaps the `merge` machine?)\n* Finally, Pat\\_Divide returns with the sorted array of 3 elements back to your main() function.\n\n(Optionally, you may later learn multitaking techniques, so that Mildred, Bob's side of the family, and Leroy can each work on different parts of the problem simultaneously. ).\n\nGood luck trying to explain recursion to the next person!",

Take a selection of playing cards, and put on the table in front of you, make sure they aren't sorted, but still layed out in a nice uniform \"array\".\n2. Then split the array in two halves - moving them a bit towards you (down the table)\n3. Split the two halves in another two halves each, so you have four groups of playing cards, and move them a bit further down.\n4. Continue until you have a number of individual cards layed out with space between them - it still looks exactly like the original array, and feels a bit silly at this point.\n5. But now, merge the two cards to the left, in order from lowest to highest, and move them a bit up the table - do the same for all the rest, so you have a collection of groups of two cards, each group sorted.\n6. Then merge the groups two and two, moving them a bit up the table, so you end up with a collection of groups of four cards, all sorted.\n7. And continue doing that, until you have only a single list of cards, all sorted ...\n\nIt is important that you actually do it, and not just try to imagine it in your mind!\n\nEvery time you move down the table, it is another call to the \"divide\" function, and every time you move up, it is a return from the latest \"divide\" function. Note how you can't return from a divide function, before you returned from the next divide-function that was called! This is what recursion is all about, and it is mindboggling to think about - but it works :)",

Why don’t you stop and go learn about something you feel good about? Do you like programming? Do you like the idea of programming? I’m not judging here — just looking for the other side of your story.\n\n2. A lot of programming involves not knowing the answer. Very often, things don’t work the way you think they should and you have to figure out why. You have to be very open to the idea that you might be wrong, because accepting that is often the key to finding the answer you’re looking for. You have to be okay with feeling frustrated for long periods, and you have to be persistent. Being good at programming is less a matter of knowing all the things and more a matter of being good at figuring out what you don’t know on an hourly basis. If those kinds of feelings make you uncomfortable or unhappy, programming may infeed not be a great career choice.\n\n3. The thing that hooks a lot of people is making stuff work. Seeing your program work exactly the way you want it to feels like an amazing combination of magic and certainty: it’s inspiring even though you know exactly how and why it works. It’s probably the same feeling someone gets when they fire up an engine for the first time after months of rebuilding work. If you’ve never experienced that, you might want to hang in there until you’ve built a few things to see whether you enjoy that part — it might make the rest worthwhile.",

Now, I'm trying to apply to other companies, but I'm scared of the coding assessments. Back in 2025, whenever I applied elsewhere, I would receive LeetCode-style assessments before even getting an interview. I lost hope immediately and didn’t continue with my applications.\n\nRight now, I’m using freeCodeCamp, but I struggled with one of the CSS labs, so I decided to take a break. I also started The Odin Project this new year, and I’m trying to learn it slowly.\n\nSince last week, I’ve been studying DSA because it feels like the only way to get hired in this job market. I try to code on my own first, but I get stuck—especially when there are nested loops. My brain just can’t comprehend the logic. I understand bubble sort and selection sort, but I can’t code them without looking at examples. I don’t know what will happen to me in the future; maybe if I keep learning, I’ll get better. The Odin Project says I need to practice a growth mindset, but studying DSA is so hard that it makes me wonder if I chose the wrong degree.\n\nI didn't choose my degree, my mother wanted me to take it, and I don't really know what I wanted to take before, so I just went with it.\n\nBack in college, I almost failed college algebra and my DSA subject, but I still managed to graduate on time. For algebra, the only reason I struggled was because I didn’t have eyeglasses. By the time I got them, it was already too late to catch up since I couldn’t see what the professor was teaching. For DSA, I didn’t really understand coding and syntax at first. I only started learning properly in my second year.\n\nMaybe I just got lucky before, because my first two jobs only required math assessments and quiz-style tests. If they had required coding assessments, I’m sure I would have failed and not gotten the job.\n\nI wish you the best OP, please know that you are not struggling alone.",

I.e. you \"ask the code base\" what kind of structure it wants to go into and then refactor it into such form.

The indecision comes from looking for certainty that doesn't exist.\n\n**My decision process:**\n\n1. **Start with the usage code, not the implementation** Write how you WANT to use it first: cpp*// Option A* if (Keyboard::Get().IsPressed(Key::Space)) {}  *// Option B*   if (input.keyboard->IsPressed(Key::Space)) {} Which feels better to read/write 50 times? That's your answer.\n2. **Ask \"what might change?\"** If yes → avoid Singleton, use the second approach If no → Singleton is simpler, go with it\n   * Will you ever have 2 keyboards? (multiplayer local co-op?)\n   * Will you need to mock input for testing/replays?\n   * Will input devices be added/removed at runtime?\n3. **Set a time limit** I give myself 30 minutes to decide. After that, I pick one and move on. Bad choice? I'll refactor later. Most \"wrong\" decisions cost way less time than endless deliberation.\n\n**My take on your specific case:**\n\nSingleton for input is fine for a hobby engine. Big engines avoid it for testability and flexibility, but you're not building Unreal. The simpler mental model of `Keyboard::Get()` is worth it.\n\n**The real skill isn't picking the \"best\" design - it's getting comfortable refactoring when requirements change.**\n\nShip something. You'll learn more from hitting real problems than from theorizing.",

This may shock the non devs incthe room, but git doesnt just work for code, nodes you write in a text file can be habdled the same way. New devs hate git, but eventually you'll have used it so much if yiu use it all the time that that feeling would be like an artist wqtching new artists hate using a pencile. \n\nDont take any shortcuts because its annoying, itll become second nature if you use it every single day, touch typing and keeping your fingers on the home row was probably annoying when you learned how to type, now you dont even think about it, and people who type with their pointer fingers look crazy to you simply because you have built the muscle memory needed to use a skill that makes you better at typing without even trying. Git isnt gonna get in your way at all once its second nature, and if you dont use it youre just hurting yourself. But just like how you can learn to type by playing games online, you can passively get better at git by using it when you decide to learn Rust or build a game or write a novel.

Last night I had an interesting dinner conversation with a friend who I consider a genius in tech and business, and he believes the cost of software dev will approach zero as current advances in AI are continually eclipsed by improved models.  Another friend tells me the latest Claude  code is unbelievably good.  Having AI as your learning partner is going to remove so many friction points.  Spend some time learning how to get the most from AI and you’ll be running faster than if you first try to learn one syntax and formal language.  \n\nExample:  my dinner conversation friend likes to make boardgames for himself and friends.  He recently made it in his todo list to a really interesting one where people cooperatively roll dice to try to beat a timer, with a difficulty scaling and hero exhaustion mechanic so the longer some heroes play the more tired they get, causing late rounds of the game to be more challenging.  He needed to build some simulation software to play thousands of rounds of the game in order to derive the right numbers to use as timer values for easy, intermediate, and hard modes.  He started by using AI chatbots to “write by prompt” a python program (he chose python for familiarity) \n\nHe had written about 30 txt files describing the game,!the dice, the heroes, the colors, the map, the paths of forking decisions to move from point to point on the map, the win conditions and on and on.  They were his personal notes, and he hadn’t shown them to any LLMs yet.  \n\nThen he opened the folder in Cursor.  The AI agent read all the files, and a whole list of notes to self and future todo items written in his personal notes.  Then it proceeded to upgrade and expand his simulation script into a ful featured and useful tool.  He has used it to simulate around 200,000 rounds of the game, and even had AI wrote an evaluative controller which would make adjustments to the difficulty levels until simulated games reach a desired success/fail percentage (ie. hard mode should fail 65% of the time on level 1, scaling to 80% fail rate for level 7)\n\nHe opened his laptop and we told AI to rewrite the entire thing in Rust, which completed flawlessly in about two minutes.  Thousands of lines of python translated to rust trivially.   Then we thought of a stumper: build it in Lisp…  it succeeded in another minute or two. \n\nGet conversational with AI … if you want to learn a formal language in depth,  study the very well written code it outputs.",

        "body": "> My question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?\n\nYes. Basically, what you should do is weigh the importance of having applications that can:\n\n1. Horizontally scale, and\n2. Tolerate/self-heal from outages \n\n...much more strongly then you normally would for personal projects.\n\nUsually, we ignore reliability for personal projects. But if you're trying to practice distributed systems, it makes sense to make it your main focus, even if there isn't really a need for it.\n\n> Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.\n\nI think it'll be possible for you to pick up a solid basic understanding of these tools -- enough for you to get an understanding of their strengths/weaknesses, and when to use them.\n\nPicking up a truly in-depth understanding may be harder. Usually, that deeper intuition comes only after either dedicated study or after spending an extended amount of time using the tool in production, seeing first-hand the limitations and quirks of that tool.\n\n> If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n1. Deliberately give your app very small amounts of cpu/mem, and/or deliberately add in sleep statements and such into your app to forcibly handicap your app so it can handle only 3 QPS or something. This means even modest amounts of traffic will cause a naive app to start becoming overloaded, which in turn gives you multiple opportunities to practice building support for horizontally scaling.\n2. Look into setting up automatic horizontal autoscaling of some sort, to automate downsizing your application when you're not currently stress-testing it.\n3. Alternatively, if your app is inherently expensive to run, just completely tear it down every time you're finished for the day. To reduce tedium, look into using terraform or something to automate the setup and teardown.\n4. Eventually, consider using something like Kubernetes to run everything. This will obviously take a lot more effort -- but doing it does mean you can test locally by setting up Kubernetes on your local machine, using VMs to simulate running on a fleet of machines. \n\nAside from simulating traffic, also be sure to do chaos testing of some sort, where you randomly kill your machines to simulate unexpected hardware failures and/or temporarily network blackhole them to confirm your application as a whole can tolerate it, not lose user data, not enter an inconsistent state, etc.\n\n> Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.\n\nYeah -- I'd say it's overkill in general. In production, state is the enemy: the moment something is stateful, you have to worry about keeping it backed up/replicated in some way so you can tolerate unexpected hardware/network failure, which in turn often places constraints on how you can scale, etc...\n\nThis is why DDIA spends so much time talking about databases and such -- figuring out how to manage state is by far the hardest part of designing and maintaining a distributed system.\n\nSo for a prod system, it behooves us to go out of our way to design our architecture to keep as many of our components stateless as possible. (Stateless == they may maintain a local cache, but it'd be perfectly fine and safe to abruptly nuke a replica at any time.)\n\nBut for a toy project, I think your instinct is correct. Now is the best time to play around with different technologies, even when they're not needed. This may end up causing your overall architecture to be more complex then needed, but I think that's perfectly acceptable if your goal is to become comfortable with different cloud/distributed-systems building blocks.",

Do you have a sort of mental checklist that a project needs to qualify for before doing so, or is it more just a second nature kind of thing?\n\n\nI know you may never need a microservice as it might introduce more complexity than it's worth, for example, but I'm wondering when you are like \"yeah okay, we need a microservice here\".\n\n\nExample from my experience of when to decouple was, and I know this super small fry, I added a lambda to run some puppeteer code to generate PDFs on AWS as we ran into some strange IIS worker processor quirk where the chrome process was executed twice when running this on Node/Nest. Spent about 2 days trying to figure it out until I went the AWS option instead. This came with the benefit of not having a heavy dependency like puppeteer in our bundle, although it does come with the cost of vendor lock-in to a feature, which I'm okay with in this case since there's a daily S3 cleanup and the function is used 10 times a day most, so cost is non existent.\n\n\nAlso thanks again, this really has been invaluable feedback/input, I wish I could upvote you more than once!",

As you've discovered, checking pixel-level collisions like this is a bit performance intensive.\n\nMost games don't check collisions this way.  Instead, like \"You can't move through walls\" or \"If an enemy touches you, you die\" are determined by representing both the character and the object as simple shapes.  Boxes and circles are the most popular (often the sides of the box are parallel to the coordinate axes which makes the math super simple).  A \"capsule\" shape is also quite easy (it's just the union of a box and two circles).  Triangles involve more math to program, but may be helpful if you want arbitrary rotation or more complicated shapes (any shape is approximately a polygon; any polygon can be broken into triangles).\n\nOften the hitbox really is, quite literally, a box!",

I.e. they're not a point but a full 2d space. Then you need a loop to check all their points no? Also, here for more than 1 obstacle, you would need to apply these if statements comparing to each obstacle in the scene constantly right (so you need a dictionary of obstacles & their positions, or something like that, and loop thru it)",

Most sellers use Shopify/WooCommerce but their payment flows go through Stripe, Shopify Payments, PayPal, etc. When refunds happen or chargebacks occur, the reconciliation is manual Excel nightmare.\n\n\n\nMy approach:\n\n1. Python backend that syncs with Stripe API daily\n\n2. Automated matching between transactions, refunds, and bank deposits\n\n3. Fuzzy matching for edge cases (partial refunds, order splits, etc)\n\n4. Alerting when discrepancies hit thresholds\n\n\n\nLearning: building reliable payment integrations is WAY harder than docs suggest. Stripe's API is solid but reconciliation logic across different payment methods is chaotic.\n\n\n\nThe data science angle: this is just supervised classification on transaction pairs - pattern matching code does what humans do but without typos. The problem isn't technical - it's that nobody wants to build \"boring\" tools.\n\n\n\nBut this is exactly where first-principles thinking wins. The market doesn't care if your SaaS is sexy - they care if it saves them hours of manual work and prevents chargebacks.",

My advice is to hustle as much as possible and think about all the ways you can say “I’m a good engineer, I’ll provide value to a company.”",

The trick with personal projects is to make them using relevent skills e.g. study the job descriptions youre looking to apply to and decide which frameworks/libraries/languages to use based off what theyre looking for, and make sure to put those keywords in the bullet points for those projects. Hot take but it matters less what the project actually is meant to do rather than what you used to build it—as long as its at least a little interesting and not super generic (weather app, todo app, etc) , your idea is fine. This will increase your chances of getting interviews.\n\nWhen it comes to interviewing, its a separate skill, I dont think having internship/work experience necessarily helps with interviewing skills. Technical Interviews are either leetcode style (practice by doing leetcode), conceptual questions (easy to prep for via google/chatgpt or through your school notes), or system design (not usually asked for new grads, but I had one for the offer I landed and I genuinely think my experience working on personal projects are what made me not completely bomb it, and I highly doubt interns are learning system design skills well if at all).\n\nFor behavioral interviews, when they ask about working on a team you can just talk about group projects you did at school. The literal thing/impact that the project did is irrelevant outside of giving context for a story. Passing behavioral interviews are all about framing yourself as a good teammate that the interviewer would enjoy working with.",

Yes, there are more opportunities here but it's not surprising to me that you're having difficulty being considered for them. I think you'd do yourself a significant favor by being open to relocating, even if it's out to somewhere you'd rather not live. What you need right now is experience and you need to be open to whatever you need to do to get it. That might mean living in Boise for a few years or something.\n\nIf you have to stay in the bay, then you need to network hard. You're not likely to get a job by spamming your resume at automated filters. You need someone to take a chance on you, and that's more likely to happen if they know you, not just your resume. Go to meet ups, see if you can find a start up founder or something who just needs warm bodies willing to work for less than market rate and just get some years of experience under your belt. The more experience you have the easier all this gets, but you may have to eat shit for a while to get it.",

If you report this to his next level or HR, he will get fired. So this can mean one of the following:\n\n  \n1.  If you are a good performer, and expecting a salary raise, your manager want to give you that raise, but he feels unable to negotiate with upper management, so he is nudging you to get an offer and then use that as a leverage for your own sake. \n\n2. Your manager has insights into upcoming downsizing and he is okay if you go. He is pretending to \"match\" your offer but giving you a chance to secure a good position. \n\n3. Your manager for some dark reason is working against the interest of the company. He is either disgruntled. \n\n4. Perhaps he is really concerned for his future, and sees that you have become relaxed at work place and not growing your skills, so this is his clever way of making you realise that you are still not good enough as an all rounded engineer. \n\n5. Perhaps he is really concerned about your future, and general nature of the industry and the need to be in the habit of interviewing. \n\n6. Your manager is just plain stupid and doesn't know how to do his job properly. \n\n  \nI think it is a combination of 1 and 6.

Clean UI design can be subjective, and really in practice we often just have to implement whatever Product and Design teams ask us to do. For the real time chat interface did you implement it via REST, websockets? Did you persist the conversation history client side via local storage or backend in a database? Did you use caching to speed up conversation loading? How is the web application scalable, (did you containerised it, used server less)? If you get to the stage where the hiring manager gets to see the resume, they may be curious to see the demo of your projects.",

I'd only focus on roles that are in your old tech stack, that are in office, and require 0-3 years of experience.\n\nI'd also highly recommend the OMSCS at Georgia tech. It costs 8k and has a great course catalog. It'll give you a hard reset and gives you an opportunity to apply to internships alongside applying to full-time roles. \n\nAs for your resume, you need to look at Jake's resume, it's a standardized template. Have gemini distill your experience and format it to fit in Jake's resume. I feel like gemini has the best creative and visual model so it'd be the best for this use case. There are other standardized resume templates, I'm not positive Jake's resume is still the most recommended so do your research. I remember his resume template being referenced all the time a few years ago.\n\nUse a mock interview platform to find where your weaknesses are (idk what they are, I think pramp is one?). Pay for it and utilize it as much as necessary. \n\nOnce you fine-tune your ability to conduct interviews, grind leetcode for 3-4 months, 30 to 60 mins a day with one day off a week. Use neetcode.io. No excuses. Stretch it to 6 months if you want to target highly paid roles at tech companies. \n\nTake whatever salary you can get, even if it's 60k it doesn't matter. You need to get back into the market, rebuild your marketability. After a year or two you can focus on more desirable roles. \n\nSeriously you can do this, I don't care how bad the market is 2.5 years is unacceptable. You're unfocused and undisciplined. No offense. Be hungry and tenacious. \n\nGood luck man, I believe in you.",

You really need do everything in your power to stand out nowadays. I’m sure you’re applying to jobs frequently like many others and I’m sorry to take the tough love approach, but you need to try harder.\n\nSome advice I can share however is looking for production support(L2 or L3) roles. These roles have a lower barrier of entry and you work adjacent to software engineers to resolve production issues. Not the most exciting job, but can lead to something better over time by having some dialogue with managers about your skillset if openings become available internally.\n\nAlso as some others have said, your resume could definitely use some refactoring. Best of luck!",

Startups are about much more, including marketing, sales, networking, and LUCK.\n\nSecond: The market is currently really bad for any and all software related jobs, in fact it's worse for developers and designers, I feel like. You're not the only one with no replies, even if you are senior level.\n\nThird: Isn't engineering what you love? Are you as good and passionate about anything else than this? If your financial situation isn't super tight, you should really pour your heart and soul into your next startup, whether it's something you've tried before or something brand new. It might take months, maybe years, but if this is what you want to do, you have to approach it as something you love and not something you're nervous it will fail. If your financial situation is tight, then you make ends meet with jobs perhaps unrelated to software, but you keep working on a product you have in mind on the side. If coding, programming and software development is what makes you happy, you should do it regardless of income potential.\n\nYou seem confused about one important thing: you meld successful career/income with engineering. I think you should shift your mindset - if development is truly what you enjoy, do it regardless of success and income. Nowadays, those who succeed as engineers are both talented and lucky. So the most important thing to do is to continue developing software while networking, applying for jobs and/or trying a new startup. I know the latter might not seem very appealing to you, but it's the only way to sustain income while continuing to do what you love.",

We could easily do exactly the same. We don't even have to make them insanely high, follow a protectionist strategy or trade wars. Just a \"small\" reciprocal DST on revenue is all you need. \n\nFor example, take the France DST, 3%, if your gross ad, digital or e-commerce revenue is 100M, even if you made 0 profit, even if you made a loss, you owe France 3M. They did set a high 25M threshold to avoid hitting small companies but no tech giant with a large French audience can scape it. UK does something similar but 2%. India's one is even higher at 6% of gross revenue but it's limited to ads and their related services.\n\nDo that same thing on the gross cost of offshoring and the problem solves itself overnight.

It ca go both ways.\n\nIn my case, it helped, but there are no guarantees.\n\n> Did you feel more exposed during layoffs? \n\nI didn't, no.\n\n> How did you make your value visible when outcomes were less tangible?\n\nWhen I'm in a more architectur'y or tech lead'y roles it is more about mentoring and communication, so the more you're seen around the teams, helping out, answering questions and just being someone that enables those around you, then that is mostly enough.\n\nMaking other teams succeed is also a success for you. Just make sure that you're actually a part of that success and not leeching of it (looking at you middle management).\n\nIn higher positions you also get to start initiatives you believe brings value, and that value can be measured in some way.

I had an impossible situation of kicking something off with a bunch of people who had poor skills, poor follow through, and poor attitudes. I was heavily involved in terminating over 80% of the team, including my boss. All while trying (and obviously failing) to make forward progress and then playing catchup while onboarding the new team while dealing with an unhappy customer who just wanted results. I was very busy for a period with HR actions, customer engagements to appease an upset customer, serving the role of like 5 different positions, trying to come up with clever ways to meet impossible milestones, convincing company leadership that the project was completely screwed and we needed help, etc. \n\nI went from boring to extremely not boring. But one type of burn out to another. Having a mountain of work to get done that grows much faster than you burn it down, constantly pivoting to emergent tasks that had to be resolved immediately and had me up until 3am writing documents and building slides, dealing with nasty people on the regular… it really wears you out.

You’re not doing it wrong, it really is this hard sometimes.",

I can tell you what helped me through it.\n\nSmall daily tasks help just because it's easy to snowball into larger ones. On days where I didn't fell like writing yet another cover letter I'd convince myself to just find 3 job ads I liked and leave the tabs open, which would turn into starting the cover letter, and eventually into applying to all 3. Also, start using an AI assistant to help, like copy+pasting the role text into it and getting a score for your profile. Networking helps a lot, I suck at it so I can't help, but you should try to expand your Linkedin friends list. Speaking of Linkedin, forget Easy Apply, I haven't heard of a single person who got hired through it. A really good advice I found was, find Linkedin Easy Apply jobs and then apply through the company website. Good luck",

I assume that as soon as you knock the rust off in 3-6 months, you will leave for a Senior role with Senior pay. It’s too risky to hire you.\n​The Better Strategy:\nInstead of lowering your title, lower the company tier temporarily.\n​Avoid Big Tech/Startups for now. Their interview loops are brutal on 'rusty' candidates.\n​Target 'Boring' Industries. Look for Mid/Senior Data Engineer roles at insurance firms, hospitals, regional banks, or manufacturing companies.\n​The interview bar is often lower (less LeetCode, more practical SQL/Python).\n​The pace is slower, allowing you to re-learn on the job.\n​Rust ≠ Junior.

It's an absolutely awful market, and there are people more skilled than you or farther ahead of you applying for the same roles as you, and forming part of the N hundred other applications for each listing you see. How are you going to prove yourself better than them? How are you going to convince hiring managers to move forward with you, and not them?\n\nIf a while passes after you graduate and you've still got nothing in hand, I'd seriously consider going to grad school, but for a non-CS field. Some fields others here have mentioned include nursing, teaching, business (MBA), law, medicine, or some form of engineering. Some of these are harder than CS, but offer stronger career outlooks and better job security. The trades could be yet another option, but know that a lot of their hype is even more inflated than that of CS, and they're genuinely not for everyone.\n\nDon't wait around hoping for the economy to improve, either, because it genuinely might never. Did the automobile jobs ever come back to Detroit? Did factory workers ever get their jobs back? Exactly. And don't expect AI to \"create new tech jobs\" either, they're not going to be junior jobs.\n\nI'm sorry, I know I'm sounding pretty negative right now, but I don't want to give anyone a false sense of hope or security. It really is that bad, and we're all in the same boat. Just prepare for a rough next couple of years.",

My advice would be to dip you toes in backend. Be full stack. If you're getting blocked by backend bs, build some solutions to those problems. If they're good, you become the product owner/go to and then you really can't get replaced. I have a friend who had similar issues working for a large real estate company and left. within a couple months of leaving, he was offered nearly triple his TC to work as a contactor and maintain the systems he built. I'm trying to do something at my current company; large healthcare servicer, so we're probably dealing with a lot of the same issues you are.\n\nIf that's not your thing, build stuff you're interested in. Doesn't matter what it is or if it's related to your current role at all. Just build something interesting to you so you're motivated to dive deep and and really learn the low level nitty gritty. When that gets boring, try building something else. If it doesn't get boring, maybe you can build something really high quality and useful, and now you run your own company, definitely not replaceable.",

Make a list of your teammates, and rank them from 1-3 on trust, higher is better. 3 means you both banter about your personal life and support each other when management does dramatic things. **Note: If you have none of these people, stop here and start building those relationships.**\n\n2. Grab some time to shoot the shit with your high trust buddies one on one. Tactfully ask how the company promotes, evolves people, and grows. Get specific, examples, resumes, etc.\n\n3. Use this information to make a case for why you should be paid more. **Note: Typically management cares about outcomes (customer satisfaction, revenue, cost, logos), not inputs (time, energy) or outputs (code, features, etc). If you don't have outcomes, you almost certainly don't \"deserve\" a raise.**\n\n4. Apply to other companies in the area and start working with recruiters. This is your reality check. **Note: If you aren't getting in the door, you now know you _can't_ earn more elsewhere. If you aren't getting past the interviews you now know where your weaknesses are.**\n\n5. Get decently far into the interviews (interviews are between 3 and 5 rounds long, once you're getting to finals (and not necessarily passing them) you should feel pretty high conviction you can land a new job.\n\n6. Tell your manager, in writing, at least 24 hours before your next 1:1, that you'd like some feedback on how to improve here. Mention your most impactful project and your least impactful project. This will signal to your manager that you're highly coachable (asking for feedback).\n\n7. At this 1:1, listen, ask non-defensive clarifying questions (e.g. \"Oh, so that wasn't as impactful as I thought. I'd like to do better next time around, how would you prefer I approach that situation when it comes up again?\").\n\n8. After the 1:1 take notes, reflect, and integrate all the knowledge you now have (peer's input on how promotions are handled, your performance in interviews, your manager's perception of you, your manager's ability to guide/help you grow)\n\n9. 24 hours before the next 1:1, tell your manager, in writing, that you'd like to discuss what growth at the company would look like in their eyes. **Note: This is the start of the negotiation. If there is a formal performance review process your manager will almost certainly shunt you to it. In that case this meeting is about learning the rules of that game and how to play it well. If there isn't a formal review process and your manager is good they will lay out a path, if they're bad, they'll wander around the subject.**\n\n10. Take notes, reflect, integrate. Your goal here is to answer this question: Do I leave, play the promo game, or wield power (threaten to leave) to get more money?\n\nAt this point you should know what you want and need to do.\n\nGood luck kiddo!",

Can you build a server that allows both ingress and egress, to specific machines? Can you troubleshoot a connection error besides just what it is. Can you tell me why you need 443 over 22? Stuff like that doesn’t seem helpful, but when I’m setting a network in a new AWS or azure account, it really really helps.)\n- Proficiency in GitHub, Gitlab, whatever they use, they’re a dime a dozen.\n- Workflows (GitHub actions, whatever Gitlab uses, etc. They are so incredibly helpful for automating but even now half of my co workers don’t understand them.)\n- Jira, ADO (whatever ticketing system you need to use. Companies need a reason to give your team a budget and good ticketing is unfortunately the start of that)\n- documentation (underrated it’s incredibly helpful when the person has well documented code, or a well documented process. It looks good on you later on if other teams need to use it)\n\nJava, Python, ansible, C++, etc aren’t as important. The foundations are good, but if your only selling point is that you can code, it surprisingly doesn’t get you far unless you’re a genius. \n\nSoft skills are arguably more important as well over some of these hard skills. I can train anyone to work on AWS, show them the repository and they can learn the application. But can you email me that you missed a deadline? Can you appropriately set up meetings/emails? Can you own up to a mistake? Can you work with the smartest person on your team? Can you break down problems for the dumbest person on your team? Are you fun at happy hours? Will you be a toxic or positive asset to the team? \n\nThat stuff matters quite a bit, just learning everything and trying to regurgitate it won’t get you far. Be humble but confident, be moldable, and be willing to do crappy stuff at first to learn.",

The way most companies set salaries is using market reference points - the market is roughly geographic and industry tied, though companies can kinda pick and choose who they think is competing for the same workers (software engineer at a FAANG and programmer in the IT department of a paper company are probably not in the same survey).\n\nSo, junior dev in some industry group and city has a median of $X. A new grad offer might be 80% * $X and the company might say that the salary band for junior is 80%-120% of the market reference. Each year they get a new market reference and also adjust target points - performance based. So if the market reference is at $110k and you're at $91k, they might bump you up 2-5% on the target. If the market reference goes up, you might get a juicier raise. If it goes down, you get less of a raise. You'll have a target point and an effective point - they won't cut pay if you're target is lower than your effective, but your raises will be smaller.\n\nIf you start getting above 100%, the raises are often lower. At that point they're thinking \"get promoted to get more money\" - part of the reason for the wider bands is to be able to make offers to people being hired away from other jobs.\n\nIf your friend got 5 years of really good raises, I'd bet on a rapidly climbing reference point (2010-2022 were pretty good years) along with being below the midpoint target, then some pullbacks in reference point and being above target.\n\nManagers don't typically know what the reference points will be and also don't really know how you'll perform relative to expectations.",

At this stage in your career, you should be hoping to level up every 2-3yrs. Sometimes faster depending on the company. A high growth startup is the type of environment I would expect to progress quicker assuming I’m contributing at a high level. If you aren’t promoted in the first 2yrs of being there, seek employment elsewhere unless you really strongly believe your equity is worth sticking around for (it often isn’t but there’s always exceptions)",

Telling them you really want to do SWE signals that you will be unhappy in the role they are hiring for.\n​The Role itself (Red Flag): You mentioned 'hardware troubleshooting.' Be very careful here. True SRE is software engineering applied to infrastructure (coding in Python/Go, writing Terraform, managing scale). It is a great foundation for becoming a Backend Engineer or System Architect later.\n​The Risk: If the role is actually just IT Support/SysAdmin disguised with an SRE title (which the 'hardware' part suggests), it will be hard to pivot back to SWE later because you won't be pushing code.\n​Strategy: Apply for the SRE role as is. In the interview, ask: 'What percentage of my time will be spent writing code vs. manual troubleshooting?' If the coding is <30%, keep looking.",

Now I do fully agree with your parents; that you should use it because it will be the future. I think with that in mind, you should use it but FULLY understand what it is the AI is giving back to you as a response. Like \"why does this work?\", and \"why would this answer be better?\" should cross your mind. That's the approach I have taken when using AI for my personal projects. It helps too, because if you complete something one way, there will almost certainly be a more faster and elegant way to complete said task.

Seems counter intuitive to hire a “consultant” without any industry experience, but that’s how they do it. Bring em in green and mold them how they want.\n\nAnd if you get hired into one of these consulting firms as one of their junior software devs, that obviously will have many parallels to being a new grad SWE at any other company.

It takes a long time for those to pay off, 6+ months of regularly going to local dev meetups and such, time for people to know you, to appreciate when you helped them out (ie Oh you're UI/UX, I know someone who was looking for UI/UX, talk to them!).\n\nSolutions Architect is good too. It's similar to Dev Associate. As I understand, Dev Associate is harder (deeper, vs wider). I couldn't tell you if SAA is impressive on it's own, or if both are worth it. Many people do SAA then do Dev. I felt that just getting Dev, the harder, more important one, done on it's own was enough. SAA is still tough too I imagine (2 vs 3 months basically?). \n\nI can only speak to my own experience and say I went from 0 interviews to weekly with the Dev Associate. Did I get more interviews because I had Dev over SAA? I don't know.\n\nSAA and Dev Associate are both good. Which, or both, I couldn't tell you 100%, but I went with Dev because I've heard it's more relevant to a web dev/full stack/SWE role.\n\nCouldn't speak on IT but I know IT is hard to break into too these days.\n\nI had very basic AWS experience before hand, basically deploying a couple websites on EC2 and some user permissions for a company. The stuff these certs go over are solutions for very large scale applications, thing basic simple websites don't usually need. It helped but wasn't huge.\n\nI'd say just pass the test to get the cert, you won't fully understand the material yet, but the first step of learning is just get the basic knowledge down. Then once you start making projects with that knowledge, it'll all make sense.",

Although I did get one phone interview from Capital One, where I talked to the recruiter but she told me that I would get rejected from the position since I didnt meet the baseline requirements of a 1.5 year minimum for the position. She gave me her number and told me to apply again in January since that is when I would meet the requirement. I am going to text her soon now, and apply to the position she tells me to apply to, but I am wondering on whether I should put this startup I had a big part in founding, and getting off the ground. Its only 3 months in and its steadily growing traction. I obviously don't get paid by it yet so need another full time job on top of it. Should i include it on my resume? I think I have done some cool things while working on it and it rounds out my skills well. My only concern is whether this would dissuade recruiters from selecting me for an interview since it may seem like I wouldn't be able to put the time commitment into the paying full time job. For the record, I've done a pretty good job on balancing both and still am able to perform well at my current job. Just concerned on whether this is a plus or a con to a recruiter. I would love some feedback on this and my resume overall. Thanks!\n\nresume: [https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu](https://imgur.com/gallery/resume-JUm59Cu)",
