Often I would concede to a different design, and after some time the team would arrive at what dimensional modelling advises. E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said \"well Kimball advises against this because its trouble\" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.\n\nIt is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data. Now we have the cloud and storage is less limited. Our mental capacity still is limited, so it is easier to reason about facts and dimensions in separation, rather than a 100-column big table.\n\n...and what about many to many?",

Something lighter like Liftbridge (Kafka semantics, single Go binary, no JVM/ZooKeeper) or just NATS JetStream covers 90% of cases.\n\nOn the storage side - totally agree on \"one source of truth, columnar, object storage.\" We're building Arc with exactly this mindset: DuckDB for compute, Parquet for storage, S3-compatible backend. No distributed cluster to babysit, SQL interface, handles GB-to-TB scale without the Spark tax.\n\nThe line I use: if I can run the query on a single node in acceptable time, I don't need a distributed system.

You kinda have to enjoy learning, adapting to new tech, new data sources, shifting business needs, all of it. Patterns and best practices aren’t nearly as clean or standardized as software dev either, and so much depends on the context of the data. It’s a lot to keep in your head.\n\nThat said, I still love it. The newer tools are genuinely interesting, and AI is opening up some cool possibilities. Business folks need someone to make sense of the data chaos, and it’s pretty satisfying to be the one who stitches it together into something useful.\n\nI’ve been director-level for about 15 years and managed to stay pretty hands-on until recently. Even now, I try to keep up so I can actually lead effectively, and I’ll jump at any excuse to write some code just to stay sharp (and maybe flex a bit for the team!).\n\nIf you’re losing passion, I’d seriously look at changing projects or orgs before bailing on the field. A good team and leadership that encourage experimentation and improvement make a huge difference. It’s still a solid career, and one underrated perk is that data folks tend to be closer to business goals and strategy than pure app devs. That context keeps things interesting, at least for me and if you can find a good company to work for.",

I wish I discovered my interest for it in youth, to be one of those kids who were already tinkering with operating systems for years before they hit college age. I wish I was the one developing these distributed database systems we all use, or working on computer vision in Robots, or computer graphics, or similarly challenging highly-specialized programming domains. I appreciate the contact with programming I get through DE but want to keep progressing towards roles that are less \"spit out an airflow script to coordinate SQL routines\".\n\nI recently accepted a new data platform job where I'll be a dedicated python developer working on internal libraries and tooling. So it's a move in the right direction towards more of a core SWE role.\n\nI don't honestly know that much about advanced SQL or data modeling and data governance. I've learned enough and find it interesting enough, but it's not my main interest.\n\nHow are your soft skills and interest in dealing with people? Could you pivot to an adjacent role that leverages those?",

Our goal is to eventually create data standards and enforce them so the data is actually a good quality. This is a slow process, but I'm optimistic. \n\nThe central BI team does seem to have a problem with scale. At my company, most of the functional users don't have BI experts and can't use PBI - at least nowhere near the quality that the BI team does. However, the BI team moves quite slowly to produce the reporting. The result is that functional teams build their own custom, low governance, reporting off the centralized data out of necessity. By the time BI develops the right tools, the business doesn't need it anymore and doesn't want to switch. \n\nMy untested idea is to give the business access to easy to use cloud based dashboarding tools (like Sigma for example). Then BI provides support, underlying data models, and connectivity to non enterprise grade sources like SharePoint. \n\n\nIn short, decentralizing everything without governance cannot work. Centralizing everything without a plan to scale cannot work. A data mesh is the tightrope that attempts to balance this. It is probably the right answer, but the degree of decentralization depends on the company.",

We didn’t say we were implementing Data Mesh because few outside IT knew about it or understood it. Instead, our aim was to modernize the data platform, speed up delivery of technical solutions, and empower the business with self-service capabilities and less reliance on the IT organization.\n\nWe were successful in many areas while other elements remained a challenge. For example, we migrated the two largest data platforms from on-premises, self-hosted and managed servers, to native services in the public cloud. Later, we built “lakehouse” capabilities on top of the public cloud platform. These included data governance features, automated data security, and data domains built for key areas of the business such as human resources, marketing, supply chain, etc. The benefits were quite profound. Within the first 2 years we had empowered 50+ business teams. Between year 1 and year 2 we saw 500% growth in teams able to use their data and the platform to create things that matter. Business teams recognized improved decision-making across the enterprise, increased efficiency and cost savings, accelerated speed-to-value for data product creation, and secure data sharing between teams.\n\nWhile we experienced success, the challenges were many. Some teams thought the changes were just another fad IT came up with. Given their prior experiences they were honestly justified in thinking that. Other teams were interested but couldn’t get their leadership to buy in or they didn’t have enough technical chops to harness their domain data on their own. They continued to rely on central IT. Other business teams were so focused on their own projects and demands they simply couldn’t make the initial shift. They asked us to come back later. A thru line that helped in most situations was having clear executive leadership support (CIO, CEO, CDO, and others). They would knock down roadblocks where needed and help provide resources when we got stuck.\n\nAfter 3 years in the journey one thing was abundantly clear. Technology was not the largest challenge. People and culture were. It took tremendous energy to cast the vision and bring people and teams along with us. This required persistent communication with all business teams and clear demonstration of the value of public cloud through demos, pilots, and “soft releases” of products, apps, and services. The technical teams (platforms, cloud, data, security) all became storytellers if they weren’t already. \n\nTo this day I don’t call the transformation a “data mesh implementation.” But we certainly knew of and studied Data Mesh and sought to implement core principles it espoused: self-service, decentralized data domains/ownership, data governance, and a focus on data product creation within business teams.",

Being solo DE is kinda scary though, youll be the bottleneck for everything and oncall will probably suck\n\nOffer 2: azure fabric is newer but dbt is everywhere. migration projects can be a resume builder but also a pain. again solo DE which means youre gonna be stretched thin. dbt is super hot rn though\n\nOffer 3: this ones interesting because you actually have a team. 2 seniors to learn from is huge for growth, and aws + python is the most common stack youll see. Protobufs are solid for data contracts. platform work is also really good experience\n\nimo id lean toward offer 3. having a team means you can actually learn and grow instead of just firefighting all day. aws + python is the most transferable stack and platform engineering is a good direction. the solo DE thing in offers 1 and 2 sounds like a burnout speedrun tbh\n\nDatabricks is cool but not worth being the only DE on a team at 2.5 YOE. Youll learn way more with seniors around. Whats the comp difference between them?",

You need very clean, very well tagged, very well modelled data. The example I always give is that if you go to the table marked “sales” and count the number of sales…. That is not even remotely correct. Years of schema evolution, changes to products, and poor engineering mean the actual number is much harder to derive. \n\nFor conversational analytics, the prompts must be very carefully tuned and the AI will straight up invent things if you aren’t careful. I would not trust it in the least.\n\nFor the CoSQL model, I haven’t tried to use it, but I notice that solution architects are suggesting I use it rather than curating dbt so I can use that to control our transformation logic. In that regard, it’s a complete distraction and a massive net-negative.\n\n“We don’t have working data products” is the same problem we have had for years and it’s the same problem that will make AI tools harder to implement even if they are viable, but it’s far too unsexy an issue to attract attention.\n\nI am hoping that if I can make clear the dependency that AI has on working data products it might get me the resources and tooling I have needed all along.",

Since a lot of human knowledge is embedded in text, this gives us quite a good basis to create large langauge models that can mirror quite a bit of that knowledge. However, large language models are not very good at doing abstract reasoning on anything other than text, which includes a lot of the work you do as an analyst by traslating some fuzzy business logics to maths, at least for anything nontrivial beyond textbook problems. You may attempt to alleviate this somewhat by providing good metadata for context, but my experience is that this doesn't really solve the problem and i very much doubt this will improve untill we get a different class of models all together as the \"more data+larger models\" approach yields diminishing returns due to sublinear scaling of LLMs wrt. data and size.\n\nNote: you should take everything i say with a grain of salt, as i am a practitioner using LLMs and my formal training is in physics, not NLP.",

The hard part isn't the LLM at all; it's the systems and guardrails around it.\n\nIf someone wants to roll their own, the pieces that actually matter are:\n\n**1) Explicit semantic layer**\n\nYou can't let the agent figure out business logic because it's incapable. Metrics, joins, definitions, and edge cases have to be defined in dbt models, semantic views, or a metadata layer\n\nIf you don't, you run the inevitable risk of fluent nonsense from the LLM. (Variance will get you eventually)\n\n**2) A constrained query surface** (Especially important if you're giving the agent to end users)\n\nDon't let the model generate raw SQL and hope for the best.  \nRestrict it to: A verified query library / A constrained DSL / Parameterised patterns.  \nThis removes a huge amount of hallucination and makes failures actually diagnosable.\n\n**3) Feedback loop/flywheel**\n\n**This is** ***critical.***\n\nYou need traces of every input, generated query, and failure mode so you can see:\n\n* Where the semantic layer is missing context\n* Which inputs result in varied rather than consistent outputs (not reliable + potentially incorrect)\n* Where the agent is making the same wrong assumptions repeatedly\n\nWithout that loop, you cannot really improve the agent, but with it, you can patch gaps, clarify metrics, and improve the agent's ability over time.\n\nThat’s the main stuff people underestimate when they say “just add an agent”.\n\nFor full disclosure, I've ended up building this approach into a full product called Inconvo that helps teams develop their semantic layer and includes built-in query guardrails and feedback loop tracing.\n\nAlso, for those data engineering teams being asked to build this for customer-facing use cases (pretty common these days and a huge ask!) Inconvo has an API and integrations so data engineers can focus on data correctness instead of auth, UI, and other historically full-stack work.\n\n**Main take:**\n\nNone of this works without good old data engineering and well-modelled data; the agent just amplifies whatever assumptions you bake in.\n\nInterested to hear where others have hit the limits of this approach.",

Like a carriage return + linefeed inside a column, text columns not wrapped in double quotes when they should be, a comma instead of a period for Decimal columns (French format), dates that are not YYYY-MM-DD, again, Europe/Quebec versus English North America. I get DD-MM-YYYY in these files, UTF-8, and French accents. It all works.\n\nSo if you load in a \"binary\" way you maintain whatever UTF-8 or Iso6500 the file was sent as, and parsing is easy with sub-selects on every column. I run the biz rule analyzer first, and only for IsValidData=1 do we import. Then we use DB\\_SendMail function to the appropriate biz unit of the invalid data.\n\nHonestly, the code quality of SaaS and input forms have taken a serious nose dive since 2020's. What happens when you use the lowest bidder to build your SaaS system.\n\nHTH",

The key is to give the peers a heads up that you have a change that needs to be fast tracked before you start development so everybody in the chain of responsibilities are aware and ready to engage when development is complete.\n\nThe challenge you describe with merge conflicts should only happen if multiple people are working on the exact same file. If this is a common occurrence, you should understand why multiple people need to change the same file. Your code structure may need to be improved to separate a monolithic file into smaller individual files and rebuilt in runtime.\n\nAdditionally, having good branch hygiene is important. Don't keep reusing the same branch for all changes. Open a new branch for each change and prune orphaned branches. Every new change should be based on the current state of Prod so the resulting PR should only be the specific change you are trying to make. Once the PR is merged, you should delete the branch. If a new change is needed, create a new branch. This also lets you more easily abandon a bad change during dev (delete the branch) and start over if necessary.",

This can provide a significant edge to performance.\n   * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume.\n   * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here!  You may need to turn them off on massive fact tables, but you can also use them at least with summary & dimension tables.\n   * AWS RDS has pretty slow IO, but other hosting options can provide blisteringly-fast servers.  But you may need to have postgres dba skills.\n   * All the above assumes vanilla postgres.  Adding extensions for duckdb, columnar storage (hydra), etc can provide faster performance in many cases.\n\nFYI: I migrated part of my snowflake reporting to postgres on RDS a few years ago in order to save a bunch of money.  IIRC it was about $20k/month saved AND my queries were much faster.  So, while I would not propose that a single node Postgres instance will always outperform a distributed database, there are absolutely scenarios in which it will.",

Microsoft has the free SQL Server Express for OLTP - perfect for staging area - 10 gig limit per database - so have a DB per source and ingest, you'll have 2 cpu peformance and decent ram usage (16g I think, check Microsoft's web page).\n\nSo what's nice with SQL Server Express is it plays nice with your AD and talks easily to other MSSQL systems, so you can avoid flat files when flat files don't make sense.\n\nIf you want history of all changes, without the hassle of CDC, flat files on a massive file share dedicated for this, you basically emulate a datalake. If this file share system is Linux, there's probably Datalake compatible open-source you can use so you can do SELECT directly on the CSV/Json/XML flat files, just like a real cloud datalake. But I haven't done it - I'm sure someone here has.\n\nIn any case, Google Big Query and even Azure Datalake are not expensive. Probably on-par with dedicated hardware costs internally adding a 4TB mirrored fileshare system, when costed and budgeted over 36 months.\n\nIt depends on CAPEX versus OPEX, your boss should know this.

Use pgvector to do vector inside Postgres.\n\nOr use ClickHouse instead which also fills those roles.

The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.\n\nA key thing to understand would be is\\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)\n\nThat means anything wrapped within is\\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.\n\nThis is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.\n\nYou can also flip that and use NOT is\\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.\n\nEDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.\n\nIf this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.\n\nOnce we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH.\n\n    {{\n        config(\n            materialized='incremental'\n        )\n    }}\n    \n    select\n        *,\n        my_slow_function(my_column)\n    \n    from {{ ref('app_data_events') }}\n    \n    {% if is_incremental() %}\n    \n      -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run\n      -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model)\n      -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records)\n    where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} )\n    \n    {% endif %}",

        "body": "There’s actually a few things to be concerned with. One issue is making sure you are dealing with the proper timestamp. A lot of the examples in this space gloss over this aspect. For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.\n\nAnother concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`\n\nAnd this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.\n\nIf you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.\n\nI would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.\n\nIt’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",

        "body": "Depends on what you mean.\n\nIf you're joining/unioning/selecting from other up stream incremental models, you don't really need to think about how they are materialized. At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.\n\nIf you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.\n\nIn this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.\n\nOn every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.\n\nSo we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join.\n\n    {{\n        config(\n            materialized='incremental'\n        )\n    }}\n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }}\n    \n    \n    {% if is_incremental() %}\n    \n        where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} )\n    \n    \n    {% endif %}\n    \n    \n    {% if not is_incremental() %}\n    \n        union \n    \n        select\n            customer_id,\n            period,\n            total_sales\n        from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }}\n    \n    \n    {% endif %}\n\nThis means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table):\n\n    -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN \n    \n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system\n    \n    \n    \n        union \n    \n    \n        select\n            customer_id,\n            period,\n            total_sales\n        from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system\n    \n    \n    -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN\n    \n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system\n    \n    \n    where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",

        "body": "Last paragraph imo is the big one. I have hardly met any coworkers that understand the problems that come with incrementals involving multiple tables. This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.\n\nFor me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.\n\nThe example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. \"Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day.\" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",

If you have bespoke code, maybe look at a load framework like DLT. Is the framework any better, or do you like having more control over the process?\n\nSave your raw data to a more modern file format with proper data types (e.g. Parquet, AVRO) - do you need to do any transformation on the source data to make it fit? Are there any unexpected issues with the data that you have to handle?\n\nLoad your data into a local database, either directly from source or from your raw files. Then you can start running proper SQL queries against your data and get some practice with querying databases in general. DuckDB comes to mind, it's powerful and lightweight with good support across many languages.\n\nDo some transformations on the data - consider cleansing data quality issues, perhaps normalising the structure, or transforming it into a better shape for Data Science modelling. You could do this with some bespoke code, or look into transformation tools like dbt or SQLMesh.\n\nBuild some visualisations of the data to build more of a story around the data than just raw values.\n\nIn each case, try out multiple tools. If you're using Pandas, consider trying Polars or Ibis, or leveraging DuckDB's APIs. What do you like about each one? What do you dislike? Even if you're achieving the same goals with each, its good to get a feel for the differences in each tool and form your own opinion.",

        "body": "This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully you find this useful. There's actually a lot to your question.\n\nWhen it comes to designing a mart, I keep the \"analyst\" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.\n\nRegarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the \"analyst\" persona querynig the star:\n\n1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability\n2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example\n3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usability\n\nThe ideal query would look something like this:\n\n    SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name\n    FROM fct_sales AS f\n    INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d\n    ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk\n    GROUP BY d.customer_name\n\nThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.\n\nIn order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for \"unknown\", \"missing\" or \"not applicable\" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. \n\nFor item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.\n\nIf your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone:\n\n    SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name  \n    FROM fct_sales AS f  \n    INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d  \n    ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk\n    AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts\n    GROUP BY d.customer_name  \n\nUsability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.\n\nTo achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.\n\nAt this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.\n\nTL;DR integer lookups",

You can do this today by validating instances against v1 and v2 schemas at the same time. If ypou work with Python, there are two simple command line tools for validation that are part of the \"json-structure\" package: \n\n    # Validate a schema file\n    json-structure-check schema.json\n    \n    # Validate an instance against a schema\n    json-structure-validate instance.json schema.json\n\nFrom a lifecycle perspective, you use schemas either where you produce data to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules AND/OR at the consumer end to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules. In code and databases, that structure manifests in column declarations or typed fields, and having a neutral data definition language that comes with \"polyglot\" tooling and know many languages and database table schema dialects is therefore helpful for data structures and data to not get lost in translation.\n\nI have very successfully used the specs as instruction files with LLMs (e.g. Copilot) so when you want to infer a schema from existing data structures with the spec in the context, you often get very good results, and from there you are on a type safe path. I wrote teh spec such that teh LLMs would be doing good with it, for instance, by having examples for all constructs.",

We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first..  the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. \n2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.\n3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path. \n\nIf you tried doing this in prod: how are you handling this tradeoff? Do you allow wide read access and rely on RLS/RBAC + logging, or do you gate it behind a semantic model / query planner / allowlists?",

What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers. It's still in the data warehouse environment but the agents can only access those curated views. What I found with this though was that I couldn't answer questions on the level of what you are describing very well, which is why I think if it's ever gonna work a much more flexible approach is needed.",

It also supports traceability by capturing how data is extracted, which can complement your audit logs and validation steps.\n\nIf you’re exploring faster ways to scale across formats while preserving accuracy, I’d love to share how a highlight, and, label workflow could reduce rework and keep your pipeline maintainable.

Maintaining data integrity and reliability at scale across platforms can be a very tough challenge, especially with any reasonable volume. All that to say: you're right that it's a real and difficult problem to solve.\n\nI'm biased (I'm one of the founders of Prequel, where we do something similar to what you're talking about), but hopefully I can also be pretty helpful on the topic -- let me know if there are any questions I can help with.\n\nAlso, the Pontoon team put together a helpful feature comparison matrix among the players in the market (though they recently discontinued work on the project): [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms)",

For the love of God don’t event try to build your own DQ framework, so many teams make this mistake. Instead use some of the already available open-source solutions, some of them are very very good. \n\nTesting is also very important part of pipelines, which are unfortunately neglected by most of the DE teams. It will make sure that your commit editing “pipeline A”, won’t alter the logic of “pipeline B”. \nEnd-to-end Testing is the best thing you can do for your Data Architecture. Create a small sample input dataset, dozen of rows usually is enough. Create expected output dataset. Run pipeline on using sample input as source and compare your actual output with expected output. Do it on every merge to main branch. Very simple, straightforward but gives you a lot of confidence in you data pipelines. It requires some simple CI/CD pipeline and probably separate env to run the tests but data quality always comes with a price, like all good things in this life :)",

Now that all Snowpipe/Snowpipe streaming is a fixed price (0.0037 Credits per GB), it should be easier to see what your costs will be regardless of the number of files. Generally Snowpipe will be cheaper, but your time is worth something too. As you mention, Snowpipe can support schema evolution with ENABLE\\_SCHEMA\\_EVOLUTION = TRUE. But if you need more granular control, I could see scenarios where you might want to do it your way.

Then build additional steps that extract the data from BigQuery and do more complex transformations on it.\n\nIf you don't care about access to the raw data, just do all your transformation steps between the json ingestion and Bigquery.\n\nAlso, if you just want to cache your json, you don't necessarily have to convert it into a BQ table. You can just store the json in an unstructured data format in something like an AWS S3 Bucket or GCS before you begin processing the JSON into a dataframe for BQ.\n\nAlso, if you're already working with pandas, I would recommend looking into polars. It's like pandas, but newer and faster (built on rust) and it comes with some features that make validation and type casting a bit more intuitive.\n\nLast thing, depending on your usecase, casting everything to a string has pros and cons. You might end up losing data as a result. For example, if you have a datetime column that you cast into a string and back, you lose any non-represented data like timezone that you can't get back anymore.

For pipelines like this that have been stable for decades, the biggest risk is changing logic that no one fully remembers the edge cases for.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work better in similar situations is a phased approach. Keep the Pro C transformations intact initially by containerizing or running them in a controlled environment, then focus on validating inputs and outputs aggressively. Once you have parity and confidence in the data, you can start peeling off pieces of the transformation logic incrementally instead of all at once.\n\nModernizing is valuable, but preserving correctness first usually buys you time and reduces risk, especially when the business depends on this pipeline behaving exactly the same way it has for years.",

        "body": "All excellent questions.\n\n1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).\n\n2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. \n\n3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. \n\n4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. \n\nOne issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",

We even help write test cases for them in some cases. We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.\n\nThis has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.\n\nFor the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. \n\nWays we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etc\n\nThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.\n\nDefinitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. \n\nStarting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.\n\nHaving had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.\n\nHaving typed structure really has been the biggest help. Working with developers, have a well defined data type not only helps data products but also helps developers to work with. This means everyone is all largely speaking the same “language” and centralizes the source of truth like what a data vcs brings",

They help to simplify the design of asynchronous systems where you send a lot of time waiting on network traffic, disk reads, or user input.  Async does not run anything in parallel, and you will not see any performance improvements from in; in fact, overuse of async methods in tight loops can significantly harm performance due to the added overhead of the event queue.\n\nPart of why async design is popular in Python and JavaScript is because threads really suck in those languages.  The existence of the global interpreter lock in Python <3.14 severely limits how well threads can perform, and worker threads are a huge pain to manage in JavaScript.  There's much less incentive to use async in languages where threads are efficient and the language has good thread management mechanisms.",

Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.\n\nSo we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!\n\nHowever, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.\n\nSo we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like:\n\n    function foo() {\n      Promise.all([\n        getUserDropdownData(),\n        getCityDropdownData(),\n        getStateDropdownData(),\n        getDepartmentDropdownData(),\n        getSomeOtherData()\n      ])\n      .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded\n        const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values;\n        buildUserDataDropdown(userData);\n        buildCityDataDropdown(cityData);\n        buildStateDataDropdown(stateData);\n        buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData);\n        buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData);\n      })\n      .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns\n        refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately\n      })\n    }\n    /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */\n\nYou would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \\~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \\~220ms instead of \\~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.\n\nWe also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.\n\nAnd that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",

Multithreading can.\n\n> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?\n\nAsync is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.\n\n> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?\n\nIt's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.\n\n> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoid\n\nI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.\n\nBecause async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.\n\nThere's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",

        "body": "SQL injection happens when you are able to identify that the receiving application does not sanitize the user input or limit permissions levels before passing it to the database (application is what authenticates to the database, not the end user). Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.\n\nAn example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like\n\n`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`\n\nthen accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in \"John@Doe.com\" as the username and \"RubberDucky\" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database\n\n`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`\n\nfair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of \"Admin';--\"? The application would pass the following \n\n`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`\n\nThe database will return the first user that has the username of \"Admin\" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, \";\" would terminate the SQL command, and \"--\" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors.  \n  \nthat is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it \"secure\" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like \"UPDATE\", \"DELETE\", \"\\*\", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen  people do it in HEX\n\n  \nOnce you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do. Here is how you might be able to get the server credentials from a SQL injection \n\n[https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478](https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478)",

The front end then sends the name to the back end to retrieve the stats.\n\nLet's say the backend does an SQL query on the database like \"SELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = '$name'\".\n\nNormally this works great.  But what if I type the following:\n\nRobert'; DROP TABLE Students;\n\nNow the SQL query on the backend looks like this:\n\nSELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;\n\nWhen that is executed, it will search for Robert in the database, and then it will wipe all the data out.\n\nOf course you can do more advanced things other than deleting stuff in the database.  You can add other queries to try to extract more information than the website would otherwise allow.  You can probe the database for other tables, like maybe asking if there is a list of credit card numbers.  You can get really fancy like querying to see if any columns start with the letter \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" and so on, and if you do enough of those queries you can reconstruct the schema for the database and discover all sorts of interesting things.\n\nI wrote a simple website one that had a shell injection vulnerability.  It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did!  Using a similar attack against my website, someone could have executed arbitrary shell script code on the backend as the www user.  I learned the value of always aggressively sanitizing my inputs.",

If the backend also only uses interfaces to other system, then it's no an sql based attack. However, if the other system is vulnerable then maybe the injection happens there. And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it. You can make it so that certain commands are not allowed, like dropping tables, but modifying data and reading data your are not supposed to might still be possible. \n\n>how are they able to get data returned from a database with their query if they are not an authenticated user to the database\n\nThe application is authenticated. \n\n>and how would they even know what to inject into the SQL database to get what they want\n\nThey often don't. But they can guess. Often there's a table called \"users\" or \"user\" and it has columns, such as \"name\", \"email\", \"password\" etc. That's why it's hacking. They just \"hack\" until it works. \n\n> this is purely educational because I honestly don't understand it?\n\nThere are many books about this. You really have to see how 90ies PHP websites were made to understand how insecure it all was.   \n  \nNote that it's only possible in very old libraries that let you just create strings containing sql queries that you then execute. Wo now use templates and make sure that user input is checked and always passed as a certain type (string, number, date etc). You can't just pass \"1' AND 1;  --\" and have it be inserted into \"select \\* from users where username = '%s' password = '%s'\". And we salt and has the passwords, if there even are any. But some people are idiots and think it's ok to use 20 year old libraries and not do anything for security. Then it's easy. Others use modern frameworks and even they can have vulnerabilities. But it's not as easy as it was back then.",

You’re also gonna have to go through code review, which can be both good (for learning) and bad (for actually getting your work accepted).\n- Your PRs are more likely to get shot down because your code doesn’t meet the project’s standards.\n- Established communities can be harder to break into. Gaining people’s appreciation and respect will take lots of time and work.\n\nI can’t say what’s best for you, but I gained a lot out of contributing to larger projects as a beginner. The key is to make small contributions and not rock the boat. Godot Engine was a great project for me because I am also a user of it, and it’s super modular so you can change parts of an individual subsystem without breaking anything else.

These types of softwares are often subscription-based, so it might run up your bill...\n\nYou could get him one of these softwares if he asks, but maybe that's something for another time!\n\n\\---\n\nMe, personally, I would get him a nice book. You could use one of my suggestions, or something else. A raspberry pi is also a nice option. \n\nMake a nice gift basket, get him some nice books, put in some plushies if you want. Place in some gift cards to his favorite mobile / console games. Maybe some new clothes. Books + fun stuff, it would make a perfect gift. :) Merry Christmas, thanks for helping your son's learning.",

It’s easier if I don’t commit to actually _doing_ the work, but I just set it up so doing the work will be easy. Once I have my workstation set up I’ll try to just read the code and understand what’s going on.

A few things that genuinely helped me:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Pomodoro technique but modified for ADHD:\\*\\* Standard 25/5 never worked for me. I do 15 minutes of focused work, then 3 minutes of literally whatever my brain wants (scroll Reddit, watch a YouTube short, whatever). The key is setting a timer for BOTH. Your brain learns it can have the dopamine hit soon, so it's easier to focus. Gradually increase the work interval as you build the habit.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Treat debugging like a video game:\\*\\* ADHD brains love puzzles and immediate feedback. When you hit a bug, frame it as \"I'm going to figure this out\" rather than \"ugh this is broken.\" Keep a running log of what you've tried - it helps when you inevitably get distracted and come back.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use the hyperfocus strategically:\\*\\* When you feel yourself getting pulled into something, lean into it if it's productive. I've had some of my best learning sessions at 2 AM because my brain decided \"today we're learning async/await.\" Just make sure you're not hyperfocusing on tutorial hell.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Accountability buddies:\\*\\* Find a study Discord or a friend who's also learning. Just having someone to check in with like \"hey I'm going to work on this for the next hour\" makes a huge difference.\n\n\n\nAlso about the medication - might be worth trying different options if Adderall isn't working? Some people do better with Vyvanse or Concerta. But I'm not a doctor, just someone who's been there.\n\n\n\nYou got this!

Or if i'm learning c, I have a custom keyboard that utilizes c to program it. Or if I'm learning LUA, i like video games, there are games that uses lua to extend the games functionality. Or if i'm learning javascript, I could use javascript to customize how my normally visited pages look to show only the things I'm interested in. Or if you're learning css/html. I could customize how firefox works and looks. Or if you're learning batch or powershell, you can program automation into your computer usage workflow to make normal routines more convenient.\n\nIt's all about seeing the payoff of what you're learning, when you are able to apply it, and see your work in action, it keeps you interested. Interested enough to explore it even further. Then eventually it starts to get boring again and you switch to another language to learn. FML",

Things move quickly and change all the time. CS fundamentals apply to most coding frameworks, you can do the same thing in most coding languages.\n\nIn a nutshell, get the CS fundamentals locked down, and you are able to adapt to different things, which is great for ADHD as we get bored easily and want to move on to different things or multitask.\n\nUse AI to help motivate you (when stuck) and to start and finish tasks. My best use case for AI is really summarising my work to pick up next time, and stick to a plan. \n\nADHD is a superpower for development! hyperfocus is real. If struggling with distraction or ‘tutorial hell’, build something basic from scratch that you want and you’ll be more interested. \nDiscipline is hard with ADHD, i’d advise while getting started to work on ‘fun’ projects that you enjoy doing.\n\nMost importantly, please don’t be hard on yourself.\nLet yourself have a break if you want, treat yourself after something hard. You have got this! Keep being you and following your passions.\n\nNo one is perfect and if it helps I still struggle with distractions too.

A queue behaves in a circular way because that’s what we need to do, on the machine level there is no circular behaviour, like i sais, data is just stacked like books on a table.\n\nTo understand how do we create such behaviours out of memory slots and most importantly why, you need a low enough language to see what’s going under the hood, otherwise it will look like magic. \n\nSo i recommend trying to implement them in C going from integers to graphs and trees. Moving to a high level language like python will be a piece of cake and you will be better than most who started there. \n\nI recommend the book Algorithmes in C, it is quite extensive, so don’t read in bulk and if you really need to know how the machine works, start with Introduction to computing systems, it is written by the creator of the LC-3, for educational purposes. \n\nGood luck to you.",

Expand the algorithms to count and display iterations, and keep track of both time and space - make sure you \"experience\" the complexity, don't just try to remember definitions.\n\nIf you need additional explanations for certain subjects, look for free videos or articles, look for university courses (MIT has exceptional free course materials available online), or ask an AI - they are good at explaining this stuff, and only rarely get it wrong!\n\nYou'll be better at truly understanding DSA than anyone following any of these paid courses!",

It can be done in Python, but typically, Python offers \"too much\" and makes it too easy, not really giving a solid view of what goes into DSA, in my opinion.)\n\nIf I were you, I'd audit a course on DSA if you feel that it would strengthen your knowledge of the subject instead of enrolling in it. Auditing is a great way to review or to learn new concepts without the pressure of assignments and exams with deadlines.\n\nI'm surprised you took a course on web programming: it's a landscape that changes so fast that by the time you've started the course, what you're learning is probably already obsolete. the others sound pretty standard for a CS curriculum, but not learning advanced algorithms or the theory of computability (unless you covered that in discrete math, which seems unlikely) seems like glaring omissions.\n\nAnother option would be to pick up a book on DSA and work through it at your own pace... that undirected learning style doesn't work for everyone, though, so pick what works best for you, but yes, a solid foundation in DSA is very important to have: knowing what data structures and algorithms to pick and why is something that I would consider essential.",

Remember that most programming languages do only one thing at a time, and even fairly simple tasks like asking the user to enter a number, and printing it back, requires a lot of individual steps.\n\nThe program you have written performs these steps:\n\n1. Print a message to the user, asking to \"Input a number: \"\n2. Reads a number entered by the user\n3. Prints a new message to the user, saying \"Your number: \" followed by the number the user entered\n\nThen there's a lot of additional \"invisible\" steps, like storing the number in a variable - creating a \"Scanner\" that is apparently some tool to get input from the user, and also a lot about importing that and creating a class and some magic incantation \"public static void main\" that probably doesn't make any sense.\n\nBut keep the main focus on the steps you want the program to execute, and gradually understand how to write them, and what extra \"invisible steps\" you need to add!\n\nAnd when in doubt about something particular - ask about that particular thing.",

It takes more time to write *and* to read while adding no useful information.\n* It introduces a maintenance burden, as changes to functionality must be mirrored in comments.\n* It tends to introduce confusion and even bugs, because sooner or later someone *will* update code without remembering to mirror the changes in comments, and then someone *will* wrongly assume that the comment is correct.\n\nTherefore, you should never say anything in a comment if it is adequately clear from a symbol’s *name* (e.g. function or variable name), or from its type. (Of course, when generating documentation or tool hints, it may make sense to include a brief summary even if it’s strictly redundant, e.g. the description of the `dirname` parameter above is fine; but I’d remove the bit about being a `char**`). If you can rename a variable and thereby make a comment redundant, you should rename the variable and delete the comment—self-documenting code is best!\n\nWhat’s most important to include in comments is whatever is *least* obvious from reading the code.

Since you like web development and you know basic Java you have all the makings of a full stack developer.\n\nBy building projects to learn how to develop software the concepts you learn in school will make more sense how it applies. School does not really teach you how to develop software directly so you are going to have to learn this on your own in addition to what they teach in school.\n\nStart small and keep simple and add one small thing at a time. Work from frontend to backend to database for every feature you add. Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn when you need to learn it.\n\nThis might sound crazy to some, but the often dismissed TODO application is very well suited for teaching comprehensive full stack development. You just have to take it that far.\n\nHere is an example roadmap that could keep you busy for a while.\n\nStart small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.\n\nMake TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.\n\nNow for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.\n\nDo this with every small project you work on. A calculator, an address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Some people have learned the \"single return\" style and stick with that.\n\nOthers prefer the \"return early to handle error conditions\" style, which has its advantages.\n\nMost people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two \"not nice\" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.\n\nIn your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an \"error case\", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the \"if\" branch and the other within the \"else\" branch) would make the \\*intent\\* slightly clearer.\n\nNow, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of \"error condition\" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so \"idiomatically\" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.\n\nOnce the \"error returns\" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is \"correct\" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",

What happens if an email address doesn't match the \"`isValidEmailAddress`\" check?\n\nIt's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this:\n\n    // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred\n    String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) {\n      if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) {\n        return \"Alex\";\n      }\n      if (username == \"\") {\n        return \"Sam\";\n      }\n      if (username.contains(\".\")) {\n        return username.split(\".\")[0];\n      }\n      if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) {\n        return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0];\n      }\n      return username;\n    }\n\nIn the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting \"weird\" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",

E.g.:\n\n    def fizzbuzz(number: int) -> str:  \n        result = \"\"  \n        if number % 3 == 0:  \n            result += \"Fizz\"  \n        if number % 5 == 0:  \n            result += \"Buzz\"  \n        if result == \"\":  \n            result = str(number)  \n      \n        return result   \n\nIn this example you could return the final value both in the second and third if-statement, but if you change the function and a third condition like \n\n```\nif number % 7 == 0:\n    result += \"Razz\"\n```\n\nthen you would have to also change the statement in the Buzz-branch even though your change had nothing to do with the Buzz part of the logic.",

If you have to allocate some hash memory at the beginning of the function, or open a file handle, or whatever, you want to be damn sure that you close that handle or free up the memory before leaving the function again. \n\nFor that reason, we'll have one return at the end of the function, and use a temporary variable to store the return value. \n\nYou don't need to have a crazy nested if-else structure for this. Just set the temporary return variable to some value (like null) when you create it. As soon as you hit a return situation, set the variable to some non-null value. Then you can run through the rest of the function with a simple \"if (!rv) ...\" check.",

I'm actually struggling to remember the last time I used else. I generally write functions that do prerequisite checks with early returns, then proceed to the body of useful work if all is ok, finally clean up and return. It avoids nesting, which I dislike for reasons that are debatable. E.g.\n\n    int do_something(int p1, int p2)\n    {\n      if (p1 < 1) return ERR_FOO;\n      if (p2 > MAX_P2) return ERR_BAR;\n    \n      // Do something useful.\n      \n      return 0;\n    }\n\nIn general, less code isn't better just because there's less. It's better when that also means it's easier to digest quickly, reason about, make changes to, etc. I would argue that code written as above is generally all of those things, compared to code that flips the condition and/or uses (nested) else blocks.",

Sometimes they even make more objects.\n\nThen there are four \"pillars\": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.\n2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a \"subclass\" of another (\"superclass\"), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. \n3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. \n4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same \"subclass\" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.\n\nThat's it, that's OOP! Now practice those ideas with C++ since you know the basics of it already. It's very conducive to object-oriented programming - in fact, in college, my advanced OOP class was all C++. If you want examples, just ask, I can help.",

And once you get the hang of the frontend, the kiosk itself, you can get started on the backend, which could be anything, but is probably some REST API running on either Java or C# - but that is purely guesswork!",

Use a nice IDE (IntelliJ) that makes it easy to refactor and move things around when you realize you don’t like how you organized it (I have been doing this the past few days).\n\nAs for when to break up functions: as much as you can.

But I can try my best to make it so that at each intersection (at each function), it is obvious which way to go. I can make it so that they do not need to spend time looking around, exploring, reasoning, guessing, and backtracking. A good function is understandable immediately, either:\n\n- accomplishing something simple in relatively few lines of code\n- or listing a series of other functions (each doing a simple thing in relatively few lines of code) like a recipe in relatively few lines of code.\n\nThere are no points for being clever or obscuring what your code is doing. Boring, obvious code is good code.\n\nThere are certainly times where it makes sense/is easier to just have a big long method.\n\nBut I have found no predictor for how many bugs a function will produce more accurate than its length.

(j/k, nobody ever asks this question)\n\nWhich we can imagine introduces these acceptance criteria:\n\n* An endpoint in the fulfillment API that can be queried by customer ID and returns a list of all that customer's order IDs and item IDs, names, and quantities\n* Access is restricted to members of the BLACKMAILBOT9000 user group, which already exists\n* Automatic tests demonstrate blackmail emails sent to a dummy address (TBD:  replace the hard-coded address of `dipshitjr@hhs.gov`)\n* Don't bother documenting it; no human will ever need to know about this endpoint\n* Allocate another data center to the agentic AI project\n* Stop asking questions about where these stories are coming from\n\nUnfortunately, it is typical for people to use terms that have real value to describe just making-shit-up-as-they-go, and to think that they can replace teaching people with giving them a coding ass-istant.  The only way I've found to deal with that sort of thing is to make the shitty stories everyone's problem by using the meetings to discuss them to force the PM to do the work they were supposed to do on their own time.  This is not an approach for the faint of heart.\n\nTo summarize the summary of the summary:  What you're experiencing is shitty, but also unfortunately typical.\n\n\\*:  Redundant:  all AI agents are rogue by definition.",

Ditch the game-dev courses.\n\nBack in the day, there were two schools that offered a game-dev degree; they were DigiPen, and Full Sail. Both these schools are accredited, both these schools are collaborations WITH THE GAME INDUSTRY. The CEOs of both EA-US and Sony-US sat on the direction board of Full Sail.\n\nAround 2006, we were at the height of Sallie Mae robbing the American public blind, and ALL the universities got in on it. They fed peoples delusions of grandeur back to them, and offered game-dev degrees of their own. I sat on a couple review boards myself, and I'd name and shame if I wasn't going to get sued to oblivion if I did... They're robbing people blind. These programs are designed without any industry input or representation whatsoever.\n\nAnd by 2010, the game studios had fully reacted. These days, they don't want to HEAR \"game dev\" degree, because they know you won't know comp-sci to save your life, and you won't know game dev, either. There's still a certain respect for the two schools mentioned, but for the most part, they want a traditional comp-sci degree.\n\nIn the mid 20-teens, the Department of Education started cracking down - tying federal grant money and subsidies to both graduation rates and placement success. Ineffective programs became dangerous to schools and they had to start putting up or shutting up.\n\nWell, I can promise you MOST of the schools slip through the cracks, and this current administration has declared war on education and dissolved the DoE. So I don't know WHAT you're learning over there...\n\nAnd if you're outside the US, I'd trust your game-dev education even less. If the program isn't perfectly cohesive, that's a really, really bad sign.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but at the very least, it's not too late to turn your future prospects around. Get in on math classes, as much as you can from here on out.\n\nAs for how your interview is going to go when you present yourself to a game studio - it's going to be almost exclusively math oriented. They're going to drill you on linear algebra, calculus, and physics at the very least. Some of it will be comp-sci oriented about algorithms, some of it will be physics, some of it will be rendering, some of it is used in game dev but you'll have never seen before because they just want to see how well you adapt to new maths - that you haven't just memorized everything. They're going to grill you over this. As for any programming part of the interview, mostly they just want to know that you know enough syntax to be dangerous: reverse a string, write a linked list.\n\nHell, you don't need C++ specifically in your education. Java is almost indiscernible from C#, which itself is used heavily in game dev, and they all share common syntax and idioms. You can pick up enough C++ on your own to get by.\n\nThe studio can teach you good programming on the job, they can't teach you math and how to think.",

Since I’m not super experienced but im not a complete beginner it’s a weird space where beginner c++ tutorials spend more time covering fundamentals than syntax and I have a hard time getting through them (granted that’s from the few I’ve seen before making this post) but I’m not advanced enough where general picking up a new language advice is applicable because it’s generally assumed that I’m further along than I am if that makes sense? \n\nEdit: example: Sorting algorithms are still a fresh concept, we’ve gone over things like Huffman trees and hash maps within the last couple of months, so while it’s not new, I’m not sure I’m confident enough to just start experimenting with it in another language since it’s only recently been taught to us how different ways of integrating it work in Java syntax wise (ex generics and wildcards)",

        "body": "The core idea of OOP is to associate data with behaviour. E.g. instead of having a `sort()` function that sorts a list of data based on an algorithm, your data has it's own `sort()` method, so it kind of sorts itself instead of getting sorted.\n\nOn first glance this sounds very powerful, because a list of strings may be sorted differently than a list of numbers or a list of pointers. What OOP allows you is to have a list of any type, just call `.sort()` on it and the correct sorting method will be used automagically.\n\nThis idea was then further applied to other things like a Date. Instead of using a library of functions and a collection of structs that the functions work on, you now get an object and have all functions directly associated with that object, so instead of writing `dateutils.to_string(date: Date, ...)` you now have `Date.to_string(...)`. \n\nIn the early days of OOP this was used for code reuse through inheritance. Inheritance just means, that you define a new class and tell the computer that this class should have all the features of that parent class plus the new stuff you define and except the stuff you redefine in the new class.\n\nHowever, it turned out that Inheritance doesn't work well for code reuse, so nobody sane recommends it any more for that. It also turned out that it's more common to have different behaviour than different kind of data, so people started using \"Composition\" instead. Composition just means that your objects has other objects that are used to perform different kind of behaviour. \n\nFor Example, you may have a class `Animal` and the animal is supposed to have different behaviour like walk, run, speak, eat. Instead of using Inheritance to create new subclasses of `Animal` and implement different behaviour, you define small interfaces `IRunner`, `IWalker`, `ISpeaker`, `IEater` (or similar) and write small classes for each interface. There might be a `Bark` and a `Meow` class implementing \"ISpeaker` and there may be \"BipedRunner\" and \"QuadrupedRunner\" implementing \"IRunner\" and so on. You then create different animals using the Animal-Constructor:\n\n```py\ncat =   Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Meow(), CarnivoreEater())\ndog =   Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Bark(), CarnivoreEater())\nhorse = Animal(QuadrupedRunner(), QuadrupedWalker(), Whinny(), HerbivoreEater())\n\ncat.speak()   # \"meow!\"\ndog.speak()   # \"wruff!\"\nhorse.speak() # \"neigh!\"\n\n```\n\nThis is what \"Composition over Inheritance\" refers to. So we're almost back to having functions applied to data, but instead we call a method of an object that then looks up another object and calls one of that object's methods (for each individual method call).\n\nA big downside of OOP is that contrary to its promise it makes code harder to maintain, because you create a compile time hierarchy that matches your domain model and with that you create boundaries around things (objects) instead of creating boundaries around properties (e.g. positions, prices, ... ). \n\nMaybe that helps a bit.",

Don't be afraid to refer back to those tutorials.  With respect to googling, IMHO, trying to code without an internet connection is madness.  I myself often google the basics when I haven't used them in a while or to confirm I am remembering things correctly.  If you switch languages a lot, you might start using the wrong syntax and I have to check that from time to time.\n\nWhen watching tutorials, hopefully you're coding along with them and then trying to do something a bit different which isn't in the tutorial and adapting what you learned to your problem.  One little project that I would do using different web technologies was a little contact manager.  That's not a typical tutorial example, but it's not much more complicated than a lot of them.  \n\nPerhaps you could go into a little more detail about what you're trying to do.  Going into specifics might help you learn something or at least how to find the answer.",

For example \"ZOO-123: Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" This ties that commit with Jira ticket ZOO-123 that either is about changes to RabbitMQ messaging or about fixing an issue with said messaging.\n\nAlso, some companies use conventional commits. It is just a way of formatting your commit message so that automated tools can process commits in an easier way. Read about it from [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) An example would be \"fix(ZOO-123): Fix to RabbitMQ binder names.\" There the fix() keyword shows that the commit was for fixing something. A feat() keyword can be for adding a new feature or for working with some new functionality. For example \"feat(SCHOOL-23): Add Japanese language.\"\n\nThe commit message itself is often in imperative present tense. For example \"Fix to\" instead of \"Fixed\". The commit should give a summary of the change. What was done. Keep it concise and clear. Do not add a whole essay. But also do not just write \"Added more changes.\" Which changes? Why? Read about it from [https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3](https://blog.devgenius.io/make-a-meaningful-git-commit-message-with-semantic-commit-message-b39a79b13aa3) \n\nAvoid frustration and all kind of nonsense in the commits. Yes, when the stuff does not work and your earlier commit did not fix it then writing \"Get working already!!!!!\" or \"wgo8g7tfwo82w37fdto238gd\" is not a rational way how to deal with the issue. It is unprofessional. In the previous company I worked at, we had one guy who raged in his commit messages.\n\nAvoid adding too many details. Instead of writing \"Fix to UserNotificationIntegrationTest, BillingIntegrationTest, BaseIntegrationTest, RabbitMQPublisherIntegrationTest\" better pick \"Fix to integration tests\". Which tests, that can be seen from the git commit itself. Neither go with \"Added an email support to UserNotificationService by introducing emailSender() method that uses angus-mail library\" just write \"Add support to send user notifications via email\" Some good and bad examples are in [https://chris.beams.io/git-commit](https://chris.beams.io/git-commit) \n\nAlso, it does not really help when you finish your whole project and then add it via a single commit that has a commit message of \"Initial commit\".",

Languages like Python are 'higher level', meaning more of the low level detail is 'abstracted away' from the programmer. This comes with tradeoffs, for example: Not having to directly manage memory when using python means the programmer is *not able* to directly manage memory even if they wanted to. This makes Python more suitable to use cases like Data Analytics, where readability and development speed matter more than minute performance optimisations, whereas a language like C is more suited to applications which require a level of control over hardware resources, like Operating System or Embedded Systems applications where you need to use resources as efficiently as possible.",

If necessary then lower your work load while doing your studies. It won't be easy. I did my studies while working part time. And I had no free time of my own. \n\nJust learning multiple coding languages will not merit you. Software development is not a Pokemon catching. No point to learn a new language when you can't make anything meaningful with it. Also, no point to learn a new language when that language is not in demand where you are living (forget remote jobs as a beginner).\n\nGo for a degree, concentrate on gaining knowledge and putting it into a practical use.

And then not just learning a new language for the sake of learning it, but learning it to solve some real world problem with it, by building an actually useful project (no calculator apps.

You shouldn't even be considering library's like numpy until you have a good grasp of computer science and programming.\n\nIf you want to learn Computer Science and really understand programming you need to engage in the equivalent of a 4 year CS program.    If you are going to DIY this find a program online that starts out with C/C++ and learn how software actually works.  You need to stay with one of those C languages until you have successfully built and UNDERSTAND, at least a couple of data structures.   A good program at this point exposes you to other languages.\n\nFor now stay away from AI and Python.   They will both become extremely important in your future but first you have a lot to learn.",

Do a short “warm up season” instead. Spend a week or two skimming your old notes and redoing one or two small projects you finished before. Do not aim to understand every lecture again, just get your fingers used to typing code and shipping something that runs.\n\nThen go back to where you fell off in TOP, but lower the bar. It is fine if you do not feel smart with data structures on the first pass. Write tiny examples, look up the same concept from two or three sources, and move on once you can explain it out loud in simple language.\n\nThe real unlock is consistency.

I'm more privy to JS so I'll focus on that. Dont let \"web based\" fool you, you can run everything locally too, but it'll do wonders for compatibility and simplicity \n\nYou can use JS and a browser for the entire gui, and JS again in the back end using NODE. You can use something like Electron for cross platform compatibility, and you can save your offline data as cookies or in the cache. Once you get back to data service, the data can sync, and then it'll be available on a server for all your devices. \n\nFor the quiz you can use something like socket.io for bidirectional communication between the server and the device\n\nYou have a lot of requirements here, and it would be prudent to be able to code everything in the same language (JS) I would start by learning basic browser JS since you have a foundation in html and css, then move on to your first server using express and node, and then learn how to utilize external packages like socket.io, then finally how to package them into standalone apps using electron. You may find that you need other things along the way like a database, but thats just another external package and another set of docs. \n\nYou can do all of this in python too it'll just be 50% more difficult than js, but python has better support for complex data and more and different external packages. I dont see any reason to recommend it for someone starting out, and you can always learn another language later \n\nYou're much better off getting good at a single thing than trying to code a bunch of things in different languages",

If you have 6 words in an array, and you want to insert a new word, you move over the words enough spaces to insert the new word in the target spot. What I'm struggling with is understanding the formula for it? There's this formula (0+1+2+⋯+n-1)/n=(n-1)/2 or this formula for array deletion: (n–1)/2 ≈ n/2. I don't know where these are coming from or how these are connected or how I'm supposed to use them. And there's this: Maximum number of comparisons = ⌊log\\_2⁡n ⌋+1 for binary search algorithm. \n\nYeah you're right, I'm not very fluent with programming either. All of this is pretty new to me but it's my second year and I'm falling behind but I'm still trying to catch up and learn. I have an assignment due in a week, and the semester just started so I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I've been relearning python since a few days ago but it will take a while to master it.",

You would find it on your 4th iteration and return true.\n\nLet's say you wanted to do binary search instead \n\nSo first step, you cut the array in half. N / 2 = 2.5, so we just pick index 2.\n\nThere's a 3 there, which isn't what we want. So we compare if it's higher or lower than 4.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 4, and we know the array is sorted, then we know that 4 is in the right half of the array\n\n[4 5]. Now, N = 2\n\nSo you cut the array in half again. N/2 = 1, and at index 1, there's the number 5. It's higher than 4, so we have to cut in half again\n\n[4]\n\nNow there's only one element, and it's the number we want, so we return true.\n\nYou will see that we had to cut the array in half only 3 times before we found it.\n\nBinary search has complexity O(log N) because the number of times we need to iterate with respect to the magnitude of the input (in this case, the number of elements in the array) is log (base 2) of N \n\nThe things that are important when it comes to big O runtime complexity is to\n\n1. Identify how you're measuring the input\n2. Draw out each step of the algorithm\n3. Determine the amount of steps you would have in the worst case.\n\nFor linear search, the worst case is having to check every element. So given N elements, you perform N iterations.\n\nIn the case of binary search, since you're cutting the number of elements to search in half every iteration, you only need search log(base 2) N times, plus the one if there are odd number of elements.",

From my experience and talking to professionals  degrees like cybersecurity, information systems, and data science (do a stats major instead) are not as good.\n\nAs for knowing what you want to specialize in I don't think there are any shortcuts besides trying stuff and seeing if you like it. Either take a class or build a project and see if it's cool. You can also research online about the different cs disciplines. If you decide on embedded systems I think computer or elctrical engineering is a better major, but it prob depends on the school.\n\nRegarding how economically cooked the different cs subdisciplines are, they honestly aren't that cooked. What's (or rather who) is cooked is the person who graduates, has no extracurricular experience, and is only interested in the doing bare minimum to get money.\n\nThe truth is that cs isn't an easy path to 6 figures. You either need to genuinely like it or be very disciplined because the degree is only like 30-40% of the puzzle. Join tech clubs, do competitive programming/leetcode, build stuff, and give it your all! It's such a cool subject that touches all the sciences, math, and unifies it under this neat idea of very clearly describing a process.\n\nPS: Maybe it's just personal bias but it seems that web dev is the most vulnerable to AI. There's hella ai tools like replit and loveable that can already handle most basic-intermediate apps. Also if you want to be immune to ai get a job writing like cobol for a bank or visual basic for some unc company.\n\n\n\nNow specifically regarding some stuff you asked: \n\nYou should stay general until you know what you like, at least until like you finish your first year or two of uni. You'll have enough time to skill up specifically for your interest. Focus on fundamentals and you'll be flexible enough to pivot. Also, even if you end up going into like embedded, building a website will still make you a better and more well rounded programmer.",

AI is the latest hot thing today, but who knows what will be the next thing a year or two from now?

Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.\n\nLet the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.\n\nAs you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \\`ngrok\\` to  temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \\`ngrok\\` and your computer are running).\n\nNow that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.\n\nCloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.\n\nWhatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing. Take TODO and add subscriptions/payments, member management, calendar schedules, email/sms reminders, single-sign on, SaaS deployment (cloud), whatever else you can think of. If you just do frontend, touch every angle of it in your projects.\n\nThis is a possible roadmap for you that will keep you busy and hopefully motivated for a while. Once you can do this, you can pretty much build anything.\n\nStart small and keep adding small things to it.\n\nI hope this helps.",

        "body": "Picture yourself in the early 1980s. There is no internet. There barely are any knowledgeable people in your area. Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.\n\nAll you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.\n\nHow do you learn?\n\nThrough experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try  more and eventually succeed.\n\nYou won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.\n\nOnce you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.\n\nThe notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because \"why should we when everything is readily available?\". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)\n\nDiscipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.\n\nThe thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).\n\nOnce you understand how to \"think like a programmer\" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.\n\nMaybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015. Another recommendable site is [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here, you get challenges and have \"hints\" and guidance.\n\nAs usual with such posts (of which there are more than plenty), some Literature (aka *books*):\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nTo address your \"all coders do is just copy-paste\" statement: yes, we do copy paste, but not because we *could not do the job*, it's because of time constraints, trusted and tested solutions. Contrary to a beginner/learner, we can assess what a solution copied from the internet does, how it fits into our codebase, what side effects it has, etc. We could come up with our own solutions, but that would be less efficient in a professional setting than to resort to tested and trusted solutions.",

Here you mostly care about the oldest and newest object, and whenever an object dies, you have a mutation. Any new object simply gets added to the end.\n\nBut even here, just a few necessary searches will kill any performance advantage you got, so you'd need to be very sure that your performance optimization holds, and will hold for a long time. And if you ever need to change something, you'll quickly have to swap out the linked list with a more powerful data structure anyway.\n\nSo even if you ever find a place where a linked list fits, you most likely will instead choose a tree, skip list or the like instead.",

If everything is in the same branch, the tests for the code are _with_ the code they're testing.\n\nAs for the directory they should be in, it may depend on the framework you're using. For example, Angular has a directory per component, etc, and you'll have a test file for each component in each directory.

Additionally, C# and TS are designed by the same engineer, so there's a lot of crossover and cross-compatibility there too. Additionally, I actually focused on C# for my degree, so just like you, I'm sort of bouncing between the three.\n\nC# and Go apps are extremely difficult to host/deploy for free. There are a few options, but they're extremely limited. However, when it comes to the TS/JS ecosystem, you can deploy like 300 applications without ever spending a dollar (not full production applications, but prototypes, portfolio projects, etc.). So that alone keeps me in TS/Bun/serverless-land for the most part.\n\nThe only fix I can really think of, is finding a stack you love. For example, I've become extremely fond of building apps/sites with Bun + SvelteKit  + Drizzle + Turso (usually with serverless functions, rather than using Bun as a dedicated backend). It's such a powerful stack, with such good developer experience, that I gravitate towards it almost always. The C#/.NET eco system doesn't feel as good to me, and so I end up using it more for portfolio projects (or just to show that I can). I save any real work in C#/.NET for jobs that require it.\n\nGo, on the other hand, is more of a separate entity. Sometimes when I'm building web apps in Tauri (using the same stack I mentioned above), I'll use Go to write more complicated or faster services. So, it's still there as a tool, but I'm not like using weird Go metaframeworks (or anything like HUGO) to build the actual sites.",

It becomes substantially less satisfying to work on.\n\nBut wait...you know what WOWULD be satisfying? Learning a completely new programming language or platform!\n\nThere are a lot of questions on here where people say \"hey, I'm about 2 months into learning to program, and I think I'm going to switch languages, is that a smart move?\" Sometimes, sure, maybe it is, if you've identified a specific job you want and that job requires a specific programming language.

Think of it as your Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the bare necessities to demonstrate what the product can do.\n\nOnce you have the backbone of your MVP, clean it up, optimize it, make it user friendly, make both the code and interface easy to follow.\n\nAfter it is looking clean, start to add features. Test each new feature extensively. Try not to move on until you have the new feature working as intended. Don't get bogged down with too many abstractions too early. You can always refactor the code later on",

A past professor of mine said that you need to know what your end goal is before you start coding and then slapped us all with a homework assignment as an \"example\". The goal? Find the shortest path from point A to B on a map. How? in his own words \"you should know the algorithm, i taught them to you. If not, review the class notes and lecture slides, find online resources, etc\"\n\nGuess what i'm trying to say is: decide what you specifically want to do first and work your way towards that, learning the necessary resources along the way if need be",

As for OS fundamentals, do you think *Operating System Concepts (Dinosaur Book)* is too complicated to start off? Everyone raves about as THE textbook - but if I'm not building my OS, would this still be an appropriate start? What do you think about \"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces\" by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau (it also costs a fraction of the price of the dinosaur book), and seems to be a gentler introduction.  \n  \n2. I have learned basic Java through online tutorials with OOP principles yet I've read online that the books have a trove of information more than online tutorials. Would you still recommend I first read Core Java I and II / Core Java for the Impatient by Horstmann before moving on to Effective Java by Bloch?",

These are the enrollment statistics for universities in Ontario, which is the province where I'm from: [Statistics | Ontario Universities' Application Centre](https://www.ouac.on.ca/statistics/). If you look at the statistics by program group tab and you filter for 2024 in one box and 2025 in the other, you can see that there has been a noticeable drop off equal to approximately a 25% reduction not just in applications, but also in acceptances/confirmations for CS programs. Although these are only statistics for Ontario, I have no reason to believe that the same would not be happening elsewhere; I doubt there's anything special about these statistics compared to any others. And clearly, this shows that the cat is out of the bag regarding how CS is a more competitive field than it used to be, so there's no reason to suggest that enrollment won't keep decreasing for the foreseeable future.",

You're probably fine, just keep at it",

There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated. This is often why people brain freeze in interviews.\n\nDo mock interviews alongside your self-study to identify your weaknesses, and ideally start them early so you have more time to fix issues.   \n  \n  \nHere are two relevant resources: one on [getting truly interview ready](https://www.coditioning.com/blog/11/complete-tech-interview-prep-roadmap), another on [key interviewing skills](https://youtu.be/V2czxOT_hwU).

Bad engineers write bad software because fundamentally they can't diagnose the problems users are having that they are hired to fix as a software developer.\n\nHow do you get there?

        "body": "What i tell Jrs (im a mid-level right now) is something i had to learn the hard way: \n\n\\- Being a good SWE it's important to understand the code but at a certain point (years down the line) you wont be coding as much so really learn how to do the boring stuff in SWE that most people dont love. \n\n\\- Get good at documentation. Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things. Even a simple \"how to run this test\" can go a long way and is proof of what you did. \n\n\\- When you finsih something, give yourself credit and post it somewehre or mention it in standup. This is somethign many of us struggle with, giving ourselves credit. To get promoted you want the higher ups to know what you did and how you participated in that. \n\n\\- Take 10 minutes after standup to present anything or even show a doc. Again, you want to be recognizable. You want your boss to say \"OP had a good presentation post-standup that was really interesting\". \n\n\\- It's better to do 5 tasks and shwo your work than it is to do 10 tasks and keep quiet. This was my biggest issue. Id do tasks but never really wanted the praise or to present it so i kept quiet. My coworkers thought i wasnt doing much and in review seasons i didnt have much coworkers to sing my praises. \n\n\\- Dont be a passive engineer. A lot of engineers are good but are very passive. In stand up they dont really say they are stuck, they only say \"i continued working on X and investgiaging a small issue\". Nothing else. Nobody is going to help if you dont say \"im stuck\" and trust me engineers get more mad if you spend a week stuck on the same issue then if on day 1 you say \"im stuck\". Time is money. Reach out to coworkers and talk to them about issues. That conversation could lead you to getting close with a higher up engineer. If you as a junior can get a principal engineer to back you up, that goes a far way.",

From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. \n\nOne of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. \n\nThe other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. \n\nThe thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me. I’ve learned so much from starting my position that I don’t think I would be anywhere near where I am in knowledge and experience without either of them.",

        "body": "Idk, I never struggled to find a job either… until this year. Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. \n\nI think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.\n\n1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. \n\n2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.\n\n3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.\n\n\nIt’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.\n\nI’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review. I’d be so excited to just get the feedback ‘Yo, you didn’t do a good job solving this LC problem. Or your architecture skills and thought process isn’t what we are looking for’. But it’s just like… no one even gives you a chance to interview if you don’t BS your resume with AI. Then those are the pool of people you can hire, and the quality of the hiring goes down.",

Location is a major factor.\n\nIn markets like New York or Silicon Valley, you have people who have sacrificed years of their lives to prep for demanding positions, so every role that gets posted has a ton of competition. When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.\n\nI've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \\~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.\n\nWe get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy. (clear rate for a fully passing solution is probably about 5% of all candidates that reach that stage).\n\nI really think unemployed engineers who are having trouble securing an offer for months have the wrong strategy. They should be taking up these 'easy' low paying jobs, moving temporarily, and then continuing to interview for their hotshot Big Tech and Silicon Valley roles. A six figure salary in a medium cost of living area is better than sitting around all day waiting for the next OA.",

The quality of peers has declined. Interview intensity has gone way up. There is the expectation now that ai just makes it all happen magically and that we will be eliminated soon anyways. Dollar is worth less. \n\nThere was a time you could be good at one part of the stack and be paid well. Now the expectation is your good at fe, be, observability, continuous integration, testing, deployment, wireframes, reqs & documentation, etc. It used to be if the codebase was a mess or you weren’t familiar with some framework they would cut you slack of train you but less so now. It used to be a few devs in a room working through stuff. Now everyone’s remote on different continents crammed into tiny noisy apartments. You’re still supposed to manage to mentor them.  Usually most of the team has already been outsourced so they really don’t have the same skin in the game and your heads on the chopping block. The interview used to focus on your degree, likability, location, and experience.  It went from white boarding to take home test and live coding exams to leet code with ai graders kidding your voice and eye movements. Not to mention how everything’s flooded now so getting noticed / not getting duped leading up to the interview view is harder. The expectation of 2x ai productivity doesn’t account for the quality of the ai, existing code, or clarity of instructions. Then there is pay. It’s held strong in a way and even grown faster than other industries but the dollar is worth under 1/3 as much as ten years ago in terms of shelter, transportation, healthcare, and food. Then there’s the increase in domestic cs degrees coming online and the over hiring in the covid market rally which went to layoffs then to ai hiring. \n\nI’ve had 6 jobs in ten years and everyone has laid us off or been bought out. Some were productive, some kept the companies software alive, others had no idea what they wanted. Can definitely make you tired. But that’s why it’s a job, right? Made some money. Am I a fool for thinking I would still be hustling 25 years from now or not gambling my cash into the stonks? Probably… \n\nOut of work and just been studying for a few months.

Talking to people at the company, that isn’t true and we anll make about the same, adjusting for stock growth (that’s how bands work, yay!). Are people adjusting yearly, are they doing it later with stock inflation (we are in an insane bull market for tech)? Do people just straight up make up salaries on there? \n\nPeople I know are getting worse offers than 2020-2022 era, especially adjusted for inflation. The people I know making bank got an offer then, stayed through it and their company is like up 2x so they are making historic money. They will cliff in 2025-2026 and go back to normal salaries for their role (still FANG).  So you could have someone claiming 350k for an E5 or 600k, when new offers are more like 325k. \n\nI think the industry is obviously down. Layoffs and wage stagnation are very real.  The only people who leveled up this year are AI scientists.",

The thing ai is best at is implementing things like functions with very strict input and output, and creating tests... which has literally never been the engineering bottleneck in my experience. The real work of an engineer is turning customer feedback or PO requests into a cohesive system that will solve a need. Even before ai, most of my coworkers didn't struggle with function implementation, some were even better than me at it... the thing they mostly struggle with is architecture and ownership, and ai appears to be *hurting* this more than it's helping.\n\n\nSo yeah, I feel pretty gaslit as well.",

Personally most of my usage is related to semantic search, calendar/task management, word smithing/generating/finding docs, and the occasional script. I did use it to help generate a fairly complex tool recently in Rust. But I also generated unit tests that tested 100% block coverage and I manually reviewed every line. This helped me learn quite a bit about Rust and I fixed many bugs generated along the way some of them subtle misinterpretation of the requirements. The quality got better as my prompts got better but you have to review everything. Still there is no way I would have been able to write the code from scratch as fast as I was able to with copilot. \n\nThe engineers in my group mostly embrace it as a tool in their toolbox and have similar complaints/praise.  Those that dont, are missing out on a valuable resource. Is it going to wholesale replace developers in its current state? Hell no, but if used correctly for the right things it can be a big time saver. \n\nAnd that is the rub. I had a very high level engineer in my group working on a project that required the intel performance tracing stuff. He started using Ai tools to grok the bazillion pages of docs but it missed some very key points that were sometimes contradictory and generated a lot of code with very subtle, very difficult to debug issues. And every time the model told him everything was good. He'd debug and find horrendous issues, tell the model and it would be like \"oh yes, you are right\". Eventually he scrapped the whole thing and just did everything by hand. The model was just confidently incorrect too much in that domain to be of use.

Well, it's partly luck. Be very aware of little problems you have or others have and constantly ask, is there a digital solution for this problem?\n\nConstantly being aware and asking that question is part of it. The other part is throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks. You can be surprised what winds up working versus what you thought would work and was a great idea. What you are trying to do is find the outlier event in a large distribution - and that requires many, many trials until you hit it.\n\nYou'll never know if you don't test many innumerable ideas out in reality. The trick is to run these tests (as many as possible) without bankrupting your self and keeping the overhead low. One good principle to hold to is: \"what I think will work is irrelevant, what works is the only relevant thing\" - in other words, be REACTIVE and not PRO-ACTIVE. See if something might work - test it like a scientist with a hypothesis and then act based on objective observation. Good luck (you and the rest of us are going to need it...).\n\nAnd just accept that if you want a shot at success - you will have to endure many, many, endless trials that result in failure - until you hit the one that does not (hopefully).",

I get hundreds of applications a day, and only an incredibly small percentage of those candidates are even possibly qualified. For the ones that look possibly like a fit, some things I look at to decide to screen:\n\n- Do the high level bits even KIND OF match? E.g. maybe the job description says 6+ YOE but candidate has 4 YOE and has a Senior SWE title already, or it says looking for embedded C but candidate has several years of embedded Rust experience and has C listed at least somewhere.\n\n- If they wrote a cover letter, do they actually understand the kind of role they're applying to? If it's generic or looks like AI slop that's an anti-signal.\n\n- Does the resume indicate a clear understanding of WHY the info they list is important or worth mentioning? I do not want a laundry list of every task a candidate has ever done, I want the highlights that indicate skillsets and ability.\n\n- Have they articulated previously done work that's similar to what we're looking for, or are they just regurgitating a tech stack? For strong candidates I don't care if they have exact tech stack matches, but sometimes more junior or otherwise weaker-signal candidates will get to a screen for having rare tech stack matches.\n\n- Do I recognize their university, prior companies, or anything else on their resume (e.g. notable open source contributions, math or programming competitions, publications at relevant venues)?\n\nAnd frankly at the end of the day I am wildly overloaded and am one person making a quick judgement. I also put significantly more weight on candidates that have been referred to me somehow or who have a shared connection. I fully acknowledge that this is not a meritocratic system, but it's the reality. Known entities or folks from known circles are significantly less risky hires.",

        "body": "First off, 300 is a massive underestimate of how many applications we get. At my last job I was involved in hiring, and we would always get at least 1,000 applications in the first 24 hours after posting, usually we'd end up with 3-5k. We started with a code screen, basically a couple LC easy questions, that usually got us down to a few hundred. Then we'd divvy up the resumes and mark them as reject or pass. It was a quick glance maybe 5 seconds each resume to see if they had the basic qualifications, the vast majority of those failed. Then we'd be down to \\~20-50 people and we'd have our HR do a phone screen, basically ask about their basic qualifications, make sure they're interested in the job at the salary range we're offering and the tech stack they'd be working on. We rarely rejected anyone in this round but many took themselves out of the running so typically we'd be down to 10-20 at that point. Then we'd have the hiring manager have a phone screen with them. If they made it to this point they had something on their resume we liked, so we'd typically ask them about it and really drill down and ask for excruciating detail to make sure they actually did it. Spoiler alert, most people are exaggerating and/or lying about their specific contribution to a project on their resume, and it's super easy to weed out. That got us down to \\~5 which we would invite to interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we selected to interview them, I would then read a cover letter if they sent one, although I think a lot of other folks didn't even read them then. This is also the point I would look at their github if they had one on their resume or anything else they included as side projects. I think I was one of the few people involved in hiring who did any of that most would just look at the resume 10 minutes before the interview. Then the interview was with a few folks, we had one do a tech screen where we give them a sample problem and watch them code, change requirements and see how they adapt. One does a culture fit interview where they ask questions related to soft skills, how do you handle conflict, those types of questions. One is a business round where our product person asks them some questions related to our business and some basic logic questions to see if they can reason through product requirement type things. Then everyone meets and ranks the candidates, we come up with a consensus order, and send the offer out to the first one, if they decline send the offer to the second one, etc. It's also possible at that point that some people just get a fail so even if they're the highest rated candidate we'd rather restart the process than hire them, although that's rare most people who've made it to this stage are at least getting hired if they're the best candidate interviewing for that role who accept because as you can see it's a long and painful process and we'd rather not start over.",

In what world, and from which perspective, is that even remotely close to ideal?\n\nSkills and execution. It doesn't fucking matter if you like doing it or not, so long as you actually do it, and do and do it well.\n\nI'll happily admit there is some correlation between the quality of your output and how much joy your work brings you, but it's not 1:1.\n\n>but I heard already from some managers that they completely don't look at cover letters due to lack of time, CV is more optimized. Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.\n\nIf you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.\n\nDo you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words \"for your kind consideration\"? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?\n\nWhy on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?\n\nFor what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.\n\nBut I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.\n\nAnd your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.\n\nAnd if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.\n\nAnd then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.\n\nBelieve me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",

Works okay but you still need the raw material of what you actually did.\n\n  2. Extracting achievements from git history - Some tools now analyze your commits and PRs to surface what you shipped. Helpful for people who forget to track their work throughout the year.\n\n  3. Manager-side summarization - Some companies are experimenting with AI to help managers synthesize feedback from multiple sources.\n\nThe biggest shift I've noticed isn't AI doing the reviews—it's AI making it harder to hide behind vague statements. When you can generate specific examples easily, \"improved system performance\" without details looks lazier than it used to.",

The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.\n\nThis framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.\n\nIf the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.\n\n**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.\n\nThat’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.\n\nThis gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.\n\nIf your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management. That’s unfortunate, but it is a separate problem from how you should handle the situation with your coworker.",

Stanford probably has better instruction and network but much more expensive. Gtech has more breath is cheap but classes are consuming to graduate and network is similar to Penn so not a factor. after factoring time to graduation, cost is pretty much the same as Penn.

The network DOES matter, but it takes a lot more effort to integrate yourself when you're an online student. If you do an OMSCS but don't integrate and network or leverage what you learn to do projects you can show prospective employers, then it won't matter where you study.",

You're under new management, so there's no point being a nail that sticks out while they're looking to get things settled in.\n\n\nBut it's also a pretty strong warning to freshen up your CV or resume and start applying to other places. Early January is usually an awesome time to be jobseeking, so see if you get any bites. It's also still early enough that you can continue seeking with your current title -- you already have history and experience working at that level, and performed well enough that you were hired or promoted into it. So your resume will still largely reflect your assigned duties and experience for 3-6 months.\n\n\nSomething else to consider is that your manager is giving you an option here, which is *super* unusual. That sounds like they want to keep you, but budgets may be too squeezed right now for your current paygrade. As far as I'm aware, it's unusual for a manager to give this option instead of just issuing a termination. It might be that the department's budget can fit you, at least for the upcoming few quarters, if they demote and reduce your salary. Obviously your call on whether you want to voluntarily earn less to stay with them, but you do say you're not being set up for success here.\n\n\nWhere I live, unless it's an especially toxic workplace or you get a reasonable severance package, it's better to jobseek and make them lay you off (rather than quitting). If you quit, you lose access to some unemployment benefits.",

It sounds like a couple smaller businesses and proprietorships I've seen around here. But you're saying it's a *median software* company. The only ones I'm aware of that meet that kind of description (near me) would be Revature and other WITCH companies. They keep devs benched on small projects, and try to get you placed with a client so they earn a cut of your salary and you get experience. Sometimes they'll exaggerate your skills to get a bigger salary cut.\n\n\nAre you working on a greenfield project that the company doesn't really need, but feels is a worthwhile gamble? Are you an intern or in training right now? Those are the contexts where I could understand assigning a solo dev at a company.

Either tech is a secondary focus, or you're isolated from the tech center of your company. I worked at a tech consulting company/digital agency, and they had someone on staff who helped the accounting team. After that person resigned, the company would ask random people for help on things. He didn't use version control.\n\nThis isn't normal, but I don't think it's completely unique, as you hear stories about people who have this experience. In the old days, teams were responsible for their own IT and work, and you'd have teams spring up like this all across departments, until they brought in someone to organize everything. I should probably say \"if\" rather than \"until.\" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. \n\nIs there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? \n\nI also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example. The tech leads did everything, and the people on the management side didn't do much work outside of call names during daily standups. They certainly didn't understand any of the work from a business perspective. There are all levels of bad companies out there.",

First thought, the directors that are still there in the program are generally really good as far as being kind/good humans go. Second though, its a great program for starting your career. You'll grow a really large network of other early stage engineers really quickly and when everyone inevitably scatters within 3-5 years you'll have that network at a lot of other tech companies as a result.\n\nI will say, the work is a mixed bag. For one of my rotations I was a data analyst and it was the most boring thing on earth (old school SAP WEBI work). For the other I was building ML models in Azure which was a lot better (I stuck with that rotation post tdp). I think the biggest downside is that the pay stagnates super hard post TDP if you dont end up in a good title. Some of my friends came out as senior software engineers around 140k, others (like me) came out with much less glamorous titles doing roughly the same work at 110k. Pay disparity was just a function of what business unit you ended up in and what titles that business unit would allow. I left after 4 years for a sizeable pay increase, but ATT TDP definitely allowed me to grow some good leadership skills while I was there and the friends I made in that program are still in my social circles today",

I don’t know what your projects are but simple capstone and full stack node projects probably just aren’t going to cut it, as literally every new grads has those and they pale in comparison to real dev experience. I think my best advice would be to A) start contributing to open source or start a serious side project to get something eye popping on your resume or B) look for a adjacent job like IT, get your foot in with the company and try to transfer to being a dev eventually.  Obviously you could continue cold applying (it’s pretty much what I did lol) but it feels a lot like finding a needle in a haystack and ur new grad status is probably running out.",

        "body": "4 interviews for thousands of applications is really bad. Did you actually do technical interviews, or was it just an initial call with a recruiter, because I would not consider that a real interview. Real interview is the 2nd or 3rd interview where they actually grill you on technical stuff. So if you aren't even getting that far...\n\nYour capstone from school should not be a listed project unless it was high quality. That's kind of a joke and if you're listing that on your resume I could see employers tossing your resume then and there.\n\nYour projects need to be professional level. What exactly are your projects built in? How are they deployed? Do they integrate testing, CI/CD, and more advanced cloud microservices than just something like vercel, github pages, or ec2/s3? Do they use cloud orchestration in any way or IAC?\n\nI'd recommend getting your AWS Developer Associate cert. I went from zero interviews to weekly interviews once I got that.\n\nIf you aren't getting interviews though, it's because your resume is weak. How do you list your skills? What skills are listed? Are you tailoring each resume to each application? Stop applying and build up your resume.\n\nReaching out to alumni is a waste imo. You should network locally, which will take at least 6 months imo to build up. But once you start seeing familiar faces, people start recommending you, you recommend people to those hiring (ie if you're a full stack guy, work with a UI/UX guy and help them get a job, they help you).\n\nSounds like your projects and resume are weak, so you aren't even getting interviews. Once you start landing interviews, that's a whole other thing you gotta hone in, being able to explain things, understand things conceptually, know when to use what vs another... So you know, I'd expect another 3-6 months minimum of study on top of that once you start getting interview experience.\n\nTry to find an unpaid internship is also my advice.",

The only reason it was tolerable for so long is that the job was far easier than what you are describing. I was able to make up for the shitty starting salary (btw this was over a decade ago so you're much more severely underpaid) with one good career move down the line, but the lack of mentorship during that early stage of my career stagnated my growth in a way that it is much harder to make up for. I learned more in my first year working on a proper dev team than I did at that entire job. For that reason primarily, I would recommend you get out of this job ASAP. The risk of stagnation in an environment like that is very very high.",

But I encourage you to apply for a relevant diploma or degree if you'd like better job security. Many government employers, companies with long-term contracts, and tech companies can afford to be selective. A related degree gives you more options, more offers, and helps keep you off the chopping block when a company needs easy staff to lay off. Since you've got a degree and some CS courses, you can potentially ladder that into a major and/or get transfer credits.\n\n\nAll that said, what's your non-STEM degree? A handful of them can be leveraged for specific positions in the industry, and any bachelors' does allow you to apply for more international working visas.",

The thinking goes: if I can’t get a job as a SWE, I’ll just *drop down* a rung or two and get one of those jobs. \n\nWhile there is very significant skill overlap between various positions in software engineering and IT, it’s not really a hierarchy. There are people just like you who have trained and educated themselves for those jobs, and they’re struggling just as hard as you are because hiring in all tech jobs sucks equally right now. If you “drop down” to one of those jobs, you’re just another applicant, but you don’t necessarily even have the same qualifications as those other applicants. (I hear your question about getting some of those qualifications). \n\nLong story short, in my opinion, there’s no reason to believe that switching focus to IT jobs will lead to more job opportunities than in the field you have been preparing for in college.",

The market for new grads has just been brutal, especially if you didn’t get a return offer lined up before graduating.\n\nGoing into IT is a totally reasonable move if you treat it as a bridge, not a dead end. GeekSquad + Network+ + cloud certs can absolutely move you toward DevOps or SRE if you keep one foot in software. Plenty of people have gone IT → sysadmin → DevOps once they could show scripting, automation, and cloud work.\n\nThe key is to not stop building or talking like an engineer. Keep shipping small projects, automate stuff at work if you can, write scripts, mess with CI/CD, cloud deployments, monitoring. That’s what makes the transition believable later. If you fully pivot away from coding for a few years, it’s harder to come back.\n\nAlso, you’re doing a lot right already. Hackathons, freelance, startup, networking, referrals, interviews. The lack of offers isn’t because you’re weak, it’s just timing and competition. IT can give you income, experience, and momentum while the market recovers.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned is that interviews reward people who can clearly explain what they’ve built and why. During interviews I’ve used StealthCoder to keep my thoughts structured on screen so I don’t undersell myself or blank, especially when my path isn’t “traditional.” That helps when you’re coming from IT or mixed backgrounds.\n\nShort answer: yes, IT can be a smart move if you’re intentional about it. Just don’t mentally give up on engineering if that’s what you actually want.",

My opinion.\n\nAt the beginning of your career, you're pretty much like every other CS grad, a big lump of clay that they have to teach and mold.  You might get a few more $$$ due to the higher education, but not enough to offset the extra 2 years and expense of getting the MS over the Bachelor's.\n\nAt the middle of your career, for dev jobs they're mainly interested in your tech experience and what you can do.  They don't want the lump of clay anymore, they want the refined tool for their tech stack or subject matter / industry.  So for basic dev jobs most would rather hire a person with the right experience than somebody who's never done the work they're doing but who has a Masters.  Which is when you try to get promoted.\n\nFor companies / leaders that are credential-focused, you'll be more of a promotion target.  With the MS-CS, that's team lead or architect.  With an MBA, that's management.  Whether or not you're deserving of those roles is another question, but for companies or leaders who focus on credentials, you'll move ahead of peers who lack them.  At the end of your career, that mid-career trajectory bears fruit.\n\nSo the question is, what path do you want?  If you don't know -- and it's OK that you don't know, job experience will help you figure this out -- then I'd skip the Masters for now.  Because you can always get it (or an MBA) later.\n\nIn \\~26 years in this industry, I've never seen a person with a Masters stand out so much that I wondered why and then discovered that they had a Masters.  That has happened for me with PhD's, that we give super interesting technical problems to and they come up with innovative solutions.  But I haven't seen that with just a MS-CS.",

Ideally go for either Statistics , or  Economics and you can still be considered for a Data Science job as those disciplines teach you solid quantitative skills. If you must go for specialized Masters program go for Data Science with several caveats to be aware of .\n\n\nIf you don’t hate traditional CS classes go for a CS Masters with a concentration in Data Science like George Tech which is highly respected and not overpriced .I know plenty of people with DS masters from Cash Grab Ivy League schools they ended up with spending over 100k for a generic data scientist job paying 140k .   There are also certain programs from certain colleges,  like Andy Bernard’s Alma mater that are just extremely overpriced O’Reilly courses .  \n\nYou could have gotten that 100k DS job if you went to George Tech’s online Masters. And keep in mind that entry level DS job exists only when the economy is good . \n\nAs someone who does work with LLM models and AI engineering , I personally would raise an eyebrow if I saw AI Masters on your resume . I wouldn’t throw away your resume but I would be asking you questions like explain the Transformer Architecture and the Self-Attention Mechanism.  A very basic question to testing if you understand the foundations behind LLM.  I don’t want a buzzword spokesperson ,we have MBAs for that .",

They made me waste a half day with an on-site as I interviewed with 3-4 different people, and the official reason for rejection is I didn't know Python. \n\nThey've decided what they'll use to evaluate people.

Don't be like me in high school. I had ideas that I didn't turn into actual things because I thought it \"was a waste of time\" and that it wouldn't impress recuriters and blah blah blah. Prob my biggest regret is not making the Minecraft mod I've thought of or that funny website.\n\nThe fact you already have some internship in high school will put you ahead of 99% of CS majors, let alone programming since u were a kid. I barely touched code outside of Scratch until I was 15 for god sake. You'll be fine. My recommendation is to reach out to people in different sectors of CS and ask them for a coffee chat, or go on something like Discord and talk with fellow people in the industry. Not only will you maybe learn more about different fields, but you'll be building your network, and I'ma be honest, the people you know will be the reason why you get the job most the time. It's how I got my internship and potentially my first full time position as an app dev.",

About a quarter of these professors are not at four year universities. \n\nSo essentially, we produce a new crop of professors every 13-14 years, meanwhile it’s common to see professors in their 70’s. Ergo, the odds are definitely not in one’s favor to become a tenure track professor. And those tenure track professors are coming from top universities. \n\nNow is being a PhD useless in industry? Hell no. But it’s also not going to turn you into an OP job candidate. Most jobs don’t require a PhD, therefore having a PhD doesn’t benefit you",

Fake check scam: https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_fake_check\n\n> The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.\n> \n> Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.\n> \n> When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html\n> \n> If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.",

I get a front row seat to listen for our customer's requirements while in meetings with our sales rep and the common question floats \"Do you sell AI in your product?\".\n\nPeople are hyped for AI, that includes our business customers, and its taking great effort for us to bake AI into our product and compete on time. We're being charged more than what a big company would be charged for using AI services because our projected volume of consuming AI tokens are much smaller than big companies. Big companies are winning the competition in many markets right now as they have more resources and investments to spend with getting their AI services into the market much sooner with more precision.\n\nWith that being said, we've buckled down and locked in the team with more hats to wear, haven't had a new hire in our department since the layoffs.\n\nwhen the AI hype is over, people and businesses will realize the valuable relationship and products that come from these small/medium businesses and come back. Once once they see gains in revenue, I believe they'll open up positions as they're confident they can support a bigger workforce once again.\n\nAnother opportunity for more positions to open up with small/medium businesses is tax breaks and or more affordable AI services these businesses can use for selling AI features in their products to compete in the competitive market.",
