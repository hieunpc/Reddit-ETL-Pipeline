Now most teams never think about cluster management.\n- Analytics engineering emerged as a discipline. Beauchemin predicted DEs would need more SQL, but underestimated how much the transformation layer would specialize (dbt, semantic layers, etc.)\n- The 'modern data stack' hype cycle. Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.\n\nWhat stayed the same (unfortunately):\n- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.\n- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.\n- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.\n\nWhat's genuinely better:\n- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.\n- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.\n- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.\n\nThe 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work. But the semantic layer and data modeling parts got more complex, not less. Different work, roughly same headcount.",

The data engineer gets the heat when the products of their automation designs don't meet expectations, and the QA inquiry too often reveals problems with the data itself, including missing values, data entry errors, mismatched or approximated semantics when bringing together variously sourced data, accuracy and precision problems, deliberate and accidental bias, agenda selectivity, etc.  AI is built on big data infrastructure, so its good that we have this professional layer to review our supply chains as we procede to the next generation of decision support.",

Have you considered having an “intermediate” type table materialization? We have several large models that have to be broken up into intermediate steps because they would either overload memory, or perform poorly due to CTE’s that are called multiple times, which we can instead just process them once in a separate model. What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes. I know you have ephemeral and view materializations, but none of those solve the problem of having too much stuff happening in the final query that uses them. Thanks again!",

Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.\n* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.\n* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.\n* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.\n* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.\n* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.\n\nThe common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. \n\nModeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",

Quicksight wasn't really considered as an option for either project - one was in the public sector and they put a lot of value on the governance baked into Looker, and the other was scared off of anything primarily UI driven and really valued the idea of BI as code.\n\nThe public sector project was pre-acquisition. I don't recall the costs from back then, but I'd bet that it was less of a factor than today.\n\nQuicksight is way less expensive, though I still doubt I'd choose it if I was the first data hire at a standup today.

I've handled ingestion, I've also had past lives in reporting, ETL/ELT and web dev, so I'm confident in my skills on any side they want to put me on. I don't really concern myself with title all that much, what I do care about is that the problem in front of me and ownership of responsibilities gets handed out cleanly.

Are you just writing one off queries on raw data to populate them? In my experience ad hoc reports are a symptom of a lack of good models (and pipelines that build those models) going into your BI tools. If that’s the case it’s a pretty easy sell to your line manager that building a proper pipeline would mean dashboards get built faster and have way more reusability.\n\nIf you’re the solo data engineer, then you’re the sole authority and the only one who can explain why it is a problem. Have you raised this with them? If you’re just complying with the requests of things they think they want to see, then they’re gunna be stuck in a loop of forcing through ad hoc things - because it’s all they know.\n\nYou mention being an excel support desk too - this definitely shouldn’t be happening - spreadsheets can be avoided in almost all cases these days (with some exceptions). I LOVE it when someone requests a spreadsheet because it’s an opportunity for me to ask them “out of curiosity” what are they doing with the spreadsheet - then you almost always get given an opportunity to solve a problem that they didn’t even know existed, this can make people very happy and that’s the most satisfying part of this job, I find.\n\nMaybe I’ve got the completely wrong take here but it sounds like the company hasn’t been exposed to a modern data stack before and are doing things the old way, if you’ve already shown them how it could be better (time optimisation, data reliability, and undiscovered insights being the selling points that execs hear) - then fair enough leave - if you haven’t you’re sitting on a golden opportunity, cause it sounds like you’re the only authority. Best wishes going forward - but this sounds like you’re not doing data engineering at all and would be a red flag to me if I were to interview you for an engineering role and you spoke about this sort of setup.",

        "body": "My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.\n\n—-\n\nSo back to my point: The majority of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” This doesn’t mean open source. If you pay attention to the current developments, it’s about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” to tools and formats that can talk to one another and in general, enable much more efficient data transfer. These two alone unlock many downstream applications!\n\nAs a small example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and proprietary file formats together. That’s where the lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format  (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.\n\nThe thing that’s really exciting and evolving is the maturation of standardized components of technological primitives that many modern tools use today. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), ABDC for super fast data transfer ,and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all are working towards the same future. They’re all open source, want to converge to open standards, and if used together, enable an “open data infrastructure”. Which means the engine you use for AI/ML, real-time applications, and BI can all be based on data that lives in one storage layer and yet, can be run in any compute engine. Developers can live in a world where you can work towards running local dev in DuckDB and prod workloads in Snowflake. Minimizing vendor lock-in to me is just the a small side-benefit.\n\nVendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of this new infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model for the technological benefits, but also allows them to compete with Snowflake/Databricks/etc at a completely different angle. If engines are swappable, these big platforms lose a lot of their architectural leverage. Now the power and thing to control is the stuff outside of that (I will let you think through that part as an exercise haha).  \n\nAll of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes “open data infra” is a buzz word and is marketing for sure, but if you follow the current state of technology, there’s real nuance here!",

My first programs were spamming scammers with scary pictures and tracking when WoW servers were up/down after reset day.  They didn't make money, but they taught me how to code independently (not rely on tutorials for inspiration), solve problems with code, and eventually make me love programming.  I went from not being able to parse strings to writing webscrapers.\n\n>More generally, how is the job market? Is Data Engineering still a sought-after profession?\n\nI feel like this has to be one of the most common questions for young people to ask, especially those in university/studying.\n\nNobody can predict the future.  Regardless of how the job market is now, all that matters is how the job market is when you are in the market for a job.  6 years ago, DE was something living in the shadow of DS.  Everybody wanted to be a DS and everybody ran towards being a DS.  12 months later, DE became the hottest job in the market.  A couple of years after that, the market temperature cooled.  Market could be absolutely amazing now and shit itself the day you graduate.\n\nLook at the jobs available in the area you want to work in and practice measuring the market temperature yourself.  It'll be worth the time.",

Things like group by with aggregations, joins across 2 to 3 tables, window functions for ranking or deduping, and basic subqueries. If you’ve internalized those shapes, most questions are just variations.\n\nAlso practice explaining your thinking out loud while you write. Even if the query isn’t perfect, interviewers often care more about how you reason about edge cases and data shape. If you blank, start by restating the tables and columns you have, then sketch the result you want. That usually gets your brain moving again.",

Cool guy!\n\nIt tries to improve on multiple fronts ,mostly user experience (e.g. hyperlinks to problematic files, init command, pretty output , some SE better practices and of course leverage Rust speed and binary size), which are explained here: [here](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/faq/), in the 'How does dbtective compare to similar projects' dropdown. One of the improvements I wanted required a completely different architecture and [Rust traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) were the perfect candidate.\n\nThe simplest explanation of this architectural change is by example, comparing dbt-bouncers [`CheckModelDescriptionPopulated`](https://godatadriven.github.io/dbt-bouncer/stable/checks/manifest/check_models/#manifest.check_models.CheckModelDescriptionPopulated)  rule (which only applies to models) with dbtective's \\`[has\\_description](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules/description/)\\`  rule, which can apply to all eligible dbt objects, for example  \\`sources\\`, \\`seeds\\`.  \\`macros\\` or anything that can be described (in the \\`applies\\_to\\` setting). So in \\`dbtective's\\` case, one rule can be used to expect descriptions on multiple objects, leaving less work for the user.\n\nWith this in mind we can set defaults that make sense (e.g. it makes sense to describe a lot of things so the default \\`applies\\_to\\` setting contains literally all objects that can have a description field for the has\\_description rule), but we can also easily remove or add objects if the project requires it, using the applies\\_to configuration.\n\nThese defaults I would like to eventually leave to the community or be fixed by asked the right questions in the init command. For now I've set them to what makes sense to me (this is also much of the reason to stay on v0)!\n\nHope that clears things up!",

But essentially an API request contains the details needed to start the long running operation, and the API returns a job number. The user then polls a 'job status' endpoint with that job number. Generally most providers I've seen use a signed url to a CSV as the response so that their API isn't locked up during sending the body back if it's hundred of megabytes. \n\nJaniF suggestion works well, if you need to write your own sensor for more complicated handling it's super straightforward.",

The benefit of supporting VARIANT becomes quite small. You might get some additional storage savings because JSONB is per-row, but that's pretty marginal saving that requires some benchmark to show the actual benefit of moving to VARIANT at this point.",

It wasn’t trivial - converting whatever the MS language was to SQL or Python wasn’t obvious. If your Synapse is on SQL I’m sure it would be easier but you’d probably have to try it to see. Databricks/Spark SQL is currently very capable - it took a while to get there, but most things you can do on other platforms are there now. You said you need good RBAC - Databricks uses standard sql permissions and now has very good fine grained permissions including constraints and expectations for data quality assurance. Pricing model seems clear to me - pay based on compute usage (kind of a big markup) and not really much else. I’ve been in the fed gov in Databricks for 5 years now on a large data warehouse and I still think it’s a good product.",

Turns out, PyFlink is quite limited, and does not really offer the power you would want from Flink.

I'd say without a doubt you made the right choice to focus on SWE over DS. The thing you actually get in DS is about Statistics-with-programming and how to properly employ research against data. All good things, not really what we're concerned about with DE. \n\n2. Since you're in SWE and looking at design patterns, keep in mind what it would be like if the only thing you had to care about was the data inside the objects. A lot of folks coming from a SWE background focus on the abstract object versus what is contained by the object. To move to DE you have to care a lot more about the latter. \n\n3. Things that will be evergreen in DE: python, SQL, databases, warehouses, data modelling (although the meaning of this varies person to person, company to company, much to my chagrin). Focus on these. Python at an expert level (focus on the data packages. Polars, Duckdb. And DB packages. Pscyopg, etc.), at least 1 RDBMS 1 NoSQL and 1 DB system you're just interested in, SQL to an expert level which will give you passable knowledge for most Warehouses as well. \n\n4. Tools that will be evergreen in DE: Airflow, Docker, GitHub, K8s. TOML/YAML as well. DBT is very good to know as well. \n\n5. And that the issue is that job descriptions are very heavily implying mastery while the actual job wants a jack of all trades. Get good at probing for this information in interviews with tech staff. Take advantage of mock interviews if you have the chance.",

Rudderstack have an open source offering that covers the ingestion and activation parts of their platform, so this may also be worth exploring to allow you to get hands on with at least part of a CDP.\n\nAlso, personally I find very few customers that actually need a CDP, or manage to implement one effectively. In a lot of cases, they'd get more mileage for significantly less investment by implementing a data activation or \"reverse ETL\" solution on top of their existing stack. The likes of Hightouch provide CDP features on top of your existing warehouse at a fraction of the cost.",

If you can talk through end-to-end flow (collect events, model it, define audiences, activate it, measure results), you’re in a good spot",

You'll want to pick up, and use regularly, systems like Docker and Kubernetes. Even for your own small data projects. This will introduce you into that world where those things are heavily used. These are also cloud-agnostic meaning no matter what service provider your future employer(s) use you'll be squared on this front. In the same vein are things like VPCs and general networking which I spend more time debugging than anything else in DE/DataOps. After that you can get into the specifics of particular platforms. \n\nAs far as practicing is concerned: Start with `docker`. Learn the ins and outs of taking arbitrary python code you have and stuffing it into a container. Learn how to find images, how Dockerfiles work, run into the issues so you can troubleshoot them. Then see what it takes to incorporate tools you may be using to develop your code into the dockerfiles. Things like `uv`. If you can have one system managing both your local dev and your container builds you have less points of failure to troubleshoot. \n\nThen grab `k3s` for local development. This is, notably, \"actual\" kubernetes. That is opposed to things like minikube which are \"kubernetes in docker\". Nothing wrong with that, but when we're talking about \"rapid\" prototyping, k3s is as close as it gets to just managing raw k8s on your local system. You'll probably immediately want to grab `helm` as well. Read up on `k8s`, `k3s`, `helm`, and `kubectl`. Play around with trying to get your docker containers that do things or expose things up onto k3s locally. See what it takes to setup `postgres` on kubernetes, and how to expose it so you can communicate with it externally.\n\nOutside of those things, which are more typical of `self host first` shops, you can likely find playgrounds around specific tech. I believe `databricks` recently opened up a playground of sorts. Snowflake may as well, but I don't honestly remember. Google on `GCP` used to give you like $300 in credits, plus they have the open BigQuery datasets you can mess around with. I think all of these things are secondary or tertiary things to focus on though, as they are mostly provisioned and managed for you from an infra standpoint. It's not bad to see what the platforms look like behind the scenes, though!\n\nI find Data infra specifically very interesting. It's got some nuance that can apply to standard web infra, but often times deviates from it. Which ends up as a nice challenge and break from the typical DE work for me!",

If you have some money to spend, some kind of graph database can be the easiest answer. You can even kind of simulate that functionality using old fashioned SQL, but it's a huge pain.\n\nIf, like most folks in our situation, you have no resources, no support, and no external understanding of the probelm, I've tackled it in Python. If your data isn't \"Big Data\" you can basically use Python to iterate over records like it's replaying an event stream. I basically have it scrutinize the identifiers on each event and ask \"Have I seen any of these identifiers in prior events I just processed? No, alright I'll give them a master, internal warehouse ID. Yes, I'll go back and find the master ID I gave some of them previously and assign it to this batch.\n\nI'm usually not a big fan of probablistic methods so I only count observations where there is some real identifier in common.",

When it comes to working vertically on bigquery I didn't adopt it for a few reasons:\n\n\\- It could correctly parse queries with clear syntax errors (e.g., this one: with cte as (select 1 as x) insert into foo select x from foo -- the cte must be within the insert) \n\n\\- It didn't support nested types nor multi-statement queries (haven't checked if they added support for them in the meantime!)\n\n\\- I wanted to be it as fast as possible (I use inbq during pre-commit and CI). Parsing alone is 17x faster (compared to the last release of sqlglot with the rust tokenizer) on my codebase (586 sqls, 102k LoC, 1020 schema objects with an average of 30 cols per table). I will try to add some benchmarks to the repository in the next days",

Networking tickets to try connect to the source system from AWS. Also networking tickets for AWS to connect to destination systems. \n2. Finding out where all the variables for informatica were stored on the on prem server.\n   1. I hated this part soooooo much. \n3. Understanding the complex logic of the informatica jobs since people who built them left and no one understood what they were doing. I exported the XML for the informatica jobs and used copilot to create sql queries to pull from source systems instead of manually doing this. \n\nI know this didn't really answer you question but I needed to vent as this was an exhausting project.\n\nFor tools. I wasn't expecting large loads(Under 20gb). So I used Docker, python, and duckdb. I created a custom image to use on lambda and I orchestrated with AWS step function or Airflow depending on the team. I used ECS if I expected loads to take longer than 15 minutes. \n\nWe might have had to keep the on prem server if we could not access the source from aws. So Docker, python, and duckdb would still have been used. Orchestration would have been some sort of cron schedule. \n\nHope this helps and sorry for the vent. ",

        "body": "Howdy. Twenty-five-year-professional, thirty-eight-year passionate programmer here. I think you're feeling the right feelings but you might lack context.\n\nI used an LLM this weekend to knock out some database code. We have models (sqlalchemy talking to a Posgresql database), ORMs, and then GraphQL interfaces to fetch that data. So I had a collection of A's and I needed new collections of B's and C's and the interfaces for them. I described the problem to Copilot, and it did the work for me by creating new files, each of which was a 90% rewrite of an existing file.\n\nYou see the problem already. \"Why do you have to rewrite 90% of a file to do something as simple as 'a collection, but for a new type of data?' Because our abstraction is bad.\n\nBut here's the thing about software engineering in a professional setting: *the abstraction is always bad.* We are, forever, solving real problems real people have, balancing correctness, speed, and maintainability. As a programmer passionate about the profession, I want to push maintainability *all* the way to maximum.\n\nI am not paid to do that because it impacts speed. So we write enough abstraction to do the job and we limp it along until it becomes too burdensome to maintain.\n\nYou see code as art. And it is! I love creating a beautiful abstraction that cleanly describes and solves a problem. I do my best to write that code in my hobby-time outside work. But problems in the real world are not clean, they are often ill-described, and the deliverable solution is, as a result, messy and tricky to maintain. We can and do refactor, but not until we're *very* sure that the problem domain is so well-defined that hiding it behind abstraction to make it less verbose and error-prone will be worth costing us the flexibility of writing everything long-form. You don't write clean code to solve the problem every time because you don't even have a clear picture of the problem you're trying to solve. But each possible solution clarifies the problem and gets you closer. And LLMs, it turns out, are *great* at recognizing fuzzy patterns and applying transformations based on that.\n\nIf you treat code *only* as art (which you can choose to do!), you'll get paid like an artist. I'm not gonna tell you not to.\n\nBut solving real problems for real people usually requires writing mountains of bad code fast. LLMs are great at that. They're also surprisingly good at fast analysis of bad (overly verbose, redundant, ill-fit to the problem domain) code and creation of more code fitting the pattern. Which means someone's real problem gets solved faster.\n\nNo surprise people are gravitating towards that, because people have problems and want them solved.\n\nMy advice to you is to keep the passion. The algorithms *are* beautiful. Code *is* art. And, as you've already observed with your peers, letting the AI spit something out you can't understand and putting it in production is just the Sorcerer's Apprentice enchanting the broom to carry water and then letting it go.\n\nBut... Your mastery of craft will take you further *with* AI because you can use it to write code faster than your fingers can, and that gets real solutions into real people's hands faster.\n\nAnd programming and computer science is about the algorithms, but software engineering is about solving the problems human beings have right now.\n\nGood luck out there. The world is a big adventure right now. Bigger than it was when I was in uni. I envy you that, in a sense.",

To be honest, some of it is not bad; if you'd trust an intern to make repeated changes to your software, then AI can usually be leveraged to your advantage.  But if your codebase is complex and is 90% complete, AI often does a lot of harm along with some good.\n\n>And AI can't even code to save its life. It spits out nonsense inefficient code that doesn't even work half the time.\n\nYeah... I once asked AI to re-write code to be more efficient, and it wrote it using an algorithm that many people think is efficient, but that I knew from experience wasn't very efficient in my case.  It's as if AI accepts common misconceptions as fact.\n\n>The fact that people are saying that \"Programming is dead\" infruits me so much.\n\nCool word!  I don't know what \"*infruits*\" means, but I like it already!  I might even start using it myself!  `;-)`\n\n>I want my classmates to learn and discover the beauty of writing algorithms. I want websites to have strong cyber security measures that weren't vibe coded by sloppy AI. And most importantly to me I want to write code.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say.  This AI and Vibe Coding boom has only been going on for a handful of years now, so in another five years I wouldn't be surprised if the programming landscape will be very different.  Perhaps competent coders like you will be in high demand in 2030.\n\nI will say, however, that AI is unlikely to go away completely, and I've found that AI results tend to help us ***provided that a knowledgeable human*** ***vets the results*** first.  So if an AI generates results that are only 10% significant, a human can review them and find lots of good stuff.  But if we blindly use AI results that are only 10%, 50%, or even 90% accurate, we're liable to get nasty surprises 10%, 50%, or 90% of the time.\n\nSo my take is that blindly putting AI on autopilot has its problems, but using it as a search tool to find results we wouldn't normally find on our own is not so bad, provided we review all its results.",

If I took my time to understand the principles of analysis I am doing, the context I’m writing the code in, and then all of the CS analysis to make it beautiful, and then write the tests for it, it’d take me a month.\n\nCopilot can look at code I’ve written before and give the rough beats which I can then fill in quickly with context to my necessity, so I can be more intentional about any minute inaccuracies which might affect my ability to do a worthwhile analysis on the actual data I have.\n\nIt’s a way to work faster.

They do it 100% unpaid. Just for fun. When you are actually interested in programming you will naturally do the same. \n\nUnfortunately university level computer science programs are more than happy to take students who have never written a single line of code in their lives and I think that gives beginners the false impression that you can just be taught to write software from a school and you don't need to actually go into it with any prior experience. \n\nBut look at art or music schools.

No respectable school would take such a student. \n\n> I keep seeing beginners (and even some experienced devs) struggle because they jump straight into writing code without fully understanding the problem. \n\nNo, they struggle because they are impatient and expect to be able to do more than is reasonable for a beginner.

Basic is such, well, a basic language that it read so much like english and i could just, as a 3rd grader without a compuer, read the book and follow the programming examples, and I picked up basic programming just by doing that, just as if one reads a book about math and learns math.\n\nI mean how simple is:\n\n10 PRINT \"What is your name?\"  \n20 INPUT $NAME  \n30 PRINT \"Hello, \" + $NAME\n\nI didn't even know until a year later in 4th grade that the home computer we had had basic installed on it (QBasic specifically) and I could actually write these programs.  By then just by reading the book i understanded it as simple as basic algebra.\n\nYou really do have to start with spending some time reading code and trying to make out what it does before you jump in.  It's not so much about what the code is, but 'why' the code is.  What is this code trying to do?  Why did they write it that was as opposed to some other way you have seen?  Each time you ask yourself one of these questions youre filling in the actual foundation of 'getting it'.  Actually trying to write the syntax is just applying that knowledge.",

Right now with functions, you're passing data around like handing a folder to different people in an office. \"Here, calculate this.\" \"Here, validate that.\" Works fine. But the folder doesn't know anything about itself. If you change what's in the folder, every function that touches it might break and you won't know until it does.\n\nA class is giving the folder a brain. It knows what's inside it, knows what you're allowed to do with it, and can refuse things that don't make sense.\n\nNow that's great and all but let's think about this from a real world problem... say you have three types of reports. With just functions you end up writing process_sales_report(), process_inventory_report(), process_hr_report(), duplicating logic every time. With a class you define what a Report is once (it has data, it can be processed, it can be exported) and each type just fills in its own specifics. You swap behavior without rewriting structure.\n\nThe honest answer to \"when do I actually need them\" is probably not for small scripts. But the moment you have two things that are similar but not identical and you're copying functions and changing variable names, that's the signal. You're doing manually what a class would do for you.\n\nI almost use classes religiously  with the pydantic library when I'm building large machine learning or agentic systems, makes life ten times easier. \n\nThis video isn't exactly on your question but I think my frame your understanding of the industry a bit better.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S3fXSc5z2n4?si=90-0Hz9Pa_xOTp99",

It takes days or weeks to find all the spots in the code to convert to Timu.\n\nBut if you had used a class to deal with Amazon - all the logic to deal with the Amazon web site is in a single class.  It probably has 7-20 methods.  You now have 2 choices:\n\n* Copy the Amazon class to create a Timu class and start changing things.\n* Get fancy and create a base 'website' class.

You can totally use AI to help - but a human must look at the problem and decide how to structure the system. This is the difference between \"Design\" vs \"Implementation\". Let a human come up with the design, then let AI help with the implementation.\n\n\n\n",

It made sense to have a class for reading the entire file, and another class for reading a single line - of course nowadays you could just read the entire file into an array of strings, and then have a single function to split each string, but back then it made sense to me :)\n\nBut again, classes are just a way of structuring your code differently - the \"problem\" it solves is in how programmers organize code, not in anything the code does.",

If you leave the suits and ranks out to be filled later, you even have a *generic card* from which you could derive different cards, e.g. Poker Card, Uno Card, Skip Bo Card, and so on.\n\nIn card games, you are always dealing with a *Deck* that holds a number of cards.\n\nAgain the attributes/fields:\n\n+ the actual cards - a collection (list) of Card instances\n\nAnd the behavior - the methods:\n\n+ A deck can be shuffled\n+ Cards can be  dealt from the deck\n+ A deck can report if it is empty\n+ A deck can be initialized\n\nHere, you see that the deck doesn't need to know *anything* about the exact card type to function. The only time it needs to directly deal with the exact card type is during initialization - here, it can be filled with a set of Poker, Uno, etc. cards.\n\nYou can then move on to a *Player* who has a *Hand* and determine their attributes and methods. Then, a *Discard Pile* (if needed), open cards, and so on.\n\nIf you define all these classes well, you don't need to change much code (apart from the initialization of the deck) to produce various different card games, as the actual *business/game logic* will be completely separate from the cards, deck, players, etc.\n\nThe *reuse* factor is one of the most important parts of OOP. You do not need to rewrite much code if you want to use your classes in different use cases. \n\nSure, all that can be done in a pure procedural style without OOP, but in such a case, you have to rewrite much more code than with OOP.",

Functions call other functions, and the project works fine.\n\nGreat that is exactly how any program work. There is no other way actually. The difference is how you look at functions together with data. You may actually code in an OOP style without ceating any classes at all. It all depends on what functions use what data. If you pack a set of functions together with a set of data and limit other functions from this data then you're basically coding in an OOP style.\n\n> If functions get the job done, what problem are classes really solving?\n\nClasses are useful because they tie data and code together in a very visible and safe way. With a class you can create a group of data and functions that work together and you can protect the data from changes from other functions outside of the class. You can also make the data work as one unit or object and tie operators to the object making it easier to use. This may seem trivial in a small program but in a large program with hundreds of files you can isolate the use of data and you don't need to check all files for usage.\n\n> This has become a big hurdle for me because almost every take home assessment or practice project I see either requires or strongly expects the use of classes, and I just can’t seem to wrap my head around how or where they fit.\n\nThis is not difficult. Just look at the problem from a data point of view. What information is needed and belongs together. This pack of data is a class. What relations does the data have with other data. How many of each are there. What changes to the data is needed, these are the functions, or methods in OOP, that take the data as one parameter.\n\nHope this helps you on the way.",

It wasn’t programming-specific at all, but it helped me see that I naturally prefer structured analytical environments over open-ended social ones which made coding feel like a good bet for me.

Writing and maintaining docs (even small READMEs).  \n* Basic security awareness (auth, secrets, common vulnerabilities).  \n\nYou don’t need to be an expert in all of this as a student, but having working familiarity makes a huge difference and makes learning new stacks much easier later.",

        "body": "This is one of those opinion based things so people may disagree but here is my list.\n\n1. Learn to communicate well!   This include written and verbal communications.   Frankly in college this was a huge challenge, more difficult than just about all other courses I took.   In the corporate world it can be more important than really understanding what you are doing.   Yes that is sad.\n2. Learn to navigate at least two Operating Systems from the command line.  This includes multiple tools that these OS'es deliver.\n3. SCM!   Yes git and github are extremely popular these days but in the corporate world you use what they currently have set up.   So understand the hows and whys.   \n4. Docker might not be a thing, in fact there are plenty of jobs that never touch the web.    As a programmer you may need to target platform specific applications.   So don't dismiss native app development.   This Reddit seems to be very web development focused but people need to know there are many jobs where programming skills might be leveraged.\n5. If you are not doing web development learn the default IDE for the platform you are working on inside out.   With modern IDE's this can take as much time as learning Python.    This especially with AI integration.   So if you are programming a Mac, that means learn XCode, if you are programming a PLC. that might mean RSLogix.   \n6. Which brings up AI, learn to leverage it as a programmer to improve your productivity.   This is entirely different than trying to implement AI features in an application.\n7. Learn Python even if Python might not be your primary development language.\n8. Speaking of Python, spend some time with C or C++ at the command line.   This should be covered in the first few classes of a good CS program.   The reason here is that understanding how compilers, linkers and such, work is important, especially in the future when the IDE breaks.   Command line development might not be the norm these days but understanding how an app is built is still required knowledge.\n9. Keep you math skills up.   You may go years not needing a particular math skill in your programming career, then one day somebody asks for a specific statistical result.   Yes there are reference manuals and text to refer to but in all honesty rusty algebra can really trip you up.   Some people believe mathematical thinking and practice helps keep you programming skill honed, I don't know about that, what I do know is removing rust can really set you behind.\n10. Someone else mentioned typing, this is actually huge.   I literally learned typing in high school well before I could even get access to a computer much less buy one.    Yes this was a teenager looking towards his future - shocking.   In any event it is a skill that makes the job much easier.\n11. Take an assembly language course as part of your college education.   The point here is not to become an embedded programmer but rather to get insight into how processors work.   In the past a good CS program required one quarter of assembly, in that case done on a emulator.    These days you could just as easily buy a small microcontroller system and learn there.\n12. I touched on this above but when it comes to computing systems, the world is much bigger than delivering web apps and in some cases these alternatives pay much better.   So don't dismiss these alternative paths in IT that may or may not be programming heavy.   Examples: Security, embedded programming, industrial automation, platform apps, network management, compiler development (because most languages suck), interpreter development (because Python has been taken over by mad men), API and SDK development, test and validation, SQL (databases) and so forth.   Others can add to this list, ultimately this should be an FAQ someplace.  \n13. Have a well defined minor.   Lets face it programming as a skill by itself is not going to be a huge career driver.   Rather it is how you apply those programming skills to solve problems.   While a weak example if you are doing web development a minor in business might be a big plus.   If you are going to be involved in embedded as stronger background in electronics can be helpful.   If you want to work in the optics industry a strong physics background should be considered.    Actually a strong physics background can help for many paths in a programming career.\n\nThere you go a bakers dozen.   I  suspect the most important point above is to avoid this idea that programming means the web.    There are actually many career paths to follow.",

I say this just to point out that this is why it's good to have database people in the org, and for back end devs to put time into learning about databases, and why it's usually pretty essential to any important app that you don't give up too much control over your database interactions by using managed services and over-abstraction needlessly. (e.g. ORMs don't always generate particularly good queries if you go looking at the query plans). In I/O bound back end services, this type of thing will almost always gain you far more performance than anything you do to application code (if problems exist, of course).

Here me out though: work is still work. You will find yourself creating ”the same” endpoint over and over again, while having meetings that should have been emails and tight deadlines. \n\nSecond. You probably are ready. There’s no reaching the end of programming. Either some new version of your language comes out, some new language appears, libraries update with breaking changes… technology changes. If you need a graduation ceremony to feel you are ready, that’s ok, but then self learning ain’t gonna help much.\n\nStart one of those projects. The 3d section thing is the one I think is the most exciting. I think you like graphics programming, animations. Artistic stuff. Backend can get so predictable that it feels mindless. Frontend is more chaotic and feels new everytime but can’t get annoying when what you did last time doesn’t seem to work. That 3d section project is something in the middle there. Is more abstract code, closeish to backend and produces something you can look at.\n\nNo matter if you get a job tomorrow or start your projects, learning is always needed and it will never end.",

If you run into a stuck, find a project that does that thing, look at how they did it, and implement as needed for your own. Alternatively, talk it through with an LLM. Don't use agentic modes, just open a chat with GitHub copilot or something and ask it for suggestions on how to solve X problem, preferably multiple ways.\n\nPersonally, I'd take your art catalog project and write a web scraper that can scrape a single website. Then build it for a second site. Look at the patterns between the two scrapers you built, and build one that can effectively scrape both. Finding patterns and making code reusable is an essential skill to have. For what it's worth I think you've probably put more time into raw practice than I ever have.

The *class* only *describes*/*defines* the general setup, while the *object* fills it with data.\n\nThere is another thing to consider: The implementation of OOP differs vastly between programming languages to the point that it is not even directly comparable (just take JavaScript, Python, and Java - completely different implementations of OOP). \n\n\n1.  In terms of programming an object is an instance of a class. - It's the *data/state* (fields/attributes/members) coupled with the *behavior* (methods) of a specific class (type).\n2.  The binary data is scattered - the methods are stored in one place, and in one place only, no matter how many objects you create. The *state* (fields, attributes, members) are stored somewhere else, typically, but not necessarily, in contiguous memory blocks, individually for each object (apart from the exception of `static` members that also only exist once in memory). This is a very efficient approach as the data is usually a lot less than the methods.\n3. It is not actually that different. In some languages even structs can have methods - so the line blurs depending on the language. In a way, structs (as the structs in C) are the predecessor of classes.\n4. Methods are functions that belong to a class - it's basically just terminology. When a programmer talks about *functions* they mean *unbound functions* that exist outside the context of OO. When they talk about *methods*, they always talk about \"functions\" that are bound to classes and that only exist in the context of OO.\n\nThe difference between function and method is: `len(string)` vs. `string.length()` - the former is a function that exists outside the context of classes and objects, but can accept an object, and the latter is a method that exists in the context of the `string` instance of a class.\n\nIt's like \"please draw me a fish\" (\"draw\" being the function and \"fish\" being the argument) and \"fish, please draw yourself\" (\"fish\" being the object and \"draw yourself\" being the method called).",

        "body": "I don't know Rust, but I know C++, so I'll explain it in that syntax, but the concepts are universal.\n\nI warn you that if you look at objects too low level, the concept itself dissolves. Consider:\n\n    class person {\n      int weight, height, age;\n\n    public:\n      void jump(int how_high), run(int how_far);\n    };\n\nIn memory - whether it's on the stack or the heap, it going to lay out in memory per byte something like:\n\n    [w][w][w][w][h][h][h][h][a][a][a][a]\n\nThis is the same as if it were a structure. Objects are programming concepts - when you get down to the machine, it's all bytes - bytes for data, bytes for addresses, bytes for offsets, bytes for instructions...\n\nAs for the functions, that gets compiled into the program binary, just like any other function. The syntax dissolves at the assembly level - to call the interface, you have to build a stack frame and push your parameters. One of the parameters is going to be the location of the object instance in memory - the hidden `this` pointer. So just as you have to push how high to jump, you also need to push who is doing the jumping. Again - the machine just sees program instruction sequences - bytes, and more bytes, and more bytes.\n\nYes, you can directly replicate what the compiler is going to generate for you with a `struct` and a function that takes a pointer, but why? The syntax is there to facilitate what you already want to do in a more concise manner.\n\nBut also, programming constructs are MORE than just syntax. C++, Rust, ANY language is more than just a high level assembly. The language defines the confines of what these things are, and the compiler is allowed to exploit everything else. In other words, stated more concretely - C++ has a SHITTON of Undefined Behavior, it's kind of notorious for it, but that's a GOOD thing, because everything the language doesn't say, the compiler can exploit for optimization. We want as much of that as possible, and then we can wrap those dicy corners with the standard library so you don't have to deal with it directly.\n\nThe hard part is cultural - getting people to use the facilities provided and stop writing raw imperative code that gets them into trouble.\n\n> What is an object in terms of programming? \n\nAn object is a user defined type, that models behavior, by encapsulating state, to protect it's invariant.\n\nSo an `std::vector` is always implemented in terms of 3 pointers. The invariant is that those pointers are ALWAYS well defined. There is no intermediate state that YOU the client can ever observe. You also don't actually know how the vector is implemented, and you don't have direct access. You defer to the vector to enforce its invariant, and it's behavior is well defined through its interface. When you hand program control to the vector, it can suspend it's own invariant - say, to reallocate, but that invariant is reestablished before it returns control.\n\nSo objects have a certain level of autonomy and agency. They know what to do, they don't need you to tell them how to do their job. It's why you employ classes in the first place, because that encapsulation keeps your program more correct and consistent.\n\n> How does the binary data and the methods in the class get managed at low level? Does the data get scattered in one place? Or it's just managed by pointers? \n\nFrankly it doesn't matter. No programming language gets that specific, because it's not portable.\n\n> How is an instance of a class that has no methods in it different from a struct type variable?\n\nTechnically there is no different. Idiomatically, a class models behavior, and a struct is a tagged tuple. It's a conventional difference in meaning. Classes make for terrible structures. A car has some state, about the position of keys, dials, doors, etc, and the interface will open and close things, speed up and slow down... But NONE of that is dependent upon the make, model, or year. Those are variables that are independent. The same car can go by different names and makes. Is that a Subaru BRZ or a Scion FRS? Trick question, they're the exact same car made in the exact same factory as a joint project between the two companies.\n\nSo if anything, you bundle your car model with it's pedantic properties in some sort of tagged tuple or relational or table structure.\n\n> How is a method different from a function that does some operations based on different values of its properties?\n\nAt that low level, there isn't a difference. But any language and implementation can make the difference more significant. A free function and a public structure, you can do anything you want, and while you can do everything strict and correct, there's nothing preventing me from writing my own function that fucks everything. A class with a method? You're encapsulating state and enforcing an invariant.",

Then study some assembly, not enough to be fluent in it but to learn about how functions are built and memory is handled.\n\nFrom C, start learning GUIs.  Build your own. Figure out the mouse works and screen regions, callbacks, etc.  You’ll abandon this but you gained insight into what’s going on.  All of that mouse info is tracked in real frameworks.  Be aware of it and use it.\n\nNow start higher languages.  Try some procedural and some functional.  You’ll start to like one.  \n\nNext, learn threads and asynchronous coding.  Wrap your head around the different ways languages and systems handle threads and how not to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\nIn parallel with learning threads, learn I/O, bottlenecks, buffering, streams, etc., combining these with threads and async code.  Do extreme tests and see how quickly you can process insanely large files.  How many large files in parallel?  How about millions of small files?\n\nThen there is database connectivity.  Combine the async IO stuff and now start getting structured.  Learn file types, how to process them, filter them, project to new types, get things in and out of databases.  What kind of database works for different problem sets?\n\nAt this point, you can good job in most shops.\n\nTo take things next level, learn AI and machine learning.  Learn the problems they solve and how to implement them.  This will give you insight into where the industry will be.\n\nSo the chain is understanding data. Data turns into knowledge.  Knowledge turns into wisdom.  Turning data into knowledge means identifying patterns.  These patterns are timeless, like identifying faces in a photo, or are a time series like identifying engaged customers based on purchase history.  15 years ago pattern identification was costly and hard.  It has since turned into toolset.  We can identify more and more patterns now.  And this isn’t going to slow down any time soon.",

The target resource in a POST request is intended to handle the enclosed representation according to the resource's own semantics, whereas the enclosed representation in a PUT request is defined as replacing the state of the target resource. Hence, the intent of PUT is **idempotent** and visible to intermediaries, even though the exact effect is only known by the origin server.  \n\nIn plain English, **PUT** is where the *user* dictates to *you (the server)* to make the resource at the URI look a specific way and it should always look that specific way no matter how many times i send that **PUT** request especially if the request is duplicated. It's an *update or insert if non-existent* like in SQL.  \n\n**POST** is where the *user* gives something to *you (the server)* and the server has free range to do whatever with it (including creating a new URI where the thing *you* gave them will live. If you **POST** the same request multiple times, you can cause the server to have *duplicates* things (in this case, you could either replicate the full favorite list multiple times or end up adding the same song to the one list multiple times). It's just an *insert without a primary key* like in SQL.  \n\nFor your use case, you should just use **PUT**.",

This becomes a good option if you need to manage or model additional information about a favorite itself, but for just a simple favorites list, defer to the prior uris.\n\n\nI would keep user id present in the uri and validate it against the user information in the jwt and accept/reject as needed.",

Which is to say, they can be considered overengineering for a program of this size & scope, but overengineering otherwise small programs can also be a decent way to learn about those engineering practices.\n\n*Avoiding \"magic\" numbers*: Your `else` case for the difficulty rating is meant to result in `easy` mode, but this can drift apart. If you decide to give `easy` mode 4 tries for example, then you need to update that number in two spots. There are a couple of ways around that, like storing the numbers in constants, e.g. `const int EASY_MODE_TRIES = 3;` and then using the constant rather than the literal number, and/or having an extra parsing step where you wind up doing something like an extra function that ends on `else { cout << \"Something…\"; return EASY; }`, returning something like an `enum` of the valid difficulty ratings, or even a struct. Error handling and parsing user input can be kind of big topics with lots of options.\n\nBut generally, magic numbers are a hazard for code maintenance, because it very often turns into questions like \"why is it _this_ number? can I change it? what happens if I do?\" and some constants with names and rationales go a long way to alleviate that.\n\n*More functions*: Generally we break code up into what's hopefully logical chunks. Often to avoid repetition, but also sometimes just to break up long reams of code into something more like a condensed sequence of subtasks. Opinions vary on how long a function should be allowed to get. My opinion is something like trying to be able to fit the entire function on the screen (but also not trying to bend over backwards to follow the rule), which I think is a fairly common middle-of-the-road opinion.\n\nThere are also a whole bunch of C++ concepts and best practices that you'll kind of have to pick up over time; one that may be good to get you to look into as soon as possible is \"[const correctness](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)\".",

Why is `<ctime>` included? Because if you didn't, the code wouldn't compile, because `time()` is missing. Right? In this way, the code speaks for itself.\n\n    // Convert difficulty input to lowercase (so EASY, Easy, easy all work)\n\nSee? This isn't a bad comment, though you could tighten it up. The important thing is to not tell us what the code tells us, because here's the thing - typically such comments and code disagree. So who's the authority? Which is right? The code? Or the comment?\n\nOne thing your comments are doing is making up for a lack of functions. You're lacking expressiveness, and so you're trying to name what you're doing with the comment. Perhaps your next lesson will introduce functions to you, and this will dry up.\n\n    std::transform(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end(), difficulty.begin(), ::tolower);\n\nThere is a bug here. It's really technical and subtle, and I don't fully understand it myself, but the [reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/tolower.html) warns you this is unsafe, that you need to write a function that casts your character type to `int`.\n\n    random_num = rand() % max_num + 1;\n\nThis is the same in every branch of your difficulty condition. Just hoist it out and write this code once, after the condition block.\n\n    std::getline(std::cin, guess); // Take guess as string\n    user_guess = std::stoi(guess); // Convert string to integer\n\nToo many steps! Streams know how to extract integers! Your problem is interleaving extraction with line grabbing.\n\nThe rules of extraction are:\n\n1) Ignore leading whitespace\n\n2) Start grabbing characters\n\n3) Stop at some delimiter character. Leave the delimiting character behind, in the stream.\n\nThe rules for line grabbing are:\n\n1) Grab characters one at a time\n\n2) Stop when you find the delimiter character, discarding it.\n\nSo imagine first extracting an `int` - something like `\"    123\\n\"; the stream purges the leading whitespace, grabs \"123\" and leaves \"\\n\" behind. Now you line grab, and what happens? We grab \"\\n\", which is our delimiter, and we stop.\n\nSo the thing to do is know when you're switching between the two, and `ignore` the newline as necessary.\n\n    int x;\n    std::string s;\n\n    std::cin >> x;\n    std::cin.ignore(); // Purge after extraction, before getline\n    std::getline(std::cin, s);\n\n    std::getline(std::cin, s);\n    std::cin >> x; // No purge necessary after getline\n\nAnother thing you should be doing is checking your streams. A stream is implemented as a \"user defined type\", which are made from `class`, `struct`, `enum`, and `union`. One of the things you can do is \"overload\" almost any of the language operators. That's how `operator >>` and `operator <<` - the bit shift operators, are made to work as stream extraction and insertion - they're written as functions that work with stream types. And when you learn to make your own types, you can write your own stream operators for them without having to modify the stream class itself - the pattern is extensible.\n\nContinued...",

Manually verifying someone’s resume takes forever, and often employers will only tell you that someone was employed during certain dates. \n\nSo, you need some way to quickly verify that the person you’re interviewing can actually program. \n\nHistorically, I think it was Microsoft that is to blame for popularizing programming puzzles, but the reason they’re still being used is that it’s one way to be sure that the interviewee can program. Although it’s far from the only way, and you definitely miss out on people that can program in a more real world setting. \n\nPersonally, my favorite approach is to ask people to submit any piece of code that they wrote and are proud of, about 100 lines or so, and then we talk about it. Another popular alternative is take-home tests, which tend to be more similar to real-world programming, but are a bigger burden on applicants.

It took me probably two weeks before I stopped feeling completely lost, and even then I was just pattern matching from problems I'd already seen. The thing that actually clicked for me was ignoring the \"optimal DP solution\" at first and just writing the brute force recursive solution. Once you have that, you literally just add a cache (memoization) and you've got a top-down DP solution. The jump from recursion to memoization is way smaller than trying to build a bottom-up table from scratch. Also, focus on the classic patterns first: fibonacci-style, 0/1 knapsack, longest common subsequence. Most DP problems on leetcode are just variations of like 5-6 core patterns. Once you recognize those, the \"how do I even start\" feeling goes away pretty fast.",

I was making a mod for Minecraft (using Java obviously). I had an item that could petrify entities by replacing the targeted entity with a modded “petrified entity”. In the petrified entity renderer I had to use Forge’s API in order to get the model from some render buffer somewhere. It then takes the model and applies a stone texture for rendering.\n\nHowever I quickly discovered a burial bug that occurs. If there is an actual instance of the target entity being rendered on screen at the same time as a petrified entity of the same entity, then any animations that played on the living one played on the petrified entity model. That obviously looks a little weird.\n\nI determined the cause of this was the fact the function I was calling to get the model wasn’t new model and was a shared reference or a shallow copy of a model. Now this were a copy constructor would have been very handy, but it didn’t seem to have one nor did the model class have the copy method implemented. \n\nI ended up writing this kinda ugly piece of code using reflections to solve it. It only needs to run once as it caches the model,  so it isn’t too bad performance wise, but the code is ugly. A copy constructor or similar would have been super handy.",

The Java language does have a related and more built-in thing, which is called \"Cloneable,\" but you can and should mostly ignore it.\n\nWhat exactly is a copy constructor?  It's any constructor for class Whatever that takes a parameter of another Whatever and tries to make this new Whatever exactly like the other Whatever.\n\nWhen should I actually use it in real code? Whenever you want there to be a new thing that is a separate thing from another thing but has the same value. \"Make a copy of this thingy\" is a very common, basic operation in a lot of situations.\n\nwhat problem does a copy constructor solve? It lets you make copies. There are lots of ways to solve that problem, and copy constructors are one of them. Other ways involve factory methods, cloneable, and just creating a new thing and setting all of its properties with setters() for the new thing and getters() for the old thing.",

Some objects really do need to run some code to make a valid copy, because they internally manage some resource. \n\nAs a simple example, consider a list. The list object itself usually doesn't directly contain its elements. It contains some kind of reference to separate memory which stores the elements. That memory is a resource it has to manage. Stuff like allocate new memory when you insert elements, free the memory when the list itself is being destroyed, etc.\n\nIf you were to just create a bitwise copy of the list object, now you'd have two list objects, which are expected to manage the same memory, probably not knowing that the other one exists. This would lead to some serious memory safety bugs. What you actually need to do, when you want to create a real copy is to run some code that allocates the new memory for the second list, and copies over the elements. That *some code* is the copy constructor.\n\n",

Same situation happened to me, I always felt like I was good at programming, solving problems and so on (I’m a civil engineer) but I never felt like it really clicked, so I decided to launch my own product, and I found that my background in scientific programming was useless to deliver a product. I became very frustrated and decided to give a try to the Odin project and I finally feel capable to code some really cool stuff. So my recommendation is that: stop trying to figure it out by yourself and start the Odin project or free code camp and start seeing results. You will make it.",

And at that point basic DSA and other stuff you've learned may look like kindergarten knowledge to you but from most lectures I've attended I can tell you that the base is absolutely crucial. If you can figure out the proper data structure(s) for your system/sub-system, the algorithms will follow without you having to explicitly design anything beyond business logic operations. And one of the most important statements I've learned is that whenever you're building something - a small project, a system, a library, an api, etc. think of it as \"Everything is a __\" where the __ is basically a morphable entity that you design from scratch. And the entire system can essentially be considered a single unit of that entity, even though it's made out of the same entity in smaller scales. This is where programming paradigms help alot. For example in Java, everything is an object. What is an object? For that you must know the details of OOP - which is just another programming paradigm. \n\nI can recommend https://roadmap.sh/ for a quick progress tracker as it covers the majority of this sphere.\n\nLastly, having a mathematical mind is crucial to programming, because getting desired results from any given problem through programming can be achievable via brute force in the worst situations. But solving a problem in an optimized manner requires a ton of math and math oriented thinking. Because taking shortcuts and cutting corners is what makes your code precise and fast. This is where your knowledge of DSA can be applied in smaller scales - competitive programming problems from sites like Leetcode are extremely helpful and will give you a good grasp of what to do in most situations.",

Sometimes the tooling available feels a bit like using a pair of wrong-handed scissors, some languages feel like they're full of [cow tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools), and that feeling will vary across people. That's part of why we have different programming languages.\n\nIt is usually possible to become competent at some language that has low compatibility with the programmer, but I suspect most would rather avoid those languages and use those they feel comfortable with.

I remember having to look at the solution for a couple problems throughout the course because I didn't quite get exactly what they were looking for and, lo and behold, I didn't structure something correctly or I didn't realize I should have done something in a specific way. The solution honestly provided additional learning, because they don't always cover the specifics that some of the problem sets require. I would say try to solve the problem set on your own using documentation or additional resources online and then, if you still can't fully get it, look at the solution and see where you might have been confused about something. The problem sets are just specific use cases for more general concepts like loops, conditionals, syntax, functions, etc. ",

Plus, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try us out risk-free.\nWe truly look forward to welcoming you to our platform and are committed to making your learning experience easy, interactive, and fun.\n\nOnly links I found on that link to formal policy link to terms that say all sales are final within the bounds of law. \n\nIf you go to the footer and click support/help center, then click subscription faq, the bottom faq is a link to a support post about the money back policy. \n\nIt reads:\n\n> Our goal is to help you achieve meaningful results in your learning journey, and if you are not satisfied with the results you’re getting within the first 31 days of the initial purchase, we offer a Money-Back Guarantee. You can learn more about the policy and check the eligibility criteria here.\nIf the conditions are met, you may request a refund by sending an email to info@codefinity.com or submitting a request. Please note that the Money-Back Guarantee is only valid if all criteria are satisfied. \n\nIf you click the word “here” it takes you to a policy that says: \n\n> We are convinced that our product (hereinafter referred to as the “plan” and/or “program”) will bring the user meaningful results within a chosen Subscription period. If no results will be reached by the user, he/she is eligible to receive a full refund, if all the following criteria are met: 1) the user contacts us within 31 days after the initial purchase, 2) the user has followed the recommendations from the provided personalized plan at least during 28 consecutive days within the first 31 days after the purchase, and 3) the user can demonstrate that he/she conscientiously has followed the plan (ex.: provide photos and/or video of completion of recommendations, tasks, etc.).\n\nSo their money back guarantee requires you use the platform for 28-consecutive days, following their recommendations, and document that you did what they recommended after that on day 28 (after doing what they tell you to), 29, 30, or 31 you have to email them and provide your proof of following their guidance to get a refund. \n\nIf you get sick, your kid has a soccer game, life happens any time during the 28 consecutive days and you miss a day?

        "body": "Hey! If you’re just starting out with programming, I think you should give pseudocode a try. Many tutors and computer science professors have already developed an algorithmic mindset, so they often dive straight into teaching specific languages and syntax. In doing so, they sometimes overlook the root of the challenge: learning how to think like a coder.\n\nIn my opinion, when you're a beginner facing a programming problem, you should first grab a blank sheet of paper and ask yourself: 'How can I break this down like a cooking recipe?'\n\nFor example, if I asked you to write a function that returns a boolean based on whether a number is prime, you could map it out like this:\n\n>Function isPrime(n):\n\n>If n≤1 then:\n\n>return False\n\n>If n=2 then:\n\n>return True\n\n>If n is even then:\n\n>return False\n\n>For i from 3 to SquareRoot(n) with a step of 2:\n\n>If i divides n then:\n\n>return False\n\n>EndFor\n\n>return True\n\nOnce you’ve done that and you’re confident in your logic, go ahead and write the code in the language you're learning. If you get stuck on the syntax, just look it up. Remember: syntax is just a matter of practice and habit. The real hurdle is training your brain to think algorithmically.\n\nIt might seem a bit silly to use pen and paper for a simple function like this, but I promise you that after a few weeks, you’ll develop a real knack for deconstructing problems. After that, you'll be free to focus entirely on reading and writing the code itself.",

You cant jump straight to making the thing that requires a jig without even knowing what they are or how to make them or when you need to make them\n\nYou only learn to make those things by solving smaller things and noticing patterns between those smaller things and then trying to optimize a little by making something that helps with those smaller things\n\nThings build on each other and it takes time for that build up to make the smaller things easier, but it does ramp up and snowball eventually, just keep going and give yourself time and a break about how challenging this is\n\nGood luck",

You end up wiring libraries together without understanding failure modes, limits, or trade-offs. That is not machine learning competence.\n\nStart by separating Python from machine learning. Python is a tool. Machine learning is applied mathematics.\n\nFirst phase: foundations.\n\nYou need linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues), calculus (derivatives, partial derivatives, gradients), probability (distributions, expectation, variance), and statistics (hypothesis testing, bias/variance). Without these, concepts like gradient descent, regularization, overfitting, or loss functions are opaque symbols. Use textbooks, not shortcut videos. Expect months, not weeks.\n\nSecond phase: Python as a numerical language.\n\nLearn Python only to the level needed to express math. Focus on:\n\nCore syntax, functions, loops, list/dict comprehensions\n\nNumPy for vectorized computation\n\nMatplotlib for visualising functions and error surfaces\n\nIgnore \"Python for ML in 10 hours\" content. It trains imitation, not understanding.\n\nThird phase: machine learning from first principles.\n\nBefore touching scikit-learn, implement algorithms yourself:\n\nLinear regression from scratch\n\nGradient descent manually\n\nLogistic regression with your own loss function\n\nk-means without libraries\n\nIf you cannot derive the update rule on paper, you are not ready to code it.\n\nFourth phase: libraries.\n\nOnly after the above should you use scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. At this point libraries accelerate work rather than replace thinking. You should be able to predict model behaviour before running it.\n\nRules to follow:\n\nAvoid tutorial playlists that jump straight to neural networks\n\nPrefer courses that derive equations before code\n\nIf math feels uncomfortable, that is the signal you are on the right path\n\nExpect frustration; ML is not a \"learn a library\" skill\n\nBottom line:\n\nMachine learning is mathematics implemented in Python. If you skip the mathematics, you are not learning machine learning you are decorating code with buzzwords.",

You can use Github Project, Trello, Notion, Jira, IceScrum or sheet of paper.\n\nWrite nice-to-have and optional and keep them in mind when you code. It does not mean doing a lot of abstraction \"just in case\".\n\nThis will already help a lot.\nNow, don't refactor until absolutely needed to add a feature. You should not have to refactor a lot if you did the first part correctly.\n\nSometimes 1-2 workarounds are fine, everything does not need to be perfect all the time. Wait until the workaround causes more issues that it solves.\n\nFinally, from time to time, allow yourself a review of your project. List the pain points, bottlenecks, ... and plan refactors.

That is what refactoring is - it isn't something you can wave around that solves your weird memory-allocation scheme into something more professional.\n\nAnyways - first you plan how the code should be structured, you probably need to diagram something for this, as you won't be able to remember. You plan which classes you need, and which methods they should contain, what those methods should receive and return, and so on. You decide if some methods should perhaps be closer together in a single class, to keep coherence high, and you decide if some should receive fewer data-structures (or objects) to keep coupling loose ...\n\nAlso, you make sure that you have valid tests that can run for both the un-refactored and the refactored code - if not, you write them along the way.\n\nAlso, create a new branch for all this work, as you'll without a doubt break something!\n\nThen you begin - usually the steps are somewhat like this, but there's never a perfect recipe:\n\n1. Split functions and methods up into smaller parts\n2. Create additional classes and connect them\n3. Move functions / methods to their new classes\n4. Change globally available variables to locally where needed\n5. Change method parameters and/or return values - perhaps introduce new objects to be received and returned.\n\nBetween each step you test, and once the tests pass, you commit - then go on to the next step.\n\nThat is basically the way.\n\n  \nRefactoring *never* makes the code \"better\" or \"faster\" from the computer's point of view - it is usually still the exact same lines of code that runs, but they are structured better from the programmers' point of view, so that they'll have an easier time implementing new features and changing functionality!",

Yeah, your existing code is shit, it's even got bugs, but it's a known quantity. What you're suggesting is all new code, that accomplishes the same goals as the old code, and it's unproven. Remember that the customer doesn't see the code. You mean you want to take 6 months to deliver... the exact same thing as what we already have?\n\n> Like i dont know if i have some kind of RoadBlock but for me when you already have \"working\" Code but you know you can refactor it to make it better, faster, etc. it just seems like starting from Scratch feeling :(\n\n> Also i gotta be honest i really often do not know where to begin even >.> \n\nSecond, the human mind is conservative. We HATE loss, so we're susceptible to things like the sunk cost fallacy. So to save some of the cost you've put into this code base, to minimize your losses, you try to make a minimal change. It's usually not robust enough to be a total solution, it's a hack or bandaid. One or two can be forgivable, but they add up quickly.\n\n> But yea anyone got any Advice for dealing with these Huge Tasks of either Refactoring or Rewriting Large Chunks of your Code >.>\n\nThird, this is the difference between juniors and seniors. I have 37 years of mistakes to inform my design decisions without having to consciously think about it - that's called intuition. This may be new code, but I've already made up my mind about it 20 years ago, when I had to learn that one thing the hard way... So refactoring is so hard because your system is too tightly coupled and does not tolerate refactoring. All software systems have their limitations, nothing is infinitely extensible or refactorable or perfectly decoupled. The difference is how far you can go before it starts looking like bandaids or hits the hard wall that you need a redesign.\n\nOne form of refactoring is short-sighted, where what you have is \"over-fit\" (borrowing from my data analyst wife), too tightly coupled, not flexible or extensible, it only does exactly what it was designed to do, and how. So what you end up doing is redesigning the thing with YET ANOTHER over-fit solution.\n\nAnother form of refactoring is well seasoned. You design with flexibility in mind. This can be a hard sell even in the industry, because it can seem pointless at the time if the others think this is a well understood and fixed area. So good code is actually needlessly decoupled, because you end up tripping over it eventually, and you'll be glad you have that flexibility built in. It's stupid until you end up needing it. It's extra and unnecessary complexity until you end up needing it. It's needlessly expensive (premature optimization) until you both need it and discover the performance didn't matter here, anyway.\n\nAnd that's a dangerous one - performance, people will die on that hill, but then you become over-dependent on the performance of that segment to makeup for the failings of other, \"justified\", sloppy and expensive code. Well now you have to break this thing, and you lose the performance, and it's not itself a big deal, but it does expose the weaknesses of other code. And rather than fixing it, there's more bias to ignore it and blame other parts, put the burden on them to make up for it.\n\n---\n\nContinued...",

You use the methods and thank the people who implemented them that stuff works out. If you need to break these invariants on subclassing DateTimes, you're doing neither algebra nor proper OOP. You're just shitting up your own architecture.\n\nYour claim about methods being slow is also wrong. Any halfway decent compiler can make a method call into a zero-cost abstraction - UNLESS you have runtime dispatch from inheritance.\n\nAnd that's the part that is usually criticised in OOP: using inheritance for everything.

I think there's good reasons that Golang and Rust lean far more towards a model of \"These are the shapes of data structures and we describe them and then write functions to act on them\" (with a syntactic sugar to do method calls) than their predecessors. I'd also like to add one more thought in this space: as software engineering has cared more and more about the network and shipping data between execution domains, coupling data to behavior has fallen grossly out of favor because **behavior is local to an execution engine and data is not**. If my data is wrapped up in a class instance and I have to ship it over the wire, I now have to peel the \"shippable\" data from the \"unshippable,\" i.e. any dynamic method pointers, vtables, or other mechanisms to specify what class this is an instance of, and that's annoying. If your data is in a bog-standard language-supported generic structure, you can ship it to a bog-standard language-supported generic marshaller and be done with the problem of getting it on and off the wire.\n\nI think I'd like to tune your thoughts a bit, because OOP conflates a couple of goals and we might want to talk about how we toss the bathwater without the baby.\n\n**Encapsulation and interface boundary**: You mention the challenge of \"re-opening\" a class to add new behavior. Some languages allow that! It's generally considered an anti-design. The reason is that being able to wall off code and say \"You can touch this via this mechanism and no other\" is a feature that enables large, decentralized teams to collaborate better by hiding details. If I hand you a Date object with methods, you do not need to care how I'm implementing the methods (with the tradeoff being the only things you can do with *my* Date object are the ones the interface exposes). This leaves me free to change my implementation without breaking you (maybe; see Hyrum's Law), and that's extremely important for being able to iterate to a solution because we almost never know how to write the best solution the first time. The humble `string` is actually my favorite example of this; crack the actual implementation of strings open in many high-level languages and you find that they're fascinatingly complicated (implementing things like caching and memory-reuse on string copy and substring so that the programmer doing the most obvious things with strings doesn't immediately torpedo program performance). If programmers touched the string internals directly, it would make using strings in those systems a nightmare. Golang has interfaces and structs instead of classes and objects, but it also has the rule that you can't write a function that acts directly on the contents of a struct if you aren't in the same module as the struct so that developers can't write code that depends directly on another developer's implementation without consent.\n\n**Discoverability**: So I have a struct. What can I do with it? How do I find all the functions that could be applied to that struct so I don't reinvent the wheel? In OOP, the answer is simple: the methods on the class and the parents of the class. In the data-and-functions paradigm... Good luck!\n\nIt's not quite that bad. It *was* when computers were slower and smaller, which is one of the reasons I think OOP took off when it did. Nowadays, with a language with good static typing and an LSP, you can find all functions that take a given data type as an argument (even grep will work in a pinch, although you'll have to do your own composition analysis). But OOP gives someone a big leg-up on the discovery problem by imposing a paradigm of how code is sorted.\n\nThough I highlight the above, I concur with OP: **you don't** ***need*** **OOP to get those things.** It's just worth noting that when you throw OOP out, you're throwing out a paradigm that tries to give you those things for free (well, for cheap... The documentation engines I've seen for Java factories kind of give the lie to the notion that OOP \"solves\" discoverability). The trick is to know what your plan is to get those things without OOP in the languages you plan to use.",

I doesn't say it's a book that is 100% about anything, and if you want to claim that there's only 4 patterns that address a specific issue, well the entire book is like that.  There's only a handful of patterns that handle the constraints of object construction.  Only a handful that handle the issues of managing a large number of objects.  Only a few that handle behavioral composition.\n\nIt's like this argument puts forth a decent idea, and the because the idea is decent, decides to back it up with dishonest arguments.  That's a kind of lack of integrity that Richard Feinman warned about, a \"speaker lying to the audience\" in the hopes that the audience follows the speaker afterwards due to the lack of integrity in arguing, instead of due to the quality of the argument.",

OOP is about message passing - which you've missed entirely, OOD is about object modeling, which is orthogonal to OOP and entirely at your discretion - I don't use it. Objects don't couple behavior with data, they couple behavior with state. You can use OOD to model data. You conflate objects with types, and your arguments are mostly about types. You misunderstand aggregation vs. composition. Your conclusion is confused, because ECS is an architecture you can implement regardless of your paradigm.\n\nYou do have one valid criticism of OOP, and that is due to the agency of the object. Each object is an island of one, which for batch processing is bad, and for stream processing is worse. While you can make a character object and a string object - to get adequate performance, you can't composite one in terms of the other, so you get a scaling problem that composition in FP solves.\n\nWhile I still say stick with FP, I can also say the difficulties you have suffered from OOP is due to your misunderstands. You're in the majority, and I would say this is one of the valid criticisms of OOP, as well.",

That's the OO part of it. Without interfaces and inheritance you aren't doing OO.

From that I conclude that coupling data with behaviour is the problem and should be avoided in the first place to avoid the design problems in the first place.\n\nTo counter that argument you would have to argue why that conclusion is not logical.

Are you just watching the tutorials or are you using them as a guideline? Also , tutorials are rarely the best option to learn how to code .

It is like human DNA which contains old codes not useful any more. But this is done for a reason: to keep the full ecosystem compatible. And this ecosystem is what makes C++ outstanding still in 2026. Just check language popularity indexes (like Tiobe, PYPL, Redmonk); stack overflow developer survey results; Google trends etc. – both C and C++ are still widely used and within the top 5 languages (together with Python, JavaScript and Java).\n\nTL;DR: the best language to learn DSA is what you are the most familiar with.\n\n",

The use of a contiguous memory layout, as well as enforcement of homogenous contents, are both secondary aspects of what makes something an array. An array is an ordered data structure which has (close to) constant time access to its contents by index. It’s better to think of these data structures in terms of the performance guarantees they provide for different operations than to try to focus on their implementations. Implementations can involve all sorts of hairy performance optimizations which obscure the intent of the data structure.\n\nThe weird thing about JS arrays, and ArrayList objects compared to something like C or Java’s primitive arrays, is that they allow the data structure’s size to efficiently dynamically grow. The other weird thing about JS arrays is that they can be sparse, but that’s something you hopefully will never have to deal with. \n\nTo be pedantic, it’s pretty common for arrays to “hold” heterogenous contents in languages other than JS. I use scare quotes because arrays of objects generally don’t hold objects themselves, but rather pointers to those objects. In languages with subtyping (like Java) the pointers may indeed point to multiple different types of objects as long as they are all subclasses of the array’s declared generic argument. A typed language like Java thus allows arrays to hold heterogenous data, but requires you to access the data as though it is homogenous (unless you use an unsafe downcast). Dynamically typed languages like JS and Python are more permissive, but it’s (IMO) a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.",

Its elements have in common that they are products, but having meat on the list is not the same as having a car, even though both are products since you can buy them.\n\nDon't worry too much about it since it's more of a conceptual issue, but TypeScript was created to avoid this problem. It forces you to type things, meaning that if you create a list of \"supermarket products,\" you can only add supermarket items to that list. In theory, cars, houses, etc., shouldn't be on the list unless they're sold in a supermarket 🤣\nJavaScript was designed to be dynamic... In your program, a variable might start as a number, then become a character, perhaps later a boolean, and even a list or array... And that's what many programmers don't like. Some prefer to define things and leave them that way, while others like it to be dynamic... It's a matter of personal preference.

IaC, basic observability, a queue or pub/sub, a DB migration story, and a rollout strategy.

OpenCV is a widespread standard image processing library. You can do C++ but I honestly would say the adapter to Python would probably be a bit more easier to handle because you can use Python for ML stuff as well if you want to, even if Python isn't exactly the fastest.\n\nOne of the problem you really need to figure out first is to determine the boundary of the problem. What do you mean when you say \"front\" and \"back\" of a robot?\n\nIf the competition has defined features of a robot, you can use that to determine what constitutes front and back. Using standard or advanced image processing algorithms are going to be an option in this case.\n\nA very straight-forward case would be if the competition requires every robot to show some sort of marker for the front facing side. You can use some variant of HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) or if its more complicated SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) to get a decently robust feature detection for the front-side and then deduct that the absence of that feature plus something else like rotational tracking will be the back-side.\n\nYou can also try the Generalized Hough Transform (although that one might be a bit too slow for pictures with too many pixels).\n\nAll 3 algorithms are implemented in OpenCV I think (although if not, you can certainly just build them yourself using the OpenCV toolkit).\n\nBut If robots can look arbitrary and you cannot say that there is some sort of fixed recognizable features, the detection is going to be tricky and OpenCV will not solve your problem. In the latter case, I would honestly consider resorting to machine learning. Retraining CNNs for classification can yield pretty decent results. You would need to have a decently sized training set of images of competition robots fronts and back. You would then do the pre-processing in OpenCV and then pass it on to the model or if you have something integrated like from Nvidia's developer suite, maybe use their stuff.\n\nThe problem with the ML approach is that you need a decently powerful compute platform on your robot. Even if the majority of computation happens at training phase, processing and then prediction still takes decent amount of compute power. Small embedded systems with a good GPU to handle matrix operations are necessary while not being power hungry monsters.\n\nYour other question is a bit vague: What do you mean \"friend or foe system\" for \"recognizing yourself\"?",

The simplest way to detect front and back is to add asymmetric markers to each robot, like a colored patch on one end or distinct shapes, so orientation can be inferred from the contour or marker positions. For friend or foe, you can give your robot a unique color pattern or fiducial marker and track that specifically, which avoids relying on pure shape detection.\n\nSince you are new to CV, I would start with basic color thresholding and contour detection in OpenCV before jumping into anything fancy. Real time performance in C++ should be fine if your frame size and processing pipeline stay reasonable. The biggest challenge will probably be lighting consistency and tuning thresholds, not the math itself.",

At some point you might specialize, but right now you just need experience using programming to solve any problem at all. \n2. Honestly C is an old language and not many working programmers today would choose it unless it was a very niche thing. The main reason is that C programs are relatively tricky for things like memory management and concurrency. C also doesn't have many features that modern languages have. That is actually why I mentioned Rust, which meant as a kind of modern C replacement. Rust is similar to C, but it has many cool features and still is very fast and runs \"close to the metal\" like C does.\n   * The general answer to the question of \"what is good to write in C (or Rust)?\" is: anything that has to run very fast and/or in limited environments like embedded systems (eg raspberry pi)\n   * a different answer could be a math-heavy problem. Something that uses a lot of data and does a lot of calculations on it very fast.\n3. Creating your own language is a great thing to try. I suggest trying it after you have learned a few different ones. After all, how will you know what kind of language you want to build if you have never experienced writing any language?\n4. I'm not sure I can answer the core of the creative block problem. I first got into programming because I wanted something to exist that didn't. I had a problem and the only way to solve my problem was to write a program to solve it. I'm not sure how you would come from the other direction, with a solution in search of a problem. I guess my advice to think about what you wish existed.\n5. Finally, I would not worry about \"knowing what you need to know.\" When I started with my problem I knew nothing at all. You will learn what you need to know as you go step by step through the problem you're trying to solve. At each step you will not know what to do, and you'll figure it out by searching, then you'll move on to the next step and repeat the process over and over until the problem is solved.",

        "body": "Generally, high vs low level, and interpreted vs compiled are 2 completely different aspects of a programming language. The definition of high and low level languages has shifted over the years as we have developed more and more languages. But strictly speaking, a high level language is any language that abstracts away any specific hardware details. This means that pretty much every programming language falls into the category of “high level”, with the exceptions of assembly and machine code “languages” (if you could call machine code a language). This means that even languages like C, are considered a high level language. This is because when you write C, you do not need to consider the specific characteristics of the hardware your code will be running on. As long as a compiler exists for a target system, your C code will run largely the same on any system (assuming whatever libraries you use are similarly supported). I would say that your professor is largely correct, using this historical definition of high and low level language. However I would add the asterisk that some projects, most notably Linux, have plenty of source code written by humans in assembly. In this case, the assembly is still source code, but is still a low level language since it is dependent on the hardware it will run on. (In large projects like Linux, this often looks like writing the same functionality multiple times in assembly for each target hardware system. So while C code largely only has to be written once, you may find multiple implementations of the same functionality in multiple assembly languages)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language\n\nHowever, this distinction has somewhat shifted over the years and people some times use more relative terms like “high*er*” and “low*er*” level programming languages. These refer to how close or far to the hardware your language is abstracted away. So this means that while C is technically a high level language, it is often perceived as “low*er*” level than something like python. You’ll even see some people say that C is generally a “low*er*” level language. However these distinctions are largely semantic and don’t have much real meaning, especially when you’re first learning. I would not get caught up on these.\n\nThe difference however between an interpreted and compiled language is completely different, and also in the modern day, much more complex. Generally speaking, an interpreter is any program that takes as an input some source code, and executes it without first compiling it to machine code. (Ripped from the first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))) A compiler is then any program that takes source code in one language as an input, and outputs code in another language. However, almost always, this looks like translating a higher level language, into a lower level language, typically from a strictly high level language, into a strictly low level language (like C -> assembly).\n\nSo the 2 concepts are somewhat related, but there is no exact relationship between them. Modern compilers and interpreters are much more complex and have many stages that translate source code through many different levels of abstraction. And, modern programming languages have started blurring the lines between what is seen as higher level and lower level.",

You might write a `mov` statement, but which specific instruction you get is dependent on it's parameters.\n\nHigh level languages target abstract machines and are portable. C++, for example, targets an abstract, byte addressable stack machine, two's compliment signed integers, little-endian, etc. So byte offset and bit manipulation on up - calling conventions, etc, all that is beyond the language, and must be defined by the implementation. So if your machine is word-addressable, the compiler has to translate byte addressing into words in some way.\n\nLanguages can affect architecture; C++03 is THE DEFINITION of the x64 Itanium ABI, and is standard for the hardware, which was designed around it. That doesn't some how lower the level of the language on that particular platform.\n\nSo it doesn't matter if the language is compiled or interpreted.

This raises my hackles and plants a giant red flag for me with you.\n\nGame Developer jobs are unstable and pretty overpopulated with individuals fighting for those positions. It is also the top underpaid and underappreciated markets for developers to be in. People get laid off all of the time because a game got cancelled, the company was absorbed by another company or the game is complete and they have no more work for you.\n\nI'm going to be real with you, I don't think you are cut out for game development based off your post and I don't think you are cut out to be a developer based off your post either. \n\nThe reason for this is because you will need to practice and study for a minimum of 4 years, plus have a BA degree to even be considered for entry level jobs in the field.

You can technically but it’s not a callable object which is what you’re actually asking.\n\nSo I can’t make a List or an Array and inside of that array put a function… I also can’t pass them as a parameter to be the input into another totally separate function. \n\nIn Dart or JS and most modern-ish languages a function are treated as an object just like any other data like a var or a const, so you can manipulate them the same exact way.\n\nSo if I have a function that does something to an array of numbers, an then sends those numbers out to be updated in real time, it’ll have specifics like who’s logged in, and who’s looking at what. It’ll be a huge function. But I may want to manipulate that data in a certain way before that function executes and send those numbers out.\n\nMaybe I want the numbers converted to a different currency, or rounded, or cut off any number below X or above Y, so I make my function.\n\nCoreFunction forEachItem(nums, SpecialBehaviorFunction5) and then the rest of that function.\n\nI may have 14 different “special behavior functions” that I’m going to use, and that gets passed to this core function 5000 times a minute.\n\nSo this makes writing and compositing the code way easier and way easier to think about as well because I don’t have a ton of classes or function sitting around scattered. I’ve got the core function, the special behavior function, and some function that decides what special behavior function to pass to the core function.\n\nThat’s the easiest way I can explain it for now but I’ll keep thinking for a concrete example.",

Depends on where you actually land up .. 1) There is sales team which helps in bidding new clients and works on offers 2) Automation Testing which automates the APIS/UI so that the test suite execution verifies all the functionalities without the need of Manually Testing 3) Manual Testing 4) DEVOPS - Responsible for all the builds and production deployment using sensible devOps tools 5) Infrastructure Team which helps in setting/onboarding of Architecture Runway or platforms like PCF/Any cloud 6) Database Team which helps in Data Modelling and Design 7) Business Analyst which documents and tells Team/Developers to work on User stories etc... 7) Project Management - PM/PMO etc and many more \n\nMy suggestion pick one and go deeply. Since u already mentioned development, networking I didnt mention them in my post.",

It just points at it, thus, the sign can change to point at anything else that’s real. But the sign will never be the thing that it’s pointing at. \n\nIn C, pointers point at memory addresses. The memory houses the actual real data by (at the most basic level) cutting it into chunks where data is then housed(also called pages). \nYour pointer can point at the beginning of such chunk and then you can ask the pointer to move forward or backward through the memory to reveal the whole chunk.",

The pointer for the array stores the address of the very first element in the array - and here is where the \"0-based\" array indexing comes from. Since the elements are stored in a contiguous memory block and have a fixed size depending on the data type, it's easy to figure  out where the elements are: `base address + (index * size)`. You know the *base address* - the pointer, you know the *index* - the element you want to access, you know the *size*, which is determined by the data type. That's it.\n\nPointers are extremely useful, but more modern languages (or more modern implementations of languages) often *hide* them away from the user so that they don't have to deal with them. In C++, you have *smart pointers*, you have *references*, which are just extensions to pointers.",

It's not 100% related to your end goal, but a cheap and easy starting point. Arduino Starter Kits (including the actual Arduino system) are in the range of $50 to $100 and you get lots of hardware (sensors, LEDs, motors, etc.) to play around with.\n\nMaybe, ask also in guitar or synthesizer related subreddits, or in the embedded ones, like /r/esp32, /r/arduino, /r/esp8266, /r/nodeMCU, and so on. /r/vsti and /r/synthesizers with their related subreddits could also be viable resources.\n\nAlso, my general advice would be to focus on *learning programming* first, and there, since you will need C++ use https://learncpp.com\n\nWe normally don't suggest C++ as first language as it is a difficult language to get into. Normally, we recommend Python (with the MOOC [Python Programming 2026](https://programming-26.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki), but that would not get you in the direction you want. You'll most likely have to bite the bullet and go in the hard way.\n\nWhat you will also need are really solid mathematical foundations of higher concepts. You'll need to go into waveforms, maybe FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation), maybe DFT (Discrete Fourier Transformation), and a lot more. Synthesis and Signal Processing use higher mathematical concepts. You'll need to work with sampling intervals, ADC (Analog to Digital Converters), and DAC (Digital to Analog Converters) and much more. You'll also need to have some musical understanding about the frequencies, etc.",

Honestly the best move right now is hands-on experimentation — build a tiny audio or control project, not your dream device — because that’s where the mental model forms.

I already have a pretty solid basis in understanding sound and music on a physical level and in audio form as well, since my major is in Creative Music Technology and I've got some excellent lecturers that help me understand a lot of the electronic components and processes that make up sound and audio.\n\nYou're right though, I shouldn't get too ahead of myself and I'll definitely focus on setting up a solid foundation in C++ first and foremost before trying to interface with hardware. It'll be a couple of years before my bandmate is skilled enough to make anything that requires my input anyway, so I'll just focus on that for as long as I can.

You thus use a setter that has validation built in so you can't set it to whatever you like. Later you then prevent yourself (or someone else) from accidentally writing an incorrect or impossible value. \n\n\n2. Keeping code lean:\nSometimes variables might only be internally used in the class. I might not need to know specific information, in those cases just setting the variable private prevents it from showing up in your IDE and or documentation, keeping things leaner\n\n\n3. Magic numbers: Magic numbers (or magic strings) are plain numbers in your code. Say you want to give a spefic tag or ID to something, and you write 'var = 5;'. The '5' could be turned into a variable and made private. This to reduce magic numbers, and allow easier modification later. (hand in hand with #2) \n\n\n4. Coding standards/consistency:\nThe common pattern of private variable with a public getter/setter is used for lots of reasons (including above) Because of this sometimes it sorta makes sense to just apply this to variables that might not really benefit from the approach, just to keep your API consistent.",

Where you need to guarantee things or you have invariants etc. this can matter a lot. C doesn't have protected/private struct (same as class in C++) members, and I don't know any C programmers who particularly care, myself included. Where it is needed in languages that don't have it, you see idioms like \"pimpl\" etc. to hide things, but they also introduce runtime overhead. It's nice to have compile-time enforcement without runtime cost. It can be very handy when refactoring not to have references to member data everywhere too.\n\nI've tried not to lecture on encapsulation because you can find that anywhere online.\n\nSide note: it's rarely useful to use private over protected. Protected will encapsulate whilst allowing you to derive without having to change code in the base (from private to protected). In the common case you want derived classes to have access to things in their base class.",

Your requirements are specified by the professor and do not change. *At worst*, the professor will provide an additional assignment that requires you to build upon your existing work (and this is steadily becoming rarer because we continue to lower our standards in CS programs).\n2. Maintenance of the project lasts for approximately one term, at which point your code goes into a folder with all the other projects, never to be touched again.\n3. The only people who will use your code are yourself and maybe some groupmates.\n\nSo - fixed requirements, short timeframes, with no customers. Let's change that.\n\n---\n\nPeople dispute exactly when the C++ standard library became \"the standard library,\" but cppreference says 1992, and that sounds pretty reasonable. This breaks all three of the above items:\n\n* Its requirements change over time because the platforms and operating systems that people use will change. \n* The maintenance time is indefinite (34 years and counting, and despite the hype over Rust on this site, extremely likely to be another 34 years and counting).\n* Billions of people depend on it, however indirectly (literally everyone with a web browser).\n\nIf you read the code for, say, `std::istream`, you're going to find A Gigantic Mess. You care about none of that. You care about the [public methods specified by the standard](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream.html), which should not change. And, indeed, they generally have not changed for the 30+ years that this language has existed, and they probably won't change much in the next 30 years.\n\nAt the same time, people are always looking to eke out more performance. If they find a tool to get more performance, they are going to use it. They might not care, despite their better judgment, that they are taking advantage of an implementation detail that could change at any time. This tendency is summed up as [Hyrum's Law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/), which states\n\n> With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.\n\nAccess specifiers establish boundaries. If you make something public, that **locks the maintainers** into preserving that thing for all time (30 years and counting. Choose wisely!) Making it private means that you can mess with it however you want. Change it every version if you want. All changes to `public` are breaking changes and will likely get you roundly cursed 30 years from now.",

In many languages this problem is addressed much more simply with phantom types.\n\nCorrectness-by-construction only stretches so far. It gets more expensive to maintain as you try to enforce more and more complex properties. At some point it becomes better to insert runtime checks and trust your test suite.\n\nI can’t help you with a misplaced sense of personal guilt (see a therapist if that’s a common theme in your life) but I can say that you’re taking the wrong approach here. Code’s correctness is multifaceted; complex code may feel safer, but it’s also more likely to contain bugs due to its complexity. A type system is indeed a static analysis tool, but static analysis is only one tool in the toolbox. Maybe focus on unit testing for a bit and explore property-based testing as a cheaper alternative to becoming overwhelmed with your own designs.",

        "body": "> Do you think AI is just a bubble that will eventually burst? \n\nIt's actively bursting and this is a very hot conversation going on right now. With the new year, people are really dissecting annual reports of publicly traded companies, and after ~5 years of this bubble, no major player has reported a positive ROI on AI software integration. Not one.\n\nWe're seeing ~$22 billion in technical debt created by AI, because the slop they generated can't be understood by people. This is important, because the industry is finally really coming around to understand - you can't hold AI accountable.\n\nIf a corporation loses shareholder value, causes damages, or kills people, C-levels and employees can be held personally accountable. There was a time I was responsible for 60% of all option trading on Earth, can you just imagine the concrete shoes I'd be wearing at the bottom of some lake right now if I allowed AI to speak on my behalf? Where did all the money go? I dunno, Boss; I asked the AI and they don't know, either. How does this work? I dunno, Boss, the AI made it, and every time I ask, it remakes it in a different way...\n\nWe're also seeing the employment pendulum swing the other way. That technical debt we've accrued so far is going to take a decade to un-fuck, and we're still going with it, so there will be work for the rest of MY career...\n\nAnd things lag, so there's still a feeling of uncertainty that everyone is acting on, and employers are taking advantage of that while they can by offering low wages since it's still a saturated, employer's market. As the employee market dries up, those salaries are going to pick back up. That things are actively changing isn't a secret, if you know where to look and who to ask.\n\n> Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?\n\nI'm not quite sure how to interpret this one, yet. Businesses thought they'd replace junior level work with AI, but that means entry level positions would be essentially senior architect roles, basically what you're suggesting - and how can you do that without the experience?\n\nSo AI has caused some damage, and there will be a gap in employee demographics as we took a whack at 5 years of college grads who didn't find their footing in the middle of this bungling market experiment. They'll all be off into other markets, or set back from missing 5 years critical experience. If you've invested 5 years into something else while this market figures its shit out, you're probably better off sticking to that, rather than finally kick-starting a late career.\n\n> I see that companies are mostly hiring senior engineers these days, but if there aren't enough junior engineers, who will they hire are seniors in the future? ( sorry if this sounds silly ) \n\nThat's a very real question, and the answer is they're going to pay out the ear for the mistake, in the long run.\n\nCompanies are hiring seniors for two reasons:\n\n1) Trump. He's a bad actor, a Russian asset; he has grifted and pilfered this government and economy, intentionally destroyed it in ways that cannot be explained by economics or incompetence alone, and he's such a wildcard, that everyone is just buckling down and hoping to survive this administration, until we can get back to \"business as usual\". And to conservatives and authoritarians of the regime who disagree - you're evil.\n\n2) Corporate interest rates went up from 0% 3 years ago, and then the massive layoffs started happening. It wasn't due to AI. Zero interest corporate loans are federal subsidies to grow the economy. You fork off a subsidiary of your conglomerate, spend the money, develop the tech, and when the money runs out, you fold the subsidiary tied to the loan - taking the debt with it. But the parent company keeps all the IP. This scheme is over for FAANG, but not for smaller corporations - so expect some underdog success stories.\n\n> how will software work envolve in the future?\n\nAI won't go anywhere. But like outsourcing to a Sally Struthers country for pennies on the dollar, you don't outsource anything actually important. It has to be able to fail to deliver, or do what it's supposed to, and that has to be OK. It can be an aid, if it can generate simple code that is faster to verify than it is to write. It'll be useful for refactoring, permuting, generating (but not implementing) protocols, other things.\n\n> What should we learn to day to avoid getting stuck in the future?\n\nStick to the fundamentals. Get good at math. The one thing AI can never do is think, and that's on you to learn.",

The skills are not really different, using an LLM as a small help in coding is not really a skill you need to learn. You need to know how software works, how to write and evaluate it etc. just as we did back before LLMs were big. AI doesn't enable you to build more complex software, it helps you do the easy things slightly faster (sometimes(TM)). ",

If you're going web, Java isn't going to enter the picture unless you're designing something with a front end communicating with a back end, which, again, is probably too ambitious as a starting point. So choose a platform for your UI and figure out how to mock something up that looks vaguely like what you want the game to look like. It doesn't need to be pretty, you can always revisit and iterate as you learn. So your ui might just be a playing field and a row of cards at the bottom to start. \n\nThen define your game rules -- simple rules are fine for starters. \"Cards have a cost assigned to them and a player can only play cards they have the necessary resources to play\" for example.

Controlling the playback with an on-screen UI moght need more complex software but if no control is needed a simple script might work.\n\nThe raspberry pi doesn't normally have power controls though so it will be continuously playing even when the TV is off. But as a \"dumb\" video player that your parents only need to switch to HDMI to watch,, it could work.",

Can you build more complicated things? Can you build the same things, but faster? Are you better at fixing bugs, even though you've stagnated learning \"new\" coding things? Can you speak to other devs using tech speakers that would confuse non devs more fluently? Does your code from a month ago embarrass you due to how amateur it looks to your eyes today?\n\nThat stuff is what programming is. Coding is just a means to an end, if coding disappeared tomorrow, developers would still exist to translated client ideas in some form or another into something a computer can understand. We only use code because its the best way to do that, and a huge difference between a fast dev and a slow dev is that the fast dev doesnt think about syntax at all, they think of concepts and type out what needs to be typed without thinking because they've done that a million times. Thats like 90% of coding. Leetcode isnt bad, but its not a gauge of your skill as a developer. \n\n\nAnd if the slow dev can research how to do something that a fast dev cant figure out ever, that slow dev is a thousand times more valuable. You can improve your Leetcode all you want, itll never prove your ability to research your way out of a tricky situation, which is much more important of a skill than coding ever has been",

        "body": "So are you suggesting that when testing, you're not entering your first condition when you think you should?\n\nWell, that implies your score is greater than 0 and less than 100.\n\n    if(!(score > 0 && score < 100))\n\nMind you, both 0 and 100 are typically valid percents, your code excludes them. Your condition should probably be:\n\n    if(!(score >= 0 && score <= 100))\n\nThis is greater-than-or-equal-to and less-than-or-equal-to. You could simply further with an inversion:\n\n    if(score < 0 || score > 100)\n\nThis is probably what you were thinking of, and it didn't work, and you didn't realize you needed a logical OR instead of the logical AND, so the inversion seemed to mostly work.\n\nYou should also move your check for `score` directly under the input for `score`. WHY would you input a grade if the score is wrong? The two variables are independent and you're going to quit anyway. Quit early.\n\nThat also means DON'T declare your grade variable until AFTER you validated your score input. The variable doesn't need to be in scope where you're not using it.\n\nSome other bits:\n\nThis:\n\n    cout <<\n\nImplies this:\n\n    using namespace std;\n\nDon't do that. Prefer to use the longer form. We're not programming on punch cards, so we're not trying to save on just a couple characters. Typing quickly becomes the insignificant part of the job. The rule is - if you know exactly what you want, then specify it exactly. Namespaces are not just a \"simple\" organizational indirection, it has some frankly arcane effects on how the compiler resolves symbols. A \"collision\" isn't oh, I named something in my own code `cout`, guess I'll have to rename it... No - a collision is when you correctly compile against the wrong code, and the program correctly does the wrong thing. Usually you won't even notice these bugs at first. They're insidious as fuck.\n\nI don't know if you've covered switches yet, but that would simplify your grade letter check:\n\n    switch(std::toupper(LetterGrade)) {\n    case 'A':\n    case 'B':\n    case 'C':\n    case 'D':\n    case 'F': break; // All the letters above \"fall through\" to here, where we break, because there's nothing to do.\n    default:\n      std::cout << \"Invalid letter grade\";\n      return 0;\n    }\n\nPrefer to use brackets around scopes:\n\n    if ( score < 60) {\n      std::cout << \"Failed the homework assignment\";\n    } else if ( score >= 60 && score <=69) {\n      std::cout << \"phew...barely made it, D\";\n    }\n\nThis is a common source of bugs. Most languages, scoping is a hard requirement, but we inherit from C, which was trying to save space on punch cards, so... We're stuck with a syntax that tolerates very error prone implied scoping.\n\nAlso, if you have an `if/else` chain like you do, always prefer to have a final `else` statement. You can achieve this by inverting your code. Test for an A first, on down, and everything 60 and below is implied as an F - there's your final `else` clause. Coding standards for critical systems code often requires this, if you ever want to get into that.\n\n    cin >> score;\n\nAlways check your inputs:\n\n    if(std::cin >> score) {\n      do_stuff_with(score);\n    } else {\n      error_handle(std::cin);\n    }\n\n`operator >>` and `operator <<` both return the stream. The stream can be evaluated as a `bool`, it's built into the type (this is something you can do in the future with your own types, it's called operator overloading, streams overload the cast operator to `bool`). This is equivalent to FIRST extracting to `score` AND THEN calling:\n\n    if(!(std::cin.bad() || std::cin.fail())) {\n\nThe stream is stateful - it stores the result of the previous IO attempt, so the stream can tell you if the last operation succeed or not. You could also write:\n\n    std::cin >> score;\n    if(std::cin) {\n\nSo the state persists with the lifetime of the stream, and IO operations can change that state.\n\nSo if the stream returns `true`, then you have a `double` value stored in `score`. If it returns `false`, there are rules about what `score` would be, what state the stream is in and what you can do about that, but you didn't get user input, and you already have to know the state of the stream BEFORE the extraction to know even TOUCHING the `score` is safe and defined behavior... Mostly, for these exercises, if the stream is false, you just terminate the program.\n\nOutput streams can fail, too, but the bugs that come from that are usually less insidious. Input failures can lead to Undefined Behavior (UB), output failures lead to no-ops.\n\nAlso, u/SpaceAviator1999 was incorrect about some of the details regarding streams and flushing. I'm not going to pick apart the nuance of what he said, it's better to just disregard it all entirely - what he's talking about isn't your problem.",

This tends to happen naturally if you're actually applying your knowledge, but if you're very sure of certain things you want to have permanently memorized, Anki will do it faster than just about any other method.\n\nFor reference docs, you can use an AI to query them in natural language. It's not always accurate, but it can at least point you to the right section when it isn't.\n\nFor learning a language or framework, you really need to do exercises and projects with it. Work through a textbook if you can find one. If not, tutorials can work, but you need to play with it to test your understanding rather than rigidly following the steps. Version control can help with this. You can experiment faster with something like a Jupyter notebook, or at least a REPL. What's available like that depends on your language.",

Mind you, I did have zero experience besides two internships. The latter internship had me doing absolutely zero programming and not utilizing me whatsoever for programming aspects. They wanted to hire me full time but I ultimately declined the offer and began searching elsewhere. \n\nI searched for about 10 months and was at just under ~600 applications sent out till I a recruiter (miraculously) hit me up on LinkedIn and the rest was history. Those numbers concerning the amount of interviews and phone screens you had were eerily similar to mine as well with 20 or so callbacks, 12 phone screens, and 4 second round interviews with 1 offer. \n\nWhich city did you ultimately get the offer in if you don’t mind me asking?",

Don't give up!",

They really have no idea how to adapt to different and smaller companies. I worked at company that hired a bunch of former telecom folks and built up such a bureaucracy of middle managers that I was attending 2 hours of meetings a day just to provide status updates to 4 different middle managers. They only reason they did that is because they was just what they were used to, not because the depth and breadth of our org was doing needed it.

That might be software development, but even significant Excel work has a lot of thinking overlap with CS.\n\nAnd last - don't forget about personal and political acumen. No matter how smart or talented someone is, you can't sell a project to your managers and get it staffed if you suck at people.

The hyper successful people I know they all have bent the narrative to attribute to their work the reason of the success, when in reality they took over some other people work and were able to master the communication part and became the face associate with the outcome. Luck, network and environment are infinitely more important in these stories. Having your side project being adopted by a big tech company is more of a political game than a technical achievement. These people are masters at communicating and becoming the face of the work that stands on the shoulders of thousands of other engineers.",

All without any of the drama from overly sensitive juniors who need me to tiptoe around their feelings just to explain why xyz is a bad professional practice.\n\nI have no idea how the next generations of senior+ engineers will get the experience they need to actually be senior+ quality engineers in a world where AI is eating the junior to mid engineering roles alive, but that's an industry and C-level problem not something I can solve.

Especially employees outside your team?\n- when others start a new feature / project, are you pulled into all day meetings to help them design it even when you will not be involved in the implementation?\n- when nasty production issues arise, are you pulled in to figure out a path forward? If so, is it just for your team or is it across other teams as well?\n- do you help identify future work for your team or do you just wait for product to tell you what to do?\n- do you help management negotiate resourcing requirements for a new feature / project by doing things like creating POCs and then following up with your recommendations for an implementation plan and the amount of teams / engineers involved?\n\nThe key difference between staff/principal and senior is this ability to navigate the landscape outside your team. You are seen as a technical expert that will influence the direction of your organization, not just your team. If you’re merely leading your team by helping them break down work and reviewing their PRs, that’s senior level work, not principal/staff.\n\nSpend the time focusing on the relationships with other teams and becoming invaluable outside your team and the promotion will eventually come.",

I don’t know what it is because I presumably never worked with you, but it’s something about you that makes leadership not trust you. One thing I can tell you from your post is, stop trying so hard to chase the next level. I have seen this trap from so many different people (my self included), from juniors to staff+. \n\nI have seen people get bitter and go “I’m doing the same work as this other person, why I’m I X and they’re X+1?” But almost always, there is something that is really holding them back. I worked with one mid level once who was extremely bitter that they were not promoted to sr yet (the left amazon as a sde1 or 2, applied as a sr to my current company under the impression that they’d get promoted to sr quickly, and then quit 3 years later as still a midlevel). They were extremely difficult to work with honestly, and mostly because of that bitterness. They couldn’t take an ambiguous piece of work and deliver it. You had to really hold their hands to get them to deliver code. And it wasn’t even because they didn’t know what they we were doing, they did. It’s because they were so focused on proving themselves as sr, they fought against every single plan and needed to fight every little suggestion. They wouldn’t take any feedback, seeing feedback as a ding against their capabilities. They’d write “clever code” that was hard to read and often had edge case bugs, and if you mentioned it during a PR, then they’d just complain to the manager that I’m holding up the review. They’d publicly call out their manager when there was a decision that was made that they disagreed with. \n\nThese behaviours are what held this person back, and it’s the same kind of behaviour that I’ve seen over and over again. Often times, just focusing on what’s on your plate and delivering outstanding work there is all you need to do. And then you have a convo with your manager and say “I’ve been building great stuff here, and I want to make it to the next level, give me more work please.” Promos are often not done by just your manager, they are done by a committee. You need a manager who is both respected and willing to back you for promo, and other managers who know your name and not willing to fight against your manager to their people. If you piss of another team by being difficult, then you can be that manager is going to bring that up and it’s going to hurt you. \n\nYou need to be open and collaborative with others. Work with your manager to line up work that aligns with your strengths and weaknesses and focus on knocking those out of the park with out the expectation of promotion.",

If a company wants to be somewhere, they'll lease property.  If a company doesn't want or need to be somewhere, they'll let leases expire.  And then everything else falls into line with the leases.\n\n10 years ago, every smart CFO advocated very long leases to reduce lease rates.  Now that companies have been shown that they don't need people onsite, every smart CFO is recommending that the company only renew very essential leases and let the rest expire.  This is a corporate finance tectonic shift on par with switching to defined-contribution retirement plans (late '90's) and switching to unlimited PTO (late '00's).\n\nIf you like working there, make yourself as valuable as you can.  It still might not make the difference, but it usually does.  If your boss can say about you to their boss \"I can't succeed without this person\", then you are usually safe.  That's your goal...if you want to stay there.\n\nAnd in a few years when your company's leases expire, then leadership will say that they've discovered or realized that WFH is a vital part of work life balance or whatever stupid way they have of justifying what is ultimately a financial, lease-centric decision.",

But all the jobs I'm getting are in series-B startups, and they are completely incompatible with being a parent to a child with high needs. I actually tried, but things are just so unstable now. I got fired from a job after about 10 months despite busting my ass on it, and then the next job I found, I got laid off in about 8 months.\n\nTech careers are so all-consuming, and if you want to run a family while in one, it means you're spending a ton of money on daycare, babysitters, after-school programs, summer camps, cleaning, and meal services. You can't turn on and turn off these things at will. Like I get my kid into a pretty expensive daycare that's taking 30% of my take-home, and then I get laid off... I can't just pull her from the daycare because I currently don't have an income, and then put her back in when my income stabilises. I have significant savings, but this type of uncertainty and demands means I can't actually build enough savings while I work, and my savings get depleted fast when I'm between jobs. And I'm not actually able to be a good parent if I'm constantly worried about getting fired or laid off.\n\nAnd AI is cool, but it feels like I'm expected to be up to date on using AI in my job, and I have to spend time outside of work to explore AI and stuff. Which I really don't have the time for. \n\nSo I'm going back to school to get a teaching credential. There's a huge shortage of math and science teachers. I need something stable that offers benefits, so I'm not constantly worried about the high cost of COBRA coverage when I'm between jobs. The biggest benefit is, even if the job isn't flexible, I'm just DONE at 5pm. Even if I have to grade papers at home, it's not as cognitively demanding as being on-call at 2am when the server goes down. \n\nThere are a lot of bad things said about teaching as a profession, and I personally know lots of teachers who got sick of it and quit, just as I got sick of tech and quit. But at this point in my life, it feels like a better career choice. \n\nI still love programming, and in my spare time, I am constantly coding apps, helping friends with their startups, and consulting. I actually have the bandwidth and energy to do it because I'm not busting ass programming all day. This stuff is much easier with AI as well.",

We don’t have fewer accountants after Excel, we have accountants doing different work. Code generation tools make certain tasks faster, which means engineers tackle bigger problems or more projects, not that companies need 80% fewer engineers.\n\nThe skills that matter are shifting toward system design, understanding business problems, debugging AI-generated code, and knowing when the AI solution is wrong or suboptimal. Junior engineers who can use AI tools effectively while understanding fundamentals will outperform those who either reject AI or blindly trust it. The job becomes more about judgment and architecture than syntax.\n\nFocus on areas harder to automate: distributed systems, security, performance optimization, and domain expertise in complex fields like healthcare or finance. Build things AI can’t easily replicate yet, like deep understanding of legacy systems or cross-functional communication skills. The engineers who get displaced are those who only knew how to translate requirements into boilerplate code. \n\nNobody can predict timelines accurately, but historically tech revolutions create more jobs than they eliminate, just different ones. The transition period is uncomfortable and some roles disappear, but demand for people who can build and maintain software systems keeps growing even as the nature of that work evolves.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

As soon as we got a client in front of us it was immediately clear why they were a 6.

This brings out all the doomers. \n\nAI is very hyped up as a replacement for software engineers because good software engineers are expensive to hire and AI is very good at trivial coding tasks. \n\nBut there's at least one thing that doesn't make sense about the AI doomerism. If AI is really going to be so revolutionary and replace a ton of jobs, then there will be engineers who work on tailoring AI models to specific tasks and packaging them up into applications that non-engineers can use. That's something where humans need be involved in because it's not just going to be AI all the way down. AI is not able to handle everything with no human oversight. A human will need to be involved at each step - architecture design, setting up infrastructure, testing, monitoring, and translating the business needs into application logic. There are people who think that AI can handle all that and that CEOs will just be pushing a button telling AI to \"build this\" and it will be done without any human supervision or oversight. In reality we are nowhere near AI being capable of that.\n\nIf anything, AI is a reason to be optimistic about the future of SWE. It's not a reason to be scared. As a developer, you can learn about AI models, training them, tweaking them, and integrating them into secure and scalable applications/products. These are skills which will stay relevant for a long time. AI might lower the barrier to developing software, but that should increase the number of software projects being worked on - not decrease them. Software development has become much easier since the field was invented. We don't need to write in low level languages most of the time. There are many well established frameworks and tools that make it easy to accomplish tasks which would have taken massive amounts of work 20 or 30 years ago. And still there are more software devs than ever because there is more software being made. \n\nSo basically don't fall for the doomerism. The job market is shit right now, but it's because of the economy and most white collar type of jobs are in the same boat. We are also in the hangover phase of companies being drunk on free money for R&D and hiring SWE in a crazy frenzy. AI is going to make developers more efficient and allow for smaller teams to do more, but it's not going to wipe out the need for humans.",

Tag in the files it should pay specific attention to, especially if you know the data flow or generally where the problems exist already. \n\nWe even have several internal frameworks/libraries, and the AI has been able to use those perfectly fine due to how much usage examples there are in our codebases (or if it's not sure, it just goes into the npm modules or vendor files and checks things out itself). \n\nThis sub and other SWE-related subs love to dog on AI and claim it's not useful or not good.

Offshoring jobs to \"cheaper\" places means that those places  become less cheap over time because increasing demand for actual skilled talent which is generally not too high in supply causes salaries abroad to increase and the cost of living to likewise increase from the capital being sent there. It's the reason why tech salaries in a lot of offshore locations like Eastern Europe and Latin America have jumped dramatically in recent years. Not only that, but there's nothing really to suggest that \"expensive\" countries couldn't just lower salaries domestically. This is honestly something that everyone on these subs seem to miss and I don't know why. It may be argued that nobody in such countries would be willing to work for a fair amount less if it came to that, but if push comes to shove, I think it is reasonable to assume that there would be a lot of people willing to do so because otherwise it might mean not having a job. Also:\n\n\\> Over time, those countries will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.\n\nYeah, no that's very likely not going to happen. Apart from ex-communist nations, there's a reason that the \"cheap\" places you mentioned are low paying. I'll leave you to figure that out for yourself.",

Something in your application materials is triggering an automatic rejection before human eyes ever see them. The fact that your network connections got you interviews proves you can perform when given the chance, so the barrier is purely at the screening stage.\n\nSix resume rewrites might actually be hurting you if each version strays further from ATS optimization. Consider this: get your most recent version reviewed by someone currently hiring in tech, not just resume writers. They’ll spot what’s causing the auto-rejections. Also, gaps on your resume or the layoff itself might need different framing. Some companies filter out anyone currently unemployed, which is brutal but real\n\nYour tech stack isn’t the problem since those skills are still in demand. More likely it’s resume formatting breaking ATS parsers, missing keywords that match job descriptions exactly, or your experience level falling into an awkward middle zone where you’re overqualified for junior roles but competing with seniors.\n\nStop applying to undervalued positions immediately. That signals desperation and companies assume you’ll leave when something better appears. Focus on contract or freelance work to fill the gap while maintaining your search. Breaking the unemployment streak often unlocks opportunities faster than anything else.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

The client hated me (they were actually an extremely petty person who burned through a lot of people, so it was not solely on me). But my boss/CEO started becoming a bully towards the end of my time there. I honestly start wondering if he was just trying to make it unpleasant enough I'd quit. I do believe he's done that (or at least tried) with other people. He would start changing requirements midway through development, constantly sending extremely harassing messages, etc. It was very stressful, and I had been worried about losing my job for a while.\n\nThe company had a major issue, and suddenly, I didn't have a job any more. And it was such a great feeling. I didn't have to deal with any of their stupidity any longer. I was lucky because I had started speaking to another company casually, so I didn't have an extended period of unemployment. I did ask for a gap in start time, and I caught up a ton on sleep I had been missing out on. I make a little less now, but I'm soooo much happier. I'm working in a much healthier environment with people who just treat people decently. \n\nI did lose out money on the time I wasn't working. There's no way around that. And I know there are others who lost theirs jobs around the same time I did who I think are still looking. There's some luck in how things play out. If I hadn't found another job, on top of that one I really like, I'd probably feel very differently. \n\nThere's risk, because what happens if your partner were to lose their job? If it takes you a long time to work again (either by choice or by market), do you run the risk of alienating them? What does recovering your mental and physical health look like, and how supportive will they be? If you're just playing video games on the couch, that could cause problems in the relationship. You need to make sure you're communicating with them, and not just that you're miserable, but understand how they'd feel about you quitting your job. \n\nWhat kind of position are you in to interview? Are you too slammed to interview? Are you not prepared? Or are you not getting any interest? ",

I’m about a month into getting back into Leetcode and it’s hard. I just did two easy’s that were similar to each other, yet I still needed hints on both. I also seem to really struggle with my memory on problems. I built an SRS app for the Leetcode problems I complete just so I can remember to go back to them lol. It’s a tough battle out there, but I believe in us. Just keep studying, keep learning, and keep applying. I’ve gotten responses back from some big tech companies and some smaller random companies so far. 3 upcoming OA’s and 2 recruiter calls coming up.\n\nAlso, I think for your position and resume, you could try to pivot it as general “software engineer” or “frontend engineer”. Make sure you emphasize the languages you’re working with and try to minimize how much you mention Wordpress. I think if you can get some personal projects going that are more than just a super simple CRUD app, that would help, too. You got this!",

The engineering is up to us, not a bunch of corporate stooges and their worthless \"AI up-skilling\" powerpoints. I’ll give you a basic run down of everything important I've learned in the last year:\n\n1. Write an AGENTS.md file that gives a broad view of your repository with high level details like tech stack, folder structure, etc. Also point to which docs should be referenced if the agent needs to expand further for more details. This prompt will be injected in every conversation so keep the information broad/horizontal instead of deep/vertical.\n\n2. Learn how to sandbox your agent so you can run the agent in yolo mode and afk it. The 3 most popular options are: Claude code’s builtin sandbox mode, vscode’s dev containers, and docker’s new sandbox mode for running agents.\n\n3. Learn git worktrees so you can have agents work in the background without disrupting your normal workflow or if you want to parallelize work. (I recommend not trying to parallelize too much, most work is inter-dependent and it's usually easier to just work sequentially)\n\n4. Utilize skills and have a directory full of detailed instructions for each common task you do. For example, a frontend task that goes deep into detail on how you want your frontend code to be written. Unlike the AGENTS.md file, you want these docs to be deep and detailed. The agent will use progressive disclosure and only invoke those skills when its relevant so your context isn’t overloaded\n\n5. Learn about the ralph wiggum technique. This is essentially breaking extremely long tasks into subtasks and running the agent in a loop so that it can work on atomic tasks with a fresh context each time instead of trying to one-shot it and getting its context window trashed. This will involve: \n  - A PRD doc explaining the feature and requirements in depth.\n  - A tasks.json file with subtasks and acceptance criteria for each task.\n  - A notes.md file so that it can jot down any information that might be relevant in between tasks. \n  - And finally, a bash script to run your agent continuously.\n  - There’s some good info [here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) along with more stuff if you google ralph wiggum.\n\n6. Standard engineering practices apply. Tons of high quality tests, linters, formatters, and strict type checkers.\n\n7. Set up a way for your agent to test changes. Whether thats setting up staging environments for backend work or setting up browser automation for frontend.\n\n8. Avoid MCPs like the plague. 99.99% of them are useless and will clog your context with useless tool definitions that the agent isn’t even good at invoking. The only mcp I recommend is this for browser automation: https://github.com/remorses/playwriter (NOT THE OFFICIAL PLAYWRIGHT MCP. The official one is trash and not optimized to preserve your context window)\n\n9. Learn your agent’s plugin system and write scripts to automate tasks that should be run deterministically. Example: Writing a stop hook that executes code quality checks like I mentioned in bullet point 6.",

It was a poorly run project because everybody just wanted to do 8 hours and go home. Nobody was really trying to go all out for them. The pay wasnt the best but it was good. I would recommend DoD to anybody who likes CS but doesnt love it to want to learn new systems, new code, etc. Just wants to get their day done and go home and not htink about work. But it'sv ery easy to get behind the times and not move ahead in your career. You will get promoted pretty quickly but wont learn much really. Nobody even sends an email after 5 pm.\n\nFAANG level - when i left DoD i wanted more pay and to learn more. It was a huge culture shock. I went to cloud services. The company i worked for was known for having work life balance but I didnt ralize cloud is where that dies. It was super competitive. A SWE2, did twice as much work as a senior at DoD did. I made good money but god it sucked. Seniors and up were so booked they had no time to help juniors. Reviews were not based on what was expected it was based on how you compared ot your coworkers. I literally got in my review, \"his coworkers do more than him\" becaus ei didnt work 60 hour weeks like osme of them. That wasnt the reason but whne most are doing 60 and you are doing 40 it shows in the work. I got laid off and honestly didnt even miss it. If you werent sending emails or getting at calls at like 8pm you were behind. It felt like you always had to be available. \n\nBig tech - i got a job in big tech and was making more than i was at FAANG. Honestly it's been great because the work is meanigful, i work for a cloud service that's big but not as big as the faang one. But because it's not as big, nobody feels overworked. For the first ime iin years i had people say \"dude it's 6pm go home\". It's a good level of feeling like youa re doing meaningful work and not feeling like you have to work 60 hours to keep up. \n\n  \nSo i will say, even if the work isnt as meaningful or worldwide as FAANG, you can definetely work at places and do meaningful work. Every company to some degree is meaningful, just some more than others. ",

A lot of people believe LLMs are the silver bullet from that and can eventually replace human support agents. However banks also have to deal with a lot of regulation and tend to have a mountain of internal controls which hamstring their AI efforts. There's still a lot of ML being done at a bank in other areas including credit scoring, risk modeling, and fraud or anomaly detection; but it's not groundbreaking stuff and honestly it's kind of a solved problem at this point so you don't hear much about it.\n\nMy personal take is if you want to actually do ML engineering you should aim higher than ML at a bank.",

Because of this belief, along with the price of LLMs (for now) everyone is just implementing the existing offering because it is seen as a \"no-brainer\".\n\nIt is my belief that this will not continue.\n\nFirstly, the prices of LLMs will go up, how much by? No-one outside of those companies know definitively.\n\nSecondly, LLMs are shit and need constant monitoring and verification, which most people don't do and even fewer do well. This will cause (and probably already is causing) quite a lot of very avoidable pitfalls and designs.\n\nThirdly, LLMs discourage you from thinking, just about anything. There has not been a single study that has proven the opposite, only this point.\n\nSo I guess to answer your question, everyone is lying about ML at the moment because LLMs are a cash cow the likes of which hasn't been seen for quite a while; far wider reaching than crypto or similar fads.\n\nThings will change though one way or another.\n\nAlso, any of you cock wombles who want to tell me I'm wrong, I will be ignoring you unless you can back up your claims with data.\n\nEdit: changed AI to LLMs",

It’s common to see a PHD or masters as a prerequisite on job listings, let alone just a relevant bachelors.

So the degree requirement is part of a generalised move to standardise data science and put a level of assurance to baseline expectations of skills. \n\nIn addition, AI has obviously changed the hiring field and a big concern of employers is hiring someone shit that is propped up by AI.

Then they flew people who did well on the interview to California for a long weekend, with the first day giving presentations on different departments in the company, then after lunch a 4 hour programming test.  The next day there were interviews in the morning.  Early afternoon they met with people one on one and gave some of us a job offer, put some people on a maybe list, and gave others no offer.  Then an optional group activity in the afternoon, a nice dinner with the people who got offers.

I used to do interviews for a company, and they gave us zero visibility into what the candidate experience was. It was just \"here's a resume, interview this person, let us know what you think.\" No guidance, not much communication, etc. I've also worked at some companies where I did a pair interview with executives who would just say, \"I'll let you lead,\" because they didn't bother to look at the person's resume. We've also dealt with situations where online tests didn't work, or the prompts/questions were wrong. Maybe you can attribute those to just accidents happening/human error, but there are definitely people who simply don't care. ",

No AI allowed otherwise.\n\nMy startup is just me currently, but I'd probably white list tools I've personally vetted to not suck and be open to suggestions.

You may say having the TV on is equally as distracting, but for me it seems to quiet all the other noise.\n\nI can easily get in to a \"flow state\" with the TV on in the background, but it is so much harder for me if i know I'm working in \"complete silence\". \n\nSo at the end of the day you know you the best.

As far as what you do, for most engineering positions it’s working on internal libraries, tooling, execution, order routing systems. My role involving pulling market data off co-located switches/servers, so I often felt like a network engineer. We also maintained all of our own servers, so a lot of the work is around maintaining / migrating those. Not a whole lot of cloud being used due to obvious reasons for HFT. Did I enjoy it? It’s a job. I loved being surrounded by the smartest working on hard problems in a competitive industry. I enjoyed having to think about computers at a low-level, digging into OS internals to write the fastest C++ code. But it’s not incredibly meaningful if that matters to you and I felt like my skills were becoming highly specialized—a good thing if you want to stay in trading your whole life, but the longer you stay the harder it may be to jump into a different space. For example, you won’t have any experience creating a product for real users. I do think most of these places offer some of the best jobs you can find that balance pay and work/life. Also, it being so specialized may help you avoid the layoffs that plague other tech jobs. It’s more like finance than tech in that way.",

Very rarely do I do more than that.\n- Pay is very good, although structured unusually. Bonuses are annual and start (for QDs) around 50% of salary and go up from there. I've seen around 1000% in a good year - your base salary ends up being fairly irrelevant at some point.\n- Promotions are not a thing. No one cares about titles and your title typically doesn't change at all. Base salary raises are rare and typically have nothing to do with you, and more to do with keeping up with market trends.\n- It's a job? I wouldn't do it if I didn't need to make money, but it's pretty good for a job. The people I work with are generally very smart and pretty helpful, which goes a long way.",

        "body": "tl;dr; keep looking, this is at best a lateral move if not a step down.\n\nContext: I have \\~20 YOE and currently am/have been in a senior US technology leadership role at small/medium-sized companies (40+ FTE reports in my area). I oversee software engineering, IT, DevOps, cybersec, and technical support/solutions teams which sounds very similar to what you're describing.\n\n>I’m a backend software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience\n\n>I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role\n\nFor starters, you are not market-competitive as a \"senior engineer\". Lots of differences in how titles are interpreted, but you are unlikely to place into a senior engineer position at a company with good engineering talent; you just haven't seen enough / could be trusted with important problems. I would be aiming for a mid-level position if I were you. I bet you *are* the most technical, talented person in your org, but this sounds like a \"big fish in a small pond\" situation; you will realize how impressive the talent out there is once you leave this pond.\n\n>I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.\n\nGood instincts; this is my read as well. You need to move on from this company or you *will* plateau.\n\n>The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes.\n\nThis sounds identical to what my org calls \"Solutions\". A typical solutions specialist/engineer has a CS degree from a small school or comes from a nontraditional background (bootcamp, self-taught, etc.). Required to code and know SQL, but isn't trusted to build customer-facing products from scratch. Much of their work is being responsive to customer demands; support tickets, onboarding new customers, code changes that are often formulaic / pattern repetition, etc.\n\n>They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.\n\n...and this is exactly how I sell folks on doing the work, and getting paid less for it. I pitch the variety of tasks they have, how much they can learn technically and about our products. It's not *wrong* but it's also not saying the quiet part out loud: you aren't trusted to be a *full* software engineer, nor do we want to pay for that for this position.\n\nHave people successfully transferred to a full Software Engineer position from our Solutions org? Absolutely, and I love enabling that move. But due to classic company issues, it's very hard to pay them the same as their peers vs. an external direct hire.\n\n>What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.  \nEDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.\n\nIMO if you're good at what you do, bet on yourself. Don't rely on a \"down the road\" transfer/promotion. Find a company that thinks you're good *now* and is willing to give you that responsibility and compensation. Even if they think you're ready in 6-12 months they might still delay on a move because you've proven yourself invaluable to their \"support\" organization and they don't have a backfill ready.\n\n>There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.\n\nI would ask them to go directly into a SE role instead of the support role, or else walk and keep looking.\n\n>Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?\n\nCaveat to all of the above: if you are not in the US and you live in a country where employment opportunities are scarce, you might need to toss all of my advice and take the job anyway. For example, if you live in Pakistan and are having trouble finding *any* job that is technical and pays reasonably well, this might be your best angle to transition into something better. I can't speak to your personal job market situation; my advice is based around what I know best (US labor market and you have authorization to work).",

Going all in on CS when you're feeling burnt out and discouraged is not the play. Up your income now, and if time permits, or you start to regain some energy and focus, you can continue on the software grind.\n\nI think finding opportunity anywhere is the key for success - up the sales at this store your paycheck grows.

As you start to experience your work-life, you'll start to get an idea of what I mean here.\n\nManagement is not necessarily for everyone, but who knows, this could end up being something you really enjoy. It could come with long hours, but it could also give you the perfect WLB such that you can \"work to live\".\n\nAnyways, there's nothing that 100% says you're locked out of tech if you take the management job. Your income is tied to your ability to sell. You could very possibly leverage your technical skillset to improve sales, in which case it is a stepping stone to later jumping into tech.
