Ofc there’s a factor where you can do rust/cpp bindings but in general it’s more to do with how python is much more user friend interactive scripting language.

You kinda have to enjoy learning, adapting to new tech, new data sources, shifting business needs, all of it.

It’s a lot to keep in your head.\n\nThat said, I still love it. The newer tools are genuinely interesting, and AI is opening up some cool possibilities. Business folks need someone to make sense of the data chaos, and it’s pretty satisfying to be the one who stitches it together into something useful.\n\nI’ve been director-level for about 15 years and managed to stay pretty hands-on until recently. Even now, I try to keep up so I can actually lead effectively, and I’ll jump at any excuse to write some code just to stay sharp (and maybe flex a bit for the team!).\n\nIf you’re losing passion, I’d seriously look at changing projects or orgs before bailing on the field. A good team and leadership that encourage experimentation and improvement make a huge difference. It’s still a solid career, and one underrated perk is that data folks tend to be closer to business goals and strategy than pure app devs. That context keeps things interesting, at least for me and if you can find a good company to work for.",

Here I'm getting exposure (although 0 mentorship 🙃) in data modeling and basic ETL work (raw data > report data) and some more technical tools like GitHub and cloud platforms \n\nOnce I've done that a couple years, I think I'd be better equipped to explore Data Engineering \n\nBut then again, I might be setting the bar arbitrarily high for myself since some folks do jump straight into DE\n\nI don't have a comp sci background so I came into the field with next to 0 background knowledge \n\nOn the \"which is more valuable\" front. Technical skills are a commodity. Don't bank on those. The gag is that project management, communication, strategic thinking and relationship building are where the real unfair advantage is in your career in my humble opinion \n\nAnd nothing is guaranteed. Your CEO may go do Ayahuasca somewhere one weekend and lay off the whole company on Monday because his spirit guide told him to lmao 🤣 \n\nAlways be ready to pivot",

Jupyter is a notebook that allows you to create cells that can be markdown, python code, or even R code. You can execute each cell individually or in order and create a whole program where the documentation, code, and results exist. Databricks uses these notebooks as scheduled tasks where you can code out an entire data pipeline and put the execution of the notebook on a schedule. Otherwise called an Orchestrator\n\nFrom here we can then introduce other resources we might need, like spark, which introduces spark data frames (a table) which then you can do transformations on the data using the spark infrastructure. It offers a way to process large amounts of data on multiple nodes with a ton of confidence that your job won't die. \n\nBut then what if your data is a bunch of little jobs that come in from multiple sources, then you might want to adopt a streaming service like Kafka or redis. Each one of your data sources can publish data to the stream, then you can set up spark to consume those messages to process it. Then you can set up a notebook that will check the stream for new data and fire off a new spark job to process the data, or just quit if there's no data available to process. The notebook could also take the results and handle uploading it to the database, or make a nice graph, or whatever you need it to do\n\nI could go on, but each one of those resources has a specific use that you should get familiar with. The first time you use them it will be difficult. The 50th time will not be so hard. If you have trouble try to make a flow chart where you will use each technology and keep the details high level.",

Only now they have to adhere to the product owners whims as to how they do things in the product, and how the product owner wants them to do ingestion etc. \n\nOf course this all happens in IT, and the business users who hold all of the business knowledge (how the data is used) are still outside of IT, and the datawarehouse people who could previously work with them directly are now no longer allowed to do so and have to prepare data that is WAY worse to work with for the analysts than what they had in the datawarehouse.",

But they aren't generally technical users and there was no governance or standards. And all the data became siloed. \n\nThe central DE team is working to unsilo the data. Our goal is to eventually create data standards and enforce them so the data is actually a good quality. This is a slow process, but I'm optimistic. \n\nThe central BI team does seem to have a problem with scale. At my company, most of the functional users don't have BI experts and can't use PBI - at least nowhere near the quality that the BI team does. However, the BI team moves quite slowly to produce the reporting. The result is that functional teams build their own custom, low governance, reporting off the centralized data out of necessity. By the time BI develops the right tools, the business doesn't need it anymore and doesn't want to switch. \n\nMy untested idea is to give the business access to easy to use cloud based dashboarding tools (like Sigma for example). Then BI provides support, underlying data models, and connectivity to non enterprise grade sources like SharePoint. \n\n\nIn short, decentralizing everything without governance cannot work. Centralizing everything without a plan to scale cannot work. A data mesh is the tightrope that attempts to balance this. It is probably the right answer, but the degree of decentralization depends on the company.",

In reality, the vast majority of companies do not. \n\n\nThe key is to not throw out the baby with the bath water.

Data warehouse, data mart, self serve bi, data lake, data mesh, lakehouse. It’s just an evolution of trying to solve the same(ish) problem. \n\n\nIn conclusion, use what serves you, throw away what doesn’t, take the labels and buzzwords with a grain of salt, and remember that ultimately you are always solving business problems, not data problems.",

We didn’t say we were implementing Data Mesh because few outside IT knew about it or understood it. Instead, our aim was to modernize the data platform, speed up delivery of technical solutions, and empower the business with self-service capabilities and less reliance on the IT organization.\n\nWe were successful in many areas while other elements remained a challenge. For example, we migrated the two largest data platforms from on-premises, self-hosted and managed servers, to native services in the public cloud. Later, we built “lakehouse” capabilities on top of the public cloud platform. These included data governance features, automated data security, and data domains built for key areas of the business such as human resources, marketing, supply chain, etc. The benefits were quite profound. Within the first 2 years we had empowered 50+ business teams. Between year 1 and year 2 we saw 500% growth in teams able to use their data and the platform to create things that matter. Business teams recognized improved decision-making across the enterprise, increased efficiency and cost savings, accelerated speed-to-value for data product creation, and secure data sharing between teams.\n\nWhile we experienced success, the challenges were many. Some teams thought the changes were just another fad IT came up with. Given their prior experiences they were honestly justified in thinking that. Other teams were interested but couldn’t get their leadership to buy in or they didn’t have enough technical chops to harness their domain data on their own. They continued to rely on central IT. Other business teams were so focused on their own projects and demands they simply couldn’t make the initial shift. They asked us to come back later. A thru line that helped in most situations was having clear executive leadership support (CIO, CEO, CDO, and others). They would knock down roadblocks where needed and help provide resources when we got stuck.\n\nAfter 3 years in the journey one thing was abundantly clear. Technology was not the largest challenge. People and culture were. It took tremendous energy to cast the vision and bring people and teams along with us. This required persistent communication with all business teams and clear demonstration of the value of public cloud through demos, pilots, and “soft releases” of products, apps, and services. The technical teams (platforms, cloud, data, security) all became storytellers if they weren’t already. \n\nTo this day I don’t call the transformation a “data mesh implementation.” But we certainly knew of and studied Data Mesh and sought to implement core principles it espoused: self-service, decentralized data domains/ownership, data governance, and a focus on data product creation within business teams.",

You need very clean, very well tagged, very well modelled data. The example I always give is that if you go to the table marked “sales” and count the number of sales…. That is not even remotely correct. Years of schema evolution, changes to products, and poor engineering mean the actual number is much harder to derive. \n\nFor conversational analytics, the prompts must be very carefully tuned and the AI will straight up invent things if you aren’t careful. I would not trust it in the least.\n\nFor the CoSQL model, I haven’t tried to use it, but I notice that solution architects are suggesting I use it rather than curating dbt so I can use that to control our transformation logic. In that regard, it’s a complete distraction and a massive net-negative.\n\n“We don’t have working data products” is the same problem we have had for years and it’s the same problem that will make AI tools harder to implement even if they are viable, but it’s far too unsexy an issue to attract attention.\n\nI am hoping that if I can make clear the dependency that AI has on working data products it might get me the resources and tooling I have needed all along.",

Since a lot of human knowledge is embedded in text, this gives us quite a good basis to create large langauge models that can mirror quite a bit of that knowledge. However, large language models are not very good at doing abstract reasoning on anything other than text, which includes a lot of the work you do as an analyst by traslating some fuzzy business logics to maths, at least for anything nontrivial beyond textbook problems. You may attempt to alleviate this somewhat by providing good metadata for context, but my experience is that this doesn't really solve the problem and i very much doubt this will improve untill we get a different class of models all together as the \"more data+larger models\" approach yields diminishing returns due to sublinear scaling of LLMs wrt. data and size.\n\nNote: you should take everything i say with a grain of salt, as i am a practitioner using LLMs and my formal training is in physics, not NLP.",

The hard part isn't the LLM at all; it's the systems and guardrails around it.\n\nIf someone wants to roll their own, the pieces that actually matter are:\n\n**1) Explicit semantic layer**\n\nYou can't let the agent figure out business logic because it's incapable. Metrics, joins, definitions, and edge cases have to be defined in dbt models, semantic views, or a metadata layer\n\nIf you don't, you run the inevitable risk of fluent nonsense from the LLM. (Variance will get you eventually)\n\n**2) A constrained query surface** (Especially important if you're giving the agent to end users)\n\nDon't let the model generate raw SQL and hope for the best.  \nRestrict it to: A verified query library / A constrained DSL / Parameterised patterns.  \nThis removes a huge amount of hallucination and makes failures actually diagnosable.\n\n**3) Feedback loop/flywheel**\n\n**This is** ***critical.***\n\nYou need traces of every input, generated query, and failure mode so you can see:\n\n* Where the semantic layer is missing context\n* Which inputs result in varied rather than consistent outputs (not reliable + potentially incorrect)\n* Where the agent is making the same wrong assumptions repeatedly\n\nWithout that loop, you cannot really improve the agent, but with it, you can patch gaps, clarify metrics, and improve the agent's ability over time.\n\nThat’s the main stuff people underestimate when they say “just add an agent”.\n\nFor full disclosure, I've ended up building this approach into a full product called Inconvo that helps teams develop their semantic layer and includes built-in query guardrails and feedback loop tracing.\n\nAlso, for those data engineering teams being asked to build this for customer-facing use cases (pretty common these days and a huge ask!) Inconvo has an API and integrations so data engineers can focus on data correctness instead of auth, UI, and other historically full-stack work.\n\n**Main take:**\n\nNone of this works without good old data engineering and well-modelled data; the agent just amplifies whatever assumptions you bake in.\n\nInterested to hear where others have hit the limits of this approach.",

I also wouldn’t want to adopt a new language only appropriate for some projects if it only offers minor improvements in certain areas or just a different way of doing things anyway.\n\nGenerally I’ve not been limited by Python at all, and there’s already a decent Rust ecosystem that’s started to form to make more performant libraries, which I’d think is the weak point of Python to focus on. Python might not seem great, but it has LOTS of libraries available, the flexibility it offers is actually good for some things, and the language/ecosystem helps me have a good work life balance. I used to think I’d be motivated to join a team if they used a language like Haskell, but at this point in my career, I’m not so sure - “good enough” is good enough, and I also feel like I might prefer working with other people who feel that way too (not trying to make an accusation here, just saying I’m not sure that having to strive for perfect functional purity on top of my other responsibilities is something I care to do now, though I do incorporate FP principles into my everyday coding).",

My opinion is that if you are going to learn a language for the sake of employability, it has to be Go, Java, Rust, Python, or JavaScript (Pick 3). Anything else introduces maintenance problems.\n\nI think there is a very specialized sub-section within data engineering called \"software engineer (data)\" but most companies do not hire for that role. They are solely focused on algorithmic optimization and doing proofs of concepts that border on being research. Even their proof of concept are often converted to standard languages. \n\nI did a PoC featuring in Python and Nim.

The key is to give the peers a heads up that you have a change that needs to be fast tracked before you start development so everybody in the chain of responsibilities are aware and ready to engage when development is complete.\n\nThe challenge you describe with merge conflicts should only happen if multiple people are working on the exact same file. If this is a common occurrence, you should understand why multiple people need to change the same file. Your code structure may need to be improved to separate a monolithic file into smaller individual files and rebuilt in runtime.\n\nAdditionally, having good branch hygiene is important. Don't keep reusing the same branch for all changes. Open a new branch for each change and prune orphaned branches. Every new change should be based on the current state of Prod so the resulting PR should only be the specific change you are trying to make. Once the PR is merged, you should delete the branch. If a new change is needed, create a new branch. This also lets you more easily abandon a bad change during dev (delete the branch) and start over if necessary.",

I had a F500 client recently with ballooning storage costs and we were able to save *millions* of dollars annually from this alone. \n   * You should basically always be saving files as Delta+Parquet, and never CSV, CSV.GZIP, etc. \n   * Try to avoid tiny files. If you need to, regularly compact your data.\n* A few pipeline design tips:\n   * You always want to be minimizing shuffles. A few ways to achieve this:\n      * Join on partitioned keys when possible If one dataset in your join is very small, use a broadcast join (`df.join(F.broadcast(df2)...)`) \n   * Avoid unnecessary distinct or sorting actions  \n   * Perform your filtering as upstream as possible If you have inefficient partitions (e.g. way to much data within a certain key), you may have data skew causing some of your longer running jobs) \n   * By the way, you should be using partitions, especially if you have jobs that only query data for a specific time frame (e.g. partitioning by day or month\\_year) \n   * Try to incrementally process your data as much as possible, rather than doing full re-writes Generally, try to search for redundancies\n\nSpark is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot.

So you will often see memory way bigger than disk, and that is expected, not a Spark UI bug. A real discussion point, should Spark expose per partition spill histograms? Right now you get cluster totals which can hide whether one task is the culprit or if it is systemic. Tools like dataflint that slice metrics per task make that debate much more concrete.",

If you want more IaC, use Serverless or Terraform with AWS EventBridge as your orchestrator. At that point, you’re setup to build however you want, with TF-defined batch jobs, step functions, lambdas, queues, whatever you need. \n\nThe single advantage of Dagster is that you have a lot of the little pieces “handled” for you like setting up logging, tracking, versioning, and data dependencies.

When a migration messes up something as basic as column order, it *sounds* trivial but it actually creates a ton of friction for anyone who has to explore or visually scan the data. Views are a workaround, but maintaining a separate view for every table is definitely unnecessary tech debt, especially if you're the only one owning this now.\n\nIf you can safely re-migrate and recreate the tables with the correct column order, ideally in a temporary schema first so you can compare row counts, types, and dependencies, it's a reasonable thing to fix. The biggest risk isn't Databricks itself, it's any downstream job that might break if it's doing something like `SELECT *` and assuming positions. As long as you map those out, the operational risk is pretty low.\n\nSo no, you're not crazy. You're just trying to clean up someone else's shortcuts.\n\n(Also, one of my ex colleagues ran into similar issues at work, their team uses Rakuten SixthSense for data observability, which helped catch this kind of schema drift early.)",

I think this medium article describes it pretty well: [https://mbvyn.medium.com/understanding-dbt-incremental-materialization-c32318364241](https://mbvyn.medium.com/understanding-dbt-incremental-materialization-c32318364241)\n\nIncr models load existing tables with more data using various loading strategies. The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.\n\nA key thing to understand would be is\\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)\n\nThat means anything wrapped within is\\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.\n\nThis is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.\n\nYou can also flip that and use NOT is\\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.\n\nEDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.\n\nIf this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.\n\nOnce we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH.\n\n    {{\n        config(\n            materialized='incremental'\n        )\n    }}\n    \n    select\n        *,\n        my_slow_function(my_column)\n    \n    from {{ ref('app_data_events') }}\n    \n    {% if is_incremental() %}\n    \n      -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run\n      -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model)\n      -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records)\n    where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} )\n    \n    {% endif %}",

        "body": "There’s actually a few things to be concerned with. One issue is making sure you are dealing with the proper timestamp. A lot of the examples in this space gloss over this aspect. For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.\n\nAnother concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`\n\nAnd this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.\n\nIf you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.\n\nI would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.\n\nIt’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",

At least I can't think of a scenario where you would need to consider that. I could also be completely wrong here, not something I've really given any thought.\n\nIf you mean in the context of joins/unions within the same model, you still only really have to think about where and when you apply the is\\_incremental() macro. To use the above example again (but expanded a bit), say we have some old stale data that we need to load, e.g. from some old source system, and then we're adding data from the new system on top. We still keep the same fields and everything.\n\nIn this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.\n\nOn every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.\n\nSo we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant.

It’s not meant to solve every problem, but if a company constantly brings in new data sources or its existing schemas change several times a year, and it still needs clean, consistent data to work with, Data Vault fits that situation very well.\n\nRecently I was Data Architecting in a project, where Data Vault was the solution to the client’s issues. A mid-sized company running an HR platform had thousands of clients but a small internal team, so they relied on many external tools: onboarding, contracts, bookkeeping, payments, their main app, and several new systems planned for the next year. Each tool had its own user table (some even had several users tables), and none of them matched. If you ran count(*) on each system’s user table, you got different numbers every time. Each system stored different pieces of information. Analysts didn’t know which database had the data they needed. Even when they found the right one, joining across systems caused rows to disappear, so they couldn’t trust anything.\n\nData Vault solved this cleanly. We created a single Hub_User table that lists every user across all systems. For each subsystem, we added a satellite tables that hold the columns coming from each system. Everything is connected using the same hash key, so joins always work the same way. Analysts now start from Hub_User, and they know exactly where each system’s data lives. Nothing gets lost during joins. When the company adds another tool next year, the team will only need to add one more satellite, and none of the existing reports will break.\n\nThis kind of constant change is normal in real data environments, and DV is a design pattern for that. \n\nI would say that it’s definitely not for newbies and requires discipline. But it’s true for all design patterns :)",

Chances are they would also want to move to a cloud warehouse, which can dramatically change the architecture for example from ETL to ELT.

If you're juggling XLSX/CSV/XML/PDF inputs and want to streamline the path from raw exports through your API layer, you’re not alone. At DeepTagger, we’ve built a no, code AI platform that lets you highlight relevant data in any document and label it to train an extraction model, no programming required. Our approach builds context, aware extraction that adapts to diverse formats, so your adapters don’t have to be reinvented for every vendor. It also supports traceability by capturing how data is extracted, which can complement your audit logs and validation steps.\n\nIf you’re exploring faster ways to scale across formats while preserving accuracy, I’d love to share how a highlight, and, label workflow could reduce rework and keep your pipeline maintainable. The platform makes it easy to test patterns across vendors and iterate without code.",

But we're no longer adding new features to it. See the blog I linked in my other comment - it's very explicit on this.\nI know that's frustrating, and I wish things had turned out differently with Synapse and I'm far from the only one who feels that way. I'll talk a bit about why we made such a seemingly asinine choice later in this comment. \n\nThe tiny bit of good news is that there's a Fabric VS Code Extension for local development (the Fabric Data Engineering VS Code Extension). If you do switch to Fabric someday, it already exists there. Along with many other nice things, like Fabric Spark's Native Execution Engine to make your Spark go vroom (thus saving you time and money). \n\nIf it was feasible to keep building Synapse, we probably wouldn't have built Fabric at all. \n\nMany person-years were spent trying to fix key mistakes we made in designing Synapse (and in some cases, far earlier than that) before we went back to the drawing board and built Fabric. But that meant we had to refactor or completely redesign many huge pieces of it. \n\nSo the APIs are often different, the internals are often different even when the external interfaces are similar or the same, and bringing the \"same\" feature to Synapse would thus often mean doubling the work of building and maintaining that feature. Or worse, due to many of the mistakes / design flaws of Synapse often being the sorts of things we'd want to improve, or the reason Synapse didn't get such a feature years ago. So investing more into features for Synapse does not make sense; that'd be effort better spent elsewhere in the mid to long term. Like filling any remaining parity gaps (few are left, and there are fewer by the day), improving migration tooling, and so on. \n\nIt's very unfortunate, it's just not something I can change without a time machine to go correct the course of Synapse in the first place. \n\nHappy to answer follow up questions.",

You wouldn't be reading from Athena you'd be reading from s3 wherever the glue table points to.\n\nYou mention Databricks in the title and that you're writing to it, then never bring it up again. If you were writing for Databricks you'd just write to s3, not to redshift, but you actually wouldn't do anything at all because Databricks could read the glue catalog table directly. \n\nThe redshift option does a delete on every row before loading the data. Some amount of time would be wasted doing these individual row deletes. If you're deleting everything just do a truncate first, or load to a staging table https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_TRUNCATE.html\n\nThe redshift options also hint that using glue to run spark is a waste of time - the \"tempformat\" shows it will temporarily save data as parquet then use a redshift COPY to load it in. With a four catalog table as the source redshift should be able to copy it directly and you can skip the glue job. Even it it can't, just have glue write a compatible parquet file separately first, then run the copy, so it is at least obvious which takes how long. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Loading-data-from-S3.html",

        "body": "SQL injection happens when you are able to identify that the receiving application does not sanitize the user input or limit permissions levels before passing it to the database (application is what authenticates to the database, not the end user). Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.\n\nAn example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like\n\n`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`\n\nthen accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in \"John@Doe.com\" as the username and \"RubberDucky\" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database\n\n`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`\n\nfair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of \"Admin';--\"? The application would pass the following \n\n`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`\n\nThe database will return the first user that has the username of \"Admin\" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, \";\" would terminate the SQL command, and \"--\" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors.  \n  \nthat is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it \"secure\" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like \"UPDATE\", \"DELETE\", \"\\*\", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen  people do it in HEX\n\n  \nOnce you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do. Here is how you might be able to get the server credentials from a SQL injection \n\n[https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478](https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478)",

The front end then sends the name to the back end to retrieve the stats.\n\nLet's say the backend does an SQL query on the database like \"SELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = '$name'\".\n\nNormally this works great.  But what if I type the following:\n\nRobert'; DROP TABLE Students;\n\nNow the SQL query on the backend looks like this:\n\nSELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;\n\nWhen that is executed, it will search for Robert in the database, and then it will wipe all the data out.\n\nOf course you can do more advanced things other than deleting stuff in the database.  You can add other queries to try to extract more information than the website would otherwise allow.  You can probe the database for other tables, like maybe asking if there is a list of credit card numbers.  You can get really fancy like querying to see if any columns start with the letter \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" and so on, and if you do enough of those queries you can reconstruct the schema for the database and discover all sorts of interesting things.\n\nI wrote a simple website one that had a shell injection vulnerability.  It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did!  Using a similar attack against my website, someone could have executed arbitrary shell script code on the backend as the www user.  I learned the value of always aggressively sanitizing my inputs.",

If the backend also only uses interfaces to other system, then it's no an sql based attack. However, if the other system is vulnerable then maybe the injection happens there. And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it. You can make it so that certain commands are not allowed, like dropping tables, but modifying data and reading data your are not supposed to might still be possible. \n\n>how are they able to get data returned from a database with their query if they are not an authenticated user to the database\n\nThe application is authenticated. \n\n>and how would they even know what to inject into the SQL database to get what they want\n\nThey often don't.

They just \"hack\" until it works. \n\n> this is purely educational because I honestly don't understand it?\n\nThere are many books about this. You really have to see how 90ies PHP websites were made to understand how insecure it all was.   \n  \nNote that it's only possible in very old libraries that let you just create strings containing sql queries that you then execute. Wo now use templates and make sure that user input is checked and always passed as a certain type (string, number, date etc). You can't just pass \"1' AND 1;  --\" and have it be inserted into \"select \\* from users where username = '%s' password = '%s'\". And we salt and has the passwords, if there even are any. But some people are idiots and think it's ok to use 20 year old libraries and not do anything for security. Then it's easy. Others use modern frameworks and even they can have vulnerabilities.

        "body": "The reason to study C is not because the language itself is interesting, or because it's especially useful for real-world programming.\n\nThe reason is that C is such a simple and low-level language that it allows you to \"see\" the guts of how things actually work, instead of having them hidden from you.\n\nFor instance, when you start using Java you'll immediately encounter the object-oriented programming style. You'll see things like objects, classes, methods, inheritance, etc. And from the perspective of a Java programmer, all that stuff just works \"by magic\", because the Java compiler and the JVM implement everything for you. Whereas if you think about how to implement the same thing in C, you'll be peeling back the layers of abstraction and you'll be forced to learn more about what's actually happening under the hood.\n\nThe same thing applies to data structures. In Java, you can just declare an `ArrayList<Foo>` that automatically resizes itself to fit the data it contains. C doesn't contain such a resizable array type, but you can implement it yourself using the lower-level primitives such as `malloc` and `realloc`. And doing that work yourself forces you to really understand what's going on. Writing something like that in C is a way to force yourself not to \"cheat\" by taking advantage of existing higher-level constructs.\n\nEven if you never plan to *use* C for any real projects, I personally believe that understanding low-level programming will help make you a better developer in the long run. \n\n(For one thing, it helps you get a better understanding of performance. In higher-level languages, the speed of a given piece of code depends largely on the behavior of many layers of abstraction that are being hidden from you. In C, what you write is much closer to what the CPU actually executes.)\n\nBut having said that: as a student, I don't think you should prioritize learning C over the actual courses that you're being graded on. Just study it on your own as time allows.",

It is the end.\n\nSome literature:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold",

Go through topics slower until you've mastered them before moving on: make flashcards, write blog posts about what you've learned (even if you don't post them, just writing them helps you articulate to yourself what you know and points out any holes in your understanding). It feels slow, but slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.\n\n* Analysis paralysis - You feel overwhelmed by all the different starting points you could make. Again, go slower. Pick one tutorial or book and commit to working through it. Finishing one mediocre tutorial feels better than starting and not finishing a dozen great tutorials.\n\n* Perfectionism - Anxiety about getting everything absolutely perfect. Just because you've mastered a topic once doesn't mean you'll never need to review it again, or Google stuff about it.\n\nRemember that progress isn't linear: some days you move ahead ten steps, other days you move ahead two steps, some days you move back three steps. Consistency is the key.\n\nIt'd help us if you could tell us more about your situation:\n\n* What language are you learning?\n* What books or tutorials have you read?\n* Can you point us to code/projects you've written?\n* What are some programming concepts you have difficulty with? What are some concepts you understood easily?\n\nIt's fine if you haven't made much (or any!) progress. But this will help us understand what kind of advice to give you.",

The requirements of the project usually dictate what language(s) might be best for the project. The knowledge already in a team also plays a big part. But people able to switch and learn new languages is a really common task.\n\nFor an example, I applied for a job that used Ruby. I had no Ruby experience, but it took me less than a week (of non-intensive) practice to be able to get a job offer from them. I was even up-front that I had no professional Ruby experience. It really doesn't matter, because 95%+ of languages all share similar concepts, so switching between them is easy.\n\nFor now, I wouldn't worry about it too much.

I think it's difficult for a true beginner to have met those criteria, though certainly not impossible.\n\nSo maybe just consider starting small.

You’re also gonna have to go through code review, which can be both good (for learning) and bad (for actually getting your work accepted).\n- Your PRs are more likely to get shot down because your code doesn’t meet the project’s standards.\n- Established communities can be harder to break into. Gaining people’s appreciation and respect will take lots of time and work.\n\nI can’t say what’s best for you, but I gained a lot out of contributing to larger projects as a beginner. The key is to make small contributions and not rock the boat. Godot Engine was a great project for me because I am also a user of it, and it’s super modular so you can change parts of an individual subsystem without breaking anything else.

Your brain learns it can have the dopamine hit soon, so it's easier to focus. Gradually increase the work interval as you build the habit.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Treat debugging like a video game:\\*\\* ADHD brains love puzzles and immediate feedback. When you hit a bug, frame it as \"I'm going to figure this out\" rather than \"ugh this is broken.\" Keep a running log of what you've tried - it helps when you inevitably get distracted and come back.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use the hyperfocus strategically:\\*\\* When you feel yourself getting pulled into something, lean into it if it's productive. I've had some of my best learning sessions at 2 AM because my brain decided \"today we're learning async/await.\" Just make sure you're not hyperfocusing on tutorial hell.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Accountability buddies:\\*\\* Find a study Discord or a friend who's also learning. Just having someone to check in with like \"hey I'm going to work on this for the next hour\" makes a huge difference.\n\n\n\nAlso about the medication - might be worth trying different options if Adderall isn't working?

So make sure whatever language you're learning have some real world application in your daily life and activities.\n\nLets say i'm trying to learn vba, i can apply what I learned in excel at work as it's heavily utilized. Or if i'm learning c, I have a custom keyboard that utilizes c to program it. Or if I'm learning LUA, i like video games, there are games that uses lua to extend the games functionality. Or if i'm learning javascript, I could use javascript to customize how my normally visited pages look to show only the things I'm interested in. Or if you're learning css/html. I could customize how firefox works and looks. Or if you're learning batch or powershell, you can program automation into your computer usage workflow to make normal routines more convenient.\n\nIt's all about seeing the payoff of what you're learning, when you are able to apply it, and see your work in action, it keeps you interested. Interested enough to explore it even further. Then eventually it starts to get boring again and you switch to another language to learn. FML",

Things move quickly and change all the time. CS fundamentals apply to most coding frameworks, you can do the same thing in most coding languages.\n\nIn a nutshell, get the CS fundamentals locked down, and you are able to adapt to different things, which is great for ADHD as we get bored easily and want to move on to different things or multitask.\n\nUse AI to help motivate you (when stuck) and to start and finish tasks. My best use case for AI is really summarising my work to pick up next time, and stick to a plan. \n\nADHD is a superpower for development! hyperfocus is real. If struggling with distraction or ‘tutorial hell’, build something basic from scratch that you want and you’ll be more interested. \nDiscipline is hard with ADHD, i’d advise while getting started to work on ‘fun’ projects that you enjoy doing.\n\nMost importantly, please don’t be hard on yourself.\nLet yourself have a break if you want, treat yourself after something hard. You have got this! Keep being you and following your passions.\n\nNo one is perfect and if it helps I still struggle with distractions too. Stay curious and enjoy the process of learning, as the truth is you always will be learning your whole life, due to how vast CS is and how often things change. \n\nSorry it’s a lot, but I hope this helps in any way. ",

Data (bits) is stored in memory slots, stacked one on top of the other. \n\nWe make them behave the way we want them to behave (to solve a specific problem that demands said behaviour). A queue behaves in a circular way because that’s what we need to do, on the machine level there is no circular behaviour, like i sais, data is just stacked like books on a table.\n\nTo understand how do we create such behaviours out of memory slots and most importantly why, you need a low enough language to see what’s going under the hood, otherwise it will look like magic. \n\nSo i recommend trying to implement them in C going from integers to graphs and trees. Moving to a high level language like python will be a piece of cake and you will be better than most who started there. \n\nI recommend the book Algorithmes in C, it is quite extensive, so don’t read in bulk and if you really need to know how the machine works, start with Introduction to computing systems, it is written by the creator of the LC-3, for educational purposes. \n\nGood luck to you.",

        "body": "## Exposition\nI'm a lot like you in the sense that I want to understand the \"full stack\" of every system I run across. For years it has got me glued to books on computer science and on general programming topics, chatting with AI about the subject, googling, watching YT videos, etc. It has helped me gain a good basis for how things work but it has also been a way for me to avoid the really hard job of coding itself.\n\n## The Problem\nWithout getting too much into meditation and casual research I've done on psychology, the basic problem is this: It's not the subject matter - programming or computer science - *it's the response to that internal state while learning the subject matter*. \n\nYou need ways to switch off that self-referential egotalk. It won't go away before you start treating it and other internal feelings and thoughts as \"information\" rather than realities that are playing out or describing \"who you are\". They are chemical events, some helpful, some unhelpful. The system that spawns them is full of messy, contradictory responses to these internal events that don't always make sense. Your brain has neuroplasticity, and whether you like it or not even your identity is a construction. Yes, we all have some properties like IQ and EQ that determine some speed or efficiency of function but again those don't determine binary outcomes. The real hindrance is the ego butting in when the analytical parts are trying to do their job or those parts tiring out.\n\nI've wired my brain to be lazy, inattentive and identify myself as stupid. The identity itself and the thoughts surrounding it is a learned set of patterns. That wiring can change, the feelings it produces while under stress can change and my image of myself can change but they won't unless I keep allowing my brain to default to those pathways and don't offer it new experiences and responses to certain difficult stimuli.\n\n## The Realities of the Field\nThe feeling of not knowing something or being confused will never change in this field. Your conscious response to that can and that will ultimately lead to your brain interpreting those signals differently. You'll even start to love the challenge of not knowing, if you can get out of your own way.\n\n## What to focus on - the narrow approach\n\n**Your real goal is learning to understand systems, syntax and data.** There are easier and harder approaches to this but generally I'd say **try to learn how memory works**. And learn it robustly. Study the virtual memory system, study file systems, study how different information - audio, text, graphics, device state - get modeled in memory. While there are millions of libraries, protocols and file formats, they have to all converge on the simple core truth of writing bytes to or reading bytes from memory. If you can nail this layer, write a few parsers that interpret file formats or networking protocols, you'll get a solid grasp of the simple fact that **software is just agreed upon patterns of bytes**. This won't trivialize learning libraries but it will trivialize a certain notion of \"newness\" from them - they aren't anything new. They may sit at several levels lower or higher on the software stack but they are all still just memory.  \n\n## On AI  \nResources are sometimes hard to come by but AI is actually pretty good for this. As long as you aren't copying code but rather asking questions on subjects that are stable and unlikely to change - how things in computer science, and the technologies that express it, work - you can get very good, very detailed answers. Plus you can go back and forth with it, trying to nail and refine your understanding. It's like taking notes with a tutor.\n\n## Conclusion\nSo don't be like me. Don't rush. Accept discomfort. Accept being stupid and having to ask. Think of the skill acquisition portion like laying bricks on a giant wall. You wish for a fast and glorious end result, you'll even settle for \"100 more bricks laid out today, look at that progress!\" but what you need and what you get by showing up and working every day is that one brick. This is a craft and the only way to learn it is by doing it. Every day.",

Previously I taught mostly pre-engineering STEM stuff at the middle school level.\n\nI have been taking a lot of CS classes from one of the state universities here thanks to a grant funded program paying for the tuition and fees. Nothing like getting a lot of credit hours at no financial cost! But those classes absolutely have kicked my tail, often leaving me feeling that \"not smart enough\" feeling you mention. I did OK with Python because I had some previous experience with it, but the Java classes were tough. But I definitely learned new things! Now I'm in my last class for this certificate, Data Structures and Algorithms. I am certainly experiencing many moments of being baffled. But I keep grinding and slowly things get clearer.\n\nFor me, the purpose of doing this is to pump up my general knowledge and skills so I can better help my students and hopefully have fewer \"I dunno\" moments when they ask me something.\n\nI think one thing we forget about learning in general is that part of the point of grinding through the work isn't the specific content or items being learned, but instead it's just the flexing of our mental muscles, helping our synapses get better at seeing and making connections and patterns out of what we interact with.",

That'll take you through the basics. Then add-on whatever you find interesting with heaps, other kinds of trees, search-algorithms, etc. Links are at the bottom of every wikipedia-article on any data structure or algorithm.\n\nWork with implementing everything yourself - plan code on paper, and code it by hand - DO NOT USE AI to write code! Expand the algorithms to count and display iterations, and keep track of both time and space - make sure you \"experience\" the complexity, don't just try to remember definitions.\n\nIf you need additional explanations for certain subjects, look for free videos or articles, look for university courses (MIT has exceptional free course materials available online), or ask an AI - they are good at explaining this stuff, and only rarely get it wrong!\n\nYou'll be better at truly understanding DSA than anyone following any of these paid courses!",

Remember that most programming languages do only one thing at a time, and even fairly simple tasks like asking the user to enter a number, and printing it back, requires a lot of individual steps.\n\nThe program you have written performs these steps:\n\n1. Print a message to the user, asking to \"Input a number: \"\n2. Reads a number entered by the user\n3. Prints a new message to the user, saying \"Your number: \" followed by the number the user entered\n\nThen there's a lot of additional \"invisible\" steps, like storing the number in a variable - creating a \"Scanner\" that is apparently some tool to get input from the user, and also a lot about importing that and creating a class and some magic incantation \"public static void main\" that probably doesn't make any sense.\n\nBut keep the main focus on the steps you want the program to execute, and gradually understand how to write them, and what extra \"invisible steps\" you need to add!\n\nAnd when in doubt about something particular - ask about that particular thing.",

It can be done in Python, but typically, Python offers \"too much\" and makes it too easy, not really giving a solid view of what goes into DSA, in my opinion.)\n\nIf I were you, I'd audit a course on DSA if you feel that it would strengthen your knowledge of the subject instead of enrolling in it. Auditing is a great way to review or to learn new concepts without the pressure of assignments and exams with deadlines.\n\nI'm surprised you took a course on web programming: it's a landscape that changes so fast that by the time you've started the course, what you're learning is probably already obsolete. the others sound pretty standard for a CS curriculum, but not learning advanced algorithms or the theory of computability (unless you covered that in discrete math, which seems unlikely) seems like glaring omissions.\n\nAnother option would be to pick up a book on DSA and work through it at your own pace... that undirected learning style doesn't work for everyone, though, so pick what works best for you, but yes, a solid foundation in DSA is very important to have: knowing what data structures and algorithms to pick and why is something that I would consider essential.",

Since you like web development and you know basic Java you have all the makings of a full stack developer.\n\nBy building projects to learn how to develop software the concepts you learn in school will make more sense how it applies. School does not really teach you how to develop software directly so you are going to have to learn this on your own in addition to what they teach in school.\n\nStart small and keep simple and add one small thing at a time. Work from frontend to backend to database for every feature you add. Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn when you need to learn it.\n\nThis might sound crazy to some, but the often dismissed TODO application is very well suited for teaching comprehensive full stack development. You just have to take it that far.\n\nHere is an example roadmap that could keep you busy for a while.\n\nStart small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.\n\nMake TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.\n\nNow for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.\n\nDo this with every small project you work on. A calculator, an address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.\n\nI hope this helps.",

It takes more time to write *and* to read while adding no useful information.\n* It introduces a maintenance burden, as changes to functionality must be mirrored in comments.\n* It tends to introduce confusion and even bugs, because sooner or later someone *will* update code without remembering to mirror the changes in comments, and then someone *will* wrongly assume that the comment is correct.\n\nTherefore, you should never say anything in a comment if it is adequately clear from a symbol’s *name* (e.g. function or variable name), or from its type. (Of course, when generating documentation or tool hints, it may make sense to include a brief summary even if it’s strictly redundant, e.g. the description of the `dirname` parameter above is fine; but I’d remove the bit about being a `char**`). If you can rename a variable and thereby make a comment redundant, you should rename the variable and delete the comment—self-documenting code is best!\n\nWhat’s most important to include in comments is whatever is *least* obvious from reading the code. If you’re doing something counterintuitive because arcane conditions make it an important performance consideration, then mention that. If a calculation is just really complex and confusing, explain the reasoning.

So the mandatory methods in the class file of an interface don't have any code associated with them (just like abstract methods).\n\nThe default methods \\*do\\* have code - but it's only used if the class that implements the interface \\*doesn't\\* provide its own implementation of the method - so those aren't abstract.",

And it seems to be changing more and more in various languages, while we also move more and more away from inheritance, and into the wonderful world of composition. So things are changing.\n\nBut yeah, (non-default) methods in interfaces are \"just abstract methods\".",

        "body": "First, you need to intimately understand what your code is supposed to do. This should not be hard because, after all you wrote the code to do what you wanted it to do. So debugging is about finding the point in your code where it first DOES NOT do what you intended it to do. “It should be exiting the loop here - why isn’t it? Oh it should be >= instead of >” etc.   To find that point you can start from the beginning and check values: “b should be 10 here. Is it?”  Trace the execution flow through your code examining values as you go. At some point you will find a value that you weren’t expecting and you can figure out why it got the value it got and fix it. \nAn alternate approach is to work backwards. Start from where you notice the error and see what your code did just before that. This typically means re-running each time you take a step back. In some cases you can also try the binary search method. Examine values in the middle of your code. If they look good the error hasn’t happened yet so split the second half into two sections and look in the middle again keep looking and splitting until you see your problem. In practice I kind of do a mix based on logical thinking…  I see where the error first manifests, I think what could cause that error, I use the debugger or add print statements the check my hypothesis and either look forward or further back depending. But you can almost always find your problem by starting at the beginning and tracing through examining values.  You likely won’t run into it for a while in your programming, but where this breaks down is when you are dealing with multi-threaded, concurrent, asynchronous tasks or threads where adding breakpoints or even printing values changes the order of processing and masks the error.",

So… if you know the programming basics it should be “easy” to learn any “modern” language. \n\nIn my humble opinion, Javascript is a very different paradigm language even it shares the basics such as conditionals, loops, etc… the underground concepts (prototypes, dom management…) are completely different in other languages, is like comparing apples with oranges even though those are fruits, are very different. \n\nYou mention python, and this makes me go to the first question, depends on what your looking for.

Ditch the game-dev courses.\n\nBack in the day, there were two schools that offered a game-dev degree; they were DigiPen, and Full Sail. Both these schools are accredited, both these schools are collaborations WITH THE GAME INDUSTRY. The CEOs of both EA-US and Sony-US sat on the direction board of Full Sail.\n\nAround 2006, we were at the height of Sallie Mae robbing the American public blind, and ALL the universities got in on it. They fed peoples delusions of grandeur back to them, and offered game-dev degrees of their own. I sat on a couple review boards myself, and I'd name and shame if I wasn't going to get sued to oblivion if I did... They're robbing people blind. These programs are designed without any industry input or representation whatsoever.\n\nAnd by 2010, the game studios had fully reacted. These days, they don't want to HEAR \"game dev\" degree, because they know you won't know comp-sci to save your life, and you won't know game dev, either. There's still a certain respect for the two schools mentioned, but for the most part, they want a traditional comp-sci degree.\n\nIn the mid 20-teens, the Department of Education started cracking down - tying federal grant money and subsidies to both graduation rates and placement success. Ineffective programs became dangerous to schools and they had to start putting up or shutting up.\n\nWell, I can promise you MOST of the schools slip through the cracks, and this current administration has declared war on education and dissolved the DoE. So I don't know WHAT you're learning over there...\n\nAnd if you're outside the US, I'd trust your game-dev education even less. If the program isn't perfectly cohesive, that's a really, really bad sign.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but at the very least, it's not too late to turn your future prospects around. Get in on math classes, as much as you can from here on out.\n\nAs for how your interview is going to go when you present yourself to a game studio - it's going to be almost exclusively math oriented. They're going to drill you on linear algebra, calculus, and physics at the very least. Some of it will be comp-sci oriented about algorithms, some of it will be physics, some of it will be rendering, some of it is used in game dev but you'll have never seen before because they just want to see how well you adapt to new maths - that you haven't just memorized everything. They're going to grill you over this. As for any programming part of the interview, mostly they just want to know that you know enough syntax to be dangerous: reverse a string, write a linked list.\n\nHell, you don't need C++ specifically in your education. Java is almost indiscernible from C#, which itself is used heavily in game dev, and they all share common syntax and idioms. You can pick up enough C++ on your own to get by.\n\nThe studio can teach you good programming on the job, they can't teach you math and how to think.",

Since I’m not super experienced but im not a complete beginner it’s a weird space where beginner c++ tutorials spend more time covering fundamentals than syntax and I have a hard time getting through them (granted that’s from the few I’ve seen before making this post) but I’m not advanced enough where general picking up a new language advice is applicable because it’s generally assumed that I’m further along than I am if that makes sense? \n\nEdit: example: Sorting algorithms are still a fresh concept, we’ve gone over things like Huffman trees and hash maps within the last couple of months, so while it’s not new, I’m not sure I’m confident enough to just start experimenting with it in another language since it’s only recently been taught to us how different ways of integrating it work in Java syntax wise (ex generics and wildcards)",

From making some small sites/pages to present your research, to analysing data\n\nCoding gives you way more options to do stuff then excel or special software - because it's more flexible. It allows you to process a big amount of data, or do complicated automations\n\nAlso, having an option to change your career is good no matter if you want it right now or not\n\nDefinitely start coding!",

This makes Python more suitable to use cases like Data Analytics, where readability and development speed matter more than minute performance optimisations, whereas a language like C is more suited to applications which require a level of control over hardware resources, like Operating System or Embedded Systems applications where you need to use resources as efficiently as possible.",

You can just change the if statement to check this instead: `if self.expression and self.expression[-1] in self.operators and input in self.operators:` since `bool(self.expression)` will be false, when the string is empty.\n\nIn the case of `calculate`, the main two errors are `SyntaxError` (raised, for example when you try `eval(\"\")`) or `ZeroDivisionError`.  Depending on what input is possible, `NameError` is possible (`eval(\"x + 1\")`). Thinking about what errors can occur forces you to think about why they happen and how to handle them. You should definitely handle the SyntaxError and ZeroDivisionError in some way. If you really want, you can catch those 2 with corresponding error messages and then catch all remaining exceptions (but I'd not catch them and let the calculator crash if something really completely unexpected happens instead of ignoring it. This would be a bug requiring a fix and not an expected exception like the other two).\n\nAlternatively, you should have a look at [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) about eval. You might want to either sanitize the input before evaluating the expression or write your own evaluation function, as eval is risky to use. This is only necessary, if there is a way to get 'unclean' input. But sanitizing input is good practice.",

And it will teache you a lot. \n\nSince you’re not a fan of front-end and you’re studying applied maths + CS, you can lean into areas that have long-term demand:\n\n**1. Strengthen one backend language deeply:** You could pick **Kotlin / Java, Go, or Python** depending on the direction you want**.**\n\n**2. Learn devops fundamentals:** You already touched deployment and Cloudflare, so the next step is:\n\n* Docker\n* CI/CD\n* Linux fundamentals\n* Nginx\n* Basic cloud (AWS, GCP, or Azure)\n\nEven basic competency in these instantly increases employability.\n\n**3. Databases + caching:** Most backend devs don’t go deep enough here. Understanding things like:\n\n* PostgreSQL indexing\n* Query optimization\n* Redis caching patterns\n* Background job queues\n\n**4. System design basics:** You don’t need FAANG-level system design, but knowing how APIs, queues, caching, and services fit together puts you on a different level.\n\n**5. Keep building small production projects:** Your CRM project is already strong. If you build 1–2 more **small, useful, real-world tools**, your portfolio becomes unbeatable, especially when paired with your degree.\n\nIf you do these over the next 1–2 years, you’re basically shaping yourself into a backend engineer with DevOps literacy, which is one of the safest positions in the market right now.",

Well... maybe your prototype and your \"production ready\" app are very similar.. you'll have pissed off users running into bugs, but maybe you cross the finish line and get funding to refactor later (you wont, you will build on top of your garbage with more \"temporary\" garbage)\n\nOr maybe your code is handling how much radiation to blast a cancer patient with... Google Therac-25, one of the most famous software bugs dealing with exactly that.. If you are making something similar now, you better that testing, failsafes and a few more \"just in case are you sure this is the correct power to fire the laser\" screens in the final app are mandatory before release. \n\nDocumentation even is considered a mandatory part of the \"code base\" in some projects Ive worked on, app works great without it, but future development is always an option. \n\nI know Rust teams that build out stuff quick and fast in Python and don't care about any bugs til they have something working, then they scrap their idea and treat it as nothing more than a proof of concept (suppose you could call it a prototype), and then rebuild it in Rust. They do this to get a proof of concept out ASAP and prove its worth pursuing in Python due to how fast you can do that compared to the much more cumbersome (but faster and safer) Rust. \n\n\nAnd on the flip side of all this.... you have companies that have 0 unit tests, use a custom build script that no one can read or understand because Bob who wrote the script in a 36 hour code binge one day used his own custom language he developed in high school that uses Tolkien characters as aliases to traditional syntax, and they fired him in 2008 when the market crashed but somehow the company survived and they have an app that they have considered production ready even before Bob showed up... Users somehow are shocked through their keyboard every 3rd time they log into this app and hate it, but they keep using it so the company marches on and pretends everything is great hoping, and management will fire you if it breaks while you're there, and will doxx users if they leave a 1 star review.\n\n\nTldr; its a bunch of things, nothing specific. Hopefully the standards you set have testing, SPECIFIC mandatory features that need to exist first before new stuff is added, documentation, and have set things up in a way that it isn't a nightmare to maintain a year from now or when new coders show up. \n\nThats another reason docs are important to move on from \"prototype\", being consistent with a style guide and practices you use, even if they arent what the language specifies. If you write Python and decide to use CamelCase, thats gross... but if the team style guide says so, and your code is consistent, you use it even if it's \"wrong\". And new devs joining the team will be able to follow the style guide and be productive without issue. Apps, like companies, grow and being ready for more users isnt the only important thing, you should be ready to add new devs and set them up to be productive and keep things consistent ideally. \n\n\n\nWrote a lot and maybe seems like my comment is all over the place, but honestly thats kinda how it works. We are writing english words that software takes and translates to different words, which translates again through another piece of garbage bit of software into more nonsense words, until eventually those original words end up becoming 1s and 0s and through dark magic you made League of Legends appear. \n\nIts messy and a lot of what youre wondering may not even rely on the dev team, rather management and funding. There's a lot of \"shoulds\" that you should have before being production ready... but boss man wants that feature complete and we just dont have time to research the best way, unless you want to stay late on Friday, the client didnt pay for the 6 months of dev time needed to do it correct anyway, so do it mostly correct and do it fast...",

I'm more privy to JS so I'll focus on that. Dont let \"web based\" fool you, you can run everything locally too, but it'll do wonders for compatibility and simplicity \n\nYou can use JS and a browser for the entire gui, and JS again in the back end using NODE. You can use something like Electron for cross platform compatibility, and you can save your offline data as cookies or in the cache. Once you get back to data service, the data can sync, and then it'll be available on a server for all your devices. \n\nFor the quiz you can use something like socket.io for bidirectional communication between the server and the device\n\nYou have a lot of requirements here, and it would be prudent to be able to code everything in the same language (JS) I would start by learning basic browser JS since you have a foundation in html and css, then move on to your first server using express and node, and then learn how to utilize external packages like socket.io, then finally how to package them into standalone apps using electron. You may find that you need other things along the way like a database, but thats just another external package and another set of docs. \n\nYou can do all of this in python too it'll just be 50% more difficult than js, but python has better support for complex data and more and different external packages. I dont see any reason to recommend it for someone starting out, and you can always learn another language later \n\nYou're much better off getting good at a single thing than trying to code a bunch of things in different languages",

Most BaaS platforms have decent docs for the stuff you mentioned (auth, payments via Stripe integration, form validation). The tradeoff is you're abstracting away a lot of the learning. For job hunting, employers value both - knowing how to build backends from scratch shows depth, but knowing how to use modern tools like Supabase shows you can ship fast. Real question though - if you're applying for backend or full-stack roles later, how do you prove you actually understand backend concepts if you only used BaaS? Like would you point to the features you shipped, or would you need to build something from scratch to demonstrate that knowledge?",

My first few years covered computer architecture, databases, python and Java, data structures, and object oriented design (and design patterns in general)\n\nI started learning web dev with the basics, Javascript/css/html.  After a couple months, I started learning frontend frameworks starting with Vue (easy-ish to pickup imo) and eventually moving to React because it is more widely adopted in the industry.\n\nThen I went deeper into backend and ops.  Setting up auth, logging, APIs, and deploying the application.  This part was absolutely the most difficult for me and I had a written step by step guide walking me through the process of setting up VMs on Digital Ocean and AWS where I'd have to ssh in and setup hosting and start the application.  This process would have to be repeated (condensed a bit) whenever the backend application was updated.  Nowadays, it is much easier to host fullstack applications but this is still good to know as a professional.\n\nAnyway, all of that was another 2yrs of grinding and I did a webdev bootcamp around the end 2020.  I got my first job in 2021 (July/August).  So 5yrs doing this basically full time lol \n\nBut even then, programming is an ocean and I've spent nearly every day as a full time dev learning new things and improving the way I build applications.  You might be able to build your Spotify clone after a year or two, but I promise that another year will pass and you will look back on it as complete garbage.  And that's fine, that is the process of growth.  Just be prepared for a very long journey, this is not something that you will master in even a couple years.  It will take a lot of time, patience, and perseverance to reach your goals.",

Here you mostly care about the oldest and newest object, and whenever an object dies, you have a mutation. Any new object simply gets added to the end.\n\nBut even here, just a few necessary searches will kill any performance advantage you got, so you'd need to be very sure that your performance optimization holds, and will hold for a long time. And if you ever need to change something, you'll quickly have to swap out the linked list with a more powerful data structure anyway.\n\nSo even if you ever find a place where a linked list fits, you most likely will instead choose a tree, skip list or the like instead.",

If you have 6 words in an array, and you want to insert a new word, you move over the words enough spaces to insert the new word in the target spot. What I'm struggling with is understanding the formula for it? There's this formula (0+1+2+⋯+n-1)/n=(n-1)/2 or this formula for array deletion: (n–1)/2 ≈ n/2. I don't know where these are coming from or how these are connected or how I'm supposed to use them. And there's this: Maximum number of comparisons = ⌊log\\_2⁡n ⌋+1 for binary search algorithm. \n\nYeah you're right, I'm not very fluent with programming either. All of this is pretty new to me but it's my second year and I'm falling behind but I'm still trying to catch up and learn. I have an assignment due in a week, and the semester just started so I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I've been relearning python since a few days ago but it will take a while to master it.",

You would find it on your 4th iteration and return true.\n\nLet's say you wanted to do binary search instead \n\nSo first step, you cut the array in half. N / 2 = 2.5, so we just pick index 2.\n\nThere's a 3 there, which isn't what we want. So we compare if it's higher or lower than 4.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 4, and we know the array is sorted, then we know that 4 is in the right half of the array\n\n[4 5]. Now, N = 2\n\nSo you cut the array in half again. N/2 = 1, and at index 1, there's the number 5. It's higher than 4, so we have to cut in half again\n\n[4]\n\nNow there's only one element, and it's the number we want, so we return true.\n\nYou will see that we had to cut the array in half only 3 times before we found it.\n\nBinary search has complexity O(log N) because the number of times we need to iterate with respect to the magnitude of the input (in this case, the number of elements in the array) is log (base 2) of N \n\nThe things that are important when it comes to big O runtime complexity is to\n\n1. Identify how you're measuring the input\n2. Draw out each step of the algorithm\n3. Determine the amount of steps you would have in the worst case.\n\nFor linear search, the worst case is having to check every element. So given N elements, you perform N iterations.\n\nIn the case of binary search, since you're cutting the number of elements to search in half every iteration, you only need search log(base 2) N times, plus the one if there are odd number of elements.",

Don't avoid frontend because it's \"saturated.\" Your design background makes you uniquely qualified for design + code roles (design systems, UI engineering). Most frontend devs can't design. Most designers can't code. You can do both. One skill worth adding here is accessibility. Relevant to C#, Java, and frontend. Companies care (legal, UX, SEO). I know AudioEye has free courses that are practical and sets you apart  [https://www.audioeye.com/courses/](https://www.audioeye.com/courses/)  \n  \nLearn frontend (HTML/CSS/JS/React) as it's the fastest to paid work and leverages your design. Add backend (C# or Node) later. Or C# + Unity for creative tech. Your age and experience are strengths!",

So to truly understand the underlying theory, building your own is a good idea.\n\nBut, noone is going to buy your homebuilt project, or hire you to build another - then want you to be able to use the tools they have already paid good money for, and they want you do do it well and do it fast!\n\nSo don't go building your own as an excuse not to learn the tricks of the tools - but also, don't just be a tool-user, but make sure you understand enough to be able to learn any tool.\n\nMy recommendation *(as someone who doesn't know anything about the business)* is to go on with building your own, but remember that it is a hobby-project, something you only do for the learning experience. And then as your \"professional project\" build something with the modern tools, to show off how well you know them!",

But you don't need developers for that - almost anyone with a little bit of programming knowledge can vibe code their way through the easy stuff.\n\nIt is when there are no off-the-shelf solutions, no tutorials to look up, the AI is striking out...that's when you need someone with skills. Someone with some mental fortitude to be able to work through complex problems, debug, and problem solve. Who can go looking through poorly written documentation or undocumented code. Who ultimately understands that, after a certain point, the buck stops with them - if they can't *find* a solution to the problem, they have to think through and *make* one.\n\nI think, like in an interview it is telling when a would-be developer get asked a question they've never seen before. They don't *know* the solution - but that's fine, because a lot of times you won't know the solution. So does the candidate sit down, start to think, formulate a plan, examine that plan, revise it and otherwise think through the problem until they get a solution? Or do they just shrug and give up and go \"I've never seen this problem before, so I can't solve it\"?\n\nSo, for instance, if a software developer wanted to know what the software developer mindset was, they wouldn't just post a question in a subreddit - they'd do some research. Find some books written by notable in the field and read them. Read some blog articles. Put together their own idea of what it means - and once they've put in the mental work of figuring it all out, then they might ask some others if they were on the right track.\n\n**tl;dr:** Being able to solve problems instead of just asking others/the web/AI for solutions.",

As for OS fundamentals, do you think *Operating System Concepts (Dinosaur Book)* is too complicated to start off? Everyone raves about as THE textbook - but if I'm not building my OS, would this still be an appropriate start? What do you think about \"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces\" by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau (it also costs a fraction of the price of the dinosaur book), and seems to be a gentler introduction.  \n  \n2. I have learned basic Java through online tutorials with OOP principles yet I've read online that the books have a trove of information more than online tutorials.

Because of Java's type erasure, you won't be able to just do something like `new BiEnumMap<Numerus, Casus>()`. At runtime, that would just be translated to the equivalent of `new BiEnumMap()` and the class will not have any way of knowing which enum classes you actually wanted to use.\n\nInstead, you will have to explicitly pass the `Numerus.class` and `Casus.class` class objects as parameters. The type signature would end up being something like:\n\n    public BiEnumMap(Class<A> clsA, Class<B> clsB) {\n        ...\n    }\n\nNote that this is the same reason why the `EnumSet` class doesn't have no-args constructor, i.e. you can't just write `new EnumSet<A>()`. The `EnumSet` class needs to know at runtime which enum type it's operating on, which means at runtime you need to either pass in the enum class object itself, or an enum value from which the class object can be determined.",

A lot of websites use loading icons to display \"placeholder\" icons to indicate that something is loading. The advantage of this approach is that state management is going to be easier on the client (you only need to manage state for the current page). \n\ntldr; I would stick to a single way of loading pages (all AJAX or all anchor tags), but what you suggesting isn't terrible.",

        "body": "I could be wrong, I've never worked with gmpy2, but I believe this is what's happening:\n\n`x` and `y` are never covered to gmpy2 types here, you are relying on the library to either handle the regular Python `int` and `float` types or create temporary gmpy2 type objects from them in order to do the math. The results of those functions will be gmpy2 types, but nowhere does any of this replace `x` and `y` with an equivalent gmpy2 type. This matters.\n\nThe source code for gmpy2 might help understand why.\n\n`qdiv` source is [here](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_mpq_misc.c#L162).\n\nYou can skip to line 210 since the first part is if you use it with only 1 argument.\n\nThe check for whether your arguments are valid is this:\n\n    if (!IS_RATIONAL(x) || !IS_RATIONAL(y)) {\n        goto arg_error;\n    }\n\n`IS_RATIONAL` is a macro defined in [gmpy2_convert.h](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_convert.h#L54)\n\nThe function works for `mpq`, `mpz`, `xmpz`, Python's `Fraction`, `int` types, and types with the `__mpq__` or `__mpz__` conversion functions (these are for writing your own custom classes, they do not get added to existing types like `float`, so they aren't relevant here).\n\n`int` is in the list, so the argument `x` is ok, but `float` is not in that list, and `y` is a `float`, so that check fails.\n\nI believe if you write `print(test(4, gmpy2.mpq(2.0)))` this should work. The reason `qdiv` does not work on regular floating point numbers. `mpq` numbers are similar to `Decimal` or `Fraction` types in Python, storing a numerator and denominator, and as far as I'm aware they're always stored fully simplified, so `2.0` = 2/1, so as long as both arguments are integers in any of the supported types, the division operation should be simple integer division for which they have a highly optimized algorithm. Dividing by a float however is not that simple, and converting a standard `float` into `mpq` is additional work. `qdiv` is an optimized function that's trying to avoid doing unnecessary work, so it simply says \"no, you can't do this\".\n\nBecause it doesn't do any unnecessary work, `qdiv` is faster, but the price is that it's more restrictive about when it can be used. If you are trying to learn this library, you should be explicitly creating variables using the gmpy2 types rather than relying on the functions to work with regular Python types and do the conversions for you when necessary.",

On the page for Multiple Precision Reals: is\\_integer() → bool: Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise. Does gmpy2.is\\_integer() say that it only checks value as opposed to type somewhere in the docs and I just missed it?\n\nI'm not a professional programmer by any means, but maybe the description for gmpy2.is\\_integer() should include that it checks only if the value is equivalent to an integer, not type? Or maybe there should be a method in gmpy2 to check type, like the normal python isinstance? I think it'd be reasonable to think that if you saw that if is\\_integer returns True if x is an integer, and used gmpy2.is\\_integer() to check if something was an integer and it returned True, that it would be considered an integer while utilizing gmpy2.\n\nAnyways, \"There’s little reason to try to use qdiv in your test code\". I'm testing qdiv and gmpy2 in general because I plan to use it on other code that I'm working on that can use arbitrarily large numbers where you could set the inputs to just be integers, and I read that gmpy2 is great for large numbers and qdiv is faster than div.\n\nI was testing inputs for various arithmetic with gmpy2 and that's how I ran into this \"whole number\" float \"problem\".

Macs reign supreme in dev here though. \n\nThe one thing I will say is I don’t recommend a Microsoft anything when it comes to reliability support and such. They mostly just work, but when things go wrong it’s always annoying, longer and harder to fix than the other brand laptops we get in enterprise. Other OEM’s fair much better, especially the big enterprise players like HP, Lenovo, Dell (though dell do make some junk these days for enterprise laptops to hit that low lease cost). \n\nReally though at that price point my recommendation with no other info is a MacBook Air. Best support, they last ages, are pretty standard in dev and cs circles, etc. only downside is the hardware is limited to when Apple stop supporting it so after 8/9 years they stop getting security updates… but I’ve yet to daily a windows computer that lives half that time, Macs often do. They also have by far the best resale.\n\nMy advice is really save some coins on another brand windows laptop or spend those coins on a MacBook Air tbh.",

Wouldn't have touched any CSS/HTML though lol. \n\nThat said, theres things like memory management that I do not want to sit down and read through documentation or lengthy texts for, so maybe I'll skim through that lecture (seriously, I still don't know when/why to use a pointer) and the DS and Algo ones as well. Definitely feel like I should push myself into learning DSA properly though so a dedicated course for that might be my best option.\n\nDo you have any suggestions? Also, do you think it makes sense to go through basic fundamentals in C if I want to do C++? I know they're inherently different, but things like memory management (for example) would be important for me to understand anyway as I work on numerical code.",

The lectures are there to support the homework and to make sure you have the knowledge to complete the homework. In a good class, the teacher will simply have figured out good, small projects that are appropriate for the students' level. \n\nIf you are self-motivated to complete projects, and can self-assign appropriate projects, you don't need a beginner class.\n\nSince you're considering CS50x, I might hunt down whatever textbook Harvard's DSA class (or any other good CS university) uses and just buy it and go through it. Again, you have to do lots of homework programming projects. For DSA, be sure you do the math parts too. If you can implement a dozen data structures from scratch and analyze the time and memory complexity of a sort algorithm, you're golden.\n\nI would use a low-level language for the DSA class, C is good choice, but you can use C++ if you're careful about not exploiting too many C++ features. Learning DSA is learning what's going on under the hood of these higher-level languages. If you do DSA in C, you'll learn all the memory management you need. \n\nAnything beyond DSA is optional. Later classes will be specialization, or too abstract to be widely useful.",

Then divide by a million to estimate how long it takes to do each object. Then draw your own conclusions.\n\nIn an ideal world, you would do only as much allocation as necessary. But in the real world, you can get away with a huge amount of *relative* overhead, if the total *absolute* amount of work you're doing is still small. For a class project, nobody is going to care if your program takes 10 microseconds or 100 microseconds to process a command line.\n\nFor instance, in Python, every single string or integer object is malloc'ed on the heap, reference-counted, and freed when it goes out of scope. This overhead causes Python programs to often be several times slower than the equivalent C code. And yet, Python is still a perfectly usable language for a huge variety of applications.\n\nMy opinion is that before worrying about the *performance* of your program, you should worry about its *correctness*. If you want to avoid memory leaks and undefined behavior, then every time you `malloc` an object, you have to keep track of its lifetime and free it after it's no longer used. Sometimes that's necessary, but if you can avoid that complexity, you should. It's easy to make mistakes with object lifetimes in C, and there are basically no guardrails to catch your mistakes.",

I thought it might help you. Java not clicking with you was a mistake, sure, but you’re already owning it, and that matters way more.\n\nYou’ve got two months of severance and real experience behind you. You also have savings, which is a huge advantage. But bills aren’t going to pause. Use that time to brush up the parts you want to keep (frontend, JS, maybe some light backend in Node) and don’t punish yourself for not mastering an entirely new ecosystem overnight.

I just got promoted to level 2, making more money than ever.\n\nI thought, in the moment, that the day I got fired was the worst day of my life. Turns out, it was actually one of my best. If I somehow stayed in that position, I would not be a level 2, and I would be making so much less money.\n\nYou might not see it, but this honestly is a blessing. It sounds like the project just moved in a direction that you have little experience in, there are plenty of projects that desperate need the experience you have and will pay money for it.

        "body": "Idk, I never struggled to find a job either… until this year. Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. \n\nI think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.\n\n1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. \n\n2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.\n\n3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.\n\n\nIt’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.\n\nI’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review. I’d be so excited to just get the feedback ‘Yo, you didn’t do a good job solving this LC problem. Or your architecture skills and thought process isn’t what we are looking for’. But it’s just like… no one even gives you a chance to interview if you don’t BS your resume with AI. Then those are the pool of people you can hire, and the quality of the hiring goes down.",

Location is a major factor.\n\nIn markets like New York or Silicon Valley, you have people who have sacrificed years of their lives to prep for demanding positions, so every role that gets posted has a ton of competition. When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.\n\nI've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \\~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.\n\nWe get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy. (clear rate for a fully passing solution is probably about 5% of all candidates that reach that stage).\n\nI really think unemployed engineers who are having trouble securing an offer for months have the wrong strategy. They should be taking up these 'easy' low paying jobs, moving temporarily, and then continuing to interview for their hotshot Big Tech and Silicon Valley roles. A six figure salary in a medium cost of living area is better than sitting around all day waiting for the next OA.",

The quality of peers has declined. Interview intensity has gone way up. There is the expectation now that ai just makes it all happen magically and that we will be eliminated soon anyways. Dollar is worth less. \n\nThere was a time you could be good at one part of the stack and be paid well. Now the expectation is your good at fe, be, observability, continuous integration, testing, deployment, wireframes, reqs & documentation, etc. It used to be if the codebase was a mess or you weren’t familiar with some framework they would cut you slack of train you but less so now. It used to be a few devs in a room working through stuff. Now everyone’s remote on different continents crammed into tiny noisy apartments. You’re still supposed to manage to mentor them.  Usually most of the team has already been outsourced so they really don’t have the same skin in the game and your heads on the chopping block. The interview used to focus on your degree, likability, location, and experience.  It went from white boarding to take home test and live coding exams to leet code with ai graders kidding your voice and eye movements. Not to mention how everything’s flooded now so getting noticed / not getting duped leading up to the interview view is harder. The expectation of 2x ai productivity doesn’t account for the quality of the ai, existing code, or clarity of instructions. Then there is pay. It’s held strong in a way and even grown faster than other industries but the dollar is worth under 1/3 as much as ten years ago in terms of shelter, transportation, healthcare, and food. Then there’s the increase in domestic cs degrees coming online and the over hiring in the covid market rally which went to layoffs then to ai hiring. \n\nI’ve had 6 jobs in ten years and everyone has laid us off or been bought out. Some were productive, some kept the companies software alive, others had no idea what they wanted. Can definitely make you tired. But that’s why it’s a job, right? Made some money. Am I a fool for thinking I would still be hustling 25 years from now or not gambling my cash into the stonks? Probably… \n\nOut of work and just been studying for a few months.

If there is nothing left and no upward mobility then you’re just on autopilot until your skills become irrelevant. \n\nSecond option I ended up going with is leaving my chill, no growth company for one with a very strong tech culture. I saw my self stagnating and could already see myself being unemployable if I stayed there for 5 more years. And since joining my career growth has skyrocketed. Significantly better engineer with way more opportunities to continue to develop. School isn’t worth it unless you want a masters in a very specific field say ML.

Well, it's partly luck. Be very aware of little problems you have or others have and constantly ask, is there a digital solution for this problem?\n\nConstantly being aware and asking that question is part of it. The other part is throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks. You can be surprised what winds up working versus what you thought would work and was a great idea. What you are trying to do is find the outlier event in a large distribution - and that requires many, many trials until you hit it.\n\nYou'll never know if you don't test many innumerable ideas out in reality. The trick is to run these tests (as many as possible) without bankrupting your self and keeping the overhead low. One good principle to hold to is: \"what I think will work is irrelevant, what works is the only relevant thing\" - in other words, be REACTIVE and not PRO-ACTIVE. See if something might work - test it like a scientist with a hypothesis and then act based on objective observation. Good luck (you and the rest of us are going to need it...).\n\nAnd just accept that if you want a shot at success - you will have to endure many, many, endless trials that result in failure - until you hit the one that does not (hopefully).",

To be clear, I still wanted to work with code or software, (I don't have any other skills) but for a company that uses those as tools for a business that is not tech related. \n\nNo luck there. Most non-tech companies never responded to my applications. And eventually, I got another job in Silly Valley.\n\nI can't complain. First, I have a job, and these days that's appreciable. Then the pay is roughly equivalent to what I was getting at my previous position. And finally, the company 's culture suits me well. But it is 100% a tech company. That's their core business. I couldn't transition out of the industry.\n\nMaybe next time (but my hope is that after this, in a couple of years, I can stop working full time)",

        "body": "Just for a different perspective:\nI remember that first year out of uni as also very stressful and draining.  I felt that I knew very little, the culture was kinda weird,  there were some big egos and seasoned jaded ultra senior devs that kinda left a trail of bitterness in the air. Competition, devs being passive aggresive, putting down each other, one upping each other. I didnt know it for the first year, but that company was very unprofessional and amateurish even though quite successful and big. It was a software company developing b2b solutions. \n\nAfter a while I noticed I was sitting with the same stack, same flows, almost the same user stories all the time. I felt like I was living groundhog day and definitely thought I made a huge mistake choosing this career. \nI realised I cant be working on the same product for 20 years. And I thought all dev jobs were gonna be like this and I had no ther skills.\n\nAfter almost 2 years I couldnt take it anymore, I needed to get out. I also, much like you, wanted to pivot immediately. \n \nThe easiest transition and most obvious solution for me was consultancy. \n\nI first joined a tech consultancy firm and the atmosphere change was night and day. Suddenly it was in their best interest to get me official certifications (they can sell you better to clients if you have a shiny cv), so it felt like being back at uni a bit, with studying for exams etc.\nAfter that, I got to work with a lot of different projects for different clients in different industries. The projects would be anything from delivering an MVP within 6 months internally for a client/company A to being placed as a dev on site and joining the team at client/company B - contracts could range from 6 months to a year and could always be extended or if things didnt work out my manager would pull me out earlier. It was the BEST experience because I got to work wkth very many different people that taught me loads.\nUnfortunately, change  in management + politics and the economy suddenly dried up the assignment pipeline and I was left on the bench for way too long. I decided to jump ship. \n\nI now work at a non-tech financial firm as part of their internal tech team. My team develops solutions for our non tech employees around the globe. This means many projects, some small, some big with many different focuses and tech stacks. I work primarily with people that studied computer science as a minor and kinda fell into development by chance. My role is to help professionalise their solutions. And I love it. I am not surrounded by tech mentality at all... its just finance and law. A nightmare for any brogrammer that yearns for silly valley and definitely not without its pain points. But for me its the best of both worlds, cos im still in tech, actively coding and architecting but the expectations are way lower, theres competition between finance bro and finance bro, but that doesnt affect me. Finance bros have to work Christmas but we do not, in fact we shouldn't really develop or ship anything during that time cos getting new update before year close makes finance bros very nervous haha. And now with AI in the air, our teams budget got increased, and we are encouraged to find novel ways to help make the firms employees more efficient/productive. That means a lot of autonomy to explore new tech stacks and solutions. It is genuinely fun again. A bit chaotic, but without the stress and expectation of greatness. \n\nAnyway... Just wanted to say theres better things out there. And that tech doesnt have to be too techy. Theres a light on the other side.",

The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.\n\nThis framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.\n\nIf the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.\n\n**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.\n\nThat’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.\n\nThis gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.\n\nIf your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management. That’s unfortunate, but it is a separate problem from how you should handle the situation with your coworker.",

The network DOES matter, but it takes a lot more effort to integrate yourself when you're an online student.

You're under new management, so there's no point being a nail that sticks out while they're looking to get things settled in.\n\n\nBut it's also a pretty strong warning to freshen up your CV or resume and start applying to other places. Early January is usually an awesome time to be jobseeking, so see if you get any bites. It's also still early enough that you can continue seeking with your current title -- you already have history and experience working at that level, and performed well enough that you were hired or promoted into it. So your resume will still largely reflect your assigned duties and experience for 3-6 months.\n\n\nSomething else to consider is that your manager is giving you an option here, which is *super* unusual. That sounds like they want to keep you, but budgets may be too squeezed right now for your current paygrade. As far as I'm aware, it's unusual for a manager to give this option instead of just issuing a termination. It might be that the department's budget can fit you, at least for the upcoming few quarters, if they demote and reduce your salary. Obviously your call on whether you want to voluntarily earn less to stay with them, but you do say you're not being set up for success here.\n\n\nWhere I live, unless it's an especially toxic workplace or you get a reasonable severance package, it's better to jobseek and make them lay you off (rather than quitting). If you quit, you lose access to some unemployment benefits.",

It helps to understand the difference between hard and soft interrupts, how registers work and why for example \"boolean\" data won't likely save any actual memory vs an int...or if it does why it's now slower than an int.\n\nIt's *always* beneficial to understand what is going on under the hood of the higher level constructs you're using.  Maybe not frequently down to the assembly level, but the deeper your knowledge and understanding the better decisions and code you write no matter what level you're working at.\n\nMy recommendation is to learn a little assembly, but do so on small, easy processors.  I learned back on 65c02 and Z80.  Today AVR and run it on a classic Arduino is probably a good route to cover the concepts enough to be useful without making your brain explode the way x86 will. ;)",

        "body": "Sorry to hear it, this is a rough spot to be in. The biggest thing that’s going to hold you back is making it through resume screening, and without any internship or real production experience it’s going to be very hard. \n\nMy biggest suggestion is to network at companies where a referral actually helps you get your foot in the door and pushes you through the automated resume system. This means FAANG+ and big tech are out the door, as a referral will hold very little weight, and even if a real person reviews it, lack of experience will likely be your down fall. Connect with as many people as you can at smaller companies - even if that’s <200 employees. It might not even be a software company. Many CS majors have a “FAANG/Big tech or bust” philosophy and see everything else as a failure. If that’s you, you must put your pride away and take any chance you can get. This is a stepping stone, not the final form of your career.\n\nThe next thing is to get very good at interviewing, leetcode, and preparing for a specific companies interview. This much is obvious, but your hit rate for interviews will be low, so when you do get one, you need to maximize the opportunity.\n\nI’d also really inspect how meaningful your personal projects are. I was surprised at how much weight they pulled during my interviews/screening, and I was told by multiple interviewers it made a large impression - which also means I got grilled on them so they could verify it was real/I did it lol. If your projects are very generic, even if done well, they likely aren’t helping as much as you think. Pick something you’d really love to learn about or make - maybe hobby related  - and flesh it out a ton. The more niche/specific, the more memorable. Document well, consistent pushes, make graphs of your data and put them in the repo, reference research papers that informed decisions, etc.\n\nLastly, I’d genuinely consider if a masters is right for you. New grad applications are already hell on earth, but doing them with no internship will be a challenge and a half. A masters degree puts you back in “intern” status before you finish it, so if you put your all into the things above during intern apps, you would likely snag some. Once you’re back to new grad apps, you could have an internship(s), maybe some light research experience (even if no paper), TA positions, and a higher degree. \n\nGood luck, and give yourself some grace while understanding what you’re willing to do for the job.",

It sounds like a couple smaller businesses and proprietorships I've seen around here. But you're saying it's a *median software* company. The only ones I'm aware of that meet that kind of description (near me) would be Revature and other WITCH companies. They keep devs benched on small projects, and try to get you placed with a client so they earn a cut of your salary and you get experience. Sometimes they'll exaggerate your skills to get a bigger salary cut.\n\n\nAre you working on a greenfield project that the company doesn't really need, but feels is a worthwhile gamble? Are you an intern or in training right now? Those are the contexts where I could understand assigning a solo dev at a company. Where the risks are very low and you might not be working on the company's main revenue streams.",

Either tech is a secondary focus, or you're isolated from the tech center of your company. I worked at a tech consulting company/digital agency, and they had someone on staff who helped the accounting team. After that person resigned, the company would ask random people for help on things. He didn't use version control.\n\nThis isn't normal, but I don't think it's completely unique, as you hear stories about people who have this experience. In the old days, teams were responsible for their own IT and work, and you'd have teams spring up like this all across departments, until they brought in someone to organize everything. I should probably say \"if\" rather than \"until.\" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. \n\nIs there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? \n\nI also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example. The tech leads did everything, and the people on the management side didn't do much work outside of call names during daily standups. They certainly didn't understand any of the work from a business perspective. There are all levels of bad companies out there.",

First thought, the directors that are still there in the program are generally really good as far as being kind/good humans go. Second though, its a great program for starting your career. You'll grow a really large network of other early stage engineers really quickly and when everyone inevitably scatters within 3-5 years you'll have that network at a lot of other tech companies as a result.\n\nI will say, the work is a mixed bag. For one of my rotations I was a data analyst and it was the most boring thing on earth (old school SAP WEBI work). For the other I was building ML models in Azure which was a lot better (I stuck with that rotation post tdp). I think the biggest downside is that the pay stagnates super hard post TDP if you dont end up in a good title. Some of my friends came out as senior software engineers around 140k, others (like me) came out with much less glamorous titles doing roughly the same work at 110k. Pay disparity was just a function of what business unit you ended up in and what titles that business unit would allow. I left after 4 years for a sizeable pay increase, but ATT TDP definitely allowed me to grow some good leadership skills while I was there and the friends I made in that program are still in my social circles today",

I don’t know what your projects are but simple capstone and full stack node projects probably just aren’t going to cut it, as literally every new grads has those and they pale in comparison to real dev experience. I think my best advice would be to A) start contributing to open source or start a serious side project to get something eye popping on your resume or B) look for a adjacent job like IT, get your foot in with the company and try to transfer to being a dev eventually.  Obviously you could continue cold applying (it’s pretty much what I did lol) but it feels a lot like finding a needle in a haystack and ur new grad status is probably running out.",

Real interview is the 2nd or 3rd interview where they actually grill you on technical stuff. So if you aren't even getting that far...\n\nYour capstone from school should not be a listed project unless it was high quality. That's kind of a joke and if you're listing that on your resume I could see employers tossing your resume then and there.\n\nYour projects need to be professional level. What exactly are your projects built in? How are they deployed? Do they integrate testing, CI/CD, and more advanced cloud microservices than just something like vercel, github pages, or ec2/s3? Do they use cloud orchestration in any way or IAC?\n\nI'd recommend getting your AWS Developer Associate cert. I went from zero interviews to weekly interviews once I got that.\n\nIf you aren't getting interviews though, it's because your resume is weak. How do you list your skills? What skills are listed? Are you tailoring each resume to each application? Stop applying and build up your resume.\n\nReaching out to alumni is a waste imo. You should network locally, which will take at least 6 months imo to build up. But once you start seeing familiar faces, people start recommending you, you recommend people to those hiring (ie if you're a full stack guy, work with a UI/UX guy and help them get a job, they help you).\n\nSounds like your projects and resume are weak, so you aren't even getting interviews. Once you start landing interviews, that's a whole other thing you gotta hone in, being able to explain things, understand things conceptually, know when to use what vs another... So you know, I'd expect another 3-6 months minimum of study on top of that once you start getting interview experience.\n\nTry to find an unpaid internship is also my advice.",

I'd personally find it hard to justify using k8s / preferring availability just for this. Also, a core principle of SRE is having an error budget that you want to actually spend (i.e. having services that are \\*too\\* reliable is \\*bad\\*). I'd be a bit apprehensive to hire a senior whose recommendation is \"reliability at the cost of everything else\".\n\n## Too much human reliance\n\n\"A justification in the PR, and/or\"\n\nPersonally, not a big fan of answers that boils down to \"let humans do this X process\". Humans are faulty, and manual processes tend to get ignored over time (e.g. people just rubber-stamping the justification).\n\n\"At each stage, monitor:\"\n\nThis also seems like an extra toil that can be done automatically.\n\nIn general, adding more bureucracy / slowing down development for the sake of needless reliability is also bad, similar to above.\n\n## Seems pretty textbook\n\nOverall, your answers give me the vibe of \"recommend the commonly recommended thing, just because that's best practice, without further thought\", like immediately jumping to k8s, specific DB, and so on.\n\nIn the system design interview, I think I'd personally like to see how you think from the fundamentals and the first principle more, rather than just giving me a list of technologies immediately:\n\n- For a simple webapp, do we \\*really\\* need to use k8s? You're signing up your team to eat a lot of dev / knowledge cost before even hearing the full constraint of the problem.\n\n- Before jumping into the details, why not verify more fundamental things? e.g. do we need redundancy across different regions?\n\n- NoSQL theoretically scales horizontally better, but is that true in reality? In a lot of cases, there is a mismatch between theory and reality. Similar to how linked list are faster than arrays on paper for some use case, but they tend to be slower in reality due to caching performance.\n\n## Random nit\n\n'“What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.' \n\nIncorrect? I'd expect the answer to be 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. I'd personally shrug it as nervousness / misunderstanding, but maaaaybe there's a small chance of interviewers really disliking it (e.g. \"this person has only ever deployed things on localhost\") since that's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong.\n\nDon't beat yourself up too much though, interview fails sometimes do just happen randomly (e.g. there just happen to be unicorn candidate right after you). From the post, it seems like you're a pretty strong candidate and the interview itself went pretty well.\n\nI think the core of the issue is that a senior SRE should be someone who knows why we need to follow mainstream recommendations, and when we should not follow them. I'm not saying you don't have that quality, but I think the way you answer the interview questions did not necessarily demonstrate that due to the textbook answer and overemphasis on reliability above all.",

One enhancement: frame your debugging narrative around measurable outcomes. Instead of just \"add alerts,\" try \"implement alerts on CrashLoopBackOff with a threshold of X failures in Y minutes, reducing MTTR by Z%.\" Concrete metrics make your experience more verifiable and demonstrate production impact.\n\n\n\nFor system design—your answers were directionally correct. The feedback about being more concrete is key. When discussing rate limiting or scaling strategies, reference specific implementations you've actually built or studied. \"In a previous project, I implemented X pattern which handled Y req/s\" is stronger than theoretical answers. Even side projects count if they're deployed and measurable.\n\n\n\nThe rejection stings, but use this experience to build a portfolio of implemented systems you can reference. Deploy a small web app with the observability/scaling patterns you discussed. Document it thoroughly. Next interview, you'll have concrete proof of these concepts in action rather than just theoretical knowledge.\n\n\n\nWhat specific areas do you want to strengthen with hands-on projects?",

I wouldn't have the same level of problem solving skills because I simply wouldn't have been forced to bang my head against a problem until I figured it out.\n\nI think it's similar to why the adventure game genre like King's Quest/Myst/Monkey Island/etc just aren't popular anymore. You don't spend days/weeks trying to figure out the puzzle, or brainstorm with friends/co-workers on what you might be missing. If you're stuck, you just go online and look up a guide for where you're stuck so you can move on. Maybe if you have good self-motivation and *want* to solve it yourself you can try and work through it - but you still know that the answer is a quick search away when that wasn't even an option before (yeah yeah, eventually there were things like the Nintendo Power Help Line, but that was still a MUCH higher barrier and often cost money compared to how easy it is now.)",

One like you'd probably see downtown amongst homeless people, where they're going around talking to themselves, detached and in their own world, and they can't be bothered. That kind of mental illness. It's a real barrier and sense of struggle for those who have it and I don't wish it on anyone. So yeah for now, because I got my brain back through very risky means and have seen the light that I had prior to all this medicated bullshit run they've put me on, I learn for the sake of getting back on track to where I was prior to all this and also just for the sake of learning. I have a whole new perspective, aside from jobs, just the will and need to keep my brain sharp and exercised all the time, and hopefully not become some egotistical / arrogant prick like I did last time. My goal is strong mental skills + strong social skills. I've been without a brain for 3 years due to the debilitation of the drugs I was on/ But I've practiced my social skills through in person retail for about 2.5 years while I was recovering from my last episode and subsequent treatment. So living without yourself for that long, makes you want to strike oil while its hot, so now that i'm back, probably as a temporary thing as the new drugs will kick in and most likely debilitate me again, I'm trying to be as sharp as possible, as if I'm storing up on information for the eventual hibernation lol.",

But I encourage you to apply for a relevant diploma or degree if you'd like better job security. Many government employers, companies with long-term contracts, and tech companies can afford to be selective. A related degree gives you more options, more offers, and helps keep you off the chopping block when a company needs easy staff to lay off. Since you've got a degree and some CS courses, you can potentially ladder that into a major and/or get transfer credits.\n\n\nAll that said, what's your non-STEM degree? A handful of them can be leveraged for specific positions in the industry, and any bachelors' does allow you to apply for more international working visas.",

For me if yo have to get loans or pay most of it out of pocket. It is not worth to get it. Because at a certain point experience trumps the degree and the pay bump you might get from the degree wont be enough to justify the cost. Like my first job after college i only had my bachelor's degree. I came in as a SWE1, that job automatically made master's degrees SWE2. But the pay bump was only by like 7k or so. Not enough to justfiy getting 30k+ in loans in my opinion. \n\nI got my master's degree through my job that paid for it. What i will say is master's degree will get you in the door more. But it wont get you the job. You may hjear back more about interviews but again you wont get the job. Tbh i forget i have a master's degree sometimes. \n\nUnless you can get it for free or pay minimal cost and have someone else pay for most of it. It's not worth getting a master's degree in this field. Most big tech jobs care more about the experience than the master's degree.",

My opinion.\n\nAt the beginning of your career, you're pretty much like every other CS grad, a big lump of clay that they have to teach and mold.  You might get a few more $$$ due to the higher education, but not enough to offset the extra 2 years and expense of getting the MS over the Bachelor's.\n\nAt the middle of your career, for dev jobs they're mainly interested in your tech experience and what you can do.  They don't want the lump of clay anymore, they want the refined tool for their tech stack or subject matter / industry.  So for basic dev jobs most would rather hire a person with the right experience than somebody who's never done the work they're doing but who has a Masters.  Which is when you try to get promoted.\n\nFor companies / leaders that are credential-focused, you'll be more of a promotion target.  With the MS-CS, that's team lead or architect.  With an MBA, that's management.  Whether or not you're deserving of those roles is another question, but for companies or leaders who focus on credentials, you'll move ahead of peers who lack them.  At the end of your career, that mid-career trajectory bears fruit.\n\nSo the question is, what path do you want?  If you don't know -- and it's OK that you don't know, job experience will help you figure this out -- then I'd skip the Masters for now.  Because you can always get it (or an MBA) later.\n\nIn \\~26 years in this industry, I've never seen a person with a Masters stand out so much that I wondered why and then discovered that they had a Masters.  That has happened for me with PhD's, that we give super interesting technical problems to and they come up with innovative solutions.  But I haven't seen that with just a MS-CS.",

There are also certain programs from certain colleges,  like Andy Bernard’s Alma mater that are just extremely overpriced O’Reilly courses .  \n\nYou could have gotten that 100k DS job if you went to George Tech’s online Masters. And keep in mind that entry level DS job exists only when the economy is good . \n\nAs someone who does work with LLM models and AI engineering , I personally would raise an eyebrow if I saw AI Masters on your resume . I wouldn’t throw away your resume but I would be asking you questions like explain the Transformer Architecture and the Self-Attention Mechanism.

If you're having issues w/ lack of vocabulary/articulation, chances are that your fundamentals are lacking. You can go about filling the gaps either in a top-down way (e.g. start from what you know and work \"downwards\" into lower levels) or bottom-up (e.g. start from from C/ASM and work your way up back to high level).\n\nThe former tends to be a more pragmatic form of learning. You can, for example, go from knowing about calling fetch (vs whatever is the abstraction for it in your favorite framework) to RPC/REST to HTTP spec (what different headers do, etc) or go from ORMs to raw SQL to reading about db normalization, etc.\n\nThe bottom-up approach is useful for getting stronger at fundamentals, e.g. reading source code for hashmap implementations in various languages can help you understand how they actually work wrt memory layout, complexity, etc.\n\nWith that said, senior level isn't necessarily about those. There's some level of importance in being able to accurately convey technical ideas via jargon, but equally (or perhaps more) important is communicating at an appropriate level for the audience (e.g. a junior vs a director). You're not really going to find resources on how to navigate this stuff, your best bet is imitate your seniors until it becomes natural.",

Do 2 problems at least a night (1 hr) If you have to redo easys until you get it, do that. I would say spend 10 min on ur own on the problem if you can’t figure it out watch neetcode solution - then do it and then wait two days and try and do it on ur own and then if you forget watch the solution again. Copy and paste all ur solutions in a Google doc so u can go back to them (cause you most likely will have pseudo code next to it). Keep doing this with the easys until ir makes sense to you and you can technically explain what is happening, watching neetcode solution more than once will help you because you will start speaking technically and confidently. And then when you’re good at all the problems u previously did time box yourself for 30 min to work on the same problem - pretend it’s an interview by then u will be confident because you have done this easy problem more than once. And just repeat for mediums and hards (time box 60 min) \n\n\nMaybe you should also go back to the fundamentals in the language ur comfortable using (w3 schools), relearning OOP principles and other things you might have forgotten. \n\n\nUse ai to help you study, ask it to ask you interview question and then you write the answer  or if you don’t know what the algorithm solution is doing when reviewing the solution ask it to go through each iteration. Also ask DeepSeek (ai I use) to make you a study plan. But regardless you should do hacker hour where no matter what you do 1 hr of algorithms (at least 2 problems a day). Also use pomodoro where you study for 25 min and then you get a 5 min reward to scroll or get up and stretch or lay down. I use my Apple Watch to do it because it buzzes.

Yeah you can Google it on the side, but a lot of times it's easier to briefly pause the meeting and have it explained by the person doing the talking. It signals that you're paying attention and willing to learn. I've had a lot of positive feedback about my willingness to do that, from both the business folks using acronyms I don't know and colleagues who were similarly confused but not confident enough to speak up.\n\n\nHonestly it sounds like you're selling yourself short a bit. I had some excellent mentors that beat in the idea of advocating for yourself in a corporate world, and being willing to make a change if the company you work for won't accommodate that.\n\n\nThat said, I also went through a destructive leadership turnover cycle and it fuckin sucked! I was having full on panic attacks and needed to consult a therapist to get through it, and I think I've come out the other side more resilient. \n\n\nSo do what you need to do, and if that involves seeking some professional help that's absolutely okay. My therapist likes to remind me that a significant portion of her clients are there for work related anxiety. Software Engineering is a high-stakes, high-stress career field.\n\n\nOh! Also, therapy exposed that I had a sleeping disorder which caused me a lot of physical symptoms like brain fog, difficulty focusing, and memory problems. Anxiety can absolutely play a role in that too, but in my case it was physical symptoms making my anxiety worse not the other way around.",

For any concept or specific interaction  between technologies I'm not 100% certain about or haven't touched in a while, I make a little sandbox on my personal computer with practical examples that I type out (not paste from google/ai) and play around with it for a day or 2 and leave some notes in markdown in the folder.\n\nSometimes you haven't worked with a technology in depth for months, I come back to those folders in such times and its a quick memory boost, imo more than you'd get if you simply read up on it or googled a singular question.\n\nFlashcards are decent for interviews but imo not amazing for in depth knowledge.\n\n2. Intelligence can't be faked (at least when working with intelligent people), trying to sound smart isn't a cool look. The people who work with you will know how well you know your stuff in the same way that I assume *you* know how well each of your colleagues knows your stuff - usually some are a cut above the rest, no matter where you work.\n\nI think you taking the time to write this post shows you care about your knowledge which is frankly more important than how \"smart\" you are in the first place, I'm sure it's really tiring being a sole provider and most people would also have trouble finding the energy to upskill in your shoes. Not always possible, but maybe try stealing a bit of work time to read up/practice if possible, when you're less tired during the day. Best of luck!\n\n  \nEDIT: Also, some times you just wont get a promotion - regardless of how well you do, there's many variables deciding who gets promoted - so don't take it to heart. The opinion your peers and/or technical leadership have of you and you work is more indicative of your skills than a promotion.",

The thinking goes: if I can’t get a job as a SWE, I’ll just *drop down* a rung or two and get one of those jobs. \n\nWhile there is very significant skill overlap between various positions in software engineering and IT, it’s not really a hierarchy. There are people just like you who have trained and educated themselves for those jobs, and they’re struggling just as hard as you are because hiring in all tech jobs sucks equally right now. If you “drop down” to one of those jobs, you’re just another applicant, but you don’t necessarily even have the same qualifications as those other applicants. (I hear your question about getting some of those qualifications). \n\nLong story short, in my opinion, there’s no reason to believe that switching focus to IT jobs will lead to more job opportunities than in the field you have been preparing for in college.",

The market for new grads has just been brutal, especially if you didn’t get a return offer lined up before graduating.\n\nGoing into IT is a totally reasonable move if you treat it as a bridge, not a dead end. GeekSquad + Network+ + cloud certs can absolutely move you toward DevOps or SRE if you keep one foot in software. Plenty of people have gone IT → sysadmin → DevOps once they could show scripting, automation, and cloud work.\n\nThe key is to not stop building or talking like an engineer. Keep shipping small projects, automate stuff at work if you can, write scripts, mess with CI/CD, cloud deployments, monitoring. That’s what makes the transition believable later. If you fully pivot away from coding for a few years, it’s harder to come back.\n\nAlso, you’re doing a lot right already. Hackathons, freelance, startup, networking, referrals, interviews. The lack of offers isn’t because you’re weak, it’s just timing and competition. IT can give you income, experience, and momentum while the market recovers.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned is that interviews reward people who can clearly explain what they’ve built and why. During interviews I’ve used StealthCoder to keep my thoughts structured on screen so I don’t undersell myself or blank, especially when my path isn’t “traditional.” That helps when you’re coming from IT or mixed backgrounds.\n\nShort answer: yes, IT can be a smart move if you’re intentional about it. Just don’t mentally give up on engineering if that’s what you actually want.",

That should not be much of a filtering step, at least compared to getting that initial phone screen, then passing the full interview cycle. Everything here is a skill you can work on!",

IT is another field just like CS within the tech umbrella and that is why I decided to give it a try, not because I think its easy, but because I find it very interesting. \n\nAnother reason I wanted to try it is because the barrier of entry is significantly lower for roles like IT Helpdesk and so on, as opposed to a New Grad Software Developer role; and the fact that certifications actually do have some weight in this field make it even better since I am finishing school right now and cant take any electives anymore.\n\nI have heard of people who started in IT and then transitioned to a mode code heavy role or things like DevOps and stuff like that and that was basically what I was asking, if someone has had a similar experience, since I personally am not going to sit around waiting for a CS role when I can start now in an adjacent field.\n\nAgain thanks a lot!!!!",

I don't think you realize how even people in their 20s don't even know what they wanna do in tech. \n\nLearn as much as u can dude you have plenty of time. I wouldn't stress about it. Don't be like me in high school. I had ideas that I didn't turn into actual things because I thought it \"was a waste of time\" and that it wouldn't impress recuriters and blah blah blah. Prob my biggest regret is not making the Minecraft mod I've thought of or that funny website.\n\nThe fact you already have some internship in high school will put you ahead of 99% of CS majors, let alone programming since u were a kid. I barely touched code outside of Scratch until I was 15 for god sake. You'll be fine. My recommendation is to reach out to people in different sectors of CS and ask them for a coffee chat, or go on something like Discord and talk with fellow people in the industry. Not only will you maybe learn more about different fields, but you'll be building your network, and I'ma be honest, the people you know will be the reason why you get the job most the time. It's how I got my internship and potentially my first full time position as an app dev.",

A good portion of the team took this as him being argumentative again. I tried to argue their case, but honestly, the team was full of assholes. The director from HR had a huge ego and wanted to say anyone who had been laid off was laid off for a reason, and one of the interviewers wanted to lowball candidates, especially if they had been laid off. You can't really predict how people will act. \n\nJust be honest if they reach out and ask for clarification. If they ask, and they should if they discover an inconsistencies, you can say things changed and you were never asked. FWIW, I offered up that I had been laid off during my interview process. I was originally employed when contacted, but I got laid off along the way. An interviewer asked something where I could have glossed it over, but I decided to be honest about it. I'm not saying honesty is always the best policy. I certainly wish I had kept it to myself during salary negotiation, but they did give me more than I had originally asked for.",

If everyone hates it, do something else. Or adapt the process so it works for you.\n\n\nIf you have people in your daily standup who aren't interested in what you're doing, your standup is too large. If most of the attendees are checking their phone or laptop instead of paying attention to who's speaking, your standup is too large. If you find that happening, bring it up with the team and make smaller groups.\n\n\nI honestly feel like a sprint longer than a week is generally too long, although this varies depending on what you're trying to do. I also find this to be a general indication that your stories are too large and need to be broken down more. Agile is all about fast feedback and two weeks to a month (or longer) is too long to go without feedback. If you do shorter sprints, you do need to have much shorter ceremonies as well.\n\n\nIf you have on-call during your sprint, you should reduce the number of stories you plan to handle that sprint. Agile is all about prioritizing things and empowering developers. So if the on-call is the highest priority thing, you as a developer should take that into account when planning out the sprint. Based on past results, if on-call consumes your entire time during the sprint, accept no stories that sprint.\n\n\nYou guys aren't really an agile shop, but very few places are.",

In each case, the emblem is mistaken for the discipline it represents.\n\nManagers clutching notes and markers are seldom distant from this same pattern of thought.\n\nThere is little to be done to reverse it. Cultural change is slow, costly, and perilous, and many will resist it with quiet persistence or open force, for the familiar order offers comfort and shelter.\n\nFor a season, one may even learn to navigate - and perhaps benefit from - such dysfunction.

Understand concepts like bean, bean lifecycle, constructor injection, application context. The spring framework is rich, learning to leverage its robust ecosystem to solve rudimentary problems is a key to success. \n\nThe second thing that helped me was understanding design patterns. This one is somewhat controversial. Some people think that they only exist to cover up for language flaws and that they lead to overly abstracted code. Those people aren't wrong but don't worry about joining the debate. Whether or not you believe in using them you will see them all over your code base. [neetcode: 8 design patterns every developer should know](https://youtu.be/tAuRQs_d9F8?si=My6PZMe7diw444c9) this is a decent intro, I'd recommend finding a modern book in java to continue this. \n\nNext recommendation depends on what versions of Java your company leverages. Java has a robust collection interface that makes it very easy to do many operations on a collection of data though method changing. The stream API. (Java 9)  Java 21 added virtual threads, a huge improvement for concurrency when using I/O heavy processes. \n\nGood luck.",

Collect some simple data on the things that matter to you. Ensure you're making regular progress on the things that matter to you, and doing things you enjoy, with some regularity. Backsliding is OK, bad days are OK. Focus on the big picture. Key thing is to understand, if you introduced a change, did it have a measurably positive effect. You could bounce into a new job and be just as, if not more, miserable. Again, backsliding is OK, but it's important to understand when you're making forward progress and when you're backsliding.\n2. Work with people you actually like. Working with assholes, absent subcontractors, and awful customers aged me substantially.\n3. Exercise. Doesn't matter what, doesn't matter when, focus on building the habit.\n4. Diet. Learn the basics of cooking if you aren't already capable. Track your calories/macros for long enough to have a good \"broad strokes\" understanding of what you're putting into your body, and what your specific body/lifestyle actually needs nutrition-wise.\n5. Have a ***social*** hobby that you engage in regularly. Challenging as an adult with marriage, mortgage, kids, indigent parents or loved ones, etc. But again, build the habit.\n\nI lean on 2, 3, 5, and my family pretty heavily during the rougher weeks. Sometimes the family is the ***reason*** for the rougher weeks and I have a frank talk with my boss -- a person I work with and actually like -- about chasing some shiny objects for a bit instead of my current priorities.

That portfolio got callbacks for applied LLM engineer and research engineer more than generic DS. Realistic targets imo are applied LLM, research engineering, and platform style roles focused on retrieval, eval harnesses, and prompt tooling. I split time 70 percent project, 30 percent interview drills. I used timed mocks with Beyz coding assistant alongside prompts from the IQB interview question bank, and I kept a STAR story bank with 90 second answers.

There's a difference of being a degree mill and having a high acceptance rate in order to farm as many average students as possible versus being a competitive program that is selective to get into.\n\nThe original comment is correct from what I've experienced, no one has really cared if it's research versus course based, and if they were looking specifically for research they would end up gatekeeping to the PhD level.",

I get a front row seat to listen for our customer's requirements while in meetings with our sales rep and the common question floats \"Do you sell AI in your product?\".\n\nPeople are hyped for AI, that includes our business customers, and its taking great effort for us to bake AI into our product and compete on time. We're being charged more than what a big company would be charged for using AI services because our projected volume of consuming AI tokens are much smaller than big companies. Big companies are winning the competition in many markets right now as they have more resources and investments to spend with getting their AI services into the market much sooner with more precision.\n\nWith that being said, we've buckled down and locked in the team with more hats to wear, haven't had a new hire in our department since the layoffs.\n\nwhen the AI hype is over, people and businesses will realize the valuable relationship and products that come from these small/medium businesses and come back. Once once they see gains in revenue, I believe they'll open up positions as they're confident they can support a bigger workforce once again.\n\nAnother opportunity for more positions to open up with small/medium businesses is tax breaks and or more affordable AI services these businesses can use for selling AI features in their products to compete in the competitive market.",

The only thing you'd have to worry about is a potentially smaller selection of hot startups.
