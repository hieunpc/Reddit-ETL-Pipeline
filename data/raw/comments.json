There's simply so many more people with those skills today then there was 10-15 years ago.\n\n10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.\n\n5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.\n\nIn the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring. Okay, they found plenty of candidates that can code, can interpret data, and have AWS experience, now can we narrow the list down to candidates that have specifically our industry experience? The answer to that is yes, companies can do that now; there's just so many candidates.\n\nIf you've been in the workforce long enough, you'll start to notice trends. The key is identifying the next trend before it happens.",

        "body": "I prefer to build streaming first.  It's not about the speed for me.  \n\nFirst, it's about control and localizing failure.  To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV.  That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled.  Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran.  If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements.  I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle.  It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.\n\nSecond, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another.  You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining.  If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead.  Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead.  I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do.  If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.\n\nLastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.  Mostly stateless operations with pipes in between.  Streaming tooling seems to map to this mental model better for me.",

Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.\n\nThey all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).\n\nNoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.\n\nWarehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",

Performance thinking\\*\\*: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider \"how would this perform on millions of rows?\" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT \\*, think about index usage.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*2. Data quality patterns\\*\\*: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW\\_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*3. Incremental processing\\*\\*: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads - using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think \"how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*4. Set-based thinking\\*\\*: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*5. Real-world scenarios\\*\\*: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like:\n\n\\- Detecting duplicate orders\n\n\\- Calculating running totals/moving averages  \n\n\\- Handling NULL values and edge cases\n\n\\- Transforming nested/JSON data\n\n\n\nFor Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: \"I’m using a CTE here for readability\" or \"This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…\"\n\n\n\nGood luck!",

You are on-site 100% of the time.  I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey.  Made me give up all of my hobbies post work.  Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6).  Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic\n* Labs are often in shitty locations.  Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time.  Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat\n* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works.  In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained.  Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.\n* No windows can be quite common in buildings.  Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)\n* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for.  Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older\n* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh).  I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD\n* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech.  You can't google and hit the right answer easily.  You really have to know what you are asking the internet.  Even then, the answers are likely not widely published.  People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers\n* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension.  For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions.  I have never seen that figure in IT\n\nLife as a DE:\n\n* Work from home is an option.  If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled\n* A much lower barrier to entry.  The idea you \"need\" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks.  DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is.  It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree\n* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close.  If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back.  I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc.  You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable\n* General working is a lot easier.  Synthesis of a product can take a long time.  A long one is multiple days if not weeks.  You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE\n* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful.  The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or \"has to\" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)\n* Zero manual labour.  Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is.  So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot.  Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl\n* Salaries are way higher on average.  After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industry\n\nSo what I'm saying is life is relative.  If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.  As somebody coming in from the other way in, it's definitely greener within the IT industry.",

Instead .replace operations you use assignement. Strings and datetime gets some changes as well as categorical types. Some changes with pd.read_excel as well. Slicing and a lot of your operations need to be explicit now instead of implicit. \n\nWhats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.\n\nSecond Answer:\n\nUse polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.\n\nJust 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.\n\nThe main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",

I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-\n\n1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. \n2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. \n3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. \n\nStart with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. \n\nMicrosoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. \n\nOne thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you. So figure out how to make it your puppet, you will win. \n\nYou WILL have an aha moment after 2-3 months and it will kick in. You will feel like you have a new superpower and feel like you have new energy. Every engineer I work with internally and externally has this moment if they break through the initial inertia - but it’s exhausting for those who have been grinding for years. \n\nYou got this!",

The fundamentals are still the same, so once you are able to figure out what the parallels are between the old and new tools you'll be in good shape.\n\nLearning Python is highly recommended, with maybe Go or TypeScript as a backup language. Learning how to use Pandas and later PySpark will help too. Data pipelines are now typically coded by hand in a programming language, or else configured in a tool like DLT or Bruin (ingestion tools) along with other tools like DBT for transformation. Definitely not impossible to transition, but be aware that it's a very different world than ODI, DataSphere, Cognos, Talend, or Informatica.",

In my current setup (airflow + spark sql) we built a framework for the boring 80% of ingestion. Basically ever source gets a config file that defines things like:\n\n* source location and fromat\n* expected schema and key fields\n* load mode (append vs merge)\n* basic column-level transforamtions\n* partitioning and retention rules\n* data quality checks such as nulls, uniqueness, etc\n\nAirflow just reads the metadata and generates the DAG tasks dynamically so adding a new table is as good as adding a new config and redeploy. That works actually, better than what I was expecting.\n\nWhere these frameworks usually die is when people try to stretch them into solving the hard 20% - business logic, weird timestamps, broken upstream APIs, one-off edge cases,. At that point you are building a DSL inside YAML, and nobody wants to debug YAML on friday.\n\nThe happy middle ground is metadtaa drives ingestion and standard bronze/silver handling. Anythign complex gets real python module with tests. Configs stay declarative so cannot do programming in configs (which is good).\n\nFunny enough, I’d love to open source what we built but cororate legal treats sharing code like i am smuggling beer.\n\nSo yeah - do it as long as you are focusing on the repeatable 80% boring stuff.

We've had a long hiring phase and let me tell you what I've seen from interviewing:\n\n\\- Most larger companies get \\~1000 CVs in a day. Most of them are trash tbf, but recrutiers won't take much time to scan your resume. Make sure it's easy to read. Make sure there is impressive stuff in there. Look at your CV and compare yourself with 1000 random people. Is there any way you can change something to make it better than your competitors?\n\n\\- THEN work on the technical details. You'll most likely have some of these 3 interviews: SQL/Python, Data Modeling, Data Architecture/System Design. If it's not a startup they'll most likely ask you concepts and not directly questions related to a platform like AWS. So understand frameworks: Orchestration, Deployment, Quality Testing, Monitoring etc. You can learn those directly with Airflow, dbt etc. or even build it by yourself in Python. Cool project to show btw.\n\n\\- At any seniority, people suck at SQL. At least for an Analytics Engineering role, this should be your best mastered skill. JOINs, GROUP BYs, Aggregations are the most basic skills. People failed so frequently on rolling averages, knowing when to use a window function and when not, how to filter by year or month, not knowing anything about how queries execute etc. I still can't believe I've rejected \\~70% in a simple SQL round. Here's your first spot to shine.\n\n\\- Be a cool person. If we had a laugh and I'm between reject and pass, you'll likely pass.\n\n\\- For Data Architecture questions, learn tradeoffs: Correctness vs Latency, Storage vs Compute, Reliability vs Velocity, Efficiency vs Capabilities, Cap Theorem etc. When to use what + example use cases.\n\n\\- For Data Modeling its the same answer: Ingestion Layer (Event Logs, Snapshots) -> Facts (out of events)/Dimensions (out of snapshots) -> Aggregations/Data Marts -> KPIs. Understand what happens in every step. This is a usual dbt workflow, learn it by just moving some messy tables to create a final cool KPI.\n\n\\- If you want to add a personal project: Have a URL, let me click it and let me be able to explore it and think \"cool\". I won't ever use your project. But having something I could use already would make you stand out by a lot because you prooved you can deploy stuff.",

BigQuery abstracts away storage *and* compute. Athena abstracts away only compute, as you need to connect it to your object storage, but fundamentally, it's at least a little similar as an offering. You're not managing infrastructure with either of them, and they'll scale up parallelization to whatever level is necessary to ensure you get query results back in a reasonable amount of time. Because they're both built on serverless billing models, costs are very high on a query-by-query basis, but this can still be competitive in a real-world scenario if you have relatively low daily utilization.\n\nCompare that to DuckDB, where you're using dedicated hardware with an embedded, columnar database. It abstracts away nothing - you're providing the hardware for storage and the hardware for compute. This is radically different. It works well at small scales, and because you're managing everything, it's great for heavy utilization and is extremely cost-effective on a query-by-query basis. It's also not distributed at all. Once you scale up past what a single machine can handle, you have graduated from DuckDB and need to move to something that can distribute the workload and handle scale.\n\nFundamentally, they're different tools solving different problems. So when you run a benchmark with 20 GB of data, you're using a very small scale of data that DuckDB is built for and which BigQuery/Athena are not. Because there's no downtime in benchmarking, you're also simulating what is effectively 100% utilization, the least favorable scenario for a serverless billing model. Of course DuckDB is going to end up looking good.\n\nThe way to meaningfully compare them on cost, at least, if you were for some reason trying to decide between these different options, would be to look at a simulated full month of usage. The hardware you're running DuckDB on costs \\~$1500 for a month on EC2, or maybe \\~$7500 in up front hardware costs if you have it on-site. You'd need to run \\~1700 queries a day on BigQuery to get a similar monthly bill, or \\~13500 of the narrow queries on Athena. You could certainly cut your hardware costs for DuckDB by a lot for this workload, but also, are you running 13000 queries a day?",

Scaling concerns are real but manageable at current volume. We are considering moving out of R2 to dedicated storage servers with appropriate redundancy. This is decent amount of initial engineering effort that's not documented in the study.\n\nYour break-even math is useful context though.

They won originally by outperforming legacy players. Think about how they effectively outmoded Redshift and Vertica by simply having a more modern architecture. But the most successful \"vertical\" companies aren't actually technology leaders. Nobody uses Salesforce, Adobe, Intuit, or Docusign because they have the best code. They use them because those companies understand specific business workflows better than anyone else.\n\nI'm skeptical that companies that big can change their product DNA that drastically. It is hard to move to selling finished houses when your entire culture is designed to build the world's best power tools.

I suspect everyone is waiting for the AI bubble to pop, and all of the markets to crash, to see where the dominoes fall.\n\nAll of which is to say, it's very likely *not you* that is the problem.

Then they wanted reports to be made on them and didn't have anyone available so did that (Data analyst stuff) Then they needed more and to encorporate that (Back to DE). Its less about job title at a certain point if you find the ebb and flow and can learn tools to do what the business needs. I did that for 2 years before I considered my self good enough to be called a professional and not a junior. Maybe you move faster than that. Also Migrating from an old system to a new system is a part of the cycle. Snowflake and Fabric are current generation cloud tech, so you are getting a free education on how to use them, take advantage of it!\n\nAsk yourself, How would you build this whole system? What does the whole system look like? Data engineering isn't just ETL, its a big part of it but the data modeling and being able to serve the overall system is the important part. Do you understand the whole system?\n\nTimeline to understand when to move is kind of irrelavent. Actually understanding and being able to apply those skills is when you make a move. You don't just set that to arbitrary 6/12/24 month timelines. When you gain the capability and understanding thats when you can think about moving to the next thing. There is always a next thing.\n\n  \nBack when I started there was only MSQL 2000 and Crystal reports or SSRS. Now there are 50 different technologies to do the same with python , Java, or C#. So tools have gotten more sophisticated. Pick a path, learn that path, maybe use claude code/Code assistant of choice to help you build one, then read and understand how its built. Look up tutorials from youtube and compare that to your solution. Read the libraries and documentation that make it work. Then go from there. \n\nBuild a whole program that takes in data to do something useful. Kaggle has a bunch of examples for this.   \n  \nThe only way to get better is to build things.",

Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in.  \n\\- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest.  \n\\- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn.  \n\\- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either.  \n\\- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc.  \n\\- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project. For the Deep Learning one, you can keep paying and extending as long as needed.\n\nOverall, I tried to finish Zoomcamp multiple times and was distracted, but I am in the final module of the Deep Learning course.",

Some of the others are less so, but overall it's pretty solid.  \n\nI'm half way through Joe Reis's Deeplearning and I'm torn on whether to finish it or not.  A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering).  It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side.  \n\nHis class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.\n\nPersonally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses.  And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.\n\nLastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some.  One year used Airflow for their orchestration, the next used Dagster and they might be using another one now.  Most orchestration tools are similar, so getting the basics done and then being familiar with other tools is a good thing.",

The main python asset imports those helpers and then executes the actual logic of batch processing the extraction and loading to our datalake (hive configured).\n\nFor transformations, we have mostly moved away from python to sql since we can directly query external tables created from our hive datalake. But we still sometimes use python for the first layer where the data is weird file formats (like grib, netcdf, etc.) that require special processing - in such cases we read the files, convert to a dataframe, and then materialize it in our dwh. Our data platform's own built-in python materialization automatically handles incremental strategies and variable injections.\n\nThere are also very rare cases where data needs to be processed in a way thats not possible with sql - for example decoding airport weather reports like metar/taf, which require special python libraries to decode.\n\nTo answer your question about frameworks - we write functional code with very minimal object-oriented programming. For my team the rule of thumb is that a single python file/asset should contain all the logic tied to a single data entity/table/model. We never use notebooks (unless for quick local testing and adhoc stuff). In some cases, we extract different data from a single API endpoint, so for those cases we create a separate agent/helper to connect to the API and configure the parameters - this is the only case where we use a bit more oop.",

This will help you develop a true passion, deep skill and experience in the field which will become the foundation for the next 10 years of your career.

For example if you order by ID, but then query by let’s say first name, performance hit would be be significant.\n\nI would say it’s a very good and cost effective engine, but even the cloud version, there are several “quirks” that you might stumble upon, compared to like snowflake which I would say works out of the box.

I don’t usually bother with trying to do a full from scratch historical rerun like this. Usually long term storage of the main intermediate results that I care about and various scenarios ran at the time to capture future possibilities is good enough. ",

Courses are an introduction to a topic.  Not a complete solution.  You do not do a course and become a complete programmer in the same way graduating with a medicine degree makes you ready to carry out complex, life threatening surgery.\n\nA common misconception is that all you need is a course.  Personally, I did an online courses.  I did a few actually.  6-8 months later, I got my first DE role with no experience whatsoever.  Without any further detail, this makes getting into DE sound really fucking easy.\n\nWhat isn't included is all of the work outside of those courses.  I was literally writing code, watching videos, reading blogs, writing stuff down, and generally thinking about programming for 60-70 hours per week every week for around 6 months.  And when I say writing code, I wasn't following tutorials.  I was googling the fuck out of the internet on how to try and do what I wanted to do.  As you can tell, that's a lot more than 70-90 hours.\n\nOn top of that, what's also not mentioned is my career before being in DE involved interpreting data on pretty much a daily basis.  Sometimes, stuff which you can't even measure, test, or see.  This makes working with data which travels between two places quite straightforward relative to somebody who hasn't had the same background as me.\n\n>I need to know so I know if I'm simply wasting my time. If they are nice additions that reflect skill, but at the end of the day, not enough on their own, and businesses really want a college degree.\n\nI'd be lying if I said a university degree doesn't make your life easier.  Of course it does.\n\nThat being said, you are only wasting your time if you think the course is \"enough\".  There are lot of soft skills which you can't really measure and they are a lot more valuable than the degree itself.  You have the massive benefit of not being time gated with what and how you learn which is balanced against not having a traditional degree.\n\nMy recommendation is work very heavily on your soft skills.  How you come across, how you analyse problems, present findings, and ultimately implement solutions will take you somewhere.  How long it will take, I can't possibly say.",

That is, in a client-server environment where the client runs on a machine controlled by somebody other than you, you must always assume that the client can be compromised.\n\nThat means the client can do whatever they want with everything in your static files and everything that's returned from every API endpoint. If there are particular kinds of data that only specific users should be able to read/write, then that **must** be carefully enforced on the backend.\n\nWhen you write any kind of frontend code, you're essentially sending it to users and asking them nicely to run it as-is. Ordinary users will do so (or rather, their browsers will). Attackers will ignore it and do whatever they want.\n\n(Corollary: if the user themselves is not malicious, but their client machine has been compromised by somebody else or by malware, then there isn't much you can do to protect them. The best you can do is protect yourself and other users from their attack.)",

For all of you who are learning, if you're ever using a service and that service gives you an api key, token, or other secret to use in calling it... it's time to learn proper practices in using secrets.\n\nHere is the OWASP cheat sheet for secrets management [Secrets Management - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html) It might not be totally comprehensive, but it's a good start!\n\nGive it a read, if you're still confused about anything come back to this subreddit and ask a question.\n\nIf you're the type to be writing tutorials or guides on how to use services that have api keys, please add warnings for your users. It's so easy for a new developer to be tempted to rip insecure code out and put it into production.

In functional style, they are mostly not applicable, and dynamic languages like Python have easier ways of doing things. OOP has always been a poor fit for the current multicore paradigm. It's still widely practiced due to historical inertia and only caught on in the first place due to lucky timing, not on much real merit. I read the Gang of Four book. It was interesting, but I rarely use them, or when I do it's because it falls out naturally, not because I had a named pattern memorized. Design patterns are mostly a waste of time.\n\nOn the other hand, algorithms and data structures were much more important to learn about. If you're not doing systems programming, you mostly won't be implementing data structures yourself, but you still need to understand their performance characteristics (and what that even means) to use the library versions correctly.\n\nIf you want to know about some other topics that will actually be useful, learn refactoring patterns and unit testing.",

It is funny how people just design the same stereotypical architectures over and over. After seeing lots of projects, you start to recognize patterns more easily.\n\n2. Search. You get really good at searching for code fragments. It can be anything; an error message, a UI string, something to get you to some file / line that is related to the bug.\n\n3. Call graphs. Once you find some relevant code, then you start branching out from it to find the exact components involved in your task. Hopefully your language has a strong type system so you can just right-click and \"find all callers\" (my biggest gripe about Ruby was that this never worked). Or else you use a debugger to break on that line and inspect the callstack while the code is running. \n\nI feel like these 3 things explain most of it. Give yourself time.

Write everything that you want the program to do down. Specify it. Every feature, every function. First, in a coarse overview and then flesh out each feature/function in detail.\n\nThis document is the base for your programming. Everything in there is what you need to do. Not more, not less. If you have an idea to extend it, *append* it to the document, but do not yet even think about implementing it. Get the basic functionality working first. All that you append is \"optional\".\n\nThe key to everything is the FDS. The more time and consideration you spend on it, the better you plan, the easier it will become to implement.\n\nVague specifications help nobody and lead only to the block you describe.\n\n> someone suggested tools that help you plan before coding. tried verdent and a few others.\n\nDedicated tools are not necessary. A simple text editor, or a proper text processor (like Word, Libre/OpenOffice Write, Google Documents) are all you need to get started. Don't overthink the tooling here. The more specialized a tool is, the more time you have to spend *learning* it, the less you can focus on the actual *content*. Simpler is better in that case.\n\n>  theres so many decisions before you write a single line\n\nAnd this is exactly what is necessary. The better you plan, the better your outcome.\n\n*Code* is the unimportant part of programming. It's only a necessary evil that we need to tell the computer what we want it to do. The *planning*, the *decisions*, the *considerations* are what really count.\n\n*Code* can be implemented by every \"code monkey\", but *planning* is what makes a *software engineer/designer*.\n\nI can give a well prepared FDS to somebody who can write code, but doesn't understand anything about the type of software I want to make and they will be able to program it.\n\nYet, there isn't a detailed FDS, even the best programmer will be completely lost.\n\n-----\n\nWhere you actually start, at the database, at the main functionality, is a different matter and often preference.\n\nI like to start with the database so that I have my fundamental construct.\n\nThen, I work on the main entry point of the program - this is the very first actual *code* that I write - it's sort of the \"ice breaker\".\n\nThe biggest hurdle is always the first line, the first few statements. After that, the flow becomes natural. Yet, of course, this requires experience, and it will get easier with gained experience.\n\n----\n\nAs always with similar posts, some books to consider:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V.

You already made a partial \"list\" in your post. And then implement these one by one. Does not matter if you make a UI first, a database first or a backend/API first. Then it is just however you test that the thing works, it differs. With database you have to use SQL queries. With API you have to use REST calls (unless you use something other besides REST). etc. The order does not matter in your case.\n\nYes, there is a system design and architecture and such in real life projects and some things do have an order, but you are just figuring out how to implement a thing and how a stuff works. Do not consider how the things are done in the real life. Before you haven't made a working app.\n\nAnd yes, there are many decisions before you write a single line. The same way there are many decisions before you lay the first brick when building a house. You can't just lay bricks anywhere you want or however you want. Software development has a planning phase. But this is where the splitting it all into pieces and putting into a list comes in. Why I mentioned it in my first paragraph. Create a list of achievable micro-goals and start implementing these one by one. \n\nYour app is an \"app\" (e.g. a mobile app)? Cool. Pick some totally random tutorial for getting the most barebones mobile app up and running. If it is not an \"app\" as a mobile app but a web application then pick a simple \"Hello world\" web application tutorial, to get it to return \"Hello world\" when run. If your application has a graphical side then get whichever \"canvas\" type working first. And then just add features on that canvas.",

It should be detailed and specific enough that you could hand it to an experienced programmer and they’d have enough information to start implementing.\n\nI’d also suggest having a concept of an “MVP”, or “minimum viable product”. What’s the absolute minimum set of features that constitute a version of the idea that you’d be happy with? Start with that, add the rest of your ideas afterwards.\n\nI personally find that it’s easiest to start with something that I can actually see working, so for example in your budgeting app you can start with a page that displays your budget overview. Where does the budget information come from? Don’t worry about that yet, just add some hard-coded numbers. Once you’ve done that pick a number that you want to be “real” and build that, hooking it up to the UI. Now you have one real field and a bunch of fake ones. Pick another field to actually implement.

I had to swap to a different library and luckily (this time!) my code did not contain many assumptions about how the graphics work, so the swap was relatively pain free. \n\n**Write down sentences that are simple statements about the process you are trying to automate:** \n\nE.g.: \n\n* The app tells me how much money I have left. \n* I enter something I have bought.\n* I enter something I wish to buy.\n* What I have bought has a name and a price.\n\nYou can think of these as questions you need to answer. If you were the budget planner for a large organisation, there would be questions people would continuously ask you. If you wrote those down and for every question you wrote down how come you know the answers, you would have the beginnings of a system.\n\nReal processes used by real people can tell you a lot about what your app must be able to handle. If you start with \"I would like a steak cooked by a Michelin level chef\" you are probably going to get there slower than if you start with \"what goes into a really good steak and who can tell me this?\"\n\n**Identify then build the core functionality first:**\n\nIf you want to start a website that can handle a billion requests per second, start with the code the takes then dispatches the requests (load balancers). For a much quieter website you would probably tackle other tasks first.\n\nIf you want to make a game in which you fly a space ship, fight pirates and trade goods, make sure the ship handles well (i.e. the interface in which the user spends 95% of their time). \n\nFiguring out what the core functionality is though can be the real brainteaser.\n\nIf there are parts of your app that are a known quantity (i.e. others have already solved this bit and documented their solutions) and parts that are not, the latter might be a good candidate. What is your USP, what makes your app stand out from the others?\n\nExample: [how the video game Lemmings was designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5-lH3lZqrg) (YT, 4 mins).",

I do think that starting with the data, which flows through the entire app, adds a certain clarity and certainty to things, but really anything goes if you don't mind lots of going back to revise.\n\nMy \"plan\" is usually my thinking beforehand and any diagrams I've doodled, as we don't create formal design docs as part of our process. We gather requirements, write software, document the result. I will put effort into writing a technical design doc if I'm handing it off entirely though. I basically short-circuit the written spec part if I'm also the implementer.\n\nFor a personal project, I think the answer is to just think, and make whatever notes/doodles you feel are necessary. How do you want to distribute/deliver it to users? What data is needed at what point? What interactions? How do you want interactions to go? How do you want it to look? Do you need common things that a framework would be able to provide? Etc.\n\nThings that you haven't considered will usually present themselves. Things you have considered will change. If you understand how everything works it all comes together as you work on it more, so my main advice is to be clear enough about what you want that you can start work, and then start writing code.",

It is natural that you don't see much use yet.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: even the most complex, largest program builds on the same fundamentals that you are learning now.\n\nDon't know what course you are doing, but I'd highly recommend the MOOC [Python Programming 2026](https://programming-26.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki. It is free, textual, extremely practice oriented and a proper first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\". Sign up, log in, go to part 1 and start learning.\n\nReal world use does not only mean GUI programs. In fact, the vast majority of programs run in the console, somewhere in the background where nobody apart from the people who work and maintain these programs see them. These programs are services, servers, etc.\n\n> how could I use it to make web app\n\nAgain, learn and solidify the fundamentals first. Patience is key. You cannot jump from not even have built the foundation of your house to the fifth floor. You'll eventually get there, but the process is gradual. One topic builds upon the previous one. Once you are getting there, you will find Flask and Django as well as FastAPI as web frameworks for Python.",

For backend, you have django, fastapi. \n\nLearn languages via courses teaching about these fields. If you simply want to learn about python syntax then codecademy is a great place to start at. Get a basic grip on the language and move to its practical applications in the fields instead. For example, you can start with the iris dataset classification in data science. It'll yeach you about the basics of machine learning and about python programming. Using a library like scikit-learn will abstract away the algorithm and allow you to do plug and play approach. \n\nData science is a much easier domain to start for since you can see its result right in your terminal or notebook.",

So what I did was start a new project (it's a console-based resource-grinding game with some light story set in The Elder Scrolls universe) and starting very small with just some dialogue and choices. I set up a Trello board and broke all my tasks into \"main quests\" and \"side quests\" (things I'd like to do but are on the backburner) and broke them down into SUPER small pieces. That has given me nice dopamine hits when I get to check off those tasks as complete. It's also way more interesting to me because I love games, and this is something I actually look forward to playing myself when I get it into a more complete or at least MVP state.\n\nAlso, (this may be controversial) using AI to talk through the issue or design I'm thinking off. Not ***ever*** using it to solve the problem or make me code, but rather \"I want to do X in my project, give me a word or two I can google to start my search\" so I have something specific to look up on Stack Overflow or the Ruby docs. That way when I get stuck I'm not just banging my head against the wall because I'm not even sure what to search, I have some breadcrumbs that get me started but I'm never actually relying on the AI to code for me or even give me the full answer.\n\nI work at a large tech company and those are the tips that a programmer friend gave me and I've been finding so much more success in the last few weeks than ever before :)",

When you figure out your studies and you feel that the studying process is going well, then sure, you'll have a chance. Not right now.\n\nAnd even when you figure it out then you'll have an uphill battle ahead. Why a company should hire you over a Bachelor degree holder, a vocational school diploma holder, an ex-intern, a Junior developer changing a company, a desperate mid-level developer trying to find a job? How will you stand out?\n\nThe current job market is difficult even for professional developers. And even more for fresh university graduates. People without a degree have little chance.\n\nSo, you'll have two obstacles: figuring out the study process itself (as you are stuck right now) and figuring out why the company should hire YOU.\n\nMy advice would be going for a degree. Like this you'll have a structured study plan made ready by people who know the industry. You'll have more options available. More doors opened for you. And you being 36 does not mean it is too late to go for a degree. I did a career change when I was 28-32. Got my degree when I was 32 and got hired then. Followed it up with Master degree studies as well. We had guys in their 30s studying with course mates 10 years younger than them. No issues what so ever. Some few were also in 40s.\n\nIf, for some reason you are not going for a degree then you have to start building real life projects that will be taken into a real use either by you, your family and friends, or by somebody else. That will make you stand out. But if you make template tutorial \"projects\" that just sit in your Github and nobody will use these, then you'll have very little chance.",

You spend years slowly spiralling your knowledge and understanding of a topic over years, probably for 12 or 13 years at the minimum. As such, when you are introduced to a 'new topic', it's 98% old knowledge. It is built on structures where a lot of the new thinking is given to you and slowly removed bit by bit until you are doing it yourself. This teaches you are taught that learning isn't really too hard, and you should be succeeding almost immediately before moving to the next topic. \n\nWhen you learn something novel it's not a slow progression over years, it's probably a logistics function of logistic functions for each topic. That is, the initial concept is pretty easy, then it becomes hard as fuff where you feel like an idiot for ages, but you eventually learn the concept and it gets easy. But, because you are constantly learning, at no point do you ever feel like a master, or even competent. \n\nI firmly believe that 'good' programmers are people who accept that they will always struggle stuff that they are just learning and can realise exactly how much they've learned. \n\nSo, what's the lesson for you?\n\n- Accept that you might need to take smaller steps, and that's okay. \n- After you learn something, make your own version of the questions/problems, and solve them as well. If you can't do that, go back to their questions and just change one small thing (like a variable) and write down what you think will change when you run it and then run it. Document if it runs the way you thought, and if it doesn't, keep playing until you get it. Then move to two things, then as many things as you can. \n- Think back to other things you've learned and ask yourself if you can incorporate those things as well, if so (and you probably can), make your own versions of those problems. \n\nYou'll likely find that giving yourself that space to learn how to solve those problems will mean that the next step will be easier.",

Because if your claim here is that having the wrong metaphor for programming was what held you back for 4 years, you want to make sure you are not jumping to another wrong one. Programming is like programming. Believe me when I say my brain does work in similar ways, and I understand why you are trying to create these abstractions, but be careful because they can be misleading.\n\nFor example, in your model, a web application might be a bunch of separate \"flowcharts\" that share parts of their path. It really does depend what you are building.\n\nThe problem of, \"how do people keep track of all these branching paths stretching out to infinity\". Well, I don't do that. I can terminate that stretching out by simply trusting that a thing does the thing it purports to do, and let somebody else worry about the rest of the branch.",

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but in the real world, software can be *quite* complex. Yes, it doesn’t branch infinitely in a literal sense the way a fractal might, but there are almost always far too many twists and turns to keep in your head all at the same time. Most real programs are more like a circle than a straight path, and the only reason that thats even true is that we write them to work that way so that we have some chance at reasoning about them.\n\nThe good news, though, is that you don’t need to keep it all in your head at the same time. Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes). Considering (and especially depending on) things outside the function can even be a liability.\n\nI’m glad that you’re sticking with it! Just don’t get too disheartened when you start working on larger programs snd start to see a lot of complexity. Remind yourself that you don’t need to understand every level of the process at the same time.",

That said, if you did do changes to your code without these before, you can improve code quality without. I am saying this, because it can seem that you are not allowed to improve code quality before you learn about two or more different things. (But since unittest is build into the standard library, maybe give it a try and write some simple tests for the functions you change!)\n\n\\- \"but I’m worried that even then it will still feel messy\". Yes, it will still feel messy, but thats just the first step, that enables the next ones. Its a journey and while the goal \"tidy code\" can be helpful as motivation it can also be overwhelming. \n\n\\- Talking about \"proceeding in steps\": A simple technique that can help is identifying sections in code, lines that belong together. Give these sections a comment saying what the section does. Then try to pull out that section into a function. The function name now can take the task that the comment had: It tells what happens, without the need to reading the whole function. Try to make the function only rely on the parameters you pass to it instead of \"global state\" (also called a \"pure function\"). This makes the function easy to test and to understand. This might not always be easy, but at least check if its possible. \n\n\\- There are a lot of helpful texts there – [https://refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a good online resource, Fowlers book \"Refactoring\" is also pretty helpful. Initially read them as inspiration, like browsing a cookbook, don't force yourself to use the methods immediately. Most likely, you will stumble upon a problem soon and be reminded of a section you have read. Then, find that section and give it a second read and try to follow its advice.",

        "body": "One of the things I like to do is not to factor into \"substeps\", but more like \"next steps\".  Taking a big function and then making functions out of it often means that you're just switching between different functions, but have the same complexity.  That's often actually worse.\n\nBreaking things down into \"input, process, output\" helps dramatically, especially if you can then extract the \"output\" to a separate method/object.  If your big function makes a call to an API, does something with it, makes a call to another API, etc?  Try to separate at those boundaries, or push things to the end.  A useful pattern can be to gather up all of the changes you want in your function, and then apply them at the end.\n\nOne strategy I've often used is to \"chop the tail\".  What that means is finding the very last thing the function does, and then creating a new function at that point, taking all of the data it needs as parameters.  You can then work through the function as a whole.  This differs from the \"substep\" method because you can, when you make that final call, basically forget about what happened before that.  If you call that last function with the right parameters, then the previous function was correct.  That's also where things like mock objects come into play.",

Took 1 year to find first IT job, 2 years to find first dev job. I was in similar shoes and my advice is what i've done.\n\n>I started posting on Twitter and committing to GitHub, but obviously nobody is watching. I don’t know if I’m supposed to keep doing this until someone magically finds me or if I’m doing it wrong.\n\nIs networking just talking to people online? Is it internships? Is it Discord servers? LinkedIn? Meetups? Or is it just something people say for the sake of saying? Networking is getting out and talking to people, not shooting messages into the avoid and hoping someone looks at your social media and goes \"this kids a genius\", thats not networking.\n\nYou need to find meetup groups in your area and start attending, meetup.com. This is a good way to get out there but with networking, you get out what you put in.\n\nIf you just go, attend, and don't talk to anyone, no ones going to know who you are / what you are doing tech wise and what you're looking for. So if you aren't socially outgoing, start working on that.\n\n>I kind of feel like I wasted most of college procrastinating. Now I’m doing DSA and web dev, but its late-very late and I know it. Also I’m from a tier 3 college and people keep saying if you’re from a tier 3 college you basically HAVE to network or no one will even know you exist, so no one will give you a chance.\n\nI had similar experience, didn't do internships, didn't really hit my stride until my senior year of college when things started clicking for me and i felt like i was finally getting it. So the issue is jobs currently want experience / proof that you have some semblance that you know what you are doing. You're not going to like this but my suggestion to you is to work for free for a while.\n\nYou can either keep shooting resume's into the void for months / a year plus on end hoping for the best or you can get the experience you need to set you apart from your peers at similar points in your career.\n\nSure, you'll find the rare hiring manager that says \"i dont care about experience, i just want them to be curious\", in reality a lot of hiring managers are kind of dumb, don't know what they want, and just pray they don't hire an idiot and the best way to do that is to find someone that has proven experience.\n\nAssuming you can build / deploy an app (i tutored college students online and you'd be surprised at the number of students who could barely build something in their senior year much less know how to deploy it), I would start with chamber of commerce website for cities near you that you'd be willing to drive to if necessary. So call it a 25-50 mile radius.\n\nFrom there, look for non-profits and call up their volunteer coordinator and see if they have any needs / opportunities to build software / automate something that they don't have the money/expense to spend on. Off the shelf software / monthly subscription based software isn't as expensive as it was when i graduated these days so maybe they are more inclined to pay for services these days, but you'd be surprised the shoe string budgets some of these nonprofits operate on.\n\nOften times they are taking paper applications and manually retyping it back into a computer which wastes time. They setup temporary shelters and take intake on paper where if they had a laptop there, they'd cut that part out.\n\nLook at rec leagues in your area and see if any of these rec leagues have a need for software to manage teams/schedules/rosters. Some leagues barely have enough money to run the league itself much less any extras so they manage the league in spreadsheets. \n\n1/2",

Imagine that \"x points to n\", what happens if 'n' gets destroyed by GC, a perfectly normal circumstance: 'x' Will be left pointing to uninitialized memory and thats what we call a memory leak.\n\nJust thought I'd go into detail",

        "body": "I learned C from books because I am old. ;) But more seriously: check the library for an intro to C textbook. Every one I've ever seen was at least a good intro.\n\nI wouldn't be too worried about being embarrassed in labs about beginner mistakes; that's what class is for. If you already knew C, the class wouldn't be helpful.\n\nRelative to other languages, it helps to understand C's memory model, because it's a lot closer to what actually happens under the hood in the computer and getting confused about it is the source of a lot of errors. \n\nSo, in C, you have two places data is stored in memory: the stack and the heap. The stack is where any variables in your functions live. If you say `int number = 5;`, that puts a `5` on the stack (hey folks who actually know C: yes, I know about registers, keeping it simple to start with, yeah?). Generally, stuff on the stack lives there until the function returns, then *everything* on the stack for that function goes away. That's all the variables you declared in your function and everything passed into the function (all the stuff passed into a function, the function gets a copy of).\n\nThe heap is where longer-lived stuff goes. You get a chunk of heap by going `int* pointer_to_number = malloc(sizeof(int));`. That gives you some int-sized chunk of memory somewhere, and what `malloc` actually returns is a *pointer* to that memory. Now, `pointer_to_number` is a variable (on the stack) that holds an address of something in the heap. You can treat the pointer like a number (if you try to print it and tell print \"it's a number,\" for example, it'll just be the memory address where the data is stored). If you want to modify the data on the heap, you can go `*pointer_to_number = 13;`. The star there means \"I want to mess with the stuff pointed to, not the pointer itself.\" If you wanted to change what the pointer points to, you could go `pointer_to_number = pointer_to_some_other_number;`. Note the lack of a star.\n\nNow here's the place where people get messed up most often: C has no way to know when you're done with the memory `malloc` gave you. It needs *you* to tell it that. So when you're all done with the memory you got handed, you call `free(pointer_to_number);`. That will say to the memory manager \"Hey, that pointer you malloc'd me awhile back? All done with it; something else can use that memory.\" If you forget to do that, when your function returns and the variables holding the pointer go away, the pointed-to memory can't be found anymore and you \"leaked\" it; that memory is stuck with a 'used' flag on it and nobody else can use it.\n\nThe other thing about C is that it's a language with few 'guardrails' and makes it very easy to screw up the memory model or machine state. If you call `free` twice on the same pointer, you probably just break the memory manager and it'll do screwy stuff in your program from that point forward (modern operating systems give every program its own copy of `malloc` itself so you can't break the *whole computer's* state that way; worst-case-scenario, you can always quit the program and when it terminates all the memory it was using is properly given back to the operating system, including anything `malloc`'d). If you `malloc` a small amount of memory and then try to cram something big in there, C will cheerfully write the big thing past the end of the memory you reserved and clobber whatever's in the next chunk of memory. If you take a pointer to something on the stack (using the `&` operator) and then try to hold onto that pointer and then return from the function where that stack-thing lives, it'll get freed but your pointer will still be around and now it's pointing to the wrong thing. And probably the biggest foot-gun in the language: strings are just pointers to the first character of the string, so if you `malloc` some memory to hold a string and then forget now much you malloc'd and write a longer string than will fit in that memory, you will rip right into some other data in memory squirting random characters into it and you'll have a bad time.\n\nIn a lot of ways, C is *way* simpler than other languages. That simplicity puts a lot of complexity on you, the user.",

It's fine if you do this for a while, but the diminishing returns become heavy after. This is because newcomers don't yet have the necessary exposure and knowledge to do \"new things\", therefore they just fall in the trap of: learn new language -> learn basic syntax -> pretty much do nothing actually minimally important (to your learning) with this language -> get bored because you pretty much did nothing -> learn new language.\n\n\\- Try to diversify your initial learning over several areas of computing: graphics, distributed systems, embedded systems, operating systems, application development (web & mobile), and so on...   \nQuick extra tip: place your effort into learning operating systems more, everything nowadays use an operating system as a basis, and therefore having at least a minimal understanding of how they work is important.\n\n\\- Try spending the majority of your time in an actual low-level programming such as C. I wouldn't recommend C++ just yet, because it won't give the same effect to a beginner as C does, this is because since C++ abstracts some stuff, beginners are prone of thinking about some features as an \"API\", which is not really what is happening, and this creates the exact opposite effect of what we want, since APIs in programming are usually perceived as a black box, and you don't want a black box, you want to actually understand what is going on. \n\nJust an additional note: I'd recommend coupling low-level programming learning with your OS studies.\n\n\\---------\n\nI'd take my advices with a grain of salt however, because it really depends on what stage you already are, and what type of approach you have towards your learning process. I also think it's pretty important you start recognizing early on what is holding you back, and what isn't, because believe me, it's very easy to stagnate when learning programming, and it's very hard to get out of that hole as well.",

If you were learning to program as an undergrad CS student, there'd almost certainly be a course in your second or third year that would involve writing a simple HTTP server in C (hint: implement HTTP 1.0, not 1.1, it's way easier).\n\nThere's something really cool about having something you're already familiar with, like your web browser, having a real, successful conversation with an app that you wrote from scratch, and displaying some cool result.\n\nThe exact mechanics of how to implement will wildly vary by language, but really understanding what ports and sockets and addresses and listening and such mean is very helpful, and the concepts will transfer as you move between languages.\n\nThere are lots of famous textbooks in this space. The Tanenbaum is probably the most famous, that's \"Computer Networks\" by Andrew Tanenbaum.\n\nThere are also many great college courses covering computer networking with all of their lectures and assignments posted online. Simply going through one at your own pace may be a great way to get an expensive education for free (excepting the benefits of being able to ask questions). Good example: [https://sp26.cs168.io/](https://sp26.cs168.io/)\n\nOne thing to be aware of: writing HTTP servers quickly starts to involve parallelization and running multiple threads, and then it becomes partly about memory sharing and memory management, and then you're learning about mutexes, and pretty soon you'll find that learning networking quickly begins to overlap with learning systems programming and operating systems.

So don't limit yourself to applying to software developer jobs (which you probably won't get). If you can get on as tech support or the like, especially at a big company which also employs developers, that gets you working and accumulating experience in a somewhat related field. Self taught vs B.Sc. plus internship is not a battle you're going to win with most employers, but several years of front line IT work and proving oneself as a reliable employee vs new college grad might be a more winnable comparison.",

Ask yourself this, if the new job is Python or Rust based can you adapt quickly to use those tools.   Frankly I don't see much of a future for C#.\n\nThe other side of this is how much have you developed completely on your own.   If you successfully have completed the design and implementation of a novel program or two you are off to a good start.   Frankly you should make this code available for review by the community.   Code reviews can be painful but they can keep you on the right tracks as your skills develop.   To put it another way if you haven't had your current programing reviewed by a third party you might not be as ready as you think.\n\nNow how quickly you might get hired depends upon demand and in many cases experience and knowledge outside of programming.   You mention \"office Job\" but that does not define much.   What I'm trying to say here is that sometimes other knowledge can be a factor in getting a job.   If you have in depth knowledge of part of a business it can make programming a lot easier to adapt to because otherwise as a programmer you have to understand the business logic before you can even write code.   I'm not having confidence in how I'm expressing this but if you have warehousing experience that can directly help in writing a business application to support warehousing software.",

But you have to write server code that uses the database.\n\nIf you’re looking to get experience that could make you useful to a company using the web for business, I suggest PostgreSQL or possibly MariaDb/MySQL, the free open source database server packages.

How much tome should I spend on a problem before looking for the answer?\n\nIt’s not about not looking for an answer, it’s about finding it through the documentation.\n\nDocumentation, documentation, documentation, documentation.\n\nIf it’s really complex (like GUIs or networking) look up the appropriate libraries for your language (often the fundamentals of these are the same, just applied to the philosophy and syntax of their respective language, i.e. the concept of an onClick event). No need to reinvent the wheel.\n\n3. How do you turn an idea into code when you have no idea where to start?\n\nLook up the appropriate libraries, and start thinking about how things will be structured. It will change, it’s impossible to forsee everything, just get a vague idea and start. It’s often way more simple than you think (after you metaphorically bang your head against the wall for days figuring something out lol).",

Most of the time, we only have a vague understanding of how they even work. But sometimes we have to dig in and read its source code.\n\nWhen you're familiar with enough programming concepts, solving typical problems isn't that hard, but that doesn't mean we know how to do everything. There are math problems that are centuries old that we still don't know how to solve. You don't automatically know how to solve those just because you became a programmer.\n\nFor typical problems, you could try top-down design: Describe, step-by-step, how to solve the problem in the ideal language you wish you had, then implement that language in the ideal language you wish you had for that, and recurse until it's obvious how to do it in the language you actually have.\n\nBut that's just one approach. You could also write the tests first or try a bottom-up skeleton that does something minimal and then tack on features.",

Get a general idea and start coding. That will teach you more about the problem. Things you couldn’t see while planning.

        "body": "Depends on the engine.\n\nFirstly: If you've never programmed before, learn that before touching a game engine. At the very least, learn\n\n1. What variables are (ints, floats, booleans, and strings)\n2. What functions/methods are (bonus points if you can tell me the difference)\n3. What for-loops and while-loops are\n4. What objects are\n5. What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.\n\nAfter that, then you can go to the game engine.\n\nIf you mean the whole \"getting used to your environment\" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video. This will teach you how to maneuver.\n\nAfter you understand the 5 basic windows most editors contain (scene view, game view, project files, hierarchy/scene tree, and the inspector), and you've followed maybe 3 basic tutorials, move onto making simple games on your own. [I recommend The 20 Games Challenge](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=82257b40e0c0ad322422c1a739ab848cd655250585883297a44bb103ee62ed7aJmltdHM9MTc2OTczMTIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=2c6d9a75-b7b3-6591-338f-8c84b639640d&psq=the+20+game+challeng&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly8yMF9nYW1lc19jaGFsbGVuZ2UuZ2l0bGFiLmlvL2NoYWxsZW5nZS8) \\- it's an amazing teaching tool simply due how it encourages repetition.\n\nBetween the games you make, try creating some basic systems - like an inventory, or a healthbar. Small things just to learn how to abstract these tools away. Better yet, make them on their own, and reuse them in some projects to learn how to make things modular.\n\nAs for healthy habits:\n\n* In general, you don't start a project in editor, you start with the notepad/whiteboard: Plan. Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.\n* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games\n* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.\n* Follow a consistent coding style. Your code should look the same regardless of where it is - this makes it easier to parse over later. Don't flipflop between \"snake\\_case\" and \"CamelCase\" for example.",

The easiest way is to read about it for a bit and then implement something that tests a feature so it make sense to you. If it has a physics engine, you could loot at how you make an object not be affected by gravity. how do you make an object adhere to gravity, what happens when two objects hit each other.\n\nBuild a single screen game \n\nStart with something simple like Pong. What do you need for that, break it down to the individual components of your game. Two independently moving paddles, a ball that moves and bounces around, and a pair of scoring zones, and a score display for each player.\n\n1. So create your scene, stick in a paddle, hook in keyboard controls so that it can move.\n2. Create a scene, stick in a ball and give it initial momentum so it moves in a direction, hook in the scoring zone and make the ball score if it enters the scoring zone, keep track of the score, display the score\n3. So create a scene, stick in a ball and a paddle and make the ball bounce off the paddle if it is hit.\n4. Create a scene that combines all of the above into one, and you have your game.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that those first three items also give you your tests cases for your game. If you make a change to the game, you can see if you broke something in regards to the gameplay.\n\nLook at the information about the various Game Jams to practice. So these might have a \"phrase\" or a couple of words your game needs to be about. So \"light & dark\", which could be a game about shadows, a Grue, or a battle of good vs evil.",

At first we don't know that there's thing called Virtual Memory which controls every aspect of memory access. The executable .data section is baked into a file (.exe on Windows, elf file format on Linux) so its size is static/constant, never changes its size when the process is running. So it's not that suitable for allocating new memory for data in the future. So the OS have a mechanism (heap) for requesting new memory pages in order for a program to be able to create new objects while it's running. If not for pointers we wouldn't be able to refer to objects located in heap because we don't know beforehand where they would be located, the compiler knows only about variables on the .data section. You can read from a books or ask AI about all these stuff and it would explain to you in a level understable for you.

My personal stack is Web API using controllers for the API, Entity Framework to talk to SQL server and I build a JavaScript web client with Angular and serve from the wwwroot folder. But if you are new to frameworks then React might be an easier learning path than Angular.\n\nThere is a lot to learn but chat GPT is actually pretty good at setting you up a skeleton project for the API and data access and vite can scaffold up you a React client.",

Even a clean console banking app or task manager with decent README looks way better than “I finished a course and now I’m stuck”.\n\nAnd don’t stress about the English – your code editor doesn’t care about accent or grammar, only syntax. Keep posting, keep shipping tiny projects, and your “basics” will quietly turn into “intermediate” faster than you expect.",

        "body": "Yea I wouldn't spend big money on a bootcamp. I would try to setup a study schedule where you are programming every day however. I see you mention wanting to be proficient in AppSec and AI, then it is important to understand that there is more to this than just the language. Many times, when in comes to the language it is just the tool you use to apply logic and with that said AppSec and AI both rely heavily on the fundamentals of Computer science concepts. Discrete math, Data structures and algorithms, operating systems fundamentals, networking basics, databases, etc. With all that said, the one thing you can look at that credentializes you while teaching you all the relevant concepts is a Comp Sci degree. Especially with your stated goals. If you can't get a degree, then focus on first building the foundation for a self made CS curriculum. Appsec in particular isn't just finding bugs in front end code, it includes threat modeling, devops and other infra principles, tons of code review, database management, etc. AI security is emerging in 2 forms. The first being red/blue team tradecraft oriented security. So hacking the models through prompt injection, data poisoning, first order attacks etc. The second form is securing the models themselves, which is actually more inline with the AI/ML engineer/MLOps skillset, the best way to get into this is to pursue a traditional AI focused CS program. Notice, how everything comes back to CS fundamentals. Not assuming you want to jump into a senior position, but security isn't really a beginner focused field. In order to do security properly, you need the knowledge of an engineer and the knowledge of someone who can actually break the app and recommend remediation. Lofty goals is what keeps us motivated, but I would break down your goals in meaningful steps and a meaningful timeline. \n\nTo answer what you would use to learn programming and CS fundamentals, the only course that ever stuck with me was a \"bootcamp\" I took last year for $150 from exercism. They didn't even use a real language for the first half of the course, yet the fundamentals they taught have still stuck with me today. The biggest benefit from this course however was their discord where mentors were there to help guide you to answers on your own. After that I recognized my own shortcomings when it came to algorithmic thinking. I focused on the math and discrete math fundamentals, before jumping back into doing algorithm problems to improve my thinking. Point being AppSec and AI are long roads, try to set yourself up for that journey.",

You could do that as a way to explore different areas of coding though before deciding what to pursue more seriously later once you have more of an idea.\n\nIf you want something that will more likely immediately benefit you and your work, then automate the boring stuff is a great book. If you then explored analytics then you could carve yourself a nice little niche at your job. Its unlikely doing a full stack course will help your career at all compared to this approach.",

        "body": "\nThink of a keyboard as three stacked realities:\n\t1.\tPhysics – switches, rows, columns, diodes\n\t2.\tTime – scanning, debouncing, state transitions\n\t3.\tLanguage – turning switch states into USB HID reports, layers, macros\n\nQMK is just a very thick sandwich around those three ideas.\n\nIf you want to build “your own QMK,” you don’t start with keyboards. You start with microcontroller firmware and USB.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 1: Pick a microcontroller and read its datasheet like scripture\n\nMost custom keyboards use:\n\t•\tATmega32U4 (classic Arduino Pro Micro)\n\t•\tRP2040\n\t•\tSTM32\n\nThe key requirement: native USB device support.\n\nBefore writing any keyboard code, you must understand:\n\t•\tGPIO configuration\n\t•\tTimers / interrupts\n\t•\tUSB endpoints\n\t•\tFlash + RAM limits\n\nThis is not optional. QMK hides this pain; you’re choosing to feel it.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 2: Implement a matrix scanner (this is the soul)\n\nA keyboard PCB is usually a row × column matrix.\n\nAlgorithmically:\n\t•\tSet all columns as outputs\n\t•\tSet all rows as inputs with pull-ups\n\t•\tDrive one column LOW at a time\n\t•\tRead rows\n\t•\tRepeat fast (≈1 kHz)\n\nYou will write:\n\t•\tGPIO init\n\t•\tA scan loop\n\t•\tA key state bitmap\n\nThis alone teaches you more embedded thinking than most app devs ever touch.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 3: Debouncing (time becomes real)\n\nSwitches lie. They bounce.\n\nYou need:\n\t•\tPer-key state\n\t•\tTimestamp or counter\n\t•\tStable-state confirmation\n\nClassic strategies:\n\t•\tIntegrator counters\n\t•\tTime-based debounce\n\t•\tState machines\n\nQMK has multiple debounce algorithms. Rewriting one is a rite of passage.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 4: Build a key event pipeline\n\nAt this point you have:\n\t•\tRaw matrix state\n\t•\tPress / release events\n\nNow you design your own internal API:\n\nraw_scan → debounced_state → key_event → action\n\nThis is where you can do things QMK doesn’t:\n\t•\tProbabilistic chording\n\t•\tPressure-aware timing\n\t•\tContextual layers (editor-aware, app-aware)\n\nThis is where creativity lives.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 5: USB HID from scratch (the dragon)\n\nNow the hard truth:\nUSB is the real boss fight.\n\nYou must implement:\n\t•\tUSB descriptors\n\t•\tHID report descriptors\n\t•\tPolling interval logic\n\t•\tKey rollover handling\n\nYou can:\n\t•\tWrite USB by hand (brutal but pure)\n\t•\tOr use a thin USB stack (LUFA, TinyUSB) without keyboard logic\n\nThis is still “from scratch” in spirit—USB is a protocol, not magic.\n\n⸻\n\nStep 6: Layers, macros, and remapping (language emerges)\n\nLayers are just:\n\t•\tLookup tables\n\t•\tStackable keymaps\n\t•\tState-dependent resolution\n\nMacros are:\n\t•\tEvent playback engines\n\t•\tTimed HID reports\n\nNothing mystical. QMK only organizes it well.\n\n⸻\n\nWhere to actually learn this (non-obvious sources)\n\nNot “keyboard tutorials.” Those are downstream.\n\nStudy instead:\n\t•\tUSB HID specification\n\t•\tLUFA examples (keyboard + mouse)\n\t•\tBare-metal MCU tutorials\n\t•\tOld AVR keyboard firmware (pre-QMK era)\n\nThen read QMK last, like reading a cathedral after learning how stones are cut.\n\n⸻\n\nA sharper insight most people miss\n\nQMK is not a keyboard firmware.\n\nQMK is:\n\t•\tA hardware abstraction layer\n\t•\tA policy engine for input\n\t•\tA build system that normalizes chaos\n\nIf you rebuild it, don’t clone it.\nDesign something smaller, stranger, and opinionated.\n\nFor example:\n\t•\tA keyboard that adapts layout based on typing entropy\n\t•\tA keyboard that changes layers by time-of-day\n\t•\tA keyboard optimized for African language input patterns\n\t•\tA keyboard that treats macros as code, not sequences\n\nThat’s how you go beyond “my own QMK” and into new instruments.",

All of the knowledge you learn in JavaScript is transferable. You’re not wasting time learning JS. In fact, you may understand the value prop of TS better if you continue to focus on JS. \n\nWhat should you learn next? Idk. I usually get the most value out of building something. Maybe try to build a website using Node Express. That’ll put your JavaScript, HTML and CSS to the test.

Always have it \"working\".\n\nThe alternative - what you should not do - is spend a long time writing code for different pieces of your system without putting them together. That will likely lead to huge gaps in knowledge and dead ends.\n\nSo for example start by making your homepage. Then make it load items from a database. Then add an \"add to cart\" feature. Then add search. Then add a recommendation system but where the recommendation is pregenerated. Then make the recommendation smarter.\n\nAnd so on. Don't bite off too much at a time. Each new feature should only take a day or two.\n\nIf it takes longer, stop and break it down into smaller pieces. If you can't make a shopping cart in a day or two, break it down. First make a shopping cart icon on your app. Then make it so that clicking Add to Cart increments the count. And so on.",

Since you're already using FreeCodeCamp, some of the beginner explanations might feel unnecessary. However, there's a great thing about TOP: even if you decide to switch, you won't need to start from scratch. You can skip some sections. Though I suggest you review them in case something is missing. In general, though, TOP doesn't actually force you to finish everything, though it strongly suggests it.\nAs for my background, I'm just a hobby developer. I don't work in the IT field. However, the knowledge and skills I gained from TOP allowed me to create apps and systems for my own convenience at work. Let me tell you, TOP works! Once you're finished, you'll have a foundation, and then you can jump into different frameworks and languages. For example, I'm currently migrating my apps from Remix, a React framework, to Laravel.

        "body": "Sure you can change paths. In the long run I doubt you will stay at the same place. Sometimes things get boring. As I said, early in my career I was prefering frontend and invested a lot of time in javascript and related frameworks, was interested in UX design even (real full stack back then 🤣 from db schema design, backend to the html and css). Years later I was focused more on backend. Then the natural things in career growth - managing teams, where soft skills are way more important. But turned out that was not really my thing, being too far from creating things and instead, doing hiring, budgeting, such kind of boring stuff. Now I am in architect role - mostly talking and drawing, but way more connected to development teams, although not writing code. Don't miss it. Only occasionally I get to code something by myself helping teams in hard situations and I like it so. My point is - you shouldn't overthink it that much. There is no right or wrong, every decision comes with mistakes and lessons. Whatever you choose, you will learn something. If you do a mistake, you will learn more! And with years you will eventually get bored in something. One more important advice - stay there, where there are better guys than you - to compete with them and learn fron them. If you notice you aren't learning and progressing - change the job and even consider shift in technology or role. It's not that big of a problem to shift from c# to java .. or python. Having the basis and experience makes it really easy. (A lot of words I've wrote, sorry for that! 🤣",

We are turned off by things we don’t understand, and there’s only one thing that can push you through that…\n\n**Incentive** — whether it be money, passion, fame, notoriety, a family that needs you to succeed, a boss breathing down your neck, having no other options and just trying to survive, or a combination of any of these and then some — *something* needs to push you to keep going. I will assume that in your stage of coding there are few things that keep you coding for long periods of time and at consistent frequencies *eg; Monday - Friday, 9 - 5*\n\nFind a point to motivate you to keep going, take breaks when you’re confused but COME BACK as soon as you feel it’s tolerable. Practice, refine your skills, and prepare to be (at the very least) a satisfied cog in this world’s big machine, with a decent paying job (maybe better if you try hard enough), a happy wife or husband and a happy life.\n\n**NO ONE** goes to work every day, consistently, for a fixed amount of time because they *have a lot of energy or a positive mind* as you say — they do it to survive, and if they’re lucky they have a passion for the field in some way, shape or form. If you even have a *small* notion that you think you’ve found something you’re good at, make that your rock and refine it.\n\nBut hey, you could always try something else and see what happens — it is also a natural part of life to go a different path, maybe you like it and never come back to coding, maybe you don’t. The important part is that you’re thinking about it critically.\n\n— College Dropout, Formerly in Healthcare for 10 years, now Software Engineer at a Bank.",

Most candidates have a 4-year degree. However, if you do get hired, the pay is good. If you're in the U.S. the pay is excellent.\n\nIf you build indie apps, games, or websites, then the barrier to entry is very low. You can make a website or app after learning for less than a month. You could even make a few dollars. However, the chances of making a living are tiny. The top 1% of indie developers make nearly all of the money.\n\nThe third option is freelance / consulting. That basically goes up with experience - it's impossible as a beginner, but once you have experience and become an expert in something you can make great money and set your own hours.

It can't understand game feel, performance tradeoffs or player psychology, it also has trouble with architecting systems properly and cleanly and of course, it's also not too good at optimizing things. AI can't replace all programmers, only the ones that don't understand what they're doing\n\nCoding is still worth it, even if you're not a genius, you can still get paid well, ship games and freelance, maybe build some other tools if that's what you end up interested in and it also opens a couple doors to tech roles  \nEven if you're \"pretty good\", understand fundamentals and know how to debug and optimize, you'll find a spot on the market, the top of the top make real good money, the middle top still live very comfortably\n\nCoding has good money if you stick with it long enough to get good and specialize in something and if you actually build stuff instead of only learning theory, your value as a developer is mostly indicated by your portfolio so especially work on that, ESPECIALLY in game dev because I feel it's generally more competitive than other IT sectors, knowing how to really optimize is a rare skill and rare skills get paid better (generally speaking)\n\nSpeaking from my own standpoint as a game dev, there's luckily some benefits that help irl too :)  \nLearning to code helps you train structured thinking, breaking down problems, I've also especially noticed I've gotten a lot more patient and persistent, this might be because of debugging? might be the cause? idk? on top of that, you'll understand computers more if you don't yet and you'll learn that ideas in your head can actually very quickly become real things that you, yourself can make instead of waiting for someone to invent it for you  \nIf something is broken, you can understand and fix it, is a mindset I often see return in IT and it carries around in every field\n\nLearning it obviously takes time, there's no shortcuts but you don't have to rush it and you don't have to master it all right away at the same time and you don't have to do it for the money instantly either, if you're already feeling interest, that's a big sign it's worth learning\n\nIf your goals are to make games, optimize systems and working with 3D and web (and understanding how things actually work) then coding isn't just something useful but rather foundational, making a game without code or little code (especially if you go into more complicated games) is nearly impossible\n\nEven if you don't become a full time programmer, knowing how to code helps you in general and gives you some kind of leverage in pretty much any tech related field\n\n\n\ntldr: Yes, it’s still worth learning to code now especially if you’re into games, optimization, 3D, and web but don't do it cause \"coding = guaranteed money\", it also has benefits outside of your specific goal",

The blunt truth is most people treat learning to code as a get-rich-quick scheme, and when they realize the hard work involved, they bail.\n\nOf the people that reach a professionally capable level *at all*, it's not only the \"extremely good\" that make money.

Lots of folks don't realize the sheer human scale of operating a massive platform with years or decades of features built by thousands of engineers.\n\nFor example: adding a single column to a users table is simple in a small shop. But at a large place that column on a critical table like such can likely: break 3 other teams downstream systems, add millions in costs in various places for storage, affect multiple critical APIs from added latency of making the payloads larger through out the stack, lead to bad downstream decisions who mis interpret the column perhaps (it happens a lot), not to mention new scaling concerns for > millions of rps\n\nThat's just a few things off the top of my head but now factor that with how many sub features those big platforms have across multiple systems. There are literally thousands of sub systems at larger places that need coordination at human scale.\n\nThe pool of engineers who can navigate this tends to be limited to a smaller circle, since lots of folks can code a system from scratch but many companies don't have such a scale. I see a lot of folks who join into this type of scale and either leave or take a few years to \"get it\" then some more years to really be valuable contributor.",

I was terrified of not being able to get my foot in the door and not being able to keep it there. \n\nIf I failed, 4 years of college would have been pointless. Plus, I knew id be taking care of my Ma once Dad retired. After graduating, I only had 2 years to get a high enough salary to support us both.\n\nOnce I got hired, I felt I had to prove myself with failure resulting in a dead career.

The coworkers I've had that went straight from college into CS jobs are usually some of the most uninteresting people I've ever met.  And holy shit do I miss my life in a lot of ways before I started working as a dev.  The people were far more interesting, the work often more rewarding, just the variety of experiences so much more interesting.  So yes, a lot of them are sheltered.  But it's almost not even just software devs, I think a lot of it is just what comes from the stability of having a career.  People talk about mortgages, cleaning rain gutters, taking their children to the doctor and sports practice and stuff.\n\nWhen I was working in my twenties, nobody really had access to that stuff, it was survival, and a lot of people had odd hours or inconsistent work which frees them up to pursue hobbies more or lead unconventional lives.  Get off work at 10 pm, go to the bar, get drunk, go see live music, do drugs, stay out late, run into friends at the bar, go to gallery openings, ride bicycles until 3 am in the city.  The office life is go to bed at 10pm, wake up workout, repeat.  It's a different life.  And then for a lot of the devs I know that do actually get out and do fun stuff, it still feels different... More transactional.  Because now you are operating with PTO, so you go on big spendy vacations, or fuck you go to burning man and you spend 5k setting up camp, getting tickets, buying drugs, buying a stupid festival outfit you only wear once... I miss my life before staring at a screen, but hopefully I'll return to living day to day once I retire early from stashing all this cash lol",

You're simply making assumptions about the input or output that are not actually stated in the task.\n\n\nYou're not anticipating lists to be empty or unsorted, numbers to be negative, zero or repeated.\n\n\n> and a couple where I just have no idea, I'm just stumped.\n\n\nPick up a book on data structures and algorithms. You're trying to learn by doing the test over and over again until you pass, rather than taking the class. Not only is that a highly inefficient way to pass the test, it also means you're not going to learn the material on the way..\n\n\n> And I'll have to do two of these in under an hour?!?! Am I really just this completely awful at the job I had for so long, in the field I'm stuck in?\n\n\nUnpopular opinion: Yeah.\n\n\nAlgorithms and data structures are an integral part of our craft. Just because we can often get away with not paying due attention to them doesn't mean that produces quality results, or that there will never be situations where they don't matter.\n\n\nIf you were an accountant, I would expect you to be able to do so e basic math, whether all of your actual work was fine with the aid if a calculator or not, too.\n\n\nFurthermore, it's a test. It doesn't aim to, or need to, be a perfect representation of your work day. I would ask you to look for the video of Gordon Ramsey being able to butcher a chicken while blindfolded. Other than a stunt done for TV, it is a test of his raw skills. And even though few chefs will ever find themselves having to perform that particular task, I'd trust anyone who can do it more than anyone who can't.\n\n\nThe good news is that any competent chef should be able to learn to perform this trick fairly quickly and easily. So, if companies decided that this is what chefs should do to get hired, no real chef should have a problem. (And, therefore, the test would work as expected: Filter out the vast majority of really bad chefs. That it also filters out some number of decent chefs that just can't be bothered with the parlour trick is not an issue for the restaurant.)",

My answer would be different if you were a fresh new grad or still in school, because there's a good case to be made that you still need to build up the manual coding skills before learning to rely on AI. But if you're an experienced engineer already, you should absolutely be taking advantage of the most recent tooling. You're only going to see skill atrophy over the long term if it's truly not needed, and you can always refresh your manual coding skills if needed.\n\n**One very very critical thing, though:** It's trivial to prompt AI agents and get output that *works,* but that's not enough. You should be aiming for code quality that *exceeds* the quality of your prior manual output, and you should always understand the details of how it all works - neither of which are very hard if you leverage the AI to do this (e.g. get it to refactor when needed, use other AI tools to review the code, ask for explanations).\n\nMost \"vibe coders\" don't do this, and that's where tech debt problems come in quickly. Serious professional engineers are leveraging AI in a very different way, keeping the AI on a short leash and ensuring high quality output just like in the manual coding days.",

He corrected some misconceptions that I had and explained that their primary business model was to compete with banks. Banks are also pretty predatory to their low-income customers, but that's a couple steps above things like payday and title loans, and, honestly, I probably would not have had similar concerns about an offer from a bank. The meeting convinced me that the company's business was above my own personal ethical line.

If everyone is spending months grinding leetcode, the only way to get a 1% pass rate is to dial up the questions to ridiculous difficulty.  It's become a \"how badly do you want this job\" test more than a matter of ability.  The interviews are so hard that the only way to ace the interview is to have practiced that exact question before.  Then it's a dance where you pretend to be solving it on the spot, when you actually have memorized the answer already.",

Just a month ago I landed my first SWE job. There are definitely go guarantees, and it will likely take a while but its definitely not impossible. \n\nMy advice would be to focus on \n\n1. Projects: Building projects that you can talk about and show in some way, whether it be a demo of the project, a blog, or anything else. With AI you can pretty much just pick any topic you are interested in, find something that seems interesting to build and is within a reasonable scope and build it. Bonus points if its a product that solve actual peoples problems, product thinking is highly valued at startups. The goal is to show people that you have actually done stuff, and to be able to talk about it.\n\n2. Network: The most universal thing I learned after a year of searching for jobs was that pretty much everyone I knew got their job through some sort of connection and is also how I ended up getting my job, and this is doubly true in todays market. Network as aggressively as you can (not annoyingly but just a lot of people) and reach out to your own personal network. The cost is basically nothing other than maybe your ego, and the upside is tremendous, you never know who could be the one that has the connect, and people are very often happy to help. \n\n  \nDefinitely still apply to companies but don't spend too much time on it especially if you aren't getting much positive feedback. Your first job will most likely be from just knowing the right person (networking) and actually having something to show for your skills (projects). Good luck, and message me if you have any other questions I think my experience has made me somewhat of an expert in the subject lol.",

        "body": "Traditional engineer here (chemical, not that it matters)... turns out, USA vs. Europe area engineering or not that makes little difference.  It looks like, checks the replies, a lot of software developers are just toxic regardless of where they live.  A lot of you all are really arguing about stupid shit.  Software development isn't a zero sum game, for US developers to win, EU doesn't have to lose, and vice versa.\n\nDo we chalk this up to people just being young?  Do European posters in /r/cscareerquestions ALSO skew young and NOT actually employed as software developers, just like the US counterparts?\n\nAnyways, unlike many people here, I regularly during the course of my work, engage with large teams of European engineers.  Primarily engineers from Ireland, Poland, and Germany.  Ireland is unique, in that it also has a large diaspora of engineers from OTHER European countries.  These have included multiple engineers from England, Spain, and France, and Architects from Ireland, Italy, and England.\n\nTwo things that have helped dramatically, are:  Persistent and clear communication.  Both parties need to be patient, and be \"clear\" with their communication.  English will be the lingua fraca, but all English is not the same.  Focus on using COMMON, more likely to be known, phrases, words, etc.  Avoid idioms that someone not from your country isn't going to know.  It's REALLY common for native speakers/writers to go crazy with this and communicate in a way that is very difficult to understand.  Simplify it down.  Assume positive intent, if something SOUNDS off, it's probably a bad translation.  Every language has it's own difficulties in translation to English.  Above all else, patience by BOTH parties.\n\nThe other, is absolutely when working with counterparts in other cultures, you HAVE to learn and understand what their leadership and accountability paradigm is, relative to yours.  Do NOT assume it is the same way, at all, to yours.  How people are led (do people DEFER to leadership, or INFORM leadership), how people are mentored, how people are held accountable, differs WILDLY between cultures; and, even within that culture, particularly in Poland I see big differences between junior and senior engineers.  I suspect in that country there's a divide there too; if I had to guess, it's roughly the 15+ and above vs. the newer peeps.  But, I don't fully understand, despite how much polish interaction I get.\n\nWith that last one, comes ASSUME positive intent.  Assume they WANT to get the job done, and done well, and seek to understand how and why they're behaving the way they are.  A metaphor I like to use borrows from the old American story about the cherry tree and the axe.  If \"Culture A\" was going to cut down a tree, and had 10 hours to do it, how many hours would they spend sharpening the axe?\"  The polish would sharpen the axe, and a backup axe, for 9.5 hours.  The Irish?  They cut it down last week.  My point?  The spread between preparing for the act, and doing the act, varies wildly, and can be a VERY common source of frustration ALL around.\n\nAnyways, good luck.  I've both enjoyed at times, and hated at times, working with various European engineering cultures.",

It requires so much more manual control/oversight and I bet 90% are taking shortcuts that will eventually cause everything to collapse. Although if they can just limp it along another 6-7 years they can once again blame current devs (who were forced to make bad decisions due to agile) and get another consulting project to redesign into whatever flavor of data structure is popular at the time. \n\nIf we just stepped back and talked about responsibilities and how to best structure the work we could really build some awesome stuff but it would require two teams, an agile and a core team. Agile works it so far but eventually tossed it back to the core team who properly builds it out (now that the nitty gritty details have been identified) and the cycle continues",

If you want to break through it you'll need to take some risks and really push yourself.\n\nIf you can, find a new team in the org to work in. What would be better though, if possible, would be to get a new job entirely.\n\nMost people move jobs for a salary increase, but another big part of it is the ability to sort of \"start over\" from step 1. Obviously if you're coming in as a senior engineer or something they'll expect you to onboard a bit faster, but you'll have that opportunity to start off asking those clarification questions and gaining that deep understanding without feeling like you're desperately behind. I've talked to other engineers about this exact feeling before and while some people boil it down to things like \"imposter syndrome\" the cold hard truth is usually that you actually aren't good enough at the moment. There have been critical mistakes made early on in your career that have stagnated your growth as an engineer and sometimes the best thing to do is simply acknowledge that you're in a position where growth is no longer possible and move on.\n\nAka, you can try and fix the soil or you can just plant your seeds somewhere else. Both options are perfectly valid, but I've found that most people find it easier to improve with a small do-over period. It's a daunting prospect though I won't lie.\n\nKeep in mind this only applies if you want to be one of the giga-nerd seniors who seem to solve every problem and know every code solution. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with just doing your job. Not everyone wants to grind it out and become an SME. \n\nYou can also take your knowledge and look to pivot into management now that you're a senior. Less technical and more people heavy if that's your style. I just think you'd benefit from a new perspective is all.",

Don't try to get it perfect the first time, because it's impossible.

All of the interviews were semi-position agnostic meaning I could get an offer for mid-level or senior if offered at depending how the interviews went. Ended up getting a mid-level offer, which feels somewhat lateral if not almost a step down in responsibility, but was a jump in salary. With my previous org facing impending layoffs it wasn’t anything to wring my hands over. \n\nFrankly, cold applying doesn’t feel super great right now. If you get the opportunity to connect with a recruiter (mine reached out to me via InMail on LinkedIn) take advantage. People are definitely hiring, but the open positions don’t exactly match what they’re posting on the internet from what I’m seeing.",

Removing it creates a gap of twelve months between graduation and your next role. Most hiring managers view a one-year post-graduation gap as a greater risk than a short stint at an established firm like AMD. The brand name helps confirm your technical skills.\n\nYour current challenge is the total number of jobs you have held in a few years. You must change how you present your history during interviews. Instead of justifying why you left, explain that you have learned that high-growth startups do not provide the structure you need. State that you are now prioritizing stability and long-term projects.\n\nFocus your search on large companies in the automotive or consumer electronics sectors. These industries typically have the HR resources and management training that startups lack. You need an environment where the requirements are documented and the management style is predictable. This shift will help you break the cycle of short tenures and build a more consistent professional record.",

        "body": "Your resume has significant room for improvement I have some recommendations that could make a major difference in how recruiters perceive your candidacy.\n\nThe most critical issue is your experience section. You have too many bullet points per role (standard is 3 to 5 maximum but since its one company around 5 is okay, maybe 6 if it’s really really worth it), and more importantly, they lack substance. When you write something like “Diagnosed systemic product-line defects, implemented robust fixes,” you’re not telling recruiters anything useful. What defect did you find? What made your fix robust? What changed as a result? Right now you’re describing tasks instead of demonstrating impact.\n\nEvery bullet point should follow a simple structure: what you achieved, how you did it, and ideally with numbers to back it up. Instead of listing what you did, show what happened because you did it. Compare “Implemented automated testing” to “Cut deployment time from 6 hours to 45 minutes by building an automated testing suite in Jenkins that caught 80% of bugs before production.” One is forgettable, the other proves you deliver results.\n\nYour summary section needs to go entirely. It takes up valuable space without adding value, and it creates a wall of text that makes recruiters skip to the next resume. Remember, most people spend under 10 seconds scanning your resume initially. Every line needs to earn its place.\n\nWith that space freed up, add more projects. Keep a rotating collection you can swap based on the role you’re applying for. Tailor them to highlight relevant skills for each position. Your current project description is far too vague and you’re missing an opportunity. If university teams are actually using what you built, name them specifically. That transforms a generic claim into proof of real-world impact.\n\nIf you want to preserve some of the context your summary provided, move your skills section to the top. This immediately tells recruiters what you bring to the table and helps them understand everything else they read through that lens.\n\nYour formatting also has problems. Company name, job title, and dates should all be on one line for ATS compatibility. Include months with your dates, not just years. Separating projects from education will also improve scannability and make both sections easier to parse quickly\n\nHope I don’t come off as too harsh. Good luck!",

[Scalability Rules, 2nd Edition](https://a.co/d/j0dQVbm) (no longer being printed, but can be found in PDF online).\n3. [Building Microservices](https://a.co/d/c3i06pq)\n4. [Release It!](https://a.co/d/5Gg1CBt)\n5. [Designing Web APIs](https://a.co/d/c7I3WTH)\n\nDon't learn CI/CD \"by hand\". Learn the Infrastructure as Code approach either using Terraform or AWS CDK.\n\nThat should take you pretty far. It'll take around a year and a half to finish everything (could be less depending on how much time you put into it).\n\nGood luck!",

Plus the vibecoders should provide job security. A general SWE job is onviously always an option. Giving up isn't something I would recommend for someone with your background. Maybe just apply to jobs, if you find something you like takeit, otherwise get an advanced degree. If you do get an advanced degree, maybe working part-timeon the side to ern some money and get some experience on your cv would be an option.

They’re probably going for someone early career who is passionate and knows their stuff. If that person were smart, they wouldn’t stay long. \n\nA single person could do the work, but their pace would be slow from being stretched so thinly. \n\nI’m skeptical of the environment given some of the assumptions, but it could be a decent early job from a resume-building perspective. It lists as part-time and internship among the job types. This job sounds a lot like a couple part-time jobs I had while in school. My hunch is their expectations will be lower than what you’re expecting from the job description. Could be a small business or a university. \n\nIf you hit the top-end of what they’re offering, that’s over $60k a year. That’s on the low-end for a dev, but given some of the posts you see in this sub, some of those people would kill for this job. \n\nNot every job is part of an enterprise software team, and it can be an opportunity for someone to start. ",

It was so hard to pick up and start that when it came time to work on any backend stuff (after finishing the frontend) for my projects, I would just cave in and give up.

Django is more common in industry, but id advise you go on LinkedIn and look at job postings yourself and see whats in demand, especially so that you know what other relevent technologies there is to learn (e.g. docker and AWS).",

More OT the longer the slack off.  I also give my people the slack off time. Example is hard push, release out it is ok everyone be available, respond on slack if need be but dont worry about anything else.  That means I will most likely be playing a video game with my phone next to me.  I have gone to the grocery store, took a nap, built a lego set.   \n\nLargely I refuse to do to much work and I have clear boundaries.  Even during crunch time I sign off at 6pm and will not come back until 9pm to get any extra work done and I dont start my day early.  Most of the time I sign off at 530-6 and I am done until the next day.

I worked normally, communicated progress, and things got done when they got done.  Nobody cared at the companies I worked for.\n\nHell, one project I was on missed a major milestone by year.

I wish I had been less stubborn and willing to listen to a mentor.\n\n\nI would recommend making the game development a hobby, make it for androids, and make it to fix specific table top game editions, like D&D.\n\n\nBut I found that the more I worked at the fun, the less fun it was.  Turns out I have a.d.h.d. and autism and if I had been able to be medicated through school, I would have been unstoppable.\n\n\nI was pretty bitter trying to find work in 2008-2011 in video games while learning and programming in C++ for \"the game\" I had in my head.  Then once I would know what \"the game\" was, I would do some research and find out that someone else had the idea and had already done it.\n\n\nThat's when it hit me, the ideas are a dime a dozen, and everyone has them; it's being able to make it into a reality and get it to market faster than the competition that gets the money.\n\n\nThe secret, kookily enough, was watching the movie \"the secret\" and saying to myself \"If I am always saying that I am burned out and there are no jobs, then that is my reality\".  So instead I said \"I am a positive person, pleasant to be around, I love people, and there are lots of jobs I would enjoy (each of those was a lie)\".\n\n\nI just had that mindset and I just flipped the job search rules on its head and I just applied for everything that looked interesting.  I had one resume, one cover letter, a few letters of reference, and then I just \"cold job applied\", or \"shotgun approach\".  I just stopped looking at the job, the description, the requirements, and instead of stressing about if I qualified for a job or tailoring my resume and cover letter for one hour and then applying for one job in two hours, I did a blanket google search, opened up the top ten results in tabs, and just went through uploading my resume and cover letter to sites and applying for as many jobs as I could.  Some were an email, some were uploading documents, some were transcribing into their web fields, so some took a minute to apply to, some took 20 minutes.  I just applied and applied and applied.\n\n\nI \"knew\" everyone else was going to be tailoring their resume to the job, so instead of me doing that for each one, I wrote the cover letter like it was a personal conversation between friends and I sold myself as an amazing worker and someone they wanted on their team.\n\n\nI'd been applying for about a day before I got a call for a job where they were looking for a permanent full time position (but I didn't know that cause I hadn't really read the job listing).  I had a 2 year technical diploma and had just finished my 3rd year of a bsc in computer science, I was on summer break...\n\n\nSo I went to the preliminary interview and fucking nailed it with my positive attitude and my honest answers of \"I don't know what that is or how to do it, but I honestly don't know what I am doing with most things.  What I know how to do is know when I don't know, I know how to look something up, and I learn fast\".\n\n\nThey ended up hiring me for a summer rather than any of the other full time applicants that they had.    I fucking love automation and I get bored easily.  It was a tech support job for a software development company, so everytime I answered a question, I templated the response.  There's really only 20 questions anyone could have about this software, and I knew what they were cause I had been doing templated responses from May to July.\n\n\nIn July I asked to get some screen recording and captioning software to make some tutorial videos; I made basic, intermediate, and advanced video tutorials, published them, and the calls stopped.\n\n\nI had automated myself out of a job, and then I went back to school and finished my fourth year.\n\n\nI had a competitive job offer from them half way through the year, full benefits, to come back and work for them.  It was a great company, it got acquired during covid, but I did basically the same thing for them for 3 years before moving on.\n\n\nI just kept looking at something that had to be done more than once and figured out how to automate it.\n\n\nThe moral of this story is sometimes you have to run before you can walk.  Successfully selling yourself and taking initiative to do your job and improve everything, rather than just collecting a cheque allowed me to develop a specific set of skills.\n\n\nI work for a much bigger company now, \"work\" is a strong term.  I do tech support and am on a team with other people where we get sent problems no one can figure out how to fix.  We figure it out, fix it, and automate it.\n\n\nI never would have figured that out without actually doing it.",

For related art stuff I’ve made some animations recently (2D hand drawn digital animations) such as a basic looping character walk cycle from one angle and a few other simple animations, and I’ve also drawn some 2D digital art for a very brief unfinished game demo group project in university too but I didn’t end up doing any of the code for that one.

My only worry is the possibility that having formal diagnoses could lead to issues if I want to move out of the U.S. or cause discrimination based on having that on my medical record (more worried about autism as opposed to ADHD for that knowing how autistic people often get mistreated, seen as incompetent, and infantilized).",

You generally still defer to ML people if there's data set training or what have you etc.\n\nAnd like I said, IME full stack isn't really a know-everything role in practice, candidates for these roles simply don't have that level of depth. It's in fact hard to find people that can do well in DS&A and frontend specialization loops, and just about zero that can do both well and also be able to implement ML basics like k-fold.",

You simply become another statistic that complains about the job market, because you put in 3,500 resumes and got 4 total responses, 3 of which declined you and one got you through. In my experience so far just doing it by hand I have yet to have a job completely ghost me and I am currently sitting at 12 applications. Mind you these were all declines still, and I will have to hunt for a little while. I do use Ai, specifically for cover letters though, but more of a guidance than fully copy pasting. Everything comes from me, but using Ai to get the thoughts flowing rather than sitting there and spending an hour on each letter that nobody will read just makes sense. I can get the creative juices flowing and type away the letter in about ten minutes or so. So, there is certainly a usefulness to Ai.\n\nI also certainly do not want to tell you which way is better over the other. It is literally a matter of do you want to manually apply to 50 - 200 places and have a higher chance of hearing something back? Or do you just want to apply to every job on the planet and not hear zip except for a couple gold mines? Believe me, there are a ton of people out there not using Ai at all or even experienced it, so they get a letter that sounds like a robot typed it (if they read it), it is going right in the trash. So it is really just that, quality vs quantity, they both can win, and in this situation they both win at the same time and lose at the same time.",
