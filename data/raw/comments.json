If you do then there's nothing wrong with using them in prod.\n\n\nSome more thoughts: The issue that I usually see in practice is that once you start introducing these things then notebooks' convenience is reduced, so there's a lot of resistance against controls that prevent people from just yeeting something into production.  And once you let people yeet their non-important work, its only a matter of time before people start yeeting important work.",

Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.\n* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.\n* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.\n* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.\n* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.\n* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.\n\nThe common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. \n\nModeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",

I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.\n\nInsurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.\n\nI was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \\~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.\n\nNot sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024. Morale went from sky-high to the absolute gutter after the layoffs, so a lot of us bounced in the aftermath of that.\n\nOnce you've seen how stressful consulting and other industries can be, then how unerringly *stable* insurance is, it's hard to want to leave.",

        "body": "My POV is someone who is closely following the work happening in iceberg, arrow, ADBC, data fusion, etc. These are technologies that are making data tools more interoperable and standardized which is what open here refers to.\n\n—-\n\nSo back to my point: The majority of the disagreement here comes from how people are defining “open.” This doesn’t mean open source. If you pay attention to the current developments, it’s about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” to tools and formats that can talk to one another and in general, enable much more efficient data transfer. These two alone unlock many downstream applications!\n\nAs a small example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and proprietary file formats together. That’s where the lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format  (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.\n\nThe thing that’s really exciting and evolving is the maturation of standardized components of technological primitives that many modern tools use today. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), ABDC for super fast data transfer ,and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all are working towards the same future. They’re all open source, want to converge to open standards, and if used together, enable an “open data infrastructure”. Which means the engine you use for AI/ML, real-time applications, and BI can all be based on data that lives in one storage layer and yet, can be run in any compute engine. Developers can live in a world where you can work towards running local dev in DuckDB and prod workloads in Snowflake. Minimizing vendor lock-in to me is just the a small side-benefit.\n\nVendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of this new infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model for the technological benefits, but also allows them to compete with Snowflake/Databricks/etc at a completely different angle. If engines are swappable, these big platforms lose a lot of their architectural leverage. Now the power and thing to control is the stuff outside of that (I will let you think through that part as an exercise haha).  \n\nAll of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes “open data infra” is a buzz word and is marketing for sure, but if you follow the current state of technology, there’s real nuance here!",

Once you know the basics of SQL/Python/basic Data Engineering fundamentals (CDC/Data Governance/OOP/Security/Statistic/DevOps/BI/etc), the questions one can be asked in this industry is so vast that practicing for it may be in vain. Esp in the high pressure screen share environment of difficult questions one might be asked. \n\nThe longer you work at that job the more senior one can become. Avoid working in/applying to industries/for companies that intentionally use older technologies. By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. \n\nThis approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year. Which, like reading 20 pages of a book a day, can be the simple consistency of a few jobs a day. And when my current job stopped challenging me enough during the pandemic I joined a start-up to challenge myself further. They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.\n\nI never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries.

I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.\n\nDay to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”\n\nStep up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.\n\nBranding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.\n\nGotchas:\nYou will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.\nYou’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.\nIf you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.\n\nWith 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is. If yes, AE is a pretty solid move.",

Their solutions tend to be one off purpose built imports. They almost never parameterize their solutions and any meta data used is typically a json file in the app and locked behind version control.\n\nWhen you are tasked with modeling an enterprise asset, you're forced to figure out ways of genericize your solution to support future initiatives.

So not too technical. \n\nIntermediate models ,i.e., models used to split up complex transformation logic are documented with the developers as an audience, so they are much more technical and basically explain what we are doing CTE by CTE.\n\nFor most models #Business Logic is a section where we explain the specific business logic/rules implemented. \n\nThe LLM infers these business logic by lopking both at the RAW query and inline comments. Also if it detects a business logic from a query, we instruct it to add short inline comments explaining it. So it goes both ways.\n\nUsing LLM to generate documentation increases the doc coverage in our project and increases the uniformity of documentation structure across all models. \n\nIn turn this documentation is then indeed used to power AI Agents for Data Discovery - think chatting with agents to discover which/where data is stored to answer specific request, so they don't answer the question, they just point the user to where they can probably find their answer. It may be also a documented exposure, not model per se. \nAnd eventually it could also power AI analytics, where they actually access a semantic/metrics layer or directly query the database based on all of the context. \n\n\nSo yes, we document business logic and use LLMs to do so for uniformity and completeness.",

        "body": "That sounds like a great way to create some really toxic team dynamics!\n\nRemember, people will optimize for what you measure.  So you better make *really* sure that what you measure is what actually adds value, or what you want people to be focused on.\n\nDoing something around story points is awful, but is one of a small number of equally bad choices.  You can minimize the harm by equalizing story points available across the team, and using discretion to add points (or subtasks) dynamically for things that wind up being more complex than estimated.  It still puts a LOT more pressure (somewhere) on estimating and updating points.  And you will still get people trying to cherry pick tasks with the most ROI (points to level of effort) or pad the points numbers.  Have fun with that!\n\nI would still rather have a performance review from a human who knows all the nuances of what I did and why.  That way I can focus on doing things we (collectively and dynamically) agree matter, and not worry about gaming metrics.  Then it is upper management's job to make sure those leaders are good at what they do, and my option to go elsewhere if they prove not to be.",

Using AI to get immediate results without knowing how it works isn't inherently bad. We all use tons of libraries and we didn't reviewed their code. \n\nBut you can't do it always like that.

Stitch is ugly and cheap.

Designing solutions that bring out the best of each tool and wiring it all together into a comprehensive platform is what you hire good Data Engineers for. Personally, I would much rather be tying together disparate tools that excel in at least one category rather than being forced to use an all-in-one commercial solution that excels at none of them.",

Doing this with gemini, open metadata, and a tool that feels like microstrategy before it was a bitcoin company. They can call down decent data from a lake or table and bitch to high heaven but my plan is basically to tell them that their excel files are trash and they need to clean them up or start learning. The tool foeces data into a standard and offers some agents for clean up. We have a fundign and culture problem though. Also, once the 50% that are eager to do things with data are showing the leaps and bounda they are making over other departments, we may get another 20 to 30% adoption.

You can always load golden data into redshift (or clickhouse) to support certain query patterns that the lakehouse may be less suited for. The issue with having golden data only exist in redshift is that it'll limit who can consume it. A spark job for example will not perform well when reading 100gbs of behavioral data from redshift (and the load will degrade query perf for other users)\n\nYou mentioned not doing cdc yet but definitely don't stream cdc (or anything) from your oltp into redshift",

Then at runtime, the individual vizzes would join in the relevant data, and any viz that doesn't require the joined data won't join anything.\n\nOtherwise, in my experience (and this is obviously dependent on a number of factors), creating a single pre-joined table generally yields better report performance and potentially better dev experience. If this isn't an option, then my instinct leans towards leaving it as denormalized as possible.",

I'd like to ask a little bit of clarification.\n\nACCOUNT\\_CODE and SERVICE are the two main tables (with several attributes), and they will be kept separate in any model. My two issues are:  \n\\- Where and how to store the attribute account\\_code x service (which has a 1:N relationship): 3NF, Denormalized, Bridge Table, i2b2 model...  \n\\- How to join this information for reporting (e.g. at the SQL level as a table, as a view, or at the reporting level with Tableau Custom SQL or functions)\n\nAll of the models listed have a single pre-joined table other than A.  B connects each account code to the service, but then the aggregation has to be done at the reporting level (in this case, Tableau). I'm sensing that you'd recommend D (denormalized), in which in the service table, there's a column with the grouped account codes (e.g. Service B - 1-3101, 1-3102, 1-3140) and there's a bridge table that connect these groups with the individual account codes. But I'd appreciate if you could detail a bit more.\n\nThanks again!",

Even a small end‑to‑end thing like that looks way better on a resume than “finished X course”.\n\nIf you can share the second course’s link or syllabus, people here can usually tell pretty fast if it’s just rebranding the same basics or if it actually goes deeper.",

SQLMesh seems to be a great solution to this, but it doesn't have the same market share as dbt. I tried to convince my tiny team to switch over to it and everyone was too scared. Since the company was actively trying to sell, moving such an important part of the infra to a new, more niche tool seemed unwise.\n\nIf you could figure out a dbt plugin that manages state for you and can easily tell you missing batches, that'd be pretty cool.",

It’s always going to suck but the alternative is suckier. \n\nIf you can get to a place where instead of having core logic and business rules/definitions scattered across different pieces of infrastructure in different forms to one where that is centralized (or more of it, start with the most critical data products/reports etc.), and some kind of business glossary/data catalog to capture understanding and drive consensus, you can generate the momentum to start shifting something that is very very deeply ingrained and much larger than likely yourself and team. At the very least some of these things will make it easier to maintain and stabilize the pieces you are able to wrangle and are responsible for even if the bigger effort takes more human power, resources, and/or political capital than you can drum up. Good luck and feel free to dm if you have questions/want to discuss further, in a similar boat myself",

The change feed+function+eventhub is very simple to set up as you're just copying data as-is, it is essentially the minimum amount of reads to get the data, and it spreads the reads evenly over the day. Using capture on the Event Hub means you don't need to worry about retention periods or having some parsing error on the document, you get a full binary copy of everything.\n\nedit: Also if you ever needed limited streaming options, you can have a second reader on the event hub that does stream processing, while still running the normal capture for batch processing.",

The end goal is important. \n\nThe first thing I would do is trash your lambda fetch. Even a hot-start lambda is going to be slower than a dedicated API layer running in something like ECS. Further, you need to refine your data layer to include a layer optimized for data fetches for your specific needs. Something that could be useful would be building an OLAP layer, with is (more or less) just a vectorized representation of your data for rapid dynamic aggregation. Something like the [elasticube](https://pypi.org/project/elasticube/) library. That might be too much for your specific needs, though, so wait until you add that.\n\nIn summary:\n- Get rid of the Lambda fetch in favor of a dedicated API layer that automatically handles authentication\n- Evaluate your database for an analytical layer to support data fetches (add indexes, split into dim/fact, optimize tables/partitions for the most common queries)\n- Look into OLAP cubes for better performance if query lag time is still an issue",

It helps to know that.\n\nBut: polymorphism -- methods of the same name doing different things based on context -- is a useful thing to understand.\n\nBut: the more recent innovation of Interfaces is actually useful. It's not nearly as clunky as interitance, and certainly not as clunky as multiple inheritance. And it lets us do lots of useful things.

OO is also often taught with easy-to-understand examples that don't reflect how people use inheritance in reality. Nobody is making a system where `Dog` inherits from `Animal` and has a `speak` method. And if you're making, say, booking software for a veterinary office, you probably have no need to different `Animal` subclasses.\n\nThe \"easy-to-understand\" examples lead people to think that OO programming is mainly about taxonomy - about building complex inheritance trees that model reality.

        "body": "> Nowadays, I just give LLMs my problems and it solves them immediately or gives me step by step instruction on how to solve them.\n\nOh really? How confident are you in the accuracy/validity of those \"solutions?\" Consider this gem from ChatGPT: https://i.imgur.com/yjWbf3z.png\n\nOne line of code (Bash script), it doesn't get much simpler than this. Except that, of course, `tee` doesn't actually *have* a `-q` option:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wUZpXmP.png\n\nTrying to run this command immediately shows that it doesn't work, and the suggested \"quiet\" option for `tee` is nowhere to be found (and of course, this `tee` *is* the binary from GNU coreutils, as the output from these commands show).\n\nObviously, it is a hallucination - not exactly a novel phenomenon. The real concern here is that one false fact easily yields more:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ap5dQPt.png\n\nUsing the non-working command as a base, *any* code it generates will not work. I didn't bother correcting it for a bit, eventually yielding this completely nonsensical, useless code:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AR6BDBQ.png\n\nOf course, this phantom `tee -` is just an example - what I'm pointing out here isn't about coding or Linux, but that LLMs not only can give false information, but use those to deduce further falsehoods. Left unchecked, such a process could yield a very large amount of information which seems perfectly reasonable, with justifications that seem to logically follow - but in fact it is all hallucinated.\n\nFinally, I chose this example here specifically because it was so simple. When asking more complex questions (involving multiple steps to solve a problem, accomplish a task, etc.), it becomes more likely that some link in the chain is faulty. Presented as an intact chain with each link solidly connected to the last, a weak link (if present) becomes harder to see.\n\nNow, as for how this relates to your post: for example,\n\n> Ever since I was a kid, I used to love the process of getting stuck, googling, watching half-relevant YouTube videos, reading forums, slowly piecing things together. That \"ohhh, wait, I get it now\" moment was addictive and felt \"earned\". \n\nThere is still the potential for that \"aha\" moment when using LLMs - namely, when realising that your question is not being answered correctly, or that the reason nothing it suggests allows you to proceed past some point in a process you're stuck at  is because the LLM itself is stuck, on some false assumption. The \"struggle\" is then to determine which assumption that is, explain why it is false, and from there proceed to your next question/step. In terms of your \"puzzle\" example, finding an error in the solution manual and proceeding to the (correct) solution by your own means.\n\nWhat you desire: \"feeling proud of understanding something because I worked for it\" hasn't gone away - but the path towards fulfilling that desire may be different.\n\n> This is probably what people felt when the computer or the internet was invented as well, eh?\n\nIndeed there are many things that those technologies now do for us that before we had to do ourselves. But they also bring new things that we were not able to do before. Focusing your attention and energy on the latter over the former when possible, to maintain a positive attitude and avoid stagnating. For example: \"I cannot sit with difficulty anymore\" - you can and will, because there will always be difficulty. New tools can only change how and where it is found, not eliminate it entirely.",

They are *parallel*, not *sequential* - it's either - or, not both.\n\nLast, *Fullstack Open* is a *web dev* course that will only help you if you want to venture into web dev, and if you go that road, basically everything before is the wrong direction. There, [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) or [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org) would be the appropriate starter points.\n\nNand2Tetris is a fantastic foundation course that *can* help you get a deeper understanding, but mainly will help if you want to go into *embedded* development (think SoC - System on a Chip or IoT - Internet of Things).",

Basic programming concepts, one backend language you stick with, and learning how to build small but complete projects. Even boring ones. Automation is real, but it only makes sense once you understand the underlying process you are automating.\n\nWhat I would avoid is the pressure to monetize too early. Skills compound quietly.

There are reasons for this, like the dual update problem, locking, you should know what these are and how to mitigate issues using them. This can also get into doing things asynchronously, networking, sockets, pipes, signals et. al.\n\nYou'll need to learn to use some different ones, relational - SQL, ( sqlite, postgresql, mysql/maria, oracle ) and non-relational ( mogodb, etc. ). You don't need to become a super pro on these, but knowing the basics will certainly help. You can't get away without knowing something, at least SQL at some point, or you will stop being able to do anything. I once had to tell a developer this directly to his face, he learned it and became a superstar almost overnight.\n\nHow will your tool be launched, maintained? You'll also need to know something about how to integrate your tools or apps into the overall system architecture. User launched, launched on boot, launched on application startup. So, some nuts and bolts know how of how to implement that in at least Windows and Linux will serve you well.\n\nBash isn't too bad to learn, but it's hard to master. The whole documentation isn't that much and if you at least thoroughly peruse it, you can know what bash can do and go look up specifics when you need them. Pro Tip : use getopts for argument handling and your scripts will be more powerful than anyone else's and similar to other unix commands) Powershell honestly sucks to learn but once you have some bash down, AI can write most of the Powershell these days and you can just tweak it, which is a lot easier. When you get under the hood in windows, it's a hellscape, so if you don't already know, Windows sucks, but at least it runs now, mostly.\n\nSecurity. How can your tool or app be penetrated? How do you code to stop this?\n\nPayment processing: Can you take payments for transactions or periodic payments for services?\n\nIntegration with service APIs: Can you connect to other things and call services? Stock market data for example? AI Agents? et. al.\n\nWhat happens when something in your app breaks? Does it write to a system log? Does anyone need to do anything if it does break after you are done and gone?\n\nNot a complete list but something to think about.",

Strings, especially from multiple data sources, are prone to human errors like inconsistent capitalization. Use enums and IDs, or at least invariant culture instead. [You may see a bad example code from my prior Reddit post in r/programminghorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/1qqwo6t/this_boss_fight_trigger_code_in_a_video_game/)\n\n\n* Some string generation and normalization methods like .ToLower(), .ToUpper(), and .ToString() give results according to the *user's* Current Culture info, which can be pretty much any language around the world. This can cause inconsistent decimal and date formats; and even break some texts and cause comparison fails in Turkish and Azeri locales, where the usual casing I/i does *not* apply.",

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why \"shift registers\" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!\n\nDon't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a \"perfect\" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around. \n\nBest suggestion is to start where you are, e.g. learn some Python, and work your way down, look at some assembly, then work your way up, towards more abstract programming concepts, data structures and whatnot, then back down again to another language, maybe C, and understand memory management, up again to understand garbage collecting and compilers, down again to understand addressing and registers in the CPU, and so on and on - not necessarily in this particular order, that was just a random example I made up on the spot.\n\nBut take a look at \"**Code**\", and try to write programs in your chosen higher level language that handles binary conversion, and select topics based on your current interest.\n\nAlso, if you are interested in the human history behind the computer, check out \"**The Innovators**: H*ow a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution*\" by Walter Isaacson.",

        "body": "First, domain names are like file paths, just backwards. Instead of /foo/bar/baz/folder/myfile, you have myrecord.domain.baz.bar.foo. The domain name 9gag.com is registered as living on a set of nameservers that the folks at 9gag control, and they can put as many records there with as many levels of dots as they like (up to the limits of the system, which maxes out at 255 characters for a full domain and at most 63 characters between dots).\n\nSecond, the Internet predates the Web. There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - \"www\" for \"World-Wide Web\".\n\nBut it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's \"front door\", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (\"TLD\"), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)\n\nRather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the \"www\" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the \"canonical name\" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those:\n\n    $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a\n    www.9gag.com.           300     IN      CNAME   9gag.com.\n\nWhat that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of \"www.9gag.com\", it gets an answer back saying \"use the address of 9gag.com\". So it has to turn around and look up \"9gag.com\" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",

But the folder doesn't know anything about itself. If you change what's in the folder, every function that touches it might break and you won't know until it does.\n\nA class is giving the folder a brain. It knows what's inside it, knows what you're allowed to do with it, and can refuse things that don't make sense.\n\nNow that's great and all but let's think about this from a real world problem... say you have three types of reports. With just functions you end up writing process_sales_report(), process_inventory_report(), process_hr_report(), duplicating logic every time. With a class you define what a Report is once (it has data, it can be processed, it can be exported) and each type just fills in its own specifics. You swap behavior without rewriting structure.\n\nThe honest answer to \"when do I actually need them\" is probably not for small scripts. But the moment you have two things that are similar but not identical and you're copying functions and changing variable names, that's the signal. You're doing manually what a class would do for you.\n\nI almost use classes religiously  with the pydantic library when I'm building large machine learning or agentic systems, makes life ten times easier. \n\nThis video isn't exactly on your question but I think my frame your understanding of the industry a bit better.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S3fXSc5z2n4?si=90-0Hz9Pa_xOTp99",

Functions call other functions, and the project works fine.\n\nGreat that is exactly how any program work. There is no other way actually. The difference is how you look at functions together with data. You may actually code in an OOP style without ceating any classes at all. It all depends on what functions use what data. If you pack a set of functions together with a set of data and limit other functions from this data then you're basically coding in an OOP style.\n\n> If functions get the job done, what problem are classes really solving?\n\nClasses are useful because they tie data and code together in a very visible and safe way. With a class you can create a group of data and functions that work together and you can protect the data from changes from other functions outside of the class. You can also make the data work as one unit or object and tie operators to the object making it easier to use. This may seem trivial in a small program but in a large program with hundreds of files you can isolate the use of data and you don't need to check all files for usage.\n\n> This has become a big hurdle for me because almost every take home assessment or practice project I see either requires or strongly expects the use of classes, and I just can’t seem to wrap my head around how or where they fit.\n\nThis is not difficult. Just look at the problem from a data point of view. What information is needed and belongs together. This pack of data is a class. What relations does the data have with other data. How many of each are there. What changes to the data is needed, these are the functions, or methods in OOP, that take the data as one parameter.\n\nHope this helps you on the way.",

You'll see this pattern in CLI tools, event systems, parsers, and state machines.\n\nThe only things to watch for is to make sure the functions have compatible signatures if you're calling them uniformly, and don't over-complicate simple cases where a basic `if` would be fine",

It’s often just a vector implementation rather than a hash table, but there’s no reason it couldn’t be one. Like, in win32 programming a form button or other event source will have a vector of function pointers (void*) and will loop over them and call the functions when the button is clicked. Very normal.\n\nI will say that in a wholly owned system, you won’t normally use this pattern because you know the function caller and function to be called and don’t need an extensible pattern of hooks for third party consumers. You’ll just call the functions or call abstract or interface functions implemented by a known set of child classes. At most you’ll use an IOC container to control which implementation is used through configuration. Keep your system simple unless you really are building a platform.",

Yet, that is the tricky and difficult part. \n\nSince in current times, people are hand-held all their lives they don't want to give up being hand-held and spoon-fed. They don't dare to let go and less know how to stand on their own feet.\n\nThis was very different in the old days when there were no tutorials. You learnt by experimenting, by trying, by failing. But there also was more time and less competition.\n\nNow, fast is key. Which is completely wrong. Speedrunning learning leads to nothing.\n\nWell back to the original topic:\n\nThere are good, mediocre, and outright rubbish tutorials and there are *courses* - this is an important distinction.\n\nProper *courses* are e.g. the CS50 series from Harvard, the MOOCs from the University of Helsinki, Algorithms from Princeton, and countless others. Common to all of them is that they have a proper, educational curriculum, are approved and battle tested, and never pre-chew and spoon feed solutions - they all make the *learner* do the work.\n\nNow *tutorials* on the other hand, generally pre-chew and spoon feed. They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.\n\nWorst tutorials are *\"How to build X in language Y\"* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.\n\nAbout *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.\n\nI still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program. Experiment, try things, break them, fix them, play around with the code. The more you struggle, fail, and play around, the more you learn.",

You've got the basics of these concepts from tutorials so lets try to get deeper into it. That is where you can find your next area to focus on where to improve. You could go back to tutorials for those or maybe documentation, it all depends on what it is you're struggling with.\n\nIn short, tutorials are good for getting a basic idea of something (like how to connect a database to a website), but you only really learn and retain the info it tried to teach you if you then also try to do it on your own with your own project(s).

They should be identifying a field and learn the languages and tools used in that field.\n\nIf you just learn a random language, you could be stuck in tutorial hell because once you are done learning that random language you may well find that nobody actually uses that language in the field you are interested in.\n\ne.g. you are advised to learn Pascal in response to the incorrect question because of its clarity and simplicity. Then you want to work in robotics. Sorry, go back and learn C/C++.\n\n## watching/reading but not doing\n\nA common problem I see is people complaining that they slogged through the entire series, but then can't do anything.\n\nThat is because they slogged through the series and everything that went in one ear, got pushed right out the other side.\n\nPeople need to regularly press pause on the tutorial (or bookmark the book) and try  out what they have seen. Experiment with it. Try to get it to do something else. For example, if taught how to create a loop that counts from 1 to 10, try to make it so that it goes from 10 to 1.\n\n## AI\n\nThis will be triggering for some - especially the AI propaganda bots. But AI is a double edged sword.\n\nIf used correctly, to search, consolidate or explain it can be a useful tool.\n\nBut if it is used to generate code - especially on anything more than an occasional basis then the risk is the same as my previous \"... not doing\" point.  \nBut it is more insidious. IMHO.\n\nIn another sub that I moderate, we get a lot of posts along the lines of \"I used AI to write the code for the lessons and some basic things, but now I'm trying to do my own unique thing. It doesn't work and I don't know how to fix it.\".  \nEven worse, because they have been copying and pasting the AI gibberish, they often don't have the vocabulary to clearly explain what is going on nor understand the changes proposed (unless someone rewrites it for them).\n\nThe solution? Go back to the basics, ditch the AI and actually try doing stuff yourself.\n\n---\n\nThese are just 3 common and hopefully easy to understand examples that I have observed over and over.  \nIn my career I've seen plenty of other types of mistakes but these are a bit more subtle and complicated to explain.\n\n\n---\n\nYou also asked about:\n\n> ... and still can’t build anything without hand-holding (after doing the tutorials)\n\nThis one is a bit harder and probably is an it depends scenario. Again from my experience, I've seen the following:\n\n* The person is perfectly capable to do it, but lacks personal self confidence.\n* The person is new to a project and needs help becoming assimilated with the organisation of the code and the standards used in the project.\n* Some people have learned the technology by rote without understanding how it works \"under the covers\". Example, they know that they can use a `long` or regular `int` and can't understand why sometimes both work and sometimes one might get weird negative values unexpectedly (and I'm thinking C here, but also some other languages).\n* When joining a new project, people are often on probation and part of the probation involves mentoring.\n\nThere are other possible reasons including \"they didn't do the tutorials correctly\".",

It's hard, we do it anyway. An old-school method that I stand by for learning is working without copy & paste: typing things out is good for developing a syntax instinct.\n\n\nI think there's two big categories of gaps to distinguish though: algorithmic gaps and library gaps.\n\n\nAlgorithmic gaps are gaps you have conceptually: Can you even break the problem into steps that are easier to code? This is very important to develop independently, breaking down complex problems into steps computers understand is arguably what programming *is*.\n\n\nLibrary gaps refer to not knowing specific tools that your language or libraries provide you. You mostly pick these up over time and it's not a big deal to look them up.\n\n\nFor example, if you want to convert a string to lowercase, algorithmic thinking tells you that you can iterate through the string, convert each letter (with e.g. ascii code math), and build a new string. You should conceptually be able to write that code in your head in your preferred language, even if you don't type it out. Library knowledge tells you \"in python, you can do string.lower().\"\n\n\nStackoverflow (and docs) is good for learning library knowledge. As you build more library knowledge in a language, it translates to having an easier time thinking algorithmically in that language.",

This will build familiarity, but won't build problem solving skills.\n\nOnce you have the gist of how and why some functions work, start learning the terminology. This is arguably one of the stronger skills you will need in the age of AI. Knowing exactly what to look for or how to phrase the parts you are stuck on will help immensely.\n\nProblem solving skills are the top priority skills for all programmers. The ONLY way to build this is with practice. Projects are great ways to practice breaking down big problems into tiny problems. If you need to practice tiny problems, chug away at LeetCode, HackerRank, or other platforms that can present a problem to you and give you instant feedback on if your solution is acceptable.\n\nAll projects/apps/features boild down to this line of thinking: \"how do I break this problem down into chunks that I can work with?\"\n\nI generally have a rough idea of what the end-project looks like, then I split that project into milestones, then I keep splitting each milestone into smaller parts until I find a place to start building out everything within the milestone. If your milestones are independent of one another, you can rotate which parts of the project to do if you get stuck and don't want to burn out. If one milestone depends on another, you gotta finish all of the first one before you can work on the second one.\n\nAll project structures will be different. There are countless ways to solve most problems once they are larger. Usually the \"right\" way to solve something either won't exist or won't be evident until after you have tried a bunch of different things. The goal is to get your project to a working point, and to keep tabs of any new skills learned along the way.\n\nEdit to add: you will always be looking stuff up. There is far too much technical documentation for anyone to fully memorize. If you need something done quick, look for shortcuts or similar completed projects. If you have time to learn, deliberately practice your problem solving when you get stuck instead of looking up an answer right away. Try to default to documentation pages before hopping to stack overflow or AI for an answer. Feel free to search error codes if the traceback is too complicated to parse yourself, but don't get into the habit of offloading your learning to other people or AI when you first start out",

Programming language doesn't matter.\n\nIt is more problem solving than actually writing code. My first professional programming job was in 1983. Today after I figure how or what the structure of the program should be, I sit down and just type. Most times I don't think about the code and somehow like magic, my fingers just type away. \n\nBut I will tell you this, I learned typing in high school in 1978, not because I knew I was going to use it one day, but because I was 1 guy in a classroom with 29 other girls for an hour every day. It somehow just worked out that I was going to need it and can now type words out as fast as someone can talk. \n\nLearning computer language after computer language can also be really difficult. But what amazed me is the structured process of learning another spoken language. Classes always start with \"Who, What, When, Where, Why and How\". With those 6 spoken words, learning those 6 words in another spoken language and building on those, makes learning another spoken language so much easier.\n\nI'm fluent in Spanish, and Portuguese as Portuguese is basically Spanish with some French mixed in. I can survive speaking German on the basic level and I know enough Mandarin to order in a restaurant. \n\nAll computer languages have the same basics as spoken languages. If, do, while, loop, for, next, with a majority of languages also having a switch statement or something similar. If you can get those procedures down, learning another computer language becomes so much more easier. It also makes fitting a square plug in a round hole so much more easier in a different computer language you may not be familiar with.\n\nSo, don't spend that much time concentrating on the actual computer language and concentrate on problem solving to use the language you are currently working with.\n\nAnd if anyone really wants to know, when I sleep at night I dream in C#.",

(e.g. ORMs don't always generate particularly good queries if you go looking at the query plans). In I/O bound back end services, this type of thing will almost always gain you far more performance than anything you do to application code (if problems exist, of course).

You don't have to watch all 8 hours, you just go to the middle. If the bike's still there, you can throw out te first 4 hours. So you jump to 3/4 and do the same thing. Every step you cut the possibilities in half, so you find the right point in time in a few minutes rather than having to watch all 8 hours of video. That's a binary search. \n\nAn index is just a sorted copy, which lets you do a binary search. Without it, the security tape has been cut up and rearranged randomly, so you just have to watch from the beginning and spend 4 hours (on average) to find the thief. That's like doing a table scan, which is what happens if you look up a column without it.",

You're always going to reach for the easiest possible way to start interacting with this stupidly hard subject. I definitely failed at learning to code when I was 11 because the resding materials were so dense back then. Also, theres a school of people early on in your programming journey who will tell you to always learn by doing, which you can take a little bit too seriously and think it means that you should just make spaghetti code rather than read docs. Over time I've realised those people are wrong, and the thing holding me back is my patience to read.\n\n\nHonestly I find when you read docs and books programming becomes way more fun. Once you get yourself focused on the reading, you start to find it more interesting because you're engaging so actively with the knowledge. You learnt the whole concept and really appreciate the design of libaries and admire them. Once youve read it, you gain so much understanding it leads to the feeling of being close to mastery which fuels flow state. When I try to avoid just reading, it usually leads to frustration with my work and imposter syndrome.",

My degree played no role in getting this job. \n\nIf you’re unable to get an apprenticeship, get a part time job that gives you enough money to do what you need, buy some Udemy courses (they’re dirt cheap), watch YouTube tutorials, use AI to help demistify any concepts you’re unsure of, build applications, get on LinkedIn, build a network, attend  meet-ups and then start applying…. Don’t even wait till summer to start doing this, do it now.\n\nBy the time your peers will have finished Uni, you could already be working as a junior dev, with 6 months to a year of experience under your belt and £0 student debt, which means more money in your pocket…. \n\nThat’s what I wish I had done.",

Once you have that, you literally just add a cache (memoization) and you've got a top-down DP solution. The jump from recursion to memoization is way smaller than trying to build a bottom-up table from scratch. Also, focus on the classic patterns first: fibonacci-style, 0/1 knapsack, longest common subsequence. Most DP problems on leetcode are just variations of like 5-6 core patterns.

Plus, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try us out risk-free.\nWe truly look forward to welcoming you to our platform and are committed to making your learning experience easy, interactive, and fun.\n\nOnly links I found on that link to formal policy link to terms that say all sales are final within the bounds of law. \n\nIf you go to the footer and click support/help center, then click subscription faq, the bottom faq is a link to a support post about the money back policy. \n\nIt reads:\n\n> Our goal is to help you achieve meaningful results in your learning journey, and if you are not satisfied with the results you’re getting within the first 31 days of the initial purchase, we offer a Money-Back Guarantee. You can learn more about the policy and check the eligibility criteria here.\nIf the conditions are met, you may request a refund by sending an email to info@codefinity.com or submitting a request. Please note that the Money-Back Guarantee is only valid if all criteria are satisfied. \n\nIf you click the word “here” it takes you to a policy that says: \n\n> We are convinced that our product (hereinafter referred to as the “plan” and/or “program”) will bring the user meaningful results within a chosen Subscription period. If no results will be reached by the user, he/she is eligible to receive a full refund, if all the following criteria are met: 1) the user contacts us within 31 days after the initial purchase, 2) the user has followed the recommendations from the provided personalized plan at least during 28 consecutive days within the first 31 days after the purchase, and 3) the user can demonstrate that he/she conscientiously has followed the plan (ex.: provide photos and/or video of completion of recommendations, tasks, etc.).\n\nSo their money back guarantee requires you use the platform for 28-consecutive days, following their recommendations, and document that you did what they recommended after that on day 28 (after doing what they tell you to), 29, 30, or 31 you have to email them and provide your proof of following their guidance to get a refund. \n\nIf you get sick, your kid has a soccer game, life happens any time during the 28 consecutive days and you miss a day? Your SoL. If your documentation doesn’t pass there test? Well you’re not getting a refund. \n\nAbsolutely horrible policy from a company I will never do business with.",

Don’t be afraid to look things up online if allowed. I’d expect you to use the Python docs \n\nYou’ll be sharing your screen so make sure you don’t have anything inappropriate open / nsfw desktop wallpaper etc\n\nIf you’re given a coding task mock out what you plan to do in pseudo code first.  Throw some empty functions in etc.  just do what you need to outline the problem and what you’re going to build so it’s clear to you\n\nIf they give you a task which has multiple parts get one working then the next. Don’t try do everything all at once.  I’d rather see a candidate get 2/3 problems solved and miss one than have 80% of all 3 and nothing working. \n\nSay to yourself make it work then make it better.  And say to them that’s what you’re doing. \n\nIf you have a short amount of time prioritise what you have to do and talk about the stuff you would do.  Like you won’t have time to write perfect error handling or unit tests but say where you would add them and why.  \n\nThe biggest thing to remember. Interviewers usually aren’t assholes.

There's always new problems and challenges to be faced and new things to learn that you haven't quite faced before, every time you think, jeez that was tough, I might just be a programmer now, there's always a new mountain to climb which would make you feel like you're starting all over again.\n\nI think it's just important to stay humble and realise that it's not really about reaching a destination where things click and you're now finally a programmer with nothing more to learn, there's always another lesson to be learned, things you can do better, and don't get into the mindset that you're now done learning, because you've learned xyz will make you believe you're more capable than you actually are, I remember reaching many important milestones, thinking I was now great, only to realise there was still things I was struggling at and creating real projects was showing me that. \n\nWhat feels really satisfying is achieving deep knowledge in one specific area, where you feel like, almost no matter what challenge or assignment were shot at you, you'd be comfortable you could solve it in a reasonable timeframe, without having to learn more frameworks or new concepts or doing tons of research and exercises. Realistically you're only going to reach this at maybe one or two niches, and that's extremely satisfying, but I guess my point here is that, stop trying to aim for some 'now it clicks', because it won't, there's always new things to learn.",

The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.\n\nThere's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow \"cannot\" happen, so it can correctly optimize the \"obviously\" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.\n\nThus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.\n\nFurther, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.\n\nUB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.\n\nA lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB. These engineers would NEVER get a job working on critical systems, where that attitude is going to get a people killed, cause billions in damages, or cause unrecoverable losses.\n\nI hear the attitude - \"We're not saving lives, here...\" Yeah? You wanna diminish your company and it's product more? Do that in front of the CEO. You might not be saving lives with every product, but to be dismissive is also putting the revenue streams and the reputation of the company at risk. No one wants to hear it. It's as serious as it can be everywhere you go - and anyone who isn't serious about it is a toxic person you shouldn't be working with.",

Emphasis on \"balance\" because overdoing it makes it harder to read.\n\nAs for testability, I look for functionality that would be suitable to unit test separately. Functions with side-effects like writing to a database or calling an API are good candidates. It's easier to test when there is a clear boundary between the implementation details of side-effecting classes and business logic. It can also be a good idea to limit leakage of implementation details such models (errors, responses etc) of your internal dependencies.\n\nOn a final note, when planning and writing code it's good to think about future extensions of that code. Writing complicated abstractions to support future possible functionality is usually a bad idea, but just thinking about how a current solution would hold up in the future can be helpful. Sometimes it can help you design a simple solution that is also future proof, and other times it just gives you a better understanding of what extensions are easy or difficult to make (would you want them).",

Having a clean divide between IO code vs business logic and keeping mutation to a minimum are two good ways of helping you do this.\n\nThe OOP paradigm is usually more useful when it's important you maintain certain 'invariants' around data: things like 'my data structure must always respect this property, no matter how it's modified' or 'all interactions with this particular 3rd party API must include these magic headers'. If you have a lot of these fiddly rules to manage, it can often be convenient to create a class that wraps around your data and presents a cleaner interface to the outside world.\n\nBut I think this sort of need is rare in data-slicing or 'pipeline' style programs.\n\nNote that this sort of decision-making has nothing to do if you're writing a script or not. I've written short 100-line scripts that ended up making heavy use of OOP, and longer 5k-10k LOC production-ready services that used it very sparingly. My ultimate goal is to make the code as obviously correct as possible (which in turn makes it both easy to understand and modify). Sometimes objects can help with this, other times they won't.\n\nThat is, OOP is not the same thing as 'clean code'. OOP is a _technique_ that can _help_ you write clean code -- but (a) it's not the only technique for doing so and (b) it's not a technique that'll be applicable 100% of the time.\n\nw.r.t. SWE best practices, I would look into:\n\n1. Writing tests and perhaps even a CI/CD pipeline for your scripts, starting with the more business critical / frequently run and modified ones. If people are actively making business decisions based on some of your analysis, you'd want reasonable confidence it indeeds behaves as expected. \n2. Creating and popularizing a helper library that streamlines common operations. The goal here is to speed up the time it takes to author a new pipeline.\n\nI don't know anything about your company, but I'd imagine both correctness and speed-of-delivery are two factors that matter most to your team and your bosses. So, I'd prioritize applying practices that directly help with both.",

You will probably get more targeted answers in data engineering or data science subreddits.\n\nFor starters, I would try using something that can translate between notebooks and .py files like jupytext. Would make source control and other checks a lot easier.\n\nBased on what you have said, traditional unit tests are often difficult to apply here and tend to provide less value in data workflows than people expect. I would focus more on testing the output instead. Things like row counts, nulls, ranges, schema changes, distribution shifts, and data freshness usually catch issues much earlier.\n\nA lot of the unit test advice you are getting is common in app and web development, where the failure modes are different. In data, things usually break because the shape or semantics of the data change, not because someone touched the code.\n\nAs far as OOP is concerned, you are less likely to run into it in many data jobs. It becomes important when dealing with graphs or hierarchies. Otherwise it is mostly useful for providing structure.\n\nGenerally, anywhere you are passing a lot of variables to a function or manipulating large dicts, you will probably want to turn those into a dataclass. For external boundaries like configs, inputs, or outputs, use pydantic. Use type hints everywhere, and use a linter and code formatter as well. I'd recommend ruff as a sufficient linter and formatter.\n\nI would also recommend arjancodes on YouTube. He has a lot of good content on Python design.",

But lately I’ve had a lot more success waiting until the last possible moment to start using it. Like when my program is basically working, but I’m getting tired of passing around long lists of parameters, or a function seems to be tightly coupled to particular set of data. Only then will I introduce objects, and if my code suddenly feels cleaner and easier, then I know it is helping and not hurting my codebase. And usually I only end up needing a few objects here and there. \n\nAnyway, I think it’s still worth practicing OOP, but don’t feel obligated to use it everywhere. There are lots of other ways to organize your code. It is good to experiment and get familiar with as many as you can, to learn when one approach is better than another.",

Oop just means to group together data as objects with functions for those objects (originally without state, but today state is the center of oop -> state is probably the biggest cause of bugs, given that you test your code)\n\nDeclarative programming is functional programming, reactive programming or logic programming. All similar, but for fp: you describe a function with other functions, to do that, you write functions that create functions and take functions as parameters, there is no state and a function only does one thing with one parameter… for example in procedural programming adding 2 numbers is done with a function like this:  \nadd = (a,b) => a+b  \nFunctional programming is a bit different, you have a function returning a function:  \nadd = a => b => a+b  \nSo, looks a bit unnecessary at first, but you can use functions to build functions… you can do: inc = add (1), while procedural would need a inc (a) => a+1.  \nIncreasing the items in a list is also easy: newList = oldList.map(add(1)), in procedural, you would loop over the list, getting every item, adding 1 and then pushing it in a new list. And oop would have a class inheriting from list, then have some build method that then changes the internal state to transform itself. (Yeah, there is a reason people mix paradigms)\n\nThere are also other paradigms, like concurrent programming (lots of data and shared resources), constraint programming, dataflow programming (aka forced recalculation hell), metaprogramming (manipulating code, instead of data… extremely powerful, easy to fuck up, hell to debug and only really useful, if you know exactly what you are doing) and there is also pipeline programming -> build pipelines…\n\nAnd a few others… but yeah, can recommend functional programming within oop, so constants instead of state and single param functions, as well as higher order functions",

Self-teaching + building a mental model _does_ indeed require non-trivial mental effort.\n\nOne tip: When I need to read through particularly gnarly code, I like to keep notes in a separate text file or doc.\n\nI typically structure this in a 'question -> answer' kind of way, where I create a separate section for each open question or \"line of investigation\" I have. Maybe I'll also create a separate section for quick links, TODOs, snippets of cli commands to run, etc.\n\nI find having this sort of structure makes it much easier for me to stay focused, especially in cases where I feel too overwhelmed trying to mentally remember and keep track of everything.\n\n> I wonder if that is something that gets better after some time.\n\nIt will -- as you get more familiar with the code, you'll have to spend less and less time digging, simply by virtue of you already being familiar with more aspects of the codebase.\n\nEven longer term, it'll get easier once you've worked on enough systems to start seeing similarities and echos. For example, if you've spend a fair amount of time working with backend and cloud infra, new codebases in the same domain will start feeling vaguely similar. There are only so many ways of reasonably structuring code after all.\n\nI'll take time for both types of familiarity/experience to grow though: it's totally expected/normal to feel a bit lost as an intern or new hire.\n\n> This is my first in person internship, so I don't know if it is normal to just stand up and walk for 5 minutes. That is what I used to do in remote internships.\n\nThis is also normal. I've been programming professionally nearly a decade or so, and I also take short breaks once every hour or two. A quick stretch break, refilling my water, etc.\n\nIf I'm feeling particularly stumped/annoyed, I'll often go on a longer 15-20m walk break, maybe step outside to grab some fresh air...\n\nEvery now and then, I figure out how to \"enter the zone\" and manage to stay focused for hours and hours, though this usually happens when I'm writing code as opposed to debugging + investigating. I consider myself lucky when this happens: I haven't yet figured out how to reliably enter flow for the latter.",

For example, Blockly with javascript is probably as simple as it gets for learning the basics. A big step up, Pascal is a strongly typed compiled language that was originally developed as a learning language and is available with a visual designer known as Lazarus open source IDE for writing desk top apps.",

For example, [\"Conventional Commits\"](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.\n\nAs far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one \"right\" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.\n\nIf you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.\n\nFor instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. \n\nThe first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (\"perf\") in the scheduler (\"sched\") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.\n\nAgain, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.\n\n----\n\nNote also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change. If the commit included other bug fixes at the same time, it would be a lot harder to write a good description.\n\nYou might think that carefully breaking up your changes into multiple commits is just creating more work, but if you do it properly, it can make things easier for you in the long run.",

Then again everyone has their own style— but definitely do not do `git add .` — source control is your friend, it’s one of the icons on the left hand side of VS code that looks like a merge request icon IIRC. Commit a message for each file, and make it a habit to commit frequently until you get a feel for appropriate checkpoints.\n\nEdit: `git add .` is fine for initial project template / codebase, or overall changes — just don’t work on something for several hours and then be lazy / cut corners with it. Proper documenting of ongoing and frequent changes is essential if your goal is to eventually work with a team at any level from small to enterprise. Some teams have a specific recommended standard for commit verbosity and frequency as well!\n\nEdit edit: If your mind is searching for a statement for a commit and can’t find it— you can describe what you did to any LLM and it should be able to help you. \n\nEg; “I added a variable that is part of my useState into the array at the end of a useEffect” becomes “Added a dependency to useEffect hook that refreshes the state of the page should that dependency change” — these are equally concise but one is more *technically accurate*.",

Anyway, I'd avoid picking random problems directly from leetcode.com itself.\n* Work on problems one at a time, give them a fair shot, but don't waste inordinate amounts of time being stuck.\n  * Force yourself to think and use the tools you can recall. If you can't solve a problem in a reasonable time because you're simply missing the tools needed to solve it, then just look up and study well-written, non-code-golfed solutions, understand the key pieces, and move on. And plan to revisit those problems later on (put them at the back of your problem queue). Over time your recall of the problem -> solution mappings will strengthen.\n* Always be putting your solution (and test cases) in its own file that you can _run_ on your machine.\n  * e.g. `node leetcode1-twosum.js`.  You can also use a debugger, e.g. `node --inspect-brk leetcode1-twosum.js` when you run into problems.\n* Try not to see DSA as an isolated thing.\n  * The main thing it boils down to is picking the right data structure(s) that suit the problem and help you meet the requirements, whatever they are.\n  * A hard part is these problems can feel contrived and disconnected, which may be true, or may be an illusion - it depends. There's no one way to feel about it.  I'm still deeply affected by having learned the \"text justification\" DP problem, and nobody can take from me.\n  * Try to come to your own conclusions about the need/value of studying DSA problems based on the kinds of companies you're interested in. Feeling bad about this interview style is a common feeling, but not necessarily a useful feeling, depending on what you're after.\n* Timebox your DSA study so that you can make time for other things\n  * Mostly to make sure you're spending time working on actual projects, so you're slowly getting exposure there.\n  * Personal projects can give you freedom to try things that may be difficult to justify trying at work, and which can have very high learning/growth value.\n  * Some experience solving DSA problems can benefit your implementations a bit, but won't help you learn how to design systems. So they can be complementary.\n\n\nFor advice moving from a service-oriented to a product company...\n\n* if your current job has lots of greenfield projects with a short lifecycle, take advantage of that as a catalyst for growth, and as freedom to try slightly different approaches  and to learn from past mistakes in code design.\n  * Once you move to a product company, that can be less common. It can still happen, e.g. starting new products, or somewhat isolated subprojects or tools, etc. that serve the overall product in whatever way. But a lot of your time will be spent on things you may not be able to change easily.\n* Don't overly aggrandize product companies and don't belittle yourself and the time you're spending right now.\n  * Have a mentality that your time right now is preparation for what's to come.\n* In your current job, try to be curious and thinking about your own growth.\n  * If you have some decision-making power over which technologies or approaches are used, try to carve out a little space for yourself to grow, whatever that means. Try to keep it low-risk (don't put projects at risk due to making wild choices, but try to take whatever liberties you can that help you move in the direction of writing better code and making better overall system design choices that meet the requirements of the project).\n  * If you don't have that power yet, then try to keep growing your skills and becoming so good that companies feel compelled to put you in that position and let you take the lead on things.\n* Prep for interviews, but don't wait too long to jump into the fray.\n  * Usually interviews don't give good (or any) direct feedback, but ideally you have a rough sense of what you did well or not so well, and figure out what to work on. Dwelling on the asymmetry of the interview process won't help you, it is what it is.\n* Don't be too surprised when interviews don't go well\n  * Just move right along to the next one, and don't get discouraged by the process.\n  * Try to glean whatever you can, and cross-reference how you did with how others do, e.g. watch videos of mock interviews if useful.  See what they do well and think about what you didn't do as well.\n* Ask your interviewers directly what you can do better!!!\n  * Don't leave this up to HR to do (they won't).\n  * Your fellow programmers _might_ be willing to say _something_ when asked directly at the very end. Don't be surprised if some cop out of this, but not all will. Either way, it's better than not asking and then getting absolutely 0 on the tail end.\n* Make sure to express interest in the company and product/problem domain.\n  * When the interview ends with Q&A, be sure to have at least a couple questions about the team and/or company!! It can tip the scales in your favor a bit.\n* Don't automatically assume rejections are because you're bad.\n  * Sometimes the company just has to pick between multiple people, and you may have been good but not _as_ good as somebody else. Well, what happens if that person gets hit by a bus, or quits, or whatever. Leave things on as good of a note as you can, you never know when a connection reaches out again, and luck may have it that you're still looking when they do.",

This means that the field `elements` would normally not be declared by its full implementation type `ArrayList`, but by the *interface* `List`, so the initialization becomes `private List<String> elements;`.\n\nThis allows for more flexibility as it is easy to swap the actual *implementation type* when needed.\n\nSame thing for the return values.

It is like human DNA which contains old codes not useful any more. But this is done for a reason: to keep the full ecosystem compatible. And this ecosystem is what makes C++ outstanding still in 2026. Just check language popularity indexes (like Tiobe, PYPL, Redmonk); stack overflow developer survey results; Google trends etc. – both C and C++ are still widely used and within the top 5 languages (together with Python, JavaScript and Java).\n\nTL;DR: the best language to learn DSA is what you are the most familiar with.\n\n",

You then create your components in separate jsx files (which is like a mix of Javascript and HTML), then add those components to your App.jsx component. Should be easy enough. \n\nOf course it depends how far along you are now. If you're most of the way through your project, refactoring it to some framework may be more effort than it's worth.",

Here's the practical breakdown:\n\n  \nIf you want to stay close to hardware (embedded systems, robotics, IoT, firmware) - start with C. It maps directly to how you already think about registers, memory, and hardware. Arduino uses C++ technically, but in a very C-like way. The embedded industry still runs on C and will for decades. Companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and automotive firms want C + understanding of hardware, which is exactly your combo.\n\n  \nIf you want to pivot toward software engineering at a tech company - C++ is the better resume play. It's used heavily in game engines, high-frequency trading, operating systems, and performance-critical applications. But honestly? For most software engineering roles at tech companies, Python (which you already know) plus a web language would get you further than either C or C++.\n\n  \nThe real answer nobody's telling you: your EE degree + programming is a rare and valuable combination. Don't think of it as \"learning to code from scratch.\" Companies building physical products with software components (robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, consumer electronics) specifically seek people who understand both sides. That's a much less crowded job market than pure software dev.\n\n  \nStart with C on Arduino since you're excited about it. Motivation beats optimization every time when you're learning. You can always add C++ later - it's literally a superset of C, so nothing is wasted.",

Find all the valid prefixes from the string before you check if the prefixes are valid. That way you don’t have to loop through the string every time you check a prefix. You only have to loop through it once.\n\nIf string is “abc” then all valid prefixes are (“a”, “ab”). Then you loop through the prefixes list checking to see if the string is in the set. Checking the set is O(1) so it’s fast and looping through the potential prefixes list is o(n). Then you just append the valid prefixes to a results list and return it.",

Assuming that this is Java, don't concatenate a lot of small strings. Strings are immutable in Java, so you are creating a copy every time you do `string0 += string1`. Use a `StringBuilder` instead.\n5. Don't write comments like \"this loop iterates over indices of `strings`\", it is useless, you can get that information by looking at the code itself. But you can explain why you start at 1, not 0.\n6. In the else branch, you set `smallestLenght` to `zwischenergebniss.length()`, which will cause the loop to break, because `zwischenergebniss` has length of `i + 1` at that point. Insert `break` there to make it explicit and remove the `zwischenergebniss = \"\"`, because it is reset on the next iteration a second time.\n7. `zwischenergebniss` can be removed and replaced by `result`.\n8.

And there will often be such collisions. It's perfectly valid to have a hashCode that always returns a constant - this will just make your hash tables inefficient. \n\nIf you want to use it for equality testing, this would only cover the negative case (unequal). But when both hash codes are equal you still need to properly compare the objects.\n\nAnd calculating hash codes is not trivial. A proper implementation will calculate the hash code over all fields, just like equals would compare all fields.\n\nHash codes are used for hash tables to quickly find an index into an array.\n\nYou can also use hashes that are unlikely to have collisions. This is often done for file-integrity. Here the hash is stored, so it doesn't need to be recomputed every time (one of the 2 hashes at least). And file I/O is also slower, making this more useful. Collision-resistant hashes are very useful, but still not cheap to calculate (not cheaper than testing equality), and hashCode* is definitely not collision-resistant.\n\n(* I'm assuming you're using Java?)",

        "body": "I don’t know about Dart, but in many languages it’s possible (or sometimes required) to override an object’s hash code function, so (contrary to some comments here) it’s important to understand how they work.\n\nNo, hash collisions are possible. They’re even quite likely if a developer has written a bad hashing function on their object. Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.\n\nComparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.\n\nComparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.\n\nComparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.\n\nIf you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:\n\n1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. \n\n2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. \n\n3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. \n\nHash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.\n\nOf course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.\n\nHopefully this helps. If you have any further questions about this I’d be happy to answer them.",

Focus on making very small games like a simple platformer or a top down shooter. Finishing tiny projects teaches more than watching endless tutorials. Learn by doing. Build something small break it fix it repeat. Do not worry about graphics or perfection. As a programmer your goal is to understand how game logic works like movement collisions input and simple AI.

Money isn’t an issue either, so that’s the two main things that should cause you that much stress out of the way!\n\nI’m a beginner in this field myself, and it’s an overwhelming ocean of knowledge - I constantly see acronyms that I have no idea what they mean, kinds of protocols or algorithms or terms that have no meaning to me. If I came at this with the attitude that everyone knows this and I don’t and that’s why I can’t get a job, by that logic I would never be able to get a job, and I’d freak out. But it’s ok. The thing I just said about everyone knowing it already isn’t true. \n\nYou will get this - you only need to understand that this is not something you can just master in a matter of weeks. It will likely be years, especially if you work full time like I do too. But to get to a level where you are competent enough to have a few noteworthy projects and seem employable? Not so long. \n\nWhenever you learn any new skill, all the knowledge you pick up is fragmented at first. This field has millions of fragments so it’s very daunting. But you will find one fragment that starts to glue others together. And the panic you feel will subside. Trust me.",

This is due to the word 'literally' being 'literally' abused for what appears to be at least hundreds of literal (or \"literary\") years of prose. Personally I think it's just a funny in-joke that keeps getting re-invented from generation to generation (e.g. you literally took that too literally).\n\nSo, fellow thread-posters here suggesting therapy, methinks you dudes/dudettes are being way too literal.",

This is our thing that separates us from salesman who are used to failure on 90% of the cold calls they do.\n\nAnd this mindset can actually be trained, by solving enough simple to gradually more difficult problems that you become used to success.\n\n> whenever I exit the comfort zone by closing the tutorial video\n\nThe tutorial zone is no comfort zone, it's a non-programming zone. The comfort zone should be problems you know how to solve without external information. Ultimately all of programming is applying techniques you've used before to new problems.

For example \"hello\" as the first number is invalid.\n* As others mentioned, handle division by zero.\n* Consider making the program keep working after doing an operation, instead of always closing. For example, ask the user if they want to do another operation, or quit. Then, if they want to do another operation, trigger the same logic again (this requires knowing loops, so only if you are there yet or want the challenge).",

Some \"official\" solutions are not optimal even with the learnt skills up to that point.\n\nYou have to understand that in programming nothing is chiseled in stone. There usually are several paths that lead to the goal. Some are more efficient than others, some are better readable/maintainable than others, and some are good middle-grounds between efficiency and readability/maintainability - that's the ones a programmer should strive for. If your solution is super intelligent and efficient but you are the only one who understands it, it is useless in production, but may be nice for competitions, if your solution is super slow but extremely readable, you're on the other end of the scale and should work on your speed.\n\nIt's all a matter of experience.

It's this reason I enrolled in a CS course at the local community college after having taken CS50x/p/w/g, completed most of boot.dev, and read a little more than half a dozen textbooks on Python, C++, HTML-CSS-JS, Design Patterns, and DS&A. Nothing beats listening, seeing, discussing, doing, and being critiqued all in a 2 hour block.\n\nHumans are social animals, and you're human.

Being well-rounded makes is a good skill for connecting with people too.\n\nPlus being able to create art you want, even if only as a hobby, is just a good skill. I do programming, a little bit of traditional arts, and digital arts as hobbies and the intersection of them is damn fun. I enjoy being able to draw/create whatever workflow. I quite enjoy employing common algorithms in interesting ways \\[re: not LLM/AI stuff as that wasn't around!\\]; I get to pursue a much wider variety of workflows/techniques since I can draw on a wider skillset.\n\nLearning how to paint, the mixtures, pigments, etc \\[I got quite into paint this last year\\] has really taught me the details of finishing, coating, and protecting anything I may make - from furniture to housing. And a quick coat of paint can make a used, cheap piece look brand new!\n\nPlus I find learning both digital and traditional art reinforces the core skills one needs to make good art overall. Composition, colors, lighting, texture, detail density, etc - all necessary to practice regardless of the medium.\n\nWhat's the point of being a programmer if you don't also get a bit of time to pursue other topics that you enjoy? I think it's worthwhile to read history, but I can tell you it will not be getting me raises anytime soon!\n\nLastly, when you learn things, it may open doors you previously would not have been aware of. The twists of life might open a door or two that would've been hidden otherwise.\n\nFinally, the AI stuff concerning \\*making\\* art is such a strong debate I think all the noise around it always misses the forest for the big tree. Thinking on it, however, one faces the same core issues with generative tools as you did with old school algorithmic/digital art!\n\nSay my 200x200 random pixel generator is able to theoretically produce any piece of art ever. (any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \\*seems\\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. \"This is random noise\".\n\nIMO, to make impactful art, you've\n\n\\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience.  \n\\- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important.  \n\\- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.\n\nThe first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)\n\nMuch like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed \"paint by numbers\" kits and never challenged yourself further.\n\n\\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha! But I've no need for productivity either, not working in a professional context.\\]",

I have about 25 years experience and there are definitely still days where I hit a problem and I just go \"This is chaos.\" But if someone were to ask me to define thinking like a programmer, I think the most defining skills are \n\n1. Being able to look at a small problem and imagine how you could represent it on a Von Neumann machine (read-writeable memory, processor, code, instructions run in sequence).\n2. Being able to take a problem too big for (1), break off a piece of it (without completely losing the original problem), and treat that problem in isolation. Over and over again, until you get a piece small enough to apply (1).\n\nEvery problem solved with computers is, at some fundamental level, solved that way.

        "body": "Everything is normal - a lot of people like to confuse things further by talking about passing by reference or value or copying, etc. This usually only confuses things further.\n\nLet me try to show an example - first with an integer (code isn't Dart or anything in particular, mostly pseudocode):\n\n    int v1 = 5;             // first we declare a variable 'v1' with a value of '5'\n    \n    myFunc(v1);             // then we send that variable as an argument to the function\n    \n    def myFunc( v2 ) {      // in the function, the variable 'v2' is now also set to the value '5'\n      print( v2 )           // as we can see if we print it\n      v2 = 4;               // but then we change 'v2' to '4'\n    \n                            // 'v1' was never changed\n    }\n\nThen if we use lists - the result is actually exactly the same:\n\n    list l1 = ['c','a','t'];  // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't'\n    \n    myListFunc( l1 );         // then we send that list as an argument to the function\n    \n    def myListFunc( l2 ) {    // in that function, the variable 'l2' is now set to the same list\n                              // of 'c','a','t'\n       print( l2 );           // as we can see if we print it\n       l2 = ['d','o','g'];    // but when we change 'l2' to another list of 'd','o','g'\n    \n                              // the original 'l1' was never changed\n    }\n\nSome people like to argue that 'v2' becomes a copy of 'v1' but 'l2' becomes a reference to 'l1' - this isn't entirely correct, and in my opinion only muddies the water. The important thing is that when you set a variable = some other value, it doesn't matter where it originally got its value from, it is gone. And setting v2 = v1 doesn't \"link\" v2 and v1 in any way, it just makes them have the same value.\n\nNow for the tricky part!\n\nA value like 4 and 5 cannot be changed, setting v1 to 5 and then setting v2 to v1 and v2 to 4, does not change neither 4 nor 5, it only changes the variables v1 and v2.\n\nBut a *value* like a list, **can be changed**, you can replace individual items, add or remove them - it is still the same list. You cannot replace or remove anything in the number 5.\n\nSo this code does change the inside of l1:\n\n    list l1 = ['c','a','t'];  // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't'\n    \n    myOtherListFunc( l1 );    // then we send that list as an argument to the new function\n    \n    def myOtherListFun( l2 ) { // and receive the same list as variable 'l2'\n      l2.add('s');             // and we modify the inside of the list!\n            \n                               // this has also changed the list for 'l1' because it is the same list\n    }\n\nThere's nothing magic about it - note that we don't write `l2 = ['c','a','t','s']` because that would change l2 to be another list, just like v2 was changed to be another number.\n\nIf we could write `v2.increment()` or something like that, we would be able to change v1 through v2, but as that is usually not the case in most languages, programmers like to say that numbers are copied and lists are referenced - although it rarely is like that.",

So if you want to be an expert, you need to pick a field and master it. You can still have a good understanding of surrounding domains and basic knowledge of things further afield, but you need to focus on specific areas to become an expert.\n\nFor example, lets say you want to become an expert in large data stores for corporations. That means being an expert in databases, accesses methods, scaling and many more things. But it is also useful to understand access methodologies such as Enterprise servers and how they operate. This can contribute to making decisions like performing processing in database (using complex SQL, procedures or maybe even UDFs) or do that processing in the server but requiring multiple fetches to the database. On the other hand, it is still useful, but far less so, to understand the front end technologies and their supporting services.\n\nSo, what I am saying is pick something (or a small number of related things) and learn them well, but also identify the main things that surround them and be well aware of them. Then identify the next layer of things and be aware of them, but no need to know them as well as the things immediately surrounding your area(s) of focus.\n\nIMHO.",

I understood memory management very well at a conceptual level - specifically the heap and the stack. But I had never really had to delve deeply into actual memory allocations - I had once written an exception capture mechanism (i.e. I had to roll my own try/catch/throw mechanism for our C application) which required understanding the stack and call frames very well, but we hardly ever used dynamic memory allocation (i.e. the heap), so I never really needed to diagnose it.\n\nBut, this failing application did and I had to learn the specifics of how the C runtime managed the heap.\n\nSo, looping back, I learned the basics of C and the facilities like malloc (so breadth-first), but as I learned them I also delved under the surface. Then when I needed to I drilled down to whatever depth was needed for situations arising.\n\nHopefully that makes sense.",

The best part about Linux is that you have control over everything, which is also the most dangerous part about Linux lol\n\n\nSo you have this environment that lets you do anything, what do YOU want out of it? Do you want to browse the internet? OK, download Firefox. You google how to do that, and you learn that you have to type out ``` sudo dnf firefox```\n\nDo you know what that command means? If you don't you've just been given a guide on what to learn next. You research a bit and learn about privileges and using the sudo command. You research a bit more and you learn that dnf is your package manager and why it makes your life easier.\n\n\nNow tomorrow you decide you want to talk to friends on Discord, you already probably can guess how to do it, but just in case you can google how to download the Linux version. You arent surprised by the command they give, because you already learned what package manager youre using and what that entire command does. At first this simple process took a few steps and research, but now you know enough to do it quickly and confidently. \n\n\nThis snowballing approach is how you learn Linux, you dont watch a 10 hour youtube video or take a class. You think \"it wish my computer did X\" then you research how to do X. It's like carving a statue in marble, you sand away the bits that annoy you or dont work until you've gotten down to what you want. \n\n\nAnytime you think \"thats annoying\", figure out how to stop it. Ever have something in your terminal spin forever or crash? Thats annoying, and many beginners just close the terminal and start over. That works... buts its kind of annoying. That should be an itch you scratch, and of you look around you'll discover that you can kill that process by hitting ctrl+c. Ever try to paste something in the terminal and it doesnt work? Thats annoying, if you research a bit you'll learn why it does that though. You'll also learn that you can paste directly into the terminal by using Shift+ctrl+v instead. \n\n\nDon't \"learn\" Linux. It's your computer, USE Linux, and if it seems like there should be a better way of doing something, find out what that better way is. Everyday you'll find something that pisses you off, which is great because that means you are being given something to learn on a silver platter.",

I have worked with experienced DevOps who did not know how to configure NGINX, because for load balancers there is AWS ELB.\n\nPrioritize cloud platforms like AWS over Linux.\n\nFor habits, I would stick with CLI tools when possible instead of using GUI for everything. For instance, use git in the terminal. It will help when configuring CI/CD pipelines.\n\nBy the way, I am a software engineer. Still I think my points are valid. Cheers.",

You don't have to go too crazy there. Answering easy and medium questions and understanding Big O is enough for most. \n\nThen focus on SQL. Being good with data and databases and knowing how to avoid things like N+1 queries is critical for production work. \n\nBut, like I said, be patient. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you have to know all of this before you can build something real. Continuing to build projects *while you're learning* is the single most important thing to do. All the best coders I know started building projects before they were ready. \n\nGood luck!",

Like Grandpa levels of old.  It's still used, and thus, still current to some.  But R has effectively replaced it.  I'd take a R programmer over an SPSS programmer any day.\n\nR is also on its way out.  It has a number of competing replacements.  Apache Spark is one of the more popular replacements.  Apache Spark (or often just \"spark\") is available for the programming languages \"scala\", \"java\", and \"python\".  Python is the most popular recently.  Java has better \"error checking\" and execution performance, and Scala is the language where Spark truly shines, but is a bit more work to learn.\n\nConsidering current market trends, I'd recommend using Spark with Python, as that seems to be popular, even if it is not as nice as some options that might be better (from a strictly computer science point of view).",

Your final sentence alone says that you aren't learning programming because you want to make games, you are learning it because you want the game developer job and if it isn't handed to you quickly, you will quit.\n\nYou haven't even learned the fundamentals of programming yet, nor have you really delved into what game development actually is. This raises my hackles and plants a giant red flag for me with you.\n\nGame Developer jobs are unstable and pretty overpopulated with individuals fighting for those positions. It is also the top underpaid and underappreciated markets for developers to be in. People get laid off all of the time because a game got cancelled, the company was absorbed by another company or the game is complete and they have no more work for you.\n\nI'm going to be real with you, I don't think you are cut out for game development based off your post and I don't think you are cut out to be a developer based off your post either. \n\nThe reason for this is because you will need to practice and study for a minimum of 4 years, plus have a BA degree to even be considered for entry level jobs in the field. I don't think you have the dedication for delayed gratification from how you worded the post.",

You can follow code, but generating it from scratch uses a completely different part of your brain.\n\nHere's what actually helped me bridge that gap:\n\n1. After you finish a tutorial, close it. Wait a day. Then try to rebuild the same thing from scratch without looking. You'll fail the first time - that's the point. The struggle is where learning happens. Check only when you're truly stuck, then close it again and keep going.\n\n2. Don't try to write a full training loop from memory. Start with just the data loading. Then just the model architecture. Then just the loss calculation. Build up the muscle memory piece by piece.\n\n3. Once you're comfortable with basics, try implementing a simple paper (like the original ResNet or a basic transformer) using only the paper and PyTorch docs. No tutorials, no GitHub repos. This forces you to translate math - code yourself, which is exactly the skill you're trying to build.\n\nThe LLM dependency isn't bad for learning concepts, but if you want to actually *think* in code, you need to struggle without it sometimes. Treat it like training wheels - useful, but you gotta take them off eventually.",

Leadership not seeing the ROI from AI\n\n2. Leadership pushing to still meet the promises that were made under the assumption that AI would deliver double digit improvements with less headcount\n\n3. No one will meet those promises over the period of a couple of quarters or years - depending on how much they overpromised \n\n4. A bunch of leaders will get kicked to the curb.

They really have no idea how to adapt to different and smaller companies. I worked at company that hired a bunch of former telecom folks and built up such a bureaucracy of middle managers that I was attending 2 hours of meetings a day just to provide status updates to 4 different middle managers. They only reason they did that is because they was just what they were used to, not because the depth and breadth of our org was doing needed it.

Sometimes a couple of side projects teach you more than one big role, with less risk.

Even if they're not part of your specialty, you can start to get familiar with them to help out more in the future. Look through the code for any TODOs.\n2. Scan the code for vulnerabilities. Depending on your stack, there are several tools out there to use. Even if you dont have access to any tools, you can double check no vulnerabilities are associated with any dependency versions on your project.\n3. Upgrade project dependencies. This one can be tricky and requires a lot of regression testing.\n4. Update, create, and improve junit test cases and test case coverage. Create/improve mock services\n5. Improve CI/CD. Add quality of life features\n6. \\^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.\n7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues. Though there better solutions.\n8. Study anything related to your job. Learn what you need to in order to eventually help your teammates with their load. Learn more about intricacies of the languages used in your stack. Research tools and libraries that may help your project.  Sometimes you can be the one to introduce new technology to the stack that improves something you already have or completely replaces it for some benefit or another.\n9. Update project documentation. You could also create guides for any new people that may join the team in the future\n10. Innovate. Maybe you can figure out a good way to leverage AI in your project. Don't immediately jump to an LLM. You might not even need AI and an LLM might be overkill if you can use traditional AI/ML.",

If you look up the term you will find a two dimensional plot with autonomy capabilities on the X axis and trust in autonomy on the Y axis. Then plotted along the y=x line will be calibrated trust.\n\nThe simple idea being that if you have a low amount of trust in autonomy in an area where it has high capabilities than you are under trusting it. Meaning you are not taking full advantage of the capabilities it has to offer. and on the other hand, if you trust it too much in areas that it doesn’t have much capabilities then you can be setting yourself up for failure.\n\nThe reason this pneumonic is significant is because of the term calibration. It is important for companies and indeed individuals to constantly recalibrate, and reevaluate the level of trust they have in these tools. If you evaluated it a year ago and haven’t done so since, then you are very likely under trusting some of the capabilities the professional tools have now. In particular, the models that dropped late last year showed dramatic improvements in the ability to assist in early dev work and project scaffolding.\n\nI don’t mean to overhype the capabilities, but I see a lot of posts where people espouse, the limitations of a year ago, as if it were still true today. The reality is the situation is evolving quite quickly, and everyone should be reevaluating on a continuous basis.",

Most of the time you only have enough “social credit” to rate 1-2 team members with top marks, maybe an additional one if you start cashing in chips to go to bat for them.

        "body": "In my experience, the senior leadership just changes the ratings instead of asks me ha. This can be for many reasons, they could have targets they're trying to fit across the orgs, budget impacts, etc. It happens when ratings are the mechanism for budget forcasts as well as professional evaluations. It does stink when it feels like you have a non bias system of evaluation you've applied and then it's updated under you.\n\nWhat I do in this situation is try to keep the feedback details the same as much as possible, remove any references to the specific rating (like, Surpasses Expectations vs Meets) in the feedback. I give them all the factual situations and behaviors that lead me to rate them this way. I walk them through how the company evaluates performance (if it is documented by the company), how I apply those criteria in my own evaluations and aligns those evaluations across managers. This is good feedback for the employee, the things they are doing well keep doing, the things they may want to change, maybe they want to change them, and so on. Did they get peer feedback? Do you have impressions of their work? all great to share. It's hard when they people you manage are asking for specific feedback to get to the rating they want. \"What do I need to do to be rated as Exceeds expectations mr manager?\", but you don't have as much agency as you think.\n\nI don't lead with this, but like others have said, tell them the truth if the rating or discrepancy between the feedback and the rating comes up or they ask. Explain the macro conditions and the process for aligning on the ratings that can give them some prospective.\n\nFor yourself, yes this is the conflict with the job. You could try to change companies, good luck, but these kinds of things come up in different ways at most companies I've found. Personally, I say this because I do it myself, you may be feeling inadequate or like a failure at justifying your ratings to your non-technical boss and retreating into stubbornness or rigid principle as a defense mechanism. Try to separate one from the other.\n\nI try to find value in the human relationships with my team and the coaching opportunities between me and them. If they flourish in this system, and the team flourishes I feel like I'm doing a good job.",

        "body": "I worked as a programmer for about 10-15 years. I took time off to be a parent. I tried to come back in, and I found a lot of great encouragement. But all the jobs I'm getting are in series-B startups, and they are completely incompatible with being a parent to a child with high needs. I actually tried, but things are just so unstable now. I got fired from a job after about 10 months despite busting my ass on it, and then the next job I found, I got laid off in about 8 months.\n\nTech careers are so all-consuming, and if you want to run a family while in one, it means you're spending a ton of money on daycare, babysitters, after-school programs, summer camps, cleaning, and meal services. You can't turn on and turn off these things at will. Like I get my kid into a pretty expensive daycare that's taking 30% of my take-home, and then I get laid off... I can't just pull her from the daycare because I currently don't have an income, and then put her back in when my income stabilises. I have significant savings, but this type of uncertainty and demands means I can't actually build enough savings while I work, and my savings get depleted fast when I'm between jobs. And I'm not actually able to be a good parent if I'm constantly worried about getting fired or laid off.\n\nAnd AI is cool, but it feels like I'm expected to be up to date on using AI in my job, and I have to spend time outside of work to explore AI and stuff. Which I really don't have the time for. \n\nSo I'm going back to school to get a teaching credential. There's a huge shortage of math and science teachers. I need something stable that offers benefits, so I'm not constantly worried about the high cost of COBRA coverage when I'm between jobs. The biggest benefit is, even if the job isn't flexible, I'm just DONE at 5pm. Even if I have to grade papers at home, it's not as cognitively demanding as being on-call at 2am when the server goes down. \n\nThere are a lot of bad things said about teaching as a profession, and I personally know lots of teachers who got sick of it and quit, just as I got sick of tech and quit. But at this point in my life, it feels like a better career choice. \n\nI still love programming, and in my spare time, I am constantly coding apps, helping friends with their startups, and consulting. I actually have the bandwidth and energy to do it because I'm not busting ass programming all day. This stuff is much easier with AI as well.",

        "body": "That is the point of stack ranking. They want employees to be in a constant state of fear, anxiety and subservience to their manager.\n\nThe solution is to have a huge 1 to 2 years of monthly expenses saved up. Then you dont have to give a fuck about your performance while you wait for the inevitable layoff. I keep $100k in hysa just for a layoff scenario - it took 5 years to accumulate, which was tough at the time, but my anxiety level was greatly reduced. This hysa stack is seperate from stocks/bonds/401k/529/real-estate etc - those are not your emergency fund. Some people say $xxx in cash is too much - but thats not my problem. This is what I need for my mental safety net and you may need more or less for yours.\n\nMy last layoff, I got $20k severance and 2 months where I was paid salary but could spend the time searching - and I luckily got a job lined up before the clock ran out. The time before, it took me 2 months to find a job, but severance was only $10k. So I had to dip into my savings, despite unemployment checks. You should look up the weekly max unemployment benefit for your state and factor that into your plan. \n\nTLDR: Layoffs are inevitable. Stressing and extra effort will not save you from it. Fuck your employer. You need to stop worrying about stack ranking and layoffs, and instead worry about reducing your expenses and stacking your emergency fund. Use your anxious energy to plan and prep. Once you are prepped and have enough stacked, your anxiety will go away.",

I don’t know what it is because I presumably never worked with you, but it’s something about you that makes leadership not trust you. One thing I can tell you from your post is, stop trying so hard to chase the next level. I have seen this trap from so many different people (my self included), from juniors to staff+. \n\nI have seen people get bitter and go “I’m doing the same work as this other person, why I’m I X and they’re X+1?” But almost always, there is something that is really holding them back. I worked with one mid level once who was extremely bitter that they were not promoted to sr yet (the left amazon as a sde1 or 2, applied as a sr to my current company under the impression that they’d get promoted to sr quickly, and then quit 3 years later as still a midlevel). They were extremely difficult to work with honestly, and mostly because of that bitterness. They couldn’t take an ambiguous piece of work and deliver it. You had to really hold their hands to get them to deliver code. And it wasn’t even because they didn’t know what they we were doing, they did. It’s because they were so focused on proving themselves as sr, they fought against every single plan and needed to fight every little suggestion. They wouldn’t take any feedback, seeing feedback as a ding against their capabilities. They’d write “clever code” that was hard to read and often had edge case bugs, and if you mentioned it during a PR, then they’d just complain to the manager that I’m holding up the review. They’d publicly call out their manager when there was a decision that was made that they disagreed with. \n\nThese behaviours are what held this person back, and it’s the same kind of behaviour that I’ve seen over and over again. Often times, just focusing on what’s on your plate and delivering outstanding work there is all you need to do. And then you have a convo with your manager and say “I’ve been building great stuff here, and I want to make it to the next level, give me more work please.” Promos are often not done by just your manager, they are done by a committee. You need a manager who is both respected and willing to back you for promo, and other managers who know your name and not willing to fight against your manager to their people. If you piss of another team by being difficult, then you can be that manager is going to bring that up and it’s going to hurt you. \n\nYou need to be open and collaborative with others. Work with your manager to line up work that aligns with your strengths and weaknesses and focus on knocking those out of the park with out the expectation of promotion.",

Especially employees outside your team?\n- when others start a new feature / project, are you pulled into all day meetings to help them design it even when you will not be involved in the implementation?\n- when nasty production issues arise, are you pulled in to figure out a path forward? If so, is it just for your team or is it across other teams as well?\n- do you help identify future work for your team or do you just wait for product to tell you what to do?\n- do you help management negotiate resourcing requirements for a new feature / project by doing things like creating POCs and then following up with your recommendations for an implementation plan and the amount of teams / engineers involved?\n\nThe key difference between staff/principal and senior is this ability to navigate the landscape outside your team. You are seen as a technical expert that will influence the direction of your organization, not just your team. If you’re merely leading your team by helping them break down work and reviewing their PRs, that’s senior level work, not principal/staff.\n\nSpend the time focusing on the relationships with other teams and becoming invaluable outside your team and the promotion will eventually come.",

I thought you had GraphQL listed twice at first, and my first boomer instinct was “if this person can’t proofread their own resume, why would I bother interviewing them if they care so little?” You are dealing with people with short fuses when people are reviewing your resume. Organize/categorize it better, so someone can digest the info more easily. It’s similar to the snark on Reddit when people joke about paragraphs. \n\n- “Contributed” sounds extremely passive. It sounds like your team built a feature while you were working on something else. Work on that section to show more involvement. Even something like “Developed a highly scalable…” might work better. You can add “team” somewhere if you are that self-conscious about it. It’s a mix of passive word choice, and I have literally interviewed people who tried to take credit for the work of others. It just raises an eyebrow because it’s kind of an odd word choice. \n\n- Were these different projects or a single one? If they were different projects, you could list the tech stack of each.

It had a context that could fit like 100 lines of code but it was also low quality context that was forgetful. It hallucinated a lot and lacked knowledge in general. It could not reason or do any thinking. There were no tools it could use to be agentic or even look up things online, didn’t work with images, was very slow, and could barely output anything.\n\nNow as of like two days ago we have gpt 5.3 codex. You give it a goal and it will do it autonomously. It can handle not hundreds, or thousands, but millions of lines of code with reliable accuracy. It can use tools, search the web, understand images, even use the computer. It still hallucinates but orders of magnitude less. The world knowledge is more broad than any single expert on earth, even teams of experts. In terms of knowledge depth it outperforms the most elite specialists and only loses to top tier humans at the moment. It can reason and solve real and unseen problems, such as imo competition math problems and even open research problems where no solution exists online. It is also not only hundreds of times faster but also cheaper by like 20x I think per token. It can outputs thousands of lines of code, actually it’ll just find and edit the files it self, push the changes, do the testing, and so on. But yes atm you still need a knowledgeable human in the loop.\n\nAnyways this will sound like glaze but it’s stuff I’ve verified myself over the years. Now imagine 5 years down the line, with in mind that progress is actually speeding up and more compute is coming online very soon. So yes, unlike most people here I plainly see what’s happening and is about to happen. Bear in mind I’ve been saying this since ChatGPT launch to many downvotes but not only has everything happened but faster than even I thought and I was already very optimistic.\n\nIn short fields cooked yes, a lot of things are, this is much bigger than jobs but I won’t get into that. What should you do? Live as normal, not much you can do to prepare and there is no guarantees things will play out this way. Just don’t be dumb and waste 120k on a degree that you may not be able to pay off.",

These participants were not particularly fast when using AI, but demonstrated a high level of understanding on the quiz. Importantly, this approach looks nearly the same as the AI delegation group, but additionally uses AI to check their own understanding.\n>* Hybrid Code-Explanation (n=3): Participants in this group composed hybrid queries in which they asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time.\n>* Conceptual Inquiry (n=7): Participants in this group only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task.

That means you need to that that, too. If all goes well, you’ll develop some prompts for things like coding standards, security, token, credentials storage etc, and you’ll work toward being able to do extended systems design work. It’s deeper storyboarding in collaboration with the product team. It’s more fine grained contracts between FE/BE/Devops. \n\nAnd then you start to build things and code review them and get multiple parts of a service build for horizontal scaling and personalization up and running so you can start to test how it scales. \n\nWhat’s happening is just another layer of abstraction on both sides of the engineering team that allows engineers to shift the engineering focus from how it connects to other services and third party apis and and towards how they interact in practice.",

The WLB is fairly good, but the performance culture grinds years off your life for a mediocre pay and no RDU.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI’ll also note, SA while a shit pay, will offer more shelter from PIPs than for PAs.

Left after I fulfilled my time requirement to not pay back the signing bonus & Relocation package. \n\nC1 tries to operate as if they’re AWS, the problem is that they’re not paying AWS money. They like to intentionally over-hire & rely on pip culture to incentivize employees to overwork themselves to be ranked appropriately. That leads me to my next thing, they do stack ranking for employees. This means that you’ll be ranked against employees at the same level as you & normally that would be fine, but a lot of orgs have company lifers. These people have been there their entire career or the majority of their career & they know the company inside & out so they’ll consistently set an incredibly high bar that new external hires have to adhere to within a few months of working at the company. \n\nWith a company so reliant on internal systems that are poorly documented & long drawn-out (again, poorly documented) processes it’s hard to learn all of that while also navigating all the levels of bureaucracy & compliance that comes with fintech. Quite frankly unless you grossly overwork yourself on a regular basis for a year or two or you’re just an incredibly talented engineer it’s unlikely you’ll succeed there. \n\nHere are some additional things that you may find useful to know:\n- They reorg frequently, I’m talking every 6 months at least. So you’ll constantly be shifting teams or lose team members\n- Everything there is reliant on tons of internal tools & many basic things you’ll have to do will take significantly longer than expected because you have to ask many people who to contact about something then you have to fill out a form & then message someone to tell them you filled out the form then fill out the form again because you forgot to check a certain field on the form\n- The way the company operates with pip culture breeds a lot of toxic behavior between employees so you’ll encounter a lot of terrible behavior throughout your interactions. Plenty of good people there, but the amount of bad interactions you’ll encounter is relatively high.\n- as a woman you might find it relevant to know that there’s not many women working there in the engineering departments. I was there for a little over a year & I found out about 3 different serious scandals there involving harassment & encountered a lot of higher ups who are not very respectful towards women. \n\n\nAll that being said, they do pay pretty decent, but in my opinion they do not pay nearly enough for how much it sucks to work there. If you’re up to date on your interview skills I highly recommend interviewing elsewhere. Many other companies pay equally well or even better that aren’t as terrible to work for.",

I think at most I would go down to 5 hours, and even then I wouldn't claim I then worked for a full 8 hours.\n\n\nIt's reasonable to not always be 100% engaged at all times. personally I aim for at least 6 hours of work a day and only occasionally go under that.\n\n\nSo as I see it, yes it is normal, but there is a limit to how much is reasonable.",

The client hated me (they were actually an extremely petty person who burned through a lot of people, so it was not solely on me). But my boss/CEO started becoming a bully towards the end of my time there. I honestly start wondering if he was just trying to make it unpleasant enough I'd quit. I do believe he's done that (or at least tried) with other people. He would start changing requirements midway through development, constantly sending extremely harassing messages, etc. It was very stressful, and I had been worried about losing my job for a while.\n\nThe company had a major issue, and suddenly, I didn't have a job any more. And it was such a great feeling. I didn't have to deal with any of their stupidity any longer. I was lucky because I had started speaking to another company casually, so I didn't have an extended period of unemployment. I did ask for a gap in start time, and I caught up a ton on sleep I had been missing out on. I make a little less now, but I'm soooo much happier. I'm working in a much healthier environment with people who just treat people decently. \n\nI did lose out money on the time I wasn't working. There's no way around that. And I know there are others who lost theirs jobs around the same time I did who I think are still looking. There's some luck in how things play out. If I hadn't found another job, on top of that one I really like, I'd probably feel very differently. \n\nThere's risk, because what happens if your partner were to lose their job? If it takes you a long time to work again (either by choice or by market), do you run the risk of alienating them? What does recovering your mental and physical health look like, and how supportive will they be? If you're just playing video games on the couch, that could cause problems in the relationship. You need to make sure you're communicating with them, and not just that you're miserable, but understand how they'd feel about you quitting your job. \n\nWhat kind of position are you in to interview? Are you too slammed to interview? Are you not prepared? Or are you not getting any interest? ",

The real world experience of coding was nothing like school; I enjoyed support a lot more so I moved into getting work doing on site technical support on contracts at oil extraction sites.\n\n\nIt was relatively easy to hop from contract to contract, make a lot of connections, and eventually I moved to do on site IT support for a regional authority.\n\n\nHaving the various experiences from the contracts and the programing experience really helped out with seeing problems in a different light and finding unique solutions.\n\n\nI rarely program now, mostly it's just problems that come my way that no one else can figure out because they don't know where to begin.  Really it all comes down to being able to understand how to parse large datasets into useful information.\n\n\nI can understand it, I can explain it, most of my team can't comprehend it; so I rapid prototype the solution, meet with various teams, and we get a usable product that prevents us from having to do a RFP for 5 to 10 million dollars a year.\n\n\nI assume there are other roles that are related to computer science that exist in which you can still use your education, training, and knowledge; but it might be a pretty niche job market - regional company, not huge, but not tiny.  Big enough to pay we'll, small enough that 5 million dollars a year on savings makes a difference, also in house IT.  Contractors aren't going to care and are going to insist that you can be in 3 places at once doing 5 things because they can't read a map.",

The engineering is up to us, not a bunch of corporate stooges and their worthless \"AI up-skilling\" powerpoints. I’ll give you a basic run down of everything important I've learned in the last year:\n\n1. Write an AGENTS.md file that gives a broad view of your repository with high level details like tech stack, folder structure, etc. Also point to which docs should be referenced if the agent needs to expand further for more details. This prompt will be injected in every conversation so keep the information broad/horizontal instead of deep/vertical.\n\n2. Learn how to sandbox your agent so you can run the agent in yolo mode and afk it. The 3 most popular options are: Claude code’s builtin sandbox mode, vscode’s dev containers, and docker’s new sandbox mode for running agents.\n\n3. Learn git worktrees so you can have agents work in the background without disrupting your normal workflow or if you want to parallelize work. (I recommend not trying to parallelize too much, most work is inter-dependent and it's usually easier to just work sequentially)\n\n4. Utilize skills and have a directory full of detailed instructions for each common task you do. For example, a frontend task that goes deep into detail on how you want your frontend code to be written. Unlike the AGENTS.md file, you want these docs to be deep and detailed. The agent will use progressive disclosure and only invoke those skills when its relevant so your context isn’t overloaded\n\n5. Learn about the ralph wiggum technique. This is essentially breaking extremely long tasks into subtasks and running the agent in a loop so that it can work on atomic tasks with a fresh context each time instead of trying to one-shot it and getting its context window trashed. This will involve: \n  - A PRD doc explaining the feature and requirements in depth.\n  - A tasks.json file with subtasks and acceptance criteria for each task.\n  - A notes.md file so that it can jot down any information that might be relevant in between tasks. \n  - And finally, a bash script to run your agent continuously.\n  - There’s some good info [here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) along with more stuff if you google ralph wiggum.\n\n6. Standard engineering practices apply. Tons of high quality tests, linters, formatters, and strict type checkers.\n\n7. Set up a way for your agent to test changes. Whether thats setting up staging environments for backend work or setting up browser automation for frontend.\n\n8. Avoid MCPs like the plague. 99.99% of them are useless and will clog your context with useless tool definitions that the agent isn’t even good at invoking. The only mcp I recommend is this for browser automation: https://github.com/remorses/playwriter (NOT THE OFFICIAL PLAYWRIGHT MCP. The official one is trash and not optimized to preserve your context window)\n\n9. Learn your agent’s plugin system and write scripts to automate tasks that should be run deterministically. Example: Writing a stop hook that executes code quality checks like I mentioned in bullet point 6.",

I quickly got tired and discouraged, feeling like an imposter, so I stopped and kept working my meh job.\n\nI’m back on the grind now, though, and I told myself I would push until I got something. I’m about a month into getting back into Leetcode and it’s hard. I just did two easy’s that were similar to each other, yet I still needed hints on both. I also seem to really struggle with my memory on problems. I built an SRS app for the Leetcode problems I complete just so I can remember to go back to them lol. It’s a tough battle out there, but I believe in us. Just keep studying, keep learning, and keep applying. I’ve gotten responses back from some big tech companies and some smaller random companies so far. 3 upcoming OA’s and 2 recruiter calls coming up.\n\nAlso, I think for your position and resume, you could try to pivot it as general “software engineer” or “frontend engineer”. Make sure you emphasize the languages you’re working with and try to minimize how much you mention Wordpress. I think if you can get some personal projects going that are more than just a super simple CRUD app, that would help, too. You got this!",

There's a big difference between a story that you actually wrote and one that you tell off the cuff. That's the important stuff, once you get out of the entry-level zone.\n\nFor some companies you need to do leetcode, but it is very far from mandatory across the industry. If you want to work at a high paying big name tech firm, then you play by their rules. If you want to have a job that still pays pretty good and is maybe kinda chill, then don't worry about it. Prep like anyone preps for any job. Don't jump through the tech hoops.\n\nI've done less than 5 hours of leetcode across 8-9 years in the industry. It absolutely cost me offers, and in turn has definitely extended some of my job searches. I've failed plenty of tech screens that I know I would have passed if I was studying DSA.

This is because trash schools do not prepare you to pass the interview. You are better off doing community college for first 2 years to get the required classes out of the way for cheap. Then you take a few basic computer science classes. Then in state tuition nearby for the last 2 years.\n\nReal computer science is hard and time consuming. If you can't handle that, you won't pass the interviews. WGU or any of the for profit trash does NOT prepare you to go to work or to PASS THE INTERVIEW.\n\nSo basically there are 3 tiers of schools\n\nIvy league or equivalent. These will get you interviews you may not get else where. You have to pass the interview.\n\nAll other not for profit colleges have similar material. Most of these will prepare you to pass the interviews.\n\nFor profit trash that is useless diploma mill crap and you will fail the interviews.\n\nBottom line: Do ivy league or do instate tuition. Id also argue that any other private college is a waste of money because its much more debt and won't prepare you for the interview. Id also argue that community college for first 2 years to save money is a good idea too. Most of the computer science classes will be at the regular college.

This is about the same view as bootcamp-only people--its better than nothing, but it's just taken as nowhere near the same as the above.\n\n\nTHAT SAID, for your specific case of already having a different degree **and teaching the subject**, I think WGU is a pretty good option. You already clearly have the interpersonal and project management skills needed to be functional in a workplace, and youre even more aligned since you have actually been doing some amount of programming already.\n\n\nI think you'll still struggle to get those first few jobs just because the career track is so railroaded towards the typical \"new grad with internships climbing up the ladder,\" but you absolutely can do it. I STRONGLY recommend freelancing to get your foot in the door, since it'll mean not needing to drop off of your teaching job. Tbh, if you can convince someone to let you build them a plugin for their website or make some open-source contributions, I think you could even end up with a \"typical eng job\" without a degree (though I don't recommend this).\n\n\nAnyways, my advice to you is\n\n1. Get the WGU degree\n2. While getting the degree, really really seek out a project or two from peers nearby. Maybe the school website could use some updating. Maybe your buddy wants clients to be able to schedule an appointment online rather than call him. These jobs will replace the typical \"internship\" experience companies want.\n3. Afterwards, seek out workplaces that can leverage your background. There is a TON of education tech being made by folk who have no idea what educators need.\n4. Be resilient. You're entering into a tumultuous field later than your competitors. There are going to be instances and people that make you feel small. Forget them, I really truly think youve got some great experience that'll be super rare and valuable for where you end up.\n\n\nYou got this!",

It's then your decision if that changes anything, if you want to notify the other company, etc. I would warn not to try extending it and make them keep bidding. That will get old quickly for them and may sour them on you. \n\nWhat you share really depends on why you chose one company over the other. You don't have to tell them anything, but it's good to keep the relationship professional, as you never know what can happen. There may be an opportunity to work for them again down the road.

Also a woman. \nThe first 3 jobs within the first 5 years of my career made me feel so completely out of my depth (either cos the code base was so vast, or deliveries were too hurried, or me simply no understanding anything) that I used to break down into tears after some meetings. Sounds ridiculous writing that down.\n\nTo this day its hard for me to describe what the hell I was feeling at the time. Why I felt so out of place. Why I felt like everyone looked down on me. I dont even know what I expected from myself to cause such a dissonance in contrast with the reality I was living. \nI still don't feel remotely competent in what I do. But I have never once been reprimanded for a weak performance.\n\nSo after many years nd now over 30 I decided to no longer care. I have decided that until someone isn't pleased with what I do, i will embrace my mediocrity, embrace my stupidity, ask the stupid questions,  learn to champion the colleagues that put in extra hours of work for fun (because they still live with their mums or girlfriends and have a very different time budget to their lives than me) to learn from them by proxy instead of feeling like I need to compete with them. \n\nThis is how I'm surviving, because I learned that its in this mess that development happens. I am neither in social, embedded or health, so the stakes arent high anyway. \nThis way I keep my sanity, my humility to keep learning from everything and everyone, and mental peace to grow outside of work and give my energy to my family.",

It doesn't help you in any ways (if you go the extreme route) and your boss might think you are worse than you are which can impact your end of year performance reviews. You have to at least show you are putting in a lot of the effort to catch up so your manager understands.\n\n>How do I stop feeling so dumb?\n\nSponge up all the knowledge as much as possible. And emulate what your teammates are doing. Catch up ASAP.\n\n>How do I earn the respect of my coworkers?\n\nWhat I just said above + do your stuff well + make sure you are a team multiplier in some ways or another.\n\n>I also feel like an idiot sometimes in general because the product itself and the code is very complex. The product is for a niche field I’m not very familiar with.\n\nI know redditors hate to hear this but spend more hours (this means outside work hours) figuring out wtf is going on. And if there's little to no documentation on what you think is important knowledge, document it and share it to the team (this shows you are 'team multiplier' and will look good to your performance review). And if there's any documents regarding the product, just read through it even if you don't understand it multiple times here and there again and again (so your eyes at least get used to the technical jargon, etc).\n\nType or screenshot everything in your note taking app or whatever per day. Every command you ran and so forth so you can look back. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I recommend it if you don't use a note taking app (it's very bare bones and light). And I have Calender plugin on it.\n\nIf your company allows you to use AI on the codebase, abuse the heck out of AI and ask all sorts of questions on it.\n\nSchedule 1 on 1 meetings with your teammates and ask questions on topics you don't know much about. Don't schedule and just be like \"I don't know\". People don't like that. People like you put in SOME effort to try so show you put in the effort to try to make sense and are confused/lost. And screenshot every single step your teammate is doing so you don't forget or lose (so you can help organize later). Also, DM your teammates with help you need (do it to different team members a time so you don't overload one teammate). And make sure that DM (Slack setting or whatever is set to never delete). And again, screenshot/save any command, etc that comes out of it.\n\nType more shit about your status and what you are doing in your team channel more. Last thing you want is to look invisible. Invisible == Looks like you aren't doing anything.\n\nI abuse the heck out of screenshotting in this field. Everything in every meeting when I see a screen is screenshot. I don't care how trivial. From the URL to what not I just screenshot.\n\nIf this is in office, bribe your team members (and other close by office workers (from where you sit)) with occasional cookies/snacks or whatever. Look optimistic and happy and eager. It goes a long way and will help you with your performance reviews indirectly (welcome to life).\n\nAh and the biggest thing. **When you are given a task, stop trying to focus on the task. Try to understand the bigger picture first (the REASON behind the task and so forth). Make sure you focus on that in 1on1 when asking your team members for help on a task.**\n\nIf you focus on 'code logic' context, then you are f-ed. You need to focus on the business/overall reason for why this task was given. And from there form your own opinion and maybe you might come to conclusion \"why is this task needed?\" and so forth which you should be free to ask/voice out. That's critical thinking. That's what software engineering is.\n\n>I (26F) have been working at my job for exactly 1 year.\n\nTook me like over 4 years just to not feel this. And even then I always constantly worry I am not performing to my level. And I studied CS directly unlike you.\n\nTook me over 3 years alone to stop thinking in terms of 'code/task context' to the bigger picture. It's normal. Just put in the hours and your hours will not betray you in the longer run. Fortunately for me I was able to cover up for my incompetence in this side by being extremely proficient/fast at coding but if I didn't have that I probably was truly cooked.",

I don't think that says that much about you.

It's common that deadlines slip and stuff takes longer than expected. It shouldn't generally be a \"work extra\" thing, particularly not for no extra pay. From a practical standpoint, I understand it if your job is on the line (the economy and all), but resist the pressure under normal circumstances.\n\nOverall, sadly, intern positions on solo projects aren't that uncommon, yet are obviously bad for the intern. Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task. And yes, solo projects are strictly worse for a new person (or arguably any person) in pretty much every way (hard to get help, isolating, more likely to have incorrect estimates, etc). You'd probably have a better experience working on a project with an actual team, though I'm not sure how realistic of a possibility that is for you on the short term.",

But once you're burned out, that's it there's no going back. \n\nThe most you can do now is manage what you can at work and take care of yourself better and hope you get better over time or if there's not much in your control then you probably need to leave the situation.\n\nThe only other thing you can do is reexamine the situation to see if there's an end in sight. If there is maybe you can stick it out. But if it's not caused by a specific situation but rather the environment there may be no end in sight and spinning your wheels hoping it'll get better will just lead to worse burnout.\n\nTo me it sounds like you're in a bad environment where they're trying to take advantage of a cheap intern. Internships in the dev industry are supposed to be intros to the company so that an intern can decide if they want to take a job there or not, or they might be part of getting college credit. Smart companies don't make long interns manage a whole giant project with moving parts and deadlines, that'd just be idiotic of them.

I used to do interviews for a company, and they gave us zero visibility into what the candidate experience was. It was just \"here's a resume, interview this person, let us know what you think.\" No guidance, not much communication, etc. I've also worked at some companies where I did a pair interview with executives who would just say, \"I'll let you lead,\" because they didn't bother to look at the person's resume. We've also dealt with situations where online tests didn't work, or the prompts/questions were wrong.

When the feature needs to be \"done\" by tomorrow, is that code complete or feature complete? If it's code complete, I'd think you still need to leave time for testing and bug fixes before release.\n\nAlso, where's your EM or Tech Lead in all of these convos? \n\nFinally, healthy friction between Product and Engineering is normal as you're working together from different angles to move the project forward.

But I know engineers making anywhere from 150 to 700k with 4-5 YOE. Yes, there are bonuses and the size depends on the firm. I think most firms are flat so your title won’t change much and salary progression is usually pretty meritocratic. As far as what you do, for most engineering positions it’s working on internal libraries, tooling, execution, order routing systems. My role involving pulling market data off co-located switches/servers, so I often felt like a network engineer. We also maintained all of our own servers, so a lot of the work is around maintaining / migrating those. Not a whole lot of cloud being used due to obvious reasons for HFT. Did I enjoy it? It’s a job. I loved being surrounded by the smartest working on hard problems in a competitive industry. I enjoyed having to think about computers at a low-level, digging into OS internals to write the fastest C++ code. But it’s not incredibly meaningful if that matters to you and I felt like my skills were becoming highly specialized—a good thing if you want to stay in trading your whole life, but the longer you stay the harder it may be to jump into a different space. For example, you won’t have any experience creating a product for real users. I do think most of these places offer some of the best jobs you can find that balance pay and work/life. Also, it being so specialized may help you avoid the layoffs that plague other tech jobs. It’s more like finance than tech in that way.",

The issue is newbies go for the one shot which is where all your problems get generated including increased token consumption from hunting down problems.\n\n\nBut once people figure out how to divide up tasks into simple functions and stitching them then it becomes pretty good with a high success rate. Afterwards asking for basic architecture problems become the next step and so on. \n\n\nRight now there will be a lot of junk but we are still in the transition phase where everyone is still trying to just play around.

They usually want people with a variety of technical skills, as each client will have different needs. It's a mix of a technical consulting role and integration engineer. A lot depends on your company, and what kind of product they are selling.\n* I've seen some sales engineer roles just shift the title to copy Palantir and sound more hip.\n* Some solution architects, who are just kind of glorified technical sales positions, trying to get more work out of a client.\n\nI think you need to get clarification from any company you're interviewing with what they actually expect from people in the role. Ideally, you'd speak to/interview with people in the actual role and ask what type of work they've been doing. I'd personally be open to the first, although having gotten out of consulting, I don't think I'd want to go back. The latter two would hold no interest for me. It's like how some Engineering Managers are pure people managers, and other still write code some percentage of time.\n\nTo clarify with \"technical consulting,\" I've seen some people who actually write code and have deliverables.

If you come out the other side and all you can offer is a few more years of Python, there's already a crowded market for that.  You can market yourself better by learning and understanding the business processes.  You can market yourself very by learning and understanding complex systems and infrastructure. \n\nI met and worked with this guy a few months after he got out of school.  Nice guy, friendly, and solid technical skills, but didn't seem impressive.  He switched teams every few years, learned tons of stuff, refined his leadership skills, and 10 years later, he's out doing tech presentations for the firm.  And he was really good at it.

Get familiar with those.\n\nChances are, you're spiraling from worrying about some vast surface area of unknowns when you come across a new challenge, instead of just focusing on the one thing in front of you. The reality is you will never be able to tackle that vast surface of unknowns, the field is just too large, and you need to be able to recognize that never knowing everything and making incremental progress over a long stretch of time is normal for everyone.\n\nFor tech projects specifically, the tool you probably want is called a work breakdown structure (WBS). The idea is take the nebulous scary thing and break it into smaller pieces, rinse and repeat until things start to look more concrete. E.g. for a webdev project, maybe there's frontend and backend, and then maybe in the frontend there's pages, and each page has components, and so on, down the rabbit hole you go, until you've got a list of concrete tasks that can be unambiguously be marked as done or not done.\n\nIf you can't tame your panic attacks, then the pragmatic option is stick with your non tech job. Not everyone works jobs they love.",
