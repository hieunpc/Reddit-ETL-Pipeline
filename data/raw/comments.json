For the first three months or so, while building the team, everything was smooth. But after that, I started feeling more or less the same way you described. When you’re the decision-maker, from system design to the nitty-gritty details, you’re also the one who gets blamed when things don’t work out. At one point, I even felt that juniors were contributing more than me because I was stuck in a loop of wrong decisions. \n\nBut that’s okay. We are engineers, and we are supposed to try, fail, and learn until something works out. It can feel overwhelming to be your own north star at the beginning. I hope you start figuring things out soon. During my own period of doubt, my CTO once told me, “I’m happy that you’re demotivated. It shows you’re serious about your work, and when things don’t work out, you feel disappointed. That’s a great engineer trait.” So you do have a great engineer trait. You’re not mediocre, we’re all good in our own way.",

I’m certain that you’ve encountered that situation.\n\nThis is why I generally caution younger engineers to avoid startups; it’s intriguing to potentially build everything from the ground up, and the money sounds great, but it’s just not a good fit for anyone who hasn’t done that architecture and design work in a more controller environment before.",

Use draw.io or something like that to draw your architecture, and share that with your team before building it and review it to see if it is foolproof. Then go build your application to that architecture. Things will fall into place, and you’ll have a documented trail of why you made decisions. And for streaming itself, just use Spark structured streaming. And if you need to do a backfill have a classic Spark job set up for it. But put these things into a design doc before you even write one line of code, and you can review that design doc with your leadership or other engineers",

Unfortunately, nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution, and things often languish in MVP stage far longer than you’ll ever expect. Often the MVP is the P, and you’ll have to live with whatever architecture was originally built. \n\nSpreadsheet for a POC? Maybe… but MVP? Often a bad idea. \n\nFor a website just displaying some data… probably a fine solution I grant you. But for anything more complex, no. How are you handling pushing the data? Do you have a Dev/PPE/Prod spreadsheet? Do you run tests to validate the data before it gets pushed live? How are you managing the schema of the spreadsheet against your application layer? What if you need to roll back? \n\nIf your client can’t handle using git or some other workflow to update the data, I’d want some substantial guard rails in place if I am letting them edit production data. At least some type of defined deployment flow with validation and integration testing. \n\nA cloud hosted DB has pretty minimal costs. Databases have tons of advantages, but the one of the most important is they are robust and conform to a design standard with means that the next guy who comes along wont be stuck unpicking a bespoke spreadsheet solution.\n\nAlso, DBs are not the only solution. I often favour config files in a git repo for dynamic data that I need to let clients manage. That way they can be CI/CD integrated, with any necessary deployment, version management, and testing built in.",

        "body": "I'm doing a similar role, although at a very small firm - similarly no data culture to speak of, messy and fragmented processes and systems etc. I wouldn't have chosen it necessarily but some life circumstances have led me to it as a necessity at least in the short term. I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.\n\nThe major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. \n\nOn the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.\n\nIf neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:\n1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering\n2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering\n3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst\n4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist\n6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, product\n\nI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. \n\nThis can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.\n\nSo my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.\n\nYou mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.\n\nYour tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a  good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",

I'd say that's true of pretty much any role that's not the 'prototypical' FAANG data engineering role. It sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job given the situation. \n\n> Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\n\nThis is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.\n\nObviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. \n\nAll of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum. Most people are going to end up de facto specialists in little sub niches over the course of a career, even if they are relative generalists in data tech.",

Your job title is really multiple, and you're learning to become a generalist which is great. This was always me and my career and now I run a consulting agency that focuses on data analytics and data engineering. \n\nI'd say don't worry about the job title, if you want to apply for analytics roles, make a resume that focuses on analytics. If you want to apply for engineering roles you can do the same thing. \n\nAs far as like LinkedIn or something, I would perhaps put down analytics and engineering. My LinkedIn for example says something like data analytics, data engineering and data science.",

Probably as other have said around a title similar to analytics engineer.\n\nMy guess is we end up with 3 core engineer roles - AI, Platform & Analytics.  With the other key areas being governance/data management.\n\nId just suggest starting to specialise in a function rather than focussing on an individual tools, after all, Excel will probably be flavour of the month again in a year or two 😂",

You’re doing the heavy lifting—cleaning up the Excel Wild West and acting as a Data Janitor to make sure the business doesn't collapse under its own messy data.\nMy advice? Don't worry about choosing a lane just yet. Being a generalist in a zero data culture environment is a superpower. However, stop the band-aid fixes as soon as you can. If you want to scale, look into dbt first. It’ll help you turn those fragmented Python scripts into a SSOT. You're building the foundation of a skyscraper; make sure the cement is solid.",

Edit: This is maybe a useless or incorrect comment; I honestly don't know what a recruiter or hiring manager would stop and look at more when faced with a stack of CVs/resumes...\n\nI've been in a similar space for the 7 years I've been in a data-focused role - my team has been a team of 2 ICs the entire time.  We have a business-oriented manager now.  For a little while we had a data architect.  But, in a lot of ways it has been me wearing hats for platform admin/architect/engineer/modeller/analyst/visualiser.  For a bit over a year I've been titled Lead Data Engineer.\n\nIt's absolutely tough being at the end of the chain as some sort of generalist mid-to-senior.  Apart from the year or so I worked with the architect who'd been around a while, I've had to learn a lot on my own, and from the internet, and from paid-for consultants.\n\nWhether you want to generalise or specialise depends on your goals, I think.  I like the variety of experience and work that can come from being a generalist.  I think I am just that way inclined, though, jack-of-all-trades kind of thing.  But, in my career, I don't think I've been a proper specialist, so 🤷‍♂️  Another way to look at it is breadth rather than depth of expertise.  On this point, I like what u/Psychological-Suit-5  said.\n\n  \nOne more edit for silliness.  Could you set your own title as Data Gandalf?",

Data people are being Data&AI Engineers or full-stack data people.\n\nI also see, most of the companies are removing lots of their dashboards, keeping only the very fundamental ones. For the rest, you should build your data model & semantic layer. AI is doing the rest.\n\nEdit: Also, I forgot to say, maybe you should hire a data consultant for 1 day a week to check your data models & give you recommendations on architecture.

The job is to solve problems and achieve real-world objectives. Sometimes to do that we have to consider other constraints on the problem space, such as:\n\n- \"this technology is inferior, but it's battle tested and has loads of technical support staff backing it; we can't afford the risk of a new system going down and having no way to fix it\"\n- \"this technology is old, and therefore I can easily hire people who already know it, and there is a lot of documentation; the new one is great on paper but we need experienced staff to maintain it, and they are hard to find\"\n- \"this new technology is better than what we currently have in terms of technical performance, but we've rigged up enough custom ameliorations around the existing core tech that we will realise hardly any real world gains from switching\"\n- \"we would benefit from switching technologies in a measurable way, saving £50,000 per year, but it would take this entire team six months of work to move all our legacy code onto it. They have other, more pressing priorities and the benefit doesn't outweigh the cost of hiring a team of contractors to do it.\"\n\nBut let's say you think there's a big pool of potential adopters for whom SQLMesh II would make business sense. It's not so easy to take a slightly superior technology and turn that into a going concern. dbt has mass adoption.\n\nAre you personally planning to fork SQLMesh and spend a substantial chunk of your time maintaining it, if Fivetran strip the original for parts? Perhaps you will fund this via a hosted version - will you be picking up the phone to pitch it to companies yourself, or will you use your own money to pay someone to do that?\n\nWhat will you do if Fivetran freak out as soon as you get traction and throw a bunch of engineers at making dbt good enough to kill your competitive advantage? Unlike SQLMesh-original-flavour, you don't have proprietary code; Fivetran have access to the same stuff plus a lot more resources.\n\nRemember, you _only_ get acquired if it makes business sense to them to spend the money on buying you out ... instead of on using their own engineering team to outcompete you. If that happens it's very good news for analytics engineering, but _terrible_ news for you as a founder. Typical outcome: nothing happens. The incumbent has no motivation to improve, and would-be founders have no ability to realise the gains for themselves, so do nothing to change this.",

I’m assuming by mid-level you mean a title like senior data engineer in my response.\n\nThis is the arguably the hardest point in your career to progress. As many point out you can go IC or PL route. PL route tends to make a higher bonus but you can still make very good money as IC so both are viable paths. I know many engineers who have stayed at the level you are at their entire career. Only a few percent move up from here. This is because a new set of skills are required. You are no longer just coding 8 hours per day. This looks different depending on the company size but these roles are responsible for architecting solutions and leading others in the solution implementation. I do both in my role on a smaller team but often these are split into a Principal Architect and a Manager role.\n\nSo to move into these roles you need to demonstrate you can architect solutions and lead others via your work experience. Unfortunately almost no one will tell you that simply doing great work in your role doesn’t make you eligible for a promotion to the next one. Unless you demonstrate the skills required for the next level you will not even be viewed as a viable candidate by others. In practice this usually looks like partnering with business stakeholders to define a problem or need, designing a solution that addresses that problem or need, and organizing a team of engineers to deliver this solution. As a manager I could complete all the work which I delegate myself but instead I focus on turning business requirements into tasks, delegating those tasks to our engineers, and filling knowledge gaps so the engineers can complete the work.\n\nI could keep going here but I think I’ve made the main point. You must proactively make the choice to stop spending 100% of your time implementing and spend some of it addressing these other requirements. Then you will get noticed for promotions or for external job openings.",

        "body": "Data engineering is a sexy label on an ETL developer. This may come as a surprise to a lot of kids but just because you CAN do a lot of data operations in Python and Spark doesn’t mean you SHOULD. \n\nThe “pythonification” of ETL came about because like 7-8 years ago everyone was taking Udemy courses or YouTube videos on “how to be a Data Scientist” because that was the hot job title. Those courses focused a ton on ML libraries like Scikit-learn and so folks were taught some Python basics. \n\nTurns out that when those same folks made their way into a real Data Scientist role they realized that the data they were working with was not spoon fed to them and required some manipulation. So what do you do when you need to manipulate data and you only know how to use one technology? You see folks only solving problems with data in Python. \n\nGive credit to two things- folks ended up being really clever with a lot of “free” tools and libraries in Python and they gave this process of manipulating data a sexy title- enter the data engineer label. \n\nYour skills are not stagnating. You are learning a new universe in which data is manipulated and served. And the most important thing you need to learn is how to add those tools to your tool belt. \n\nThere is no right way to deliver data to an end consumer. I have seen nasty ass Python scripts that could easily be replaced by a few SQL statements. There may be reasons to use an ETL tool like Informatica instead of Airflow for pushing data around. Every option has trade offs, and the skill you are learning is how to work with those trade offs. You need to consider cloud compute costs, performance, failover and availability, and ease of support. \n\nWanna know the advantage of those visual tools? It’s easier for someone who is supporting your code to pick up and understand exactly what you are doing versus trying to debug a PySpark job. That’s part of what the appeal of tools like dbt are, yes they are overglorified CTE executing on SQL but it helps the end users understand a lot more as your pipelines get hairy. \n\nThe saying is “Jack of all trades, master of none, but often better than a master of one.” Knowing multiple ways to manipulate data helps with your flexibility and creativity in solving problems. I actually lament when folks focus on basic tooling for their job title and not the business problems they are solving or understanding the fundamental structures of data and how to present it.",

        "body": "> in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodity\n\nCode production is actually easy on AI age. Good code paired with good engineers that understand the code and know how to locate issues, fix them, support customers and add features on what they have without disturbing what they did before is not.\n\nI've seen lots of junior engineers using AI tools as fit for all tools which result in many of them being clueless of what's going on. That's a tremendous risk for a company. When something goes wrong things goes wrong in a big way. Tools have no accountability or responsibility but engineers do. Tip for engineers out there: AI tools are a game changer but NEVER deploy code you don't understand.\n\n> Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthless\n\nMaybe if you miss what's the purpose of unit tests. I see lots of engineers using unit tests to give them coverage or just as a way to look responsible but mostly the tests are so tied to the components that are not testing anything specific. If there are edge cases on potencial user inputs that should be tested to guarantee that no one removes the actual piece of code that does the validation or fallback on the inputs. So I would say: bad tests are detrimental, good tests are amazing guard rails.\n\n> Dependencies has to be explicit\n\nSounds like a no-brainer but it's actually hard to enforce that because many teams/engineers lack the discipline to do so and only value that once the s* hits the fan (somehow similar to skipping the tests)\n\n> nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for review\n\nBad engineering culture drives that. Mostly people are valued by the litres of code they add or the features they add (even if unbaked). Code reviews are good for aligning, learning and guaranteeing some standards. Running pipelines costs time and money so it's not the case they are free. So maybe code reviews investment might be something people should lean on.\n\n> REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineers\n\nNot that linear. You need good leadership that knows what's implemented, running and what your customers want. You need to make sure that everyone understand what's going on and why the things are the way they are, that's essential part of leadership. When it comes to ambiguity and a decision needs to be made you need someone that is a good leader and has a strong sponsor (CTO, VP, Director...).\n\nIf there is no leadership, sense of direction and accountability/responsibility is something exoteric even the best engineer will not be able to do the change and in that case maybe the 5 cheaper engineers might ship out more (despite risking shipping the wrong things at the wrong time with arguable quality).\n\nSo, in other words, your 5 cheap engineers are not an alternative to the \"good\" engineer but rather a combination of both.",

If every backfill costs $1000 of compute, you’re not going to get away with that many times. ",

        "body": "Yep, so this is a pattern dbt uses regularly.  I am fairly new as well (been reading/learning for what seems like years, but work doesn’t want to go down this route).\n\nBasically, the idea is you bring each referenced source table in to the model you’re working on as their own cte.  By doing this pattern you have a clear reference to every parent model you are using at the top of your model.\n\nYou then perform the transformation steps, including the joining of those referenced tables as the next cte (or several ctes depending on complexity).\n\nThen you read directly out of your last cte - preferably with little transformation in the final step.\n\nAll of this is to make things as readable and organised as possible.\n\nIf you were to start transforming each source in the initial cte, you wouldnt be reading a simple, single line bringing it in to the current model, but reading more complex transformations that you would need to spend more time figuring out what that piece was doing and where it began and ended.\n\nEdit to add: this way you can tell at a glance at the top of your model all the referenced sources.  Each of them as a single line cte with no complexity thrown in.  After you have brought in each source as its own cte, then you start a new one with a name indicating the source and transformation step, etc.\n\nBy bringing in your sources, transforming each, joining, performing joined transformations, aggregating, etc, each in a little code block cte, you are mimicking how programmers would use methods in code to logically break code into chunks.\n\nIf you also read up about layering data models (medallion architecture), you’ll see how dbt likes to break it down further into separate models.  This allows you to perform the simple single-model transformations, such as renaming, casting, etc at a ”silver” stage, and more complex transformations such as joining or calculating the values in two tables, aggregating, etc in a later, “gold” model.  This takes the organising and simplifying of models from within a single model/step, to a process.\n\n——-\n\n   /*\n      Model header and configuration \n    */\n\n    // bring in referenced models and sources\n\n    WITH orders AS \n    (\n         SELECT * FROM source_orders \n    ),\n    customers AS\n    (\n        SELECT * FROM source_customers\n    )\n\n    // transform table\n\n    transform_orders AS \n    (\n        SELECT \n            col1 AS col1_rename,\n            col2 AS cast(col2 AS string),\n            .....\n        FROM src_orders\n    ),\n    transform_customers AS\n    (\n        SELECT customer_id\n                      ,UPPER(customer_name) AS customer_name\n        FROM src_customers\n    ),\n\n    cust_orders AS\n    (\n        SELECT *\n         FROM. transform_customers AS c\n             LEFT JOIN transform_orders AS o\n                 ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n\n    )\n\n    // select result\n    SELECT * FROM cust_orders",

There are plenty of rich learning opportunities with Fabric. Yes, it has paper cuts. Yes, sometimes picking the right tool feels like deciding whether to eat your meal with a grapefruit spoon, a butter knife, or a plastic spork. But I am learning and growing, no regrets at all in that regard. I'm writing PySpark every week (with lots of help from ChatGPT Plus 😅) and learning more about delta tables than I ever wanted to.\n\nAnd if I wasn't a massive, massive Microsoft shill, I'm confident that after this project is done I could hard pivot my career to Databricks if I wanted to. Snowflake slightly less so. So, I can't give you a neutral opinion, but I'm happy to answer any questions.",

What is real DE? Fabric is as popular as a fart in a spacesuit in this sub, but it is data engineering. The technologies you mention, Python, SQL, pipelines etc are all transferable to other \"real\" platforms. There are a lot of opportunities just now with people migrating from Power BI and Synapse to Fabric, so it could also be a good career move financially.\n\nAnd with AI, the ability to write pipelines and code in Databricks or Fabric (or anything else) isn't going to matter so much. I'd concentrate on really getting to understand your data and building relationships with your user base, translating requirements into actual deliverables. That's what's going to add value to your career rather than being able to use tool X, Y or Z.\n\nEdit: typos",

And the retrieval side. Spark or SQL have no built in functions to do anything with the image data directly, so it will always be a two step process to do something with the images after retrieving with an sql or spark statement. For example ocr the content of an image. You retrieve the image data from iceberg and then need some eg Python code to load it into an image object and then use libraries to ocr the image. Same process if you would store the URL to the image in the db, step 1 retrieve the url step 2 load the image and ocr with Python.\n\nI would think the performance and infrastructure compute would be more favorable with images in blob storage. You just need a much smaller spark cluster to process the iceberg files and faster retrieval of the URL and image due to much less data volumes to process.",

As you mentioned schema changes are common, but relatively easy to detect. Most often I experienced renaming of columns, which manifests as a missing column in your expected schema and a new column at the same time. The pipeline cannot resolve this issue and will most likely fail if the missing column is used in transformations. You can detect schema changes with DBT-tests with dbt-expectations package or you can use great expectations package or dlt (data load tool) when using Python. Those tools also allow for detecting other type of problems, e.g. for categorical fields additional values that are not expected. You can also define simple tests or expectations that a column shouldn’t have NULL values, or fields need to be of a specific types and and and …\n\nAnything you can envision will happen eventually. And most often it requires human intervention to be fixed because most likely you need to talk to other people to either fix it at the source or you need to adjust the data pipeline to handle the new case. Your time is best spend in investing in detection and observability so you can spot the reason for the failure quickly.\n\nOne way to minimize your disruption (and this is used in more mature organisations) is to create data contracts with your source system owners. In this document you describe what tables are you pulling, schema information, frequency, expected values, date time boundaries …. Then you can create a test data set that you can use to test your data pipeline when you make changes.",

Downstream of all of this, of course, when processing the load of cleansed data to production systems, the many pitfalls you might run in to there and need to report alongside the original raw picture of data to clients and internally. My favorite is a client we have who has a massive hierarchy for their enterprise that is sent to us via web services so that we can marry it up to our hierarchy for them in our system, all sent as this massive multi megabyte json beast. Most of the issues with them are mapping them to the right corresponding place within the hierarchy, and it’s a lot of reporting what isn’t set up by our enterprise so we can successfully consume the data at a later date. After corrections, we automatically reprocess raw data for these clients for just the failures.\n\nI often run in to structural or data quality issues that I need to gracefully handle.",

Move data through them with ETL (or ELT).\n\n-I had to model my data using the Kimble method for my curated version (dimensions and facts). It definitely helps with Power BI reporting. There are lots of resources for this online.\n\n- Consider how your API works. When you call it, what does it give you back? Is it a full data set, or do you pass it a date and it just gives you back a smaller set of data? Which columns in that API call do you need and which are definitely not useful to your business (don't get rid of them in raw in case the business wants them in future, but think about if they are needed in cleansed). I was able to use watermarks to record when the pipeline last ran. I can pass that watermark to my API so it only gives me the data that has been inserted or updated  since then. That's handy because you process a much smaller data set.\n\n-Think about what happens if your pipeline fails at each stage. Draw it out on paper if you have to, think about why parts could fail and how you would fix them or deal with the next pipeline run.\n\n- Spend some time thinking how your pipeline will handle deleted data. If someone deleted a record from November in your CRM, how does it need to be handled in your reporting? Does the business still expect to see it in the reporting or are they happy it should be removed. I use MERGE to handle these in SparkSQL.\n\n- How often does the business want your pipeline to run, and at what time?",

The salary I'm on at the moment is good, I get that but I'm mid 30s, I probably have 30 years left in work, it makes sense to consider what my future look like. When I think about progression there's a lot of stress and long hours that come for positions of more seniority as a DBA. Depending on the company, as a Head of/ Manager you can almost always be on call if that makes sense and I'm not sure the value is really there for me.\n\nI should clarify there are no plans to immediately transition, I'm on a good salary, it's remote and there's low demand, but when I think of 30+ years of working, I need to consider my options. I realise if I looked to move tomorrow I'd need to take a pay cut. I was thinking I'd be looking somewhere between £50-£65k though I think with my role changing I should be able to do a bit more of a hybrid role for a couple of years.",

As a DBA a call might look like an emergency call at 3 am that a critical server / db was down. In a worst case situation you might work 24 hours straight to bring systems back online and still would need to be back in the office on time the next day. As a DE, depending on industry itnis much more common to get a pipeline failure alert and deal with itnfirst thing in the morning. Fixing a production pipeline is alsonalmost always easier than something like an emergency server migration / DR rebuild. \n\nThe actual easiest way to make the switch is find a hybrid role as a DBA. Find a role whwre you have to do both jobs. Half 6our day is spent doing the normal DBA tasks. Other half is sepnt writing pipelines, architecting solutions, database design, ci/cd, etc. Then look for a role that is almost exclusively DE work. \n\nThat said you will still be used and leveraged as a DBA in a pinch because very few pure DE's have enough SQL / server knowledge to help out at the same level you can.",

        "body": "I didnt actively intend to make the switch until I was pretty far along down the path. Biggest driver is DE comes with higher pay than being a DBA. In my current role I still wear both hats fairly regurlarly. In fact I was hired more for my DBA skills than my DE skills.\n\nThat said I found all the following skills very helpful in making the switch. \n\n1. Expert level Powershell knowledge. This comes in handy both on prem and in thr cloud if you regurlarly work with Microsoft stacks. If not Bash would be more useful. \n\n2. Intermediate Python skills. I learned python after powershell and the knowledge transfers easily between them. Somethings when you know both get hard just from do pythonism or powershellism in the other language. In Python focus on learning the common DE packages like pandas, polars, SqlAlchemy, pyodbc, requests these will get used constantly when writing pipelines for rest api endpoints. Dont worry too much about getting into the weeds with oop as most pipelines are not written that way. \n\n3. If you want to go one step further learn Pyspark which is hugely useful in cloud pipelines  and datalakes. Azure data factory, Databricks, etc is just spark underneath the sheets. \n\n4. As a DBA for 10 years before making the switch. I was very familiar with On Prem / runnung SQL on VMs. A big switch for me was learning PaaS offerings like snowflake, databricks, Azure SQL, Azure data factory. So spending time learning the basics on these helped. I got lucky and was dealing with vendors / clients using these services so got paid to learn on thr job as it were. \n\n5. Many older DBAs still have yet to embrace source control. If you are in this boat learn source control, ci/cd, and managing databases as code. If you get these under you belt it will make life better as a DBA and a DE. \n\n6. Communication skills. I have to communicate with non technical and business staff more frequently as a DE than as a pure DBA. As a DBA we are kept locked up and kept away from business / non technical / dats analyst types. We are a bit like wizards who only send ravens when you have really fucked up. Being a DE is more meetings and requirement gathering.",

What should you actually start with?\n\nHere’s the order I recommend (I use this path for mentees transitioning from non-tech backgrounds):\n\n1. SQL basics → intermediate → analytical SQL\n2. Python for data tasks (Pandas, scripting, file handling)\n3. Cloud fundamentals (Azure AZ-900 is a good starter)\n4. Data engineering concepts (batch vs streaming, data lakes, warehousing)\n5. Spark (Databricks or Azure Synapse)\n6. Then consider DP-700.\n\nBy the time you reach DP-700, you will understand why you are learning each topic instead of memorizing answers.\n\n4. Other certifications worth considering\n\n* AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals): great starting point\n* DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals): perfect for beginners\n* Later: DP-203 : this is the most recognized DE certification on Azure\n\nYour background isn’t a limitation. Your willingness to learn is your biggest advantage.\n\nIf you take it step by step instead of trying to \"jump to the end\", the transition becomes not just possible, but achievable.\n\nYou have already taken the most important step: asking the right questions!",

The ability to think critically and problem-solve remains paramount. Good luck.",

        "body": "tl;dr: I wouldnt necessarily advice to use Snowflake as operational database. As an analytical database, it might help you if the analysts are experiencing timeouts and/or slow queries  \n\n\nDepends on how much data you have. Are analysts experiencing problems when they run queries on MySQL? And if they are, are you sure this is a problem related to the amount of data or could it be due to a bad-indexed db or small ec2 instance used to query?\n\nBy design, Snowflake is not made to be an operational database. There is a new table format called Interactive Table, which according to the documentation is basically the way you would use Snowflake for transactional data (low-latency + high concurrency). It is, however, also written that you get best performance by querying that table with a Interactive Warehouse, which - and here's the catch - is by default ON all the time (which will sky-rocket your costs)\n\nIf the analysts are experiencing slow queries, then replicating databases in Snowflake will definitely (most likely) help. In this case, I would leave the MySQL database as your operational database and replicate them in Snowflake, where analysts would only query from there (given that they are ok with some delay in the data compared to the data in MySQL). You'll spend a bit less with the AWS instances used to query data, but I'm pretty sure your Snowflake bill will more than compensate that decrease.\n\nBtw, I move data from MySQL to Snowflake doing exactly that: lambda -> s3 -> Snowflake (using Tasks) + PowerBI. Very quick to get it up and running (with a first load done with DMS), but given that lambda is not really made for this kind of task (there's a 15min hard timeout in the lambda), I'm on the process of moving that into fargate.",

We look at internships by far the most, followed by cs degree and gpa (less than a 3.0 is out usually). There are wayyyyyyyy too many cs majors to bother looking at resumes that don't have a technical degree. \n\nThe irony here is that once I am interviewing someone, I often do take a look at them if they make it past a tech screen. But this doesn't mean the projects themselves are the differentiator.  I have never seen a project unique enough to make up for anything significant in thousands of resumes.  With AI I think this muddies the waters even more. Anything interesting has an even bigger asterisk.  People are just not trustworthy when their livelihood is at stake. \n\nThis is an industry that is fiercely devoted to the idea that seemingly very few devs can code at all and has loved to crow about how their applicants can't pass fizzbuzz for decades now.

They get copied because we may not want to modify the original argument, so it saves us a line of copying, separates areas of concern, and it's a bit faster.\n\n2. We **can** pass large values (complex structs, arrays, etc...) as function arguments. But they will be copied. That can be a lot of copying, especially if we can't anticipate the size of arguments `my_func(int arg[12])` vs `my_func(int arg[9999])`. \n\n3. Since function arguments get copied, and large copies are expensive, it's cheaper and faster to pass the address (pointer) of the data as a function argument.\n\n1. Very low level programming can involve jumping forward and backward to memory addresses. We can do math on the pointer itself to get to different addresses. You may never do this yourself, but pointers gives us access to this capability.\n\nWhy are you experiencing this in C++ when C++ is supposed to be modern? Because C++ was designed to be compatible with C and the preexisting C libraries. C was designed like this because it was one of the first successful abstractions above assembly and written in an era when compute, storage, and memory was very expensive (cost and compute cycles).\n\nEdit: I mostly mentioned functions + pointers and not pointers in general, but my goal is to justify the utility of pointers and mentioning their benefits with functions is good enough.",

If you need to load a picture into memory, you don't know where in memory that picture is going to end up, so it isn't given an address until it is made.  The pointer stores where that memory is after it is allocated.\n\nThe next question as to why this is a thing where it isn't in other languages is because C++ is code that is running much closer to the processor than in other languages.  Other languages abstract away this issue for you, but in environments where C++ is commonly used, such as 3D engines, operating system kernels, or embedded devices like arduino, we can't trust any other tooling to handle this efficiently enough for us, we need direct control.  And using pointers to manage memory allocation and passing around information is how it all works under the hood.\n\nBeyond that, pointers are also the mechanism that your program uses to point to functions in other programs such as system API's, etc.",

One of the best pieces of advice I got from my first manager was something along the lines of “I don’t care about dev. We have it for a reason and no one depends on that data. Go break it. That’s how you find out how it’s working and how you find issues. We can always redeploy dev “. And that changed my learning perspective. Instead of feeling like I need to understand the docs cover to cover, I now feel empowered to take a look at the architecture and app dependencies and then just go fuck with it. \n\nFor example, the past 3 years I’ve worked almost exclusively with serverless architecture in AWS using python. But I just joined a new team and we are shifting the application to EKS using a Java library. No fucking clue but I spend the last 2 days reviewing architecture, in the console, and googling/gpt every step of the way when I run into something I don’t know.

Mindlessly asking AI to generate code for you teaches you nothing. But using AI to explain documentation, recommend improvements, provide examples, and break down code can be immensely valuable. There's nothing wrong with asking AI to clarify and teach. That's exactly what a professor does; to accommodate curriculum reading.\n\nWhat I'll do when trying to pick a new project I'd like to do and ask it something like this: \"I'd like to make an app or program that does xyz. What stack would you recommend and why?\" It'll spit back a bunch of recommendations. Then I'll pull up Google and read a bit about them and pick one. Then I'll pop open the documentation and ask the AI: \"Let's start from the beginning. How do I render zyx? Or how do I get a basic function abc working?\" Then I might ask it to explain the code and reference the documentation. I'll sometimes ask it for a list of the most common functions from the API and what they do, etc... but once AI helps me get the ball rolling I gradually transition to doing things myself. Once I understand the code the AI generated I'll apply it myself. This approach can take awhile but has gotten pretty functional at learning new skills. While I'm doing all this I'm also checking documentation and taking notes. \n\nAI is like a tool box but you shouldn't drop the toolbox off at the job site and trust it to build everything itself.

On the other hand, I know a guy who is a mediocre employee in general, never really put any effort into their work, and he got a senior role much faster than others, as he kept apply frequently until he got one, and he did land one eventually.\n\nProbably the people I know who advanced to high roles fast were the ones that were very persistent in some sense, looking for opportunities every moment until they got a desirable offer, and being in dynamic environments.

You really just pick one thing and stick to it. You mentioned you've \"technically\" done DSA, so doing Leetcode seems like a pretty obvious next move. From there, you can literally start with any problem. If you want, start from 1 and move your way up. It really doesn't matter.  For a more directed interview prep, go to the \"Study Plan\" in the left side menu and pick \"Top Interview 150,\" or any other plan under \"**Cracking Coding Interview.\"** There really couldn't be any clearer signs to guide you. There's nothing scary about it, my dude/dudette, just spend some time familiarizing yourself with your resources, that's all there is to it.\n\n>Right now, I genuinely need guidance. I know I need to do hackathons and internships, but I don’t know how to get there or what steps I should take. Someone please tell me how.\n\nYou need to stop looking for hand-held guidance like this. Hackathons and Internships are both things you do through your university (usually, as in, they can provide guidance). You get there by asking your university staff. Schedule a 15 or 30-minute session with an advisor or career counselor, and they'll give you a place to start, but the rest is all you. Ultimately, you'll need to start finding your own way around being an adult, though.",

At this point I consider it to be absolutely stupid to introduce CS to students with IDE's.   To much basic material gets glossed over that often results in  students not understanding what is happening underneath.\n2. Frankly this applies to trying to write any software as a GUI application, there is too much to learn to be distracted by GUI's.\n3. So what we need to do is to get back to basics.\n4. This means building software with command line tools and maybe a simple GUI text editor.   \n5. I'd suggest following a CS program that uses C++.   You already supposedly have some CS under your belt but I'm really wondering if you learned anything.   But the point here is that as each point is explored in class you just write code that leverages that technique in as many ways as possible.   The usual first program is to write your name to the screen, often followed by simple looping.  Explore looping for hours then continue with every other concept discussed in the program.   the idea is to totally understand the ins and outs of every concept and be able to use with muscle memory.   \n6. Then start writing simple command line programs that solve things you understand well.   Try to tie in these programs with hobby's or other thigns you know well.   The point is you understand the the technology so you know what is right and you know the end result you want to see.   An example would be writing a program that takes resistor band colors and returns the actually resistance value.    Another example would be to display your favorite Chili receipt on screen.   The idea is to start out dirt simple and grow from there.\n7. Once you fell comfortable building command line programs from abstract requirements then start building  GUI apps.   At this point you will  likely want to shift away from C++ to a common platform programming language.   For example on Apples systems that would be Swift.   In some ways you will be starting over as Hello World is a common first GUI program.   You will also need to become familiar with more advanced data structures and methods.\n8. Once you get past the introductory step you need to start crafting your own apps while you follow a platform specific program.   Again the idea here is to take something you understand well, a hobby or something other and create programs that solve a problem within that domain.    You can even start over with a receipt program but this time one that stores multiple receipts and allows more interaction.   The idea is to get more and more complex.   As you learn more and more you will realize just how bad the first receipt program was and can refactor it as much as possible.   You really should have several programs under various states of construction.",

And when you finish the freecodecamp build mini projects on your own. There are mini projects on github how to build with JS and its frameworks. \n\nAnd then build a good CV or update if you have one. Also linkedin. \n\nAnd when you finish or land a job upskill all the time. I recommend hyperskill or TheOdinProject. I am currently going with TheOdinProject.

The answer is to build projects and start small. \n\nLook, there's no way to just leap from tutorials to building complex software in one bound. \n\nSo, start small. First, choose a project with a tight scope, like a Todo app with user accounts. \n\nThen, get a Trello account and start writing out individual tasks. You want to make these tasks super simple at first. One might be \"create a webpage with Ultimate Todo List as the title.\" Your next task might be \"Create a CSS Page and make sure it's linked to the webpage.\" Then do the same with JavaScript.\n\nIf you run into something you don't know how to do, make a card for learning how to do it. You do not need or want to fully master new technologies at this stage. You want to learn the bare minimum to incorporate it into your project.\n\nIf you get stuck, try to look up the specific thing you want to do. For example, if you're trying to make a checkbox the user can click, look up that specific thing. If you're unsure how to store your list of items, look that up, but not until you're working on that task.\n\nAnd then you just keep going. Try to complete one or two cards per day. This is almost exactly how professional software is built, btw. Only we break the cards into batches we can complete in two weeks and call it a sprint. \n\nRemember, the cards aren't complete features, they are small tasks. \n\nIf you know Git (and you should) make a repo for your project and get in the habit of making a branch for each card. Once you complete a card, merge your branch into main and start the process again. Your Main branch should always be a working app with whatever features you've added so far. \n\nStart small, complete one or two small tasks every day, rinse, repeat.\n\nIt's not just a way, it's the only way. Software is built one small step at a time.",

There were staffing issues that postponed the course but the communication throughout was terrible and we were often times left in the dark. I have heard similar stories about other online bootcamps here in the UK but someone else might have a more positive experience with them. \n\nIn hindsight I should’ve paid for the more expensive courses that included in person classes/exams as I think there would be more structure. Either that or should’ve gone with something more well known (Lewagon for example).

I was signed up to NuCamp's newsletter and got an email that my city was offering a retraining scholarship, which meant I'd only have to pay $600 for 7 months of classes. Hard to pass that up.\n\nI did NuCamp from September 2024 to March 2025. It's designed to be a part-time program that you can do while you have a full-time job, but I'm not sure how realistic that is. I quit my job and went all in when we started React. Before the BootCamp, I was in tutorial hell, having done Free Code Camp, Harvard CS50, Odin Project, YouTube, and Udemy classes. I'll say that even with all that prep, the BootCamp was a firehose of information, and by the end of it, I was exhausted. I liked the classes. Most of the teachers I had were good. The Jobs class they offered was total trash IMO, but that could have been because of the teacher, who felt more like a social media influencer. That class did force me to finish my portfolio website, so it wasn't all bad. Their Discord is actively shouting out jobs.  \n  \nI ended up taking a few more months after class to wrap my head around React and get better at JavaScript by building projects and doing CodeWars. Over a year after starting, I'm now studying Front End Dev questions I pulled from GreatFrontEnd and dabbling with LeetCode, which has been incredibly frustrating. At best, I've probably got another six months of practice and projects before I'd be hireable, but realistically, I'm thinking I've got another year. I'm an artist, so this stuff comes slowly to me. Since you're already doing analytics, I'm guessing it will be faster for you.\n\nIf you do the BootCamp, my advice is to do personal projects with people in your cohort. That was probably the MOST beneficial part of the BootCamp. Looking at my group's code and trying to make everything work together really forced me to understand it and broke me out of tutorial hell.\n\nAnother tip I'd give is to grab a BootCamp class off of Udemy when it's discounted and work your way through it to see how you do. Just make sure you're doing your own personal project after every tutorial project.\n\nHope this is helpful. Good luck!",

That maps well to how real systems break.\n\nThat said, Rust is not the only way to get there. If you ever feel like you’re spending more time appeasing the compiler than reasoning about the problem, stepping sideways into something like Go or even plain C for a bit can help. Different languages surface the same fundamentals from different angles. There’s value in contrast.\n\nThe biggest trap to avoid is “exploration creep.” Pick problems that are almost boring. A tiny file indexer. A toy key value store. A CLI that parses input, mutates state, and fails in predictable ways. Stop the moment it works. Do not add features. The learning comes from finishing and reflecting, not from polishing.\n\nYou’re already thinking about this the right way.

If it's just one tiny feature, it probably makes more sense to use a good existing library.\n\nSecond, what are the costs of using an external component? Let's say I need a matrix multiply function. Adding a dependency on a huge linear algebra package like BLAS or numpy might increase the size of the build, add a new license to check, and just overall add a lot of complexity to the project. If the only thing I need it for is to multiply some small matrices and performance doesn't matter, I might implement it myself and use another library to verify that my implementation is correct.\n\nLast, is this something that needs to change/update frequently or is it stable? If it's parsing a data file that's internal to my project and not user-generated, then that code might not ever need to change. Writing some custom code to parse it might be fine because it's not likely to break. On the other hand if it's parsing user-generated PDFs, a third-party library probably keeps getting new bug fixes and improvements over time, so it's probably way better to use a library.",

Sometimes management wanted a summary of the table, and it may need to sum, average, or count the number of times a certain value (or range) appeared in a column.\n\nSome cells also needed to provide a link, multiple links, or color-code text in some way.

Oh, yeah, and it needed to have a one-click download CSV export of the data in-browser (so, it couldn't re-send the data to the server to generate a file).\n\nWrote one, it worked great, used it for about 8+ years and it got copied to several of our different systems. \n\nEventually one of the juniors asked why we were using my library, and not some npm library he found that did \"the same thing but better\".

Performance suffers when developers clog the Main Thread with heavy tasks (like parsing JSON) instead of offloading them to Background Threads, causing UI stutters. Finally, optimized apps use Local Caching to show content instantly, whereas laggy apps force the UI to wait for the network and re-render everything from scratch, draining both battery and data. I usually see a big difference between a native application and a Cross-platform, and even more so I see how poorly WebView works.",

But academics depend on existing curricula because it is very hard to develop new lessons and lab projects, so MIPS examples will continue for many years to come.\n\nARM is quite popular with processors available from many different vendors. Upcoming is RISC-V and 64bit ARM (also available from Microchip). Old 8bit standbys are PIC and AtmelAVR that can be important depending on your notion of \"embedded\" (not every toaster and microwave is running Linux-ARMs yet),. There are also 16bit processors that are optimized for motor controllers if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nOnce you get the hang of any one of those then the others follow pretty easily so look at the market you hope to enter. Anything with wifi or ethernet will probably want ARM or newer. Motors will be the 16bit DSP engines or specialized ARM devices (often slightly more than the typical assembly instruction set). Light bulbs and toasters and hand-held appliances will probably continue with 8bit which is easily mastered.\n\nThe important point is having something to practice on until you are comfortable with how it works. There are a number of [Curiosity Nano boards from Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/evaluation-boards/curiosity-nano) that can give a flavor of most of these for not a lot of $$ so its reasonable to have different versions.",

It is a good career and exposes you to a lot of variables with respect to electronics.   However you will not do a lot of custom electronics, it is largely programming of controllers, panel design and the like.   So it is sort of high level embedded programming.\n\nThat said Assembly Language skills and understanding can be a big pay off for most programmers.   Obviously for embedded this is daily use while for other programmers it helps them understand how software works.  Back in my day the first exposure to assembly language in the class room was via a VAX emulator running on a SUN platform.   Learning VAX assembly would be useless these days.   Instead I'd take a two prong approach, learn PIC and ARM assembly.    Embedded ARM is a big player these days and PIC is still extremely useful in small embedded devices.   More importantly they are drastically different architectures.",

        "body": "“Assembly language” isn’t a generic thing. It’s a way to write machine code with mnemonics rather than just heaps of hex or octal numbers. The mnemonics and their meanings are entirely dependent on the machine instruction sets of the target processor. So, if you know PDP-11 assembler language, you don’t really know ARM-64 or x86 or MIPS or whatever. \n\nIf you find an embedded job, you’ll be using the processor your employer chose. If you start a company to make an embedded project, you’ll choose the processor. So your core skill will be getting your coding process up and running quickly on whatever instruction set.\n\nIf your time is worth anything, you’ll hammer out most of the embedded code in C. Both GCC and LLVM have really good facilities for turning C code into astonishingly well optimized machine code for your processor of choice. It can prolly generate smaller and faster code than 99.9% of programmers ever will be able to. I’ve worked with a couple of the 0.1%, those folks are amazing. But they still use a lot of C.\n\nAssembly comes into its own for small chunks of an application that are time- or power- critical. And often the assembly code is embedded in some sort of pragma directive inside .c source code files.\n\nThere’s still a lot to learn by programming machine instructions directly. Learning how registers, stack pointers, program counters, and other machine concepts work is helpful. You may as well do it for whatever machine you have readily at hand. \n\nC compilers generally have options that make them generate “listings” with the generated machine instructions displayed. That, combined with the instruction architecture document for your processor, will teach you a lot. \n\nEspecially, compare the generated code with optimization turned off (-g) and on (-O).",

        "body": "You have to understand some programming history to understand why C and C++ exist.\n\nLets roll back the clock to 1990 or so.  Personal computers are just starting to become practical.  For $3000 in todays money you can get a home desktop computer about as powerful as a super Nintendo is (286 or 386 PC running windows 3.1)  At the time this is considered cutting edge, way faster than those atari and apple 2 computers people are using before.  You can get real work done with these!\n\nYour options for programming languages really boil down to something like assembler, BASIC, or C / C++.  Lets compare each.\n\n\\- Anyone programming in 1980 to 1990 or so to do real work was likely using assembler.  This is as close as you can get to actual processor instructions.  Read value from memory address one into register 1, read value into memory address 2, compare the values with binary math, if they are equal then JMP to subroutine that outputs string from memory address 3, etc.  This is literal processor instructions - it doesn't get any more raw and fast than that.\n\n\\- You could learn BASIC, but BASIC is an interpreted language.  Rather than the code being compiled into processor instructions BASIC is a program itself that reads the program you are running and figures out what it should be doing in real time.  This makes it about 10 times slower.  But good god, is it easier to write a program in BASIC than Assembler - you can just define an array, you can just write a function, you can just define subroutines that take actual arguments - its so much more clean.  If you can write your program in BASIC it will be much easier to maintain and simpler to comprehend - but its going to run soooo much slower.  In a world where making a FPS like wolfenstein 3D work stretches the limit of what is possible on the hardware, a 10x speed loss is just too much when your program relies on speed.\n\n\\- Then comes C and C++.  The idea behind these languages is that you can write your code kind of like interpreted languages instead of assembler - defining functions, data structures, complicated mathematical algorithms - but instead of the computer interpreting the program in real time, it can convert it all to bytecode - basically the same thing as assembler - and run it almost as fast as an assembler program as a result.  C/C++ is written like a processor actually acts.  But as nice as this is, there are still significant shortcomings.  Dynamic memory allocation which is something that just happens like magic in an interpreted language, is not automatic in C++ - stuff like creating an array, creating a variable length string, or defining a variable, or converting one variable type to another - this is not actually provided in C, you have to manage it on your own.  Which you most defiantly can - and doing so is easier than doing so in assembler.  So now you have all the advantages of assembler and the complexity is significantly reduced.\n\nBut its not 1990 anymore, its 35 years later.  Computers are hundreds if not thousands of times faster, have multiple cores, usually have 32,000 MB of RAM instead of like, 4 MB, etc.  There is enough extra speed in a computer that you don't really need that extreme optimization anymore.  And the way computers operate with all this extra resources have also changed - with multi core systems you can have some of the cores or the GPU handling the graphics pipeline in your program, which is like 95% of the processing time - and this is all handled outside of the program you are actually writing.\n\nThere are also many, many more languages that more elegantly handle the problem of ease of development balanced against speed.  Most modern languages, like javascript or python, act like interpreted languages in that they are flexible and just run, but under the hood they still compile to bytecode for speed - the performance loss of using them vs C++ is not as much as it used to be.  Modern Javascript in particular is \\*\\*king FAST, thanks to google throwing millions and millions of dollars into optimizing chrome. The way the async cycle in javascript works is far more flexible than what C/C++ offers, and in general all the features in C/C++ are now available in newer languages, and usually they do it better.\n\nFinally, you should consider that your programs don't need the extra speed and complexity that comes with C++ because all the heavy lifting in your program will not actually be done by the program you are writing.  The graphics are done by the GPU.  If you want a video or mp3 encoder or something, you bring in someone else's tool into your program as a library (probably written in C++) and invoke it and get the results.  Programming in 2025 is more about gluing premade tools together and orchestrating them, and your code is the orchestration layer.  It is much more beneficial for this layer to be simpler and easier to comprehend and manage and leaving the dirty details to other tools.  You will always be on hardware that is hundreds of times faster than you need for this purpose.",

Thus, the code that calls the function with the pointer is also responsible for telling us how big it is.

The int here is only 32 bits or 4 bytes.\n\n> So both *scores and &testScores[0] are float* numbers? \n\nWell... your pointer is always just a memory location.  It's how you talk about it that makes it float.  So here `scores` is a pointer when it gets to the function. We've told our program the type referenced by that pointer is float.  To be clear, it could be a single float at the memory location or thousands.  Once you pass that pointer, the actual size gets lost.  As, hopefully, seen in that trace above.",

Key terms in bold.\n\n    float arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};\n\nThe **name/symbol** `arr` **aliases** the **address** (assigned by the compiler) of some **storage** (allocated somewhere at compilation time or runtime) that has a specified **value** (or values in the case of arrays) of a certain **type**. A **pointer** type is a type that stores addresses as values (pedants: yes, I've read the standard and this is good enough here). Example with address annotations in parens:\n\n    float a(0x01) = 0.1f; // addr 0x01 (alias a) contains value 0.1f.\n    float *b(0x05) = &a = 0x01; // addr 0x05 (alias b) contains value 0x01 (a's addr).\n\nName/symbol, address, storage, type, and value, are distinct things. Names mean we don't have to write addresses (though you can, and do in embedded). Storage for a single object (not in the OOP sense, object = datum here) can of course be larger than a single address. Value is what is in that region of memory when read at a given time. Books can be written here (E.g. *Modern C*, Gustedt), this isn't supposed to be exhaustive.\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. It's the address of the first byte of the first element in the array.\n2. Those are expressions that yield results of pointer type. Dereference and addressof operators can be thought of as inverses, yes. The reason you can write a function that takes a pointer and then pass an array is because of the language semantics, no doubt influenced by what is happening on the hardware. When passing by value in C++, the values of the arguments are copied into the target function's stack frame (usually, compilers are clever and will elide things). How do we efficiently copy an array here? We don't. We say that arrays \"decay\" to pointers in this scenario, and we copy a smaller fixed-size pointer value instead (fits in a register, nice!). Referencing the above, we've copied the (base) address of the storage of the array into the storage for the function parameter. We have a pointer value that we can dereference and/or do pointer arithmetic on. **Whereas the original name/symbol (arr) aliased the address of the first element directly, the parameter stores that same address as a value. In this situation, the language doesn't force us to explicitly take the address using an expression and then pass it, it effectively does it for us.**\n\nHopefully that makes sense. I do recommend both K&R C and Modern C if you want to go beyond this summary. I simplified and left things out.",

I've been trying to study the patterns like sliding window and two pointer and can usually identify when to use them.\n\nFor this kind of stuff, then for me it's essential to have a well-illustrated example, in order to really understand. For example, you used the term \"sliding window\", which gave my brain a vague inkling of what you're talking about, but not yet enough to have a \"picture\" in my mind of what you're really trying to solve.\n\nThen I used Google and found this Answer which is illustrated beautifully: [What is Sliding Window Algorithm? Examples? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples)\n\nAnyway, as the Answerer points out, calling it a \"sliding window algorithm\" is really a misnomer; it is a useful technique, though.\n\nSo, how does one get better at using this technique? Well, you've got to practice it, of course. The example shown in that Q&A is a pretty good starter problem (find the maximum sum of n consecutive numbers); you can adapt that to almost anything (e.g. find the lowest average of n consecutive numbers, find a particular small sequence within a large stream of numbers, etc.).\n\nFor this example, I'd see the \"sliding window\" approach as an optimization of the brute force approach. That is, solve it first with the \"brute force\" approach (which will still be 'efficient' in computational terms, but will be a factor of n slower than necessary), and then solve it again with a sliding window approach.\n\nSolving a problem twice may sound lame or may sound like unneeded extra work, but in a situation like this will be satisfying because first, you'll be able to measure exactly how much faster the better approach is, and second, you'll have a \"testing client\" against which you can test your 'better' approach. For something like this, it's usually easier to make  a mistake in the implementation of the more clever approach, so a handy testing method is to make a testing driver that solves your problems using both approaches.\n\n(I.e. the test driver tests some sample testing inputs against the 'dumb' solution way, as well as against the 'clever' solution way) and then stops if two clients give different results (which indicates that ONE of the approaches must be wrong for that particular input). Usually you'll end up with a bug or two in the 'clever' way, but by systematically comparing with the 'dumb' way, you can normally lay such bugs to rest in a fairly straightforward way (debugging will still be work to do it, of course, but it will never feel like you're totally stuck, because you'll have the alternate version to compare against).\n\n>I've seen many people say they took courses or they learned it in college, but I just cannot afford an expensive course let alone going to college. Does anyone have some advice?\n\nRobert Sedgewick et al's course on Algorithms is available free of charge on Coursera, the last time I checked (for auditing it); it's a pretty good course. You'll need the textbook to do the course properly, but I suppose you can find a low-cost edition, use a library, etc. if you cannot afford to buy that book.",

I would recommend making a USB drive with a Linux installation you can boot to if you don't already have Linux installed (Puppy Linux, MX Linux, and Slax are all good choices for this - a Linux distribution you can use from a keydrive and save your changes and files), or have a virtual system with Linux installed on it, or if you're really determined, install Linux on a partition, which can be a bit difficult to do. Another option could be to buy a Raspberry Pi, which is Linux-based, and play with that for many of your tasks.\n\nYou can get books on Linux that will teach you plenty about how the operating system functions:\n\n\"The Linux Programming Interface\" by Kichael Kerrisk is viewed by many as a definitive encyclopedia for understanding how Linux works. You'll learn about making system calls, OS library functions, and the relationship between applications and the kernel in detail. You'll come away from that book with a whole new appreciation as to how OSes work.\n\n\"How Linux Works\" by Brian Ward. It really covers the glue that holds the OS together, covering the boot process, how the kernel manages hardware, and how networking and devices actually function under the hood.\n\n\"Modern Operating Systems\" by Andrew Tanenbaum is also a great book. It's not exclusively about Linux, but it will teach you the fundamental theory of OSes, such as process management, memory, and file systems that Linux is built on.\n\nKeep in mind that you don't **need** to really understand your operating system before you can start learning a programming language. Most programming languages these days run on all operating systems (with a few exceptions). Pick the language you want to learn, and there's a very good chance it will run on whatever operating system you already have installed on your computer, and will abstract away the differences between operating systems, which is one of the main functions of a programming language: that way, programs are portable, and can be run on any operating system.",

Then, like everything capitalism touches, they went to shit. People are using them to stuff their CV, burning everything that made them fun in the past. With the \"AI\" hype it became worse, because now not only will everyone try to sell their shitty, useless CRUD SPA as the next big thing in SaaS, no, now the shitty, useless CRUD SPA is just a paper thin wrapper around some unprofitables joke of a companies API.\n\nYeah! Hackathooooon!\n\nI interviewed a lot of people who had one hackathon after another on their resume. Most of them turned out to be duds.

        "body": "Is the newest thing also stable and reliable? Older thing can have its issues worked out and fixed. Perhaps only some very obscure corner cases are still generating Github issues. But other than that, the thing is stable and \"it just works\". Whereas the newest thing can have multiple open issues.\n\nIs the newest thing actually maintained? Recently I had to make a technical analysis for a new microservice and had to come up with an architecture proposal for it. I considered different alternatives. There was a library A and a library B. Library A had been around for many years. Sure, it had a lot of bloat and stuff, but it worked. Library B also seemed to work. Less bloat. Promising. BUT the maintainer/developer/owner of that library had abandoned that project. For 2 years there had been no commits. Github issues were abandoned. Yes, that B was newer than A but it was abandoned. Whereas A was older, did have more bloat, but was in active maintenance. Recent commits to update versions. Recent commits to fix vulnerabilities. etc.\n\nIs the newest thing that you should consider in the current geopolitical world? Let's say you are a developer in the US. Will you use a library made in China, in Russia, or in Iran? By itself the library can be newer and perhaps also better. BUT the decision makers can start making decisions where they tell the developers to make the library close sourced and you won't have any overview of the changes. Decision makers can introduce kill switches or backdoors. Or, the developers will collect data and send it to their data brokers. And then that data will be used in a competitive manner. One of the many reasons why one should think twice if he should use Deepseek AI, for example. Technically very promising LLM model. Also, it introduced many changes to other LLMs in the world. But, it follows the political agenda of China. It is not neutral.\n\nDoes the newest thing have enough documentation? Older stuff can have massive documentation compiled by many developers over years. A new thing can have close to no documentation and you have to be one of the pioneers creating that documentation on the go.\n\nHow is the new thing fitting in the existing infrastructure? Perhaps it does not even work? Yes, stuff often is meant to be backwards compatible, but not always it is the case. For example Spring Boot 2.x vs Spring Boot 3.x and different libraries. Some newer libraries expect you to use also newer Spring Boot version. Also newer Java version. You can't just throw the newest library in the code and hope that stuff works.\n\nDo you have resources (time, budget) to make upgrades to support the newest tools and the newest versions?\n\nHow will you balance constant upgrades with adding new functionality and maintaining the project as a whole? A new library version can come out every month, for example. Will you concentrate on version upgrades over working what the client actually cares about? It is difficult to \"sell\" version upgrades to a client. You have to prove that it is needed. Yes, Dependabot is a thing but some time will still go into reviewing its MRs and doing smoke testing to ensure that untestable stuff (for whichever reason) works.\n\nWith you updating stuff, will you break something that external service providers are using? You can't expect them to update their stuff because you are doing constant upgrades.",

        "body": "Ok, gotcha. You are right in saying that Next (and other Frontend Frameworks, like Nuxt) have a small Backend integrated in it. It's not like a full scale backend infrastructure, but for smaller web apps this is often enough, because most times all they need is a way to hide some stuff, like API keys, from the client, make a hand full of database queries and calculate a few things here and there. It's called a 'Backend for Frontend', because all it does is usually all you need as a Frontend Dev. \n\nIf you plan to only learn Javascript as a proper programming language, Node.js is a popular choice for backend development, if it gets more complicated than that. That's totally doable. For many things, expecially small to medium scale solo dev projects, you can totally get away with just JS, yes.\n\nAt some point this no longer scales very well, but you can always cross that bridge when you get there and notice JS is limiting you. You can't build a 'Facebook' scale Project on just JS.. But Facebook started with just PHP,  because that's what they knew how to write.\n\nBottom line is - yes you can build useful stuff with just JS. Sure.\nVSCode the IDE you are statistically likely using - is entirely written in JS.",

        "body": "There are several reasons to use microservices:\n\n1. The biggest reason is to avoid coordination between teams. Each team can ship the services they own independently of other teams, which allows them to iterate faster and respond more quickly to issues.\n2. Security isolation. Isolating functionality reduces the blast radius if a component is compromised. If a monolith is compromised, then the attackers potentially have full access to everything.\n3. Reliability isolation. Similar to security isolation, reliability isolation means there is a smaller blast radius when a component fails. Following from #1, devops will also be easier when your teams only need to understand the components they own and deploy instead of needing to understand the whole monolith during on-call incidents.\n4. Scaling mismatches. Monoliths that contain multiple functional paradigms (for example both async batch processes and synchronous requests) can be very difficult to scale, performance tune, and cost tune. It is easier to scale and performance/cost tune systems when functional paradigms are isolated into separate services.\n5. Licensing/distribution issues. This one is probably the rarest in this list, but sometimes you need to isolate components due to billing/licensing/other business agreement purposes. Especially for per-cpu licenses, which kind of overlaps with #4.\n\nIf you don't need anything in 1-5, then a monolith is probably fine.",

Unfortunately, I've seen diminishingly few video lecture series that are organized in this way (i.e. none). Sometimes, video lectures on platforms like Coursera have a limited amount of this kind of organization, e.g. \"pause the video and try to work out the solution\" type of stuff, but usually the problems presented in that kind of video situation are very simple \"fill in the blank\" or \"answer a conceptual question\" variety.\n\nTLDR: Get a textbook.",

You can't tackle any larger project, can't work together with others, etc. without understanding how a small part of a problem solved with code contributes towards solving a larger problem.\n\nIn practical terms when you get a DSA exercises if I were you I'd just invest a little more time into planning, before doing the actual coding.\n\n- If it's more of a linear problem (you can tell if the problem reads like a sequential recipe) you can add markers or paragraph breaks where you think sub-problems start and end\n\n- if the problem description is more \"wild\" and all over the place instead of just trying to pull the problem apart through line breaks it's probably better if you create a list which on level 1 contains milestones and on level 2 contains the actual sub-tasks.

Use proper variable names, var0 tells me nothing. Same with folder1. \n\n\n2. Use less comments. \n\n\n3. Split your code into functions, this together with proper variable names makes your code easier to understand and will lessen the need for commenting everything. Make sure to use the local keyword on variables to limit the the scope of your variables to that function. \n\n\n4. Use \"#!/usr/bin/env bash\" instead of \"#! /bin/bash\" as this is considered best practice as it makes fewer assumptions about the underlying system. \n\n\n5. I'd prefer you created the Bookmarked and Originals folder after the colour definition, but this is just my preference as I'd expect definitions to come before commands. \n\n\n\n\n6. Implement error handling and have the script clean up after itself if something fails. \n\n\n7. Avoid shadowing your variables by naming a variable the same in nested code, see file. \n\n\n8. Less nesting, use function calls. \n\n\nAnd that's all I've time for. ",

I mainly picked it up after getting frustrated with how quickly inline AI suggestions fall apart once a change touches more than a couple files \n\nSo far it’s been helpful in a really practical way. When I’m doing refactors or cleanup I’ve been putting off sweep seems to have a better grasp of how the project fits together instead of just guessing line by line\n\nI still review everything it does, but it’s made those “ this is going to be annoying” tasks a lot easier to start and finish. It’s kind of become a nice middle ground between doing everything manually and hoping autocomplete magically understands the whole codebase\n\nPyCharm definitely feels like a lot at first, but once the codebase grows, the inspections and refactoring tools start to make sense and honestly in my opinion it pairs really nicely with sweep",

Sometimes when doing the second part, you realize that the first part must be re-written. If you have a software engineer around, ask them to write a plan aka blueprint for you. It is the most important document to keep you motivated and focused on the right parts at all times.",

We just get a little better at it.\n\n\n\nWhen I start dreaming up a new project, I start with a \"sell sheet\". I write open-source code and make it public, so my \"sell sheet\" is the \"readme\" file for a github repository. (If you're not yet familiar with github repositories, it's worth your trouble to spend some time doing that. [Read this](https://github.com/trending).\n\nMy sell sheet tells the reader:\n\n1. What is this project?\n1. Who is it for?\n1. What does it do for those people it's for?\n1. Why should they use it?\n1. How do they get it?\n1. How do they get started using it?\n1. How do they find out more?\n\nI write this stuff down, super rough, for myself, as I dream up the project. \n\nI'm writing it as if the project is finished.  Writing the sell sheet that way takes some imagination about the completed project.  \n\nBy the way, contracts for megabucks for software development look something like this sell sheet. \n\nI suggest you try writing a sell sheet for your project. It's a structured way to guide your imagination into figuring it out.\n\nOnce you know pretty clearly what you want to do, figuring out how to do it becomes much much easier.\n\nYou got this. Do good work!",

Developers in the west in general are obsessed with code quality to the point where it clashes with business outcomes. As long as the functionality works as expected and performance/stability is decent that’s all anyone on the business side of things and the customers care about. Code quality only matters to devs really. Let me reiterate functional testing is important to everyone, but code quality only matters to devs. A lot devs in India (and other off shore locations) aren’t paid enough to care about code quality but they do as a matter of pride care about the functional output being correct - the part their management and customers will see. Ironically this matches exactly with what the business and customers want. Why deal with a bunch of “overpaid” people complain about the need to refactor and take care of tech debt all the time perceived to be moving slowly and being difficult to manage when you can get others who will accept less pay and just do what you want them to do.",

        "body": "This is going to be a copy paste of a reply that I gave to a similar question. It’s my honest experience. No at least where I am, it’s not just a small companies thing. Here it goes:\n\nI can offer my perspective as a junior. Got a job a year before graduation.\n\nTLDR: It’s still possible to make it, but you need a degree *with* internships. If you want to guarantee yourself a job, it’s going to be *hard* work, unless you’re a genius. I’m not a genius. Caveat that I’m Canadian, the market might be better or worse where you are.\n\nMore details to give you an idea: \nI left my previous stem degree in 2022 when I realized that it wasn’t likely to yield a stable job. I started the CS degree in 2022. I’d programmed a bit before, always liked math and it seemed like a field with a bright future. I jumped in. \n\nThings turned sour for my cohort very quickly. By late 2022, many internships were rescinded, postings on universities’ coop programs dropped dramatically, the layoffs *started*. I was pretty dismayed by this to be honest, I’d left a degree that I loved in large part for improved job prospects and now there was a very real chance that it had been a poor decision. \n\nMy family and I are really not rich (lower middle class at best) so I didn’t have much a choice, I wasn’t sure what else I could do either so I decided to work *hard*. I got perfect grades, I worked on eyebrow raising side projects, I TAed a math heavy class (thanks to my previous background in my other degree), I prepped for interviews. Got my first internship in my first year of the CS degree. Had to move to a different city temporarily for it. I didn’t quite like the particular field that it was in but it was really important for my CV, I finished it and got a good review. Didn’t want to stay in the city I moved to, so I decided to find another internship. \n\nKept doing all of the above mentioned extracurriculars and still kept my grades very high. Meanwhile, things kept deteriorating for most of my cohort, the “best” students got internships, the majority did not. Keep in mind that I’m in coop so internships are *mandatory*.\n\nPrepped harder for interviews. Got a bigger company for the second one. If my first internship taught me anything it’s that if you want to be kept on after in this job market, you better be really good. I hit the ground running at this one, lost track of the hours I put into upskilling for it. I also took classes to not put off my graduation date. By the end of the 4 months, I was shipping year end deliverables. They were pretty happy and kept me on. Salary is about 80-90k TC. Quite good for a new grad in Canada. It’s been a huge relief and I’m immensely grateful for it.\n\nEnd all be all, success story in adverse job market conditions, but I want to be honest with you. I haven’t had a life for the past 2 and a half years or so. It’s literally all been school and working on side projects and interview prep and TAing. Now it’s working and still going to school. My relationship blew up and I haven’t been able to date because I just don’t have time, I don’t see my friends often. My own family that I live with doesn’t even talk to me often because I’m always in my room working one way or the other, they’re understanding and supportive though.\n\nI don’t want to complain at all because this is a thousand times preferable to being poor, but I want to highlight that this is what it takes to *guarantee* yourself a job now. You have to be the best of the best, whatever best means to the job market. Most of my cohort has not gotten internships and quite a few universities are working out deals with students: decreasing the number of internships, loosening the requirements of what classes to take when, actively involving themselves in our search. The situation has continued to devolve, at the entry level, things are not improving but actively getting worse.",

Even if problems seem similar it may show up with a different constraint and you the solution you'd normally do for that problem might no longer be effective or even feasible. Basically you get an increased scope of knowledge on top of the hindsight of knowing what approaches works well in a situation of multiple approaches being \"correct\".\n\nIn the example you gave the big thing is scope. You can design and architect a website or microservice but also remember generally thats an extremely small scope and more than likely is a solved problem. Like anyone could go on some system design prep site and know how to design and architect twitter or facebook or some trading site. Where the seniority in that comes in is knowing why you may want to take some approaches vs others based on needs because you've had prior experience making such calls. Often time what you think in your head or what works on paper doesn't play out the same in reality and there tends to be a lot of edge cases that are missed.\n\nWhat makes the big n experience so valuable is because you get exposed to a unique scale problem. Because they work around stuff so big they get to see the extreme edge cases a little more frequently even if theyll never directly work on it but just that visibility is so valuable especially to similar sized companies. But you can turn around and see big n employees might not do well at a smaller company because the breadth of tools they need to know how to use might be something they never even have had to touch or think about previously. Or that scale isnt the big issue and theres another type of problem that needs to be solved.\n\nLike if you can crank out a business/ecom site effectively without much help or guidance (this includes truly understanding the business reasons behind what your developing) you are probably a senior at a non tech non super huge scaled company. But you wont be a senior at a company where scale matters and vice versa.\n\nYou could be a senior level expert at CUDA programming and then be junior at cloud stuff. Thats why again id put senority to yoe/overall exposer and it changes depending on the scope.",

I guess what annoyed me most was how persistent he was with multiple calls out of the blue and twice ghosted me after taking an interview.

Harden your alerts, metrics, and your tests and you will *reduce* the chances of an outage. In my experience I've categorized outages as unforced errors and just being unlucky.\n\nWas the system down because of an unforced error? Lead a technical review on it. Why did it get to that point? How? How can you prevent it from happening again and how can you apply this to OTHER cases in the future? Reduce unforced errors to 0.\n\nUnfortunately. there will be times that you will need to put out fires. That's part of the job. For example, [Log4Shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) was a week ruiner for many. AWS, Azure, etc. outages have caused fires at work.\n\nAlso fwiw if you're not really needed in these meetings, you can really just go to the concert and attend chats through your phone if you want.",

As a junior engineer, you can't decide this, but you can get the conversation going. \"Hey, what happens if...?\"\n\nSecond, if there is no such procedure in place, then - all things being equal - I'm probably going to the concert. If it's one I could stand to miss, then maybe I'm making an offer: Cover the cost of my tickets plus something for the trouble. Something like that. But me helping you above and beyond the normal agreement is a favor, and sometimes I'm not in a position to grant you that favor. Boundaries are important.\n\nHowever, I'm also going to try to be accommodating within reason. In a situation like that, I'd offer to check in when I get back from the concert. If the issue's still ongoing, then perhaps some responsibility could be handed off to me so that others can get a break. This is probably really helpful as a junior, because while you might not be the best help for the initial incident, there can often be follow-up work that is less intensive. Like someone needs to run a database query every five minutes and make sure A stays less than B, until we can get the alert automation in place. And if I'm on the primary crew and I've been at it for six hours and a junior comes in at midnight and says, \"How can I help?\" you bet I'll hand that over and get some sleep.\n\nFinally, there's also the issue of Emergency Theatre. Do we really need all hands on deck? Or do we need the appearance that we're busting our butts to get it working again? There's not much you can do about this in the moment except recognize it and deal with it later. Figure out why this is the case. There's usually some failure in the management chain - some mid-level director with more power than sense, who has to be appeased. Or maybe a high-profile customer. Recognizing this and knowing it is very important as you navigate office politics in the future.",

Lacking focus in the sense that \"SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science\" are all \\*very\\* different types of roles. SWE alone is an enormously broad field, and employers want people who can progressively become subject matter experts in some narrow-ish complex area, not someone who's just superficially mehhh about everything.

This ties back to the comment about broadness, there's a lot of software in a lot of places that you wouldn't think to look.

You had a job for life and a nice pension for retirement.\n\nIn 1981 a new CEO came in. He cut any non profit part of the company. Every department was expect to fire the bottom 15%, no matter how they did compared to others. I think he removed the pensions, but not sure on this one. GE’s stock price soared.\n\nJack Welsh’s tenure at GE was the catalyst that set corporations to become what they are today. Also a CEO’s job is to increase share price.

LLMs are a constant advancing threat to our jobs, and if that's not what ends up taking my next one, it'll just end up in India. If I do somehow find security, it will be in a job that I don't find nearly as fun anymore in a post-LLM world. And this isn't even getting into the headache that they have introduced into the job hunting process itself. I can't decide which future feels scarier, the one where the AI data center bubble pops or the one where it doesn't. I know LLMs aren't the silver bullet they're being marketed as but I don't think that matters much until the bloodythirsty C-suite ghouls stop drinking the kool-aid. To me it feels like the better outcome is for the bubble to pop but that could mean half a decade of a job market that will make 2025 feel like 2021. It all has me giving serious thought to a complete career pivot into a field with a stronger human element that provides better protection from LLMs.\n\nIn summary, yeah, this environment is completely overwhelming",

Either you know what the impact is, or you don't. It is ok to ballpark and \"saved X dev hours\" is a type of claim I've seen many times.\n\nFor some things, we call them \"zero-to-one\" initiatives, where the impact of completion/rollout of the feature is self-explanatory (e.g. \"there was no two factor auth, now there is\")\n\nThe real catch is that metrics solely for STAR format's sake won't necessarily look good, and it's a backwards way of thinking about things. E.g. \"saved dev hours\" sure, but to what end? Do they actually deliver more features or does the time end up being spent on other ancillary tasks w/ same overall velocity anyways?\n\nMetrics are supposed to provide finality to an overarching story that has actual metrics, so that the narrative sounds coherent rather than an aimless rambling. Just tacking on whatever metric to the end of a project doesn't necessarily make for a compelling STAR format story, just like adding sprinkles to the top of a poop cake doesn't make it a nice cake.",

If you are at a company where the SW team comes up with their own work then part of that is justifying why it's important to do.  More times than not metrics are likely to fall out of that.  \n\nAll of my 15 YOE has been at R&D companies working on greenfield medical device projects, think dialysis machines.  It was very top down management style where you do as you are told at the product level. SWEs have control of code level design, but not really the direction of the product\n\nSo asking me to justify why did I implement X major feature over 1 year is on the level of asking why did you put as gas and break pedal in a car or why is there an infotainment system in the car.  It's there because it's expected to be there if you want people to use your product.\n\nSo asking me to put in metrics on my resume is pretty hard since we are implementing things on the project for the first tome and not iterating and improving something.  Why did we need some feature comes down to the product owner saying this is what is needed based on conversations with X/Y/Z important person at the end of the day.\n\nThere is obviously all shades of grey between the two extremes I gave as examples.  Frankly I have no actual metrics on my resume.  My bullets are along the lines of:  I accomplished \\[X\\], that provides \\[Y\\] value, by doing \\[Z\\].  It works ok enough to get some visibility, but I don't have companies banging down my door to get me to interview or anything like that.",

You have transportation, structure, utilities, water resources as some big sections. Utilities, and water resources tend to be the most stable as they have long contracts and steady work.  Plus they can and will do work for other sections. Transportation is boom or bust. If the local DOT slows down or shuts down work they are in a bad spot and harder to cross train. Structure is very heavy tide to construction so boom or bust. \n\nYou see sections in cs like that as well but we can and do jump industries fairly easily so it is much more wild. I am in my 4th industry in my career and most likely not my last. Every time I changed jobs I change the  industry I am working for.  My wife is on her 4th employer but same base industry the entire time in civil engineering (water resources). Mine has been iOS most of my career but I have worked for 4 very different industries. \n\nIt is different work. Don’t chase the paycheck. Chase the type of work you enjoy. I enjoy software engineering and mobile engineering. That being said if I was not getting paid to do it I don’t code and gladly would hang up my software engineering if I didn’t need money. I enjoy it but I get paid for it as well.",

For example, looking at latency of virus scanning for images. However, the cutoff is much more \"is this too slow at the scale we expect to matter\" instead of \"is this the absolute best option\". Also, we don't have free reign to choose whatever stack we want. There are languages that our developers are familiar with, ones for which we have tooling (e.g. Terraform modules), and for which we can easily collect metrics. I got in a bit of trouble for using Python for a cloud function script because it wasn't an \"approved language\". IMO, you can absolutely build something that would scale to 100m daily users in Python or Ruby (not that I would want to), as the language matters much less than the architecture and actual implementation. I think there is this idea that you need to use C or Rust to get the \"absolute best performance\", and that is probably true on a micro scale, but on a macro scale, you can just use a native extension and get the same performance boost without actually writing low-level code.",

I know life at that company suck and people will ghost you, but there are many people who WILL bend over backwards to help you figure these things out given you’ve done some digging yourself and can ask informed questions.\n\nIn my experience pretty much all feature work at all levels is going to have to consider business logic and deployments to a service that runs on compute, extend or create DAOs that write to databases, add routing rules for new APIs to an LB, and update front ends — the foundation for an application; lambdas and queues and ddb streams are all very common patterns too. That alone is a really good place to start researching trade offs, which is something you can do very intentionally while building, or even by looking through low severity system issues during oncalls. If you’re on the hook for LLDs, there’s even more room to dig into trade offs and alternatives.",

It usually doesn’t make a difference  in hiring decisions and the pay is not much more if there is any difference at all. Just doesn’t make sense from an ROI perspective. The applicants that I interviewed with a Masters in CS, usually had a BS from a non-US university and then got a Masters in the US to allow them entry to the country, and then did a F1-H1B visa conversion. So if you’re outside the US and want to work in the US, getting a masters degree can be an easier way to get into the country (compared to other methods). However the ROI just isn’t there from a straight degree perspective.",

Networking is crucial; reconnect with former colleagues, attend meetups, or join online communities to hear about opportunities and get referrals.

That's a little tongue in cheek, but it's worth having some perspective: people that work mining coal a mile underground don't do it for fun, don't study coal mining as a hobby, and don't participate in miner meetups. We all need to keep some perspective on how lucky we are that there's even a question there.\n\nIn that vein:\n\n> I enjoyed going to the office, using my split keyboard, having triple monitor setup, cool desk decorations\n\nI don't mean this to be discouraging at all: but you need to get more out of things than that. Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying better tools and environment - but careers are long and tweaking your setup isn't going to keep you motivated beyond the next few months, let alone decades.\n\nBut all that said - you aren't entirely wrong. This is both a job and a career, and if you're not learning stuff or getting growth opportunities then that isn't good. You won't always have interesting things to build, but if you never get that then you're going to stagnate and that's where people run into trouble finding new jobs.\n\nYou should be able to work with your manager to identify some growth areas and find some tickets where you can learn something. That's a perfectly reasonable expectation. But the key is to focus on what you can learn and what new skills you can build: it being \"exciting\" doesn't really enter into it.",

You should relax!\").  **If you're ambitious, never listen to anyone who tells you to relax.**  Take that as their own personality or goals being incongruent with yours and shed their advice like dust off your shoulder.\n\n\\- Then took a few grad school IT (\"MIS\") and Statistics courses\n\n\\- Moved to SF Bay.  The combo of Digital Marketing, SQL & R / Statistics knowledge from grad school classes helped me land a data integration job in a marketing company\n\n\\- Was tough to break into 100% Software Engineering w/o some real programming projects and a portfolio, so I created a prototype full stack app.  **(I lived in a tent** while working at cafes/libraries; **on a rural ranch** while doing **landscaping part time for rent**; and **later, in mexico after camping on a California beach became too tough** due to people waking me up for trespassing)-- my Dad's advice of \"How much do you want it?\" echoing in my mind when I'd need to encourage myself.  As well as motivational music, and motivational speeches, regularly playing in my headphones while building the app for about 6 months-- 2-3 months of that involved just learning, 3-4 months was knowledgeably building or trial/error building)\n\n\\- Two weeks later, landed remote job doing full stack clojure (programming language)\n\n\\- 2 months later, hired as a digital marketing / data engineering consultant\n\nAfter that last job, it was all down hill-- had recruiters regularly contacting me.  Applied to jobs and landed interviews decently easily.  Worked a variety of contract & salaried full stack jobs.  Even got into a DevOps job by continuing to learn new skills at work and in free time.\n\nThen the industry took a big shit in 2022-2023 due to a confluence of: AI, H1B, Tax law changes, Covid money running out.\n\nI got laid off.  Now about to build my own ecommerce project.",

That work needs to run somewhere, so that's an excuse for building a home lab.  Having a home lab also opens up other wishes, like a Plex media server or backup solution for the family's computers, etc.\n\nIf I'm building a home lab and building/running all these services, it only makes sense to build it all with IaC and keep track of everything with Git, just like I'd do in a professional setting.  Maybe I won't PR myself and yolo it all right into main, but otherwise I'm building things out for my home with the same tools, tech, and patterns I use professionally.\n\nBecause of this I'm very often doing \"POC\" work for my job on my own home lab first.  *That's* where I built my skills first for example, in building and running k8s clusters and all the downstream details that brings for how I structure my code to run on k8s, how do I handle CI/CD cleanly to deploy, etc.\n\nWhen it comes to actual software, I'm coding a lot of family management apps to help track kid chores, keep our finances in order, etc.  I'm also coding on robotics and drone projects, including some with/for my kids to run their Lego robot creations.

Then I'd be able to explain what HTTP/websocket/graphql/rest requests and routing you'd make (ie i'd have a get /users, a post /users/signin, post users/register, get /data, post /data), be able to explain authorization vs authentication and how'd you'd implement JWTs in all of this, what kind of database you'd use and why. Then some basic devops implementation choices, ie ec2 server with nginx, api gateway with lambdas, how you'd handle scaling.\n\nI think system design is really just knowing about what the available tools are, and why you'd make one choice over another and the drawbacks and benefits of them. Using react or just plain javascript or nextjs, SQL vs NoSQL, lambdas vs EC2, ECS vs Kubernetes, client side rendering vs server side rendering (ie maybe you dont want server side rendering with immediately important information like financial data or medical data, but otherwise you'd want it especially publicly facing applications).",

And looks like you’re doing that already. \n\n\nWith my job and what worked for me was asking my team leader if there were any areas where he felt I was lacking or could improve. The company had fortnightly 1 on 1 with me and my team leader so I could have regular private conversations and ask about my performance. \n\nFor “stepping up” for that getting ahead in your own time management is good, if I was running short on work and would have nothing to do soon, I would shoot an email to my team leader giving him an update on my progress, that I should be finished soon and ask if there’s anything specific that he wants me to work on next. \n\nAnother good thing to do is shared knowledge. This isn’t something everyone can do in the first year. In my job we recently started trying out a new tool to help speed up debugging part of the software we use, because I had less work I had more time to allocate to learning the specifics and how to set up quickly and link it up. Because of this when senior team members had the time to sit down and go over it, I was able to “train” them on the new tool and pass on everything I learned to speed up their onboarding on the tool. \n\nJust because a team member is senior to you does not mean you can’t help them. Also they won’t know everything. If a senior is asking questions about what will and won’t work, sometimes it’s good to jump in and ask/offer to test the question for them. “I don’t know but I can try and find out for you” has been a great response to many situations at my job.",

If you need to use a car, the resulting depreciation of the car is a business expense that needs to be paid out of business earnings, or again you are stiffing yourself on wages.\n\nThe figure you get from that calculation will look large.

So on the face of it, I do not think the PhD granting department being math vs CS is a big deal.\n\nHowever, yeah, some of your red flags are red flags. The repayment thing is brutal, attrition in PhD programs is very high and you don't want that hanging over your head. Why isn't it funded with TA or RA positions like a typical STEM PhD? You don't have to pay back your tuition waiver from those. Internships not being allowed is horrible if you're pursuing an industry role.\n\nRegarding your potential PI being new, do they have tenure yet? The last thing you need is your advisor going up for tenure and not getting it, and at least if you're in the US, that's a very real risk these days. I have a few friends from grad school who went the academic route and will be up for tenure soon, and despite playing their cards well, they're all very worried about this.\n\nSo math vs CS, no real worries, but imo you are right to have reservations.",

Internships, connections, and ML conference papers are how people get jobs at those labs. Without putting in extra work, and potentially a lot of extra work, you won't have any of those three. \n\nPersonally, I'd do it only if I were at peace with the full range of potential post-PhD outcomes. That includes not just the best case where you end up at an industry lab, but also worse cases including rejoining industry at basically the same level you are now (albeit with a PhD, or after mastering out) or being a postdoc. \n\nIf what you'd work on during your PhD isn't so compelling to you to the extent that it doesn't matter where you end up after you're done, I wouldn't do it. I did my PhD at Stanford and I saw so many bright and talented people strike out on the industry research job market only to settle for \"worse\" jobs, including as data scientists or postdocs. \n\nThat said, you don't have to view the next application cycle as your last chance, as I've seen many people start a PhD in their 30s or 40s or even later.

Then after that is really the beginning of the more \"cool\" stuff like operating systems, cryptography, robotics, databases, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, computer graphics, compilers, algorithms, etc.\n\n>If programming makes sense, which language suits a math student who’s learning for understanding, not employability?\n\nPython (due to amount of resources online)\n\n>I want to keep learning mathematics \n\nIf you have never taken Number Theory, I recommend the Intro to Number Theory book by Mathew Crawford from AoPS. I did that when I was in elementary school and it's a phenomenal book. And like all AoPS books, challenging.\n\nFor Discrete Math, it's Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, Kenneth Rosen.\n\nThose are the more \"CS\" sided part of math. Math majors of course would be: Calculus 1, 2, 3 -> Linear Algebra + Diff Eq -> Real Analysis 1/2 + Modern Algebra 1/2 -> Topology/etc",

I worked professionally for six years. \n\nI started learning C# early on in life because I loved video games and wanted to make them, there were two primary languages you could accomplish that with back then (this was about 20 years ago) C# with the XNA framework, or C++ with a library like SDL. XNA transitioned to monogame, and SDL is now SDL2. I believe Unity was around but it wasn't popular yet, unreal engine existed but the commercial license was expensive. I went with learning C# because I wanted to make games for the Xbox 360 and monogame was free to use, which I did, I launched two games before finding work in the industry doing web development. \n\nThat was my path and it worked well for me.\n\nIn your case, because you have a heavy math background and you're only interested in learning id try LISP or maybe Python. Those are less marketable languages but have heavier focuses on Math.\n\nAny mainstream language to start is a good one though. Game programming is fairly math intensive which you might enjoy but it's very labor intensive and requires a knack for art , if you don't mind trying to make your own graphics and aren't all that concerned about design philosophy then id still recommend C# and monogame. Maybe you could start by building pong and then transitioning to a game like tetris. \n\nGood luck!",

I've experienced some candidates show off flashy projects on their portfolios but don't really know how to present them to hiring managers, and we wouldn't want that. \n\nIt's always good practice to also match it with your target career/industry, e.g. fraud detection for fintech or clinical prediction models for healthcare. I've seen some posts here and there that can be a good starting point to mapping out your next projects based on skills & goals, and can link one to you if that's something you're interested in.",

That only matters if you're talking to an actual engineer, or engineering manager, who knows the difference between \"wrote HelloWorld in Rust\" and \"on the Rust board of directors\". Most HRBPs/recruiters don't know the difference, and speak \"years of accredited education\" and \"years of professional experience\" exclusively, and those are the people deciding whether your application/resume ever lands in the inbox of a manager with an open [req](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453).\n\nBe sure to emphasize the internship and accredited education in your resume first and foremost. The portfolio, or interesting GitHub personal projects, can and should be a footnote below things recruiters/HRBPs are specifically looking for. I'll also add that tinkering alone, by yourself, on a project is not nearly as useful as collaborating with a team on a project. Because in the real world, most engineers work as a part of a team or teams to get stuff done. Consider contributing to well-known open source projects. Understand that step 0 of contributing meaningfully to most open source projects is: You understand what the project is, and who its end users are, on a deep level. That can take anywhere from days/weeks/years depending on the complexity of the project. And \"I was part of SIG release for Kuberenetes 1.31\" is easier for a recruiter/HRBP to grok than \"look at this chatbot I made, isn't it neat\". It's especially easier to grok if that recruiter/HRBP is staring at a req with the word \"Kubernetes\" in 5 different places.\n\nFor extra emphasis; Fix your resume first before you spend time chasing shiny open source projects. Also, the job market just extra sucks right now -- sorry about that. Not much to be done about organizations shy around adding headcount.",

So, transposing to coding, you may need to build the \"muscle memory\" in layers, e.g. first memorize syntax, then memorize specific API signatures, then eventually memorize semantics of the APIs.\n\nSyntax can be learned by just coding a lot and running the code to validate that the syntax is correct. API signatures can be memorized via exercises called Katas (basically do the same thing from memory multiple times) or just using them frequently enough. Semantics start to become easier to memorize once the \"lower\" layers become more second nature.",

But then also I tend to focus on ability to problem solve, take constructive criticism, and ability to work with a team. So I’ll ask questions like;\n\nTell me about a time you were unsure of how to approach a solution. What did you do?\n\nTell me about a time you and a coworker had a disagreement about something, how did you resolve it?\n\nThings like that. First one tells me about your problem solving skills and is an indicator of how recognizing you don’t know what you don’t know. I also ask seniors this except in a way that shows they have the ability to mentor juniors. \n\nThe second one is important because in software there are a million ways to solve one issue. Some better than others, but they’re all a solution regardless. It will let me know how you approach these kinds of situations that come up a lot of times in code reviews and architecting out solutions (no I don’t expect a junior to do this) \n\nBut as a junior, we’re expecting to have to hand hold for a\nGood bit to get you comfortable and get you onboarded.

From my understanding for them the difficult part hasnt been the coding challenges of the dev interviews because they stayed sharp but more like hiring managers look at them as a pm and dont want to interview them for an engineer role. \n\nSo i guess it comes down to maintaining a stream/timeline of projects coding that you can use to say \"see this?

Both fields offer a ton of opportunity, but they lead to different skill sets and roles. For AI/ML, it's true that a PhD can give you an edge for pure research or very advanced roles, but a Master's is increasingly valuable for applied Machine Learning Engineering positions, especially if you can combine it with practical experience. Your current embedded development background is actually a great asset here, as applied ML often benefits from understanding hardware constraints and real-world system integration. An EE degree, on the other hand, would deepen your understanding of the underlying hardware, which is crucial for things like edge AI, robotics, and advanced embedded systems – areas where AI and EE naturally converge. Consider what truly excites you more: developing algorithms and models, or designing the systems and hardware that enable them. Sometimes the best path isn't just about the degree, but how you combine your education with hands-on projects and internships.
