If you do then there's nothing wrong with using them in prod.\n\n\nSome more thoughts: The issue that I usually see in practice is that once you start introducing these things then notebooks' convenience is reduced, so there's a lot of resistance against controls that prevent people from just yeeting something into production.  And once you let people yeet their non-important work, its only a matter of time before people start yeeting important work.",

Its real value is allowing systems to adapt as business meaning changes over time, and that benefit is easy to defer.\n* Tech debt is real, and under delivery pressure the cleanup backlog rarely wins. Even when modeling could be part of the design, timelines usually cut it first.\n* Storing source data indefinitely is becoming common, which makes replaying historical transformations feel like an acceptable substitute for managing change semantics.\n* Data teams are increasingly embedded in business units. Without a central steward, consistency across domains erodes even when the same underlying data is reused.\n* AI increases speed and lowers the cost of repetitive work, which further shifts effort toward shipping and iteration rather than integration rigor.\n* The idea of a single source of truth still matters philosophically, but if leadership doesn’t care when numbers don’t line up exactly, it’s hard to justify enforcing it.\n\nThe common thread is that modern data systems are optimized for reversibility rather than correctness. Cheap compute, infinite retention, replayability, and AI assisted iteration all increase tolerance for semantic drift. Dimensional modeling still addresses that problem, but its value only materializes when the organization is forced to care about consistency over time. \n\nModeling is rejected in favor of these other mechanisms which isn't a better approach but it does align with the systems that are readily available.",

You are right that compute got so cheap and efficient that people can be sloppy about architecture. \n\nBut the benefit still far exceeds the costs. The problem is leadership has a bias for action and expediency. It's hard to explain the proper modeling and architecture will make everything faster and easier down the road. \n\nBut will you get a reward for taking longer to do it correctly or fix what's broken? No. And if you have a great model, you'll never be able to point to problems that never manifested and how much time you saved. To the business it looks like you just took a long time.",

I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.\n\nInsurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.\n\nI was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \\~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.\n\nNot sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024. Morale went from sky-high to the absolute gutter after the layoffs, so a lot of us bounced in the aftermath of that.\n\nOnce you've seen how stressful consulting and other industries can be, then how unerringly *stable* insurance is, it's hard to want to leave.",

But as a general rule, the difference between any individual contributor (IC) role and a senior IC role is the demonstrable ability to basically manage yourself. Identify and execute projects that support company objectives, develop relationships within the business, that sort of thing. \n\nThis is why: the next step from senior is often a lead or manager, so to go from junior to senior, you need to demonstrate capability, then when you’re a senior you’ll be refining your capability and starting to demonstrate that you can apply your skill to leading others, which gets you to the next place.\n\nAnd obviously that varies wildly from company to company 😅",

The maintenance is very important because long term that is where most costs are generated.

Once you know the basics of SQL/Python/basic Data Engineering fundamentals (CDC/Data Governance/OOP/Security/Statistic/DevOps/BI/etc), the questions one can be asked in this industry is so vast that practicing for it may be in vain. Esp in the high pressure screen share environment of difficult questions one might be asked. \n\nThe longer you work at that job the more senior one can become. Avoid working in/applying to industries/for companies that intentionally use older technologies. By that I mean if they list older technologies in their job positing or the company inherently keeps themselves ancient like Intel/IBM/some pharmaceutical companies/some government jobs/etc. \n\nThis approach may not be for everyone but I applied to hundreds, if not thousands of jobs in a year. Which, like reading 20 pages of a book a day, can be the simple consistency of a few jobs a day. And when my current job stopped challenging me enough during the pandemic I joined a start-up to challenge myself further. They just wanted SQL which is an easy requisite and through that process I learned Snowflake, and through that start-up/Snowflake experience I later got another job in Snowflake/GBQ/GCP, and through that job I later got a job in AWS/Databricks.\n\nI never practiced code tests for any job. Many jobs didn’t want me for many reasons outside my control and it still hurt on a deep personal level. Many jobs I didn’t want because the interviewer was rude/the company didn’t seem fun. But for the few jobs that worked out I have seen a bunch of different problems in a bunch of different contexts in a bunch of different languages in a bunch of different industries. Those things, and factors about one’s personality, seem to govern good Senior/Staff level positions.

It’s quite literally about open standards and moving away from “proprietary interfaces” since this unlocks so much (minimizing vendor lock-in is the first high level superficial answer).\n\nAs an example: warehouses bundled storage, compute, and file formats together. That’s where the real lock-in came from. If your data lived inside a proprietary format  (like in Snowflake), you were effectively tied to that engine.\n\nThe thing that’s really changing is the growth of standardized layers. Open table formats like iveberg and delta, arrow (as a shared in-memory format), and newer engines like duckdb and data fusion all point in the same direction. When data is stored in formats multiple engines __can__ read, compute becomes easier to swap and vendors have to compete more on performance than on lock-in.\n\nVendors are still vendors. Nothing about this means tools like Fivetran+dbt are suddenly open source. The idea is that they operate on top of infrastructure that is less restrictive than the old warehouse model - there’s so much to unpack tho in terms of current technological developments and what future data platform will look like. \n\nAll of this to say, I try not to take anything with face value. There’s always nuance. Yes it’s marketing for sure, but if you follow the current states of technology, there’s real nuance here.",

        "body": "Did that move about 3 years ago, can share my 2 cents.\n\nWhy I switched: I realized the parts of DE I enjoyed most were modeling data for analysts, arguing about metrics definitions, and making dashboards actually useful. I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.\n\nDay to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”\n\nStep up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.\n\nBranding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.\n\nGotchas:\nYou will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.\nYou’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.\nIf you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.\n\nWith 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is. If yes, AE is a pretty solid move.",

They almost never parameterize their solutions and any meta data used is typically a json file in the app and locked behind version control.\n\nWhen you are tasked with modeling an enterprise asset, you're forced to figure out ways of genericize your solution to support future initiatives.

In our case we use Cline or Claude Code. \n\nWe have a specific workflow for each type of model that the LLM follows to generate the docs. \nMoreover, we instruct the LLM to produce the same structure of documentation for each type of model.\n\nFor example, curated (mart/gold etc.) models are directed more for the end user and contain sections such as purpose, business use cases, metrics ect. So not too technical. \n\nIntermediate models ,i.e., models used to split up complex transformation logic are documented with the developers as an audience, so they are much more technical and basically explain what we are doing CTE by CTE.\n\nFor most models #Business Logic is a section where we explain the specific business logic/rules implemented. \n\nThe LLM infers these business logic by lopking both at the RAW query and inline comments. Also if it detects a business logic from a query, we instruct it to add short inline comments explaining it. So it goes both ways.\n\nUsing LLM to generate documentation increases the doc coverage in our project and increases the uniformity of documentation structure across all models. \n\nIn turn this documentation is then indeed used to power AI Agents for Data Discovery - think chatting with agents to discover which/where data is stored to answer specific request, so they don't answer the question, they just point the user to where they can probably find their answer. It may be also a documented exposure, not model per se. \nAnd eventually it could also power AI analytics, where they actually access a semantic/metrics layer or directly query the database based on all of the context. \n\n\nSo yes, we document business logic and use LLMs to do so for uniformity and completeness.",

So you better make *really* sure that what you measure is what actually adds value, or what you want people to be focused on.\n\nDoing something around story points is awful, but is one of a small number of equally bad choices.  You can minimize the harm by equalizing story points available across the team, and using discretion to add points (or subtasks) dynamically for things that wind up being more complex than estimated.  It still puts a LOT more pressure (somewhere) on estimating and updating points.  And you will still get people trying to cherry pick tasks with the most ROI (points to level of effort) or pad the points numbers.  Have fun with that!\n\nI would still rather have a performance review from a human who knows all the nuances of what I did and why.

Then they wanted reports to be made on them and didn't have anyone available so did that (Data analyst stuff) Then they needed more and to encorporate that (Back to DE). Its less about job title at a certain point if you find the ebb and flow and can learn tools to do what the business needs. I did that for 2 years before I considered my self good enough to be called a professional and not a junior. Maybe you move faster than that. Also Migrating from an old system to a new system is a part of the cycle. Snowflake and Fabric are current generation cloud tech, so you are getting a free education on how to use them, take advantage of it!\n\nAsk yourself, How would you build this whole system? What does the whole system look like? Data engineering isn't just ETL, its a big part of it but the data modeling and being able to serve the overall system is the important part. Do you understand the whole system?\n\nTimeline to understand when to move is kind of irrelavent. Actually understanding and being able to apply those skills is when you make a move. You don't just set that to arbitrary 6/12/24 month timelines. When you gain the capability and understanding thats when you can think about moving to the next thing. There is always a next thing.\n\n  \nBack when I started there was only MSQL 2000 and Crystal reports or SSRS. Now there are 50 different technologies to do the same with python , Java, or C#. So tools have gotten more sophisticated. Pick a path, learn that path, maybe use claude code/Code assistant of choice to help you build one, then read and understand how its built. Look up tutorials from youtube and compare that to your solution. Read the libraries and documentation that make it work. Then go from there. \n\nBuild a whole program that takes in data to do something useful. Kaggle has a bunch of examples for this.   \n  \nThe only way to get better is to build things.",

FP&A in my experience is awful because you get a bunch of excel jockeys who think that because they can maintain a rats nest of insane excel macros and formulas that they know how to “do data engineering”. \n\nI’m obviously generalizing, but in working in data for almost 10 years, this has been my experience working with several marketing/Finance teams across several companies",

They should know your roadmap/sprint board/whatever, so they don't think you're sitting on your asses and do nothing.  \n\\- If they have recurring issues, create a ticket, let them follow it. Whenever they try to blame, ask them to tell their lead to discuss with your data lead to prioritize it. If your lead declines, they won't annoy you because they know why they don't get it.  \n\\- Block urgent ad-hoc requests. Every request has to be a ticket with a clear description + impact + what happens if they don't have it within the next <time period>. With the last question a lot of urgent things will not be urgent anymore. Most of the time it's just a blocker they want to get rid off asap.   \n\\- Sometimes they actually don't have the data to do their jobs. Can you provide an interim solution by pulling raw data without implementing it into your data model? So they can run simple queries.\n\nKnow your people, try to be seen as an overworked ally who wants to unblock them.

        "body": "I work in Marketing Operations, and I find the challenges I deal with day-to-day are underestimated by management.\n\n1. I often find that I don’t have the data to do what is being asked of me. Most commonly, this happens when there is a campaign where the target audience is brand new. I cannot tell you how many times I find myself caught in email chains with compliance and legal where their segmentation criteria requirements specify data points that the company does not even have and has no way of obtaining in a timely or reasonable way. Many times, I will point this out to my superiors who will just ignore me and leave me to figure it out on my own because they have no idea what to do. This literally happened to me last quarter. 🤪 \n\nI work closely with the team that does operational comms, and it is similarly stressful because they do not always know what list criteria they will need or when. They often deal with Sudoku like puzzles where they have to build lists with pieces of information, from multiple applications and then find a method to validate the results.\n\nEven coordinating sends becomes challenging because of how dynamic the production process is. Multiple rounds of revisions means delayed approval which can push past the expected send date, causing sending conflicts that now have to be sorted out with multiple teams that often believe their message should be priority.\n\n2. Yes. “Everything is a fire.” 🔥 Things break unexpectedly all the time, and we are constantly conducting an orchestra in front of a live audience. Marketing comes to you complaining of “bad” data, but keep in mind that often we are fielding complaints from our stakeholders, triggering the inquiry. (FWIW Typically, I only flag anomalies after multiple observations or complaints. I also do some initial investigating on my end, like reviewing audit and sync error logs to rule out the obvious.)\n\nSuccessfully capturing UTM parameters is kind of like walking a tightrope if you have a bloated tech stack and duplicate records. Yes, collection CAN be the issue, but I’m 15 years into a career as an IC in digital marketing now, and I mostly pull my hair out from poor data practices upstream in the CRM (e.g; users deleting emails and creating a new record, duplicates merged where UTMs aren’t preserved, poor field level security or outdated/inappropriate user permissions, etc.) I’ve had an experience just in the last few years where the internal IT team decided to pull Marketing’s access to the native UTM fields (after 8+ years of having access) because a newer and more senior product hire had this as a requirement. It broke all of the UTM tracking from the website and some other applications, and I had to spend a year arguing with them to get it fixed 🙄\n\nThe practices I see in Salesforce in the last 5 years truly feel like a major regression from the ways that I learned to manage data and technology early on in my career. I worked for leaders that mentored me in [customer driven enterprise architecture](https://blog.opengroup.org/2021/01/28/providing-customer-driven-value-with-a-togaf-based-enterprise-architecture/). It feels like it’s become a foreign concept with what I see now. For example, I have worked for multiple orgs that will spend a good month if not more in between December and January completely caught up in territories, sales compensation and incentives, performance reviews and bonuses, etc. Entire calendars are blocked off and dedicated completely to the sales process and sales experience. I’ve seen how entire companies are stalled as they wait for decisions to be made. \n\nLastly, sometimes we work for people that will use their authority to put pressure on us or our managers to force us to do things we know are stupid. 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️ It’s riskier to say this if you work remotely, but when I worked in person, it’s the kind of thing I absolutely would’ve acknowledged in a whisper 🤫",

It should be the dev owner but it's clear that work is beneath them so they just let the teams figure it out on their own, because we don't have assigned responsibilities and finger pointing people won't bring up problems until they literally blow up. Then we create more tech debt to solve them.",

I'd like to ask a little bit of clarification.\n\nACCOUNT\\_CODE and SERVICE are the two main tables (with several attributes), and they will be kept separate in any model. My two issues are:  \n\\- Where and how to store the attribute account\\_code x service (which has a 1:N relationship): 3NF, Denormalized, Bridge Table, i2b2 model...  \n\\- How to join this information for reporting (e.g. at the SQL level as a table, as a view, or at the reporting level with Tableau Custom SQL or functions)\n\nAll of the models listed have a single pre-joined table other than A.  B connects each account code to the service, but then the aggregation has to be done at the reporting level (in this case, Tableau). I'm sensing that you'd recommend D (denormalized), in which in the service table, there's a column with the grouped account codes (e.g. Service B - 1-3101, 1-3102, 1-3140) and there's a bridge table that connect these groups with the individual account codes. But I'd appreciate if you could detail a bit more.\n\nThanks again!",

So, anybody who is is unlikely to be telling the internet, or even a very popular sub of a relatively niche community, that they are working two jobs.\n\nI'd also say for anybody else reading this post, common questions which have the feel of \"how do I earn more money by doing X\" isn't going to be well explained because you are increasing a lot more competition to your successful way of making money.  Again, I'd expect reluctance but could be wrong.",

        "body": "Couple things from someone who was in a very similar “I like cloud + data but entry level feels impossible” spot:\n\nFirst, your background is actually a plus. Biomedical + CS + interest in AWS is a really solid combo for any company doing healthcare / medtech / clinical analytics. You’re not “just another CS grad” and you should lean into that in your branding.\n\nJob search stuff:\n\nYou’re not going to win by only applying through LinkedIn / Indeed. Use them to find roles, but assume most of your “wins” will come from:\n- Direct company career pages (especially mid‑sized boring‑sounding companies, not just the big names)\n- Alumni network from your undergrad and your MS program\n- Local meetups / online meetups (data engineering, cloud, healthcare analytics)\n\nOn LinkedIn specifically:\nSearch for “data engineer”, filter by Experience → Entry level / Associate, and also try “analytics engineer” and “data analyst” with SQL + Python + cloud. A lot of “data engineer” work is hiding under those titles and is more friendly to juniors.\n\nThen for roles you like:\nCheck who works there as a data engineer / analytics engineer / dev on LinkedIn. Add them with a short note like:\n“Hey, saw you work on X at Y. I’m a biomedical eng + CS grad student getting into data engineering (SQL/Python/AWS, a few personal projects). Would love to ask 2–3 quick questions about how you got started there if you have time.”\nYou’re not asking for a job, you’re asking for info. Some % of those chats naturally turn into referrals.\n\nTargeting-wise, with your background I’d look at:\nHealth tech startups, EHR vendors, medical device companies, hospital systems, insurers, pharma / biotech. They all have messy data and love someone who actually understands the domain.\n\nAlso, consider “bridge” roles:\nData analyst, BI dev, “reporting engineer,” even some backend roles with a data flavor. If they let you work with SQL, warehouses, ETL, and AWS, that’s a path into a pure DE title later. First job title matters less than “I have 1–2 years of real data work on my resume.”\n\nProjects:\nMake 2–3 small but real projects that scream “I can do data engineering” and “I know healthcare”.\nExample: pull some public health dataset, build a basic pipeline:\ningest → clean → store → query → simple dashboard.\nPut it on GitHub, write a 1‑page README that explains the problem, tech stack, and what you did. This is gold in interviews.\n\nIf you want to play with realistic internal‑tool type stuff: spin up a small web UI on top of that data so someone non‑technical could view / edit it. Tools like uibakery / Retool / Appsmith are handy for this, because you can show “I know how to wire APIs + DB + UI together” without spending months learning frontend. That’s closer to what a lot of internal data teams actually do.\n\nMindset part:\nThe “no light at the end of the tunnel” feeling is super normal. Most people don’t talk about the 200 ignored applications, just the 1 offer. If you’re sending out apps into a void with no feedback, shift some of that time into:\n- Reaching out to humans\n- Tightening 1–2 standout projects\n- Practicing SQL + basic data modeling + simple dbt / Airflow patterns so you crush technical screens\n\nYou’re not incapable. The market is just noisy and bad at surfacing juniors. Your combo of domain + CS + cloud interest is good. If you keep iterating on outreach + projects and stay flexible on titles, you’ll get a crack at it.",

If you would not translate the 5 letter SAP column names going to silver and then gold, that would be almost crazy to me. \nWe are mostly not SAP specialists as data engineers, and it would be a much larger chore to have to remember and translate the acronyms every time I want to use a column in any layer.\n\nNow for the Polish to English translation - can you expect this codebase and data system will be maintained by Polish people forever?\nCause if not, the same thing as for SAP applies.\nAfter all it would be far more overhead than for (I suppose) you - a Polish language specialist.  \nIf it's a core service of the state infrastructure, then it may fly to not translate.\n\nAnd from the other perspective - if this wasn't data, but software engineering - if you were integrating with a system that for some reason was written completely in Polish, would you also write yours in Polish to ease debugging?  \nFor me - in 99.99% of cases the answer is no.

So every round going to the Silver, we will perform those translations, same goes with testing and debugging.\n\nSpeaking of the next layers, where data objects are prepared in more 'unified' way (say Invoice, Order, Customer..) 100% that's all in english onwards.\n\nEven on top of SAP tables on previous project - we just learned the tables, as it's so much easier without the extra renaming layer (and I am not a SAP person).\n\nWould this make sense?",

I’m now retired.\n\nMost of their business is in government contracts.  That’s bad from the standpoint that the business would almost certainly fold if they lost those contracts or a large portion of them.  It’s far better if a consulting firm has clients spread across several business sectors.  If you have your business spread roughly evenly across five sectors and there is a downturn in one, two or even three sectors, you could survive as a business.  On the other hand, the federal government is frequently good for business.\n\nHonestly, the IRS cut 31 contracts with Booz Allen less than a week ago.  It was over the leaking of IRS wealthy taxpayer data by a Booz Allen employee.  They still have quite a few contracts, most with the DOD.\n\nIf you do a good job, it be can be an okay place to work.",

If you're in the DMV area internal networking is very important since its easy to get lost in the mass of employees if you have an inattentive CM, this is slightly less of a concern if you're based in a regional office with maybe a couple hundred headcount or have a really good admin group. Pure staff augmentation contracts are fairly rare on the data engineering side, they seem to follow more of a Design & Implementation -> Sustainment & Iterative Development cycle. Staff aug seems more common if you're something like a former intel analyst & moved to the private sector for higher pay.\n\n  \nI've generally enjoyed my time here & its pretty neat when you're working on a project that ties into recent geopolitical news headlines.",

You don't want big batch processes to hit Cosmos directly as they can flood its request capacity and cause issues for other processes. The change feed+function+eventhub is very simple to set up as you're just copying data as-is, it is essentially the minimum amount of reads to get the data, and it spreads the reads evenly over the day. Using capture on the Event Hub means you don't need to worry about retention periods or having some parsing error on the document, you get a full binary copy of everything.\n\nedit: Also if you ever needed limited streaming options, you can have a second reader on the event hub that does stream processing, while still running the normal capture for batch processing.",

Further, you need to refine your data layer to include a layer optimized for data fetches for your specific needs. Something that could be useful would be building an OLAP layer, with is (more or less) just a vectorized representation of your data for rapid dynamic aggregation. Something like the [elasticube](https://pypi.org/project/elasticube/) library. That might be too much for your specific needs, though, so wait until you add that.\n\nIn summary:\n- Get rid of the Lambda fetch in favor of a dedicated API layer that automatically handles authentication\n- Evaluate your database for an analytical layer to support data fetches (add indexes, split into dim/fact, optimize tables/partitions for the most common queries)\n- Look into OLAP cubes for better performance if query lag time is still an issue",

If you have secondary dims like company association/email domain, then make sure data is extracted to another dim table. Then you could just perform analysis using unique keys rather than pii fields and then arbitrarily assign labels to the ids like companyA, participant01798, country12, regionB or whatever the pii granularity you need to analyze but not display might be.\n\nIf you are talking about actually exposing the dataset to parties that are a pii leak risk... then the dim approach would help with cogently mapping people/companies/addresses to nonidentifiable labels that maintain full data integrity and the relationships between samples.",

You say if x then y is safe, but even though your programming language acts like there is nothing between x and y that could happen, in reality the os could give priority to another process/thread, and by the time y runs, x isn't necessarily true. It only takes a clock cycle. \n\nPython made this obvious to everyone because it isn't c fast. There is basically no amount checking you can do that guarantees much of anything is true unless it involves the os helping you.\n\nSo when you boil that down to it's essence it amounts to just skip the if statements and go straight to the try catch logic.\n\nThe principle is called EAFP.",

Then I got hired and went through an onboarding program at work, became a junior developer, then promoted to software developer, etc.\n\nOnly in the last 1-2 years or so did I start coding with the assistance of AI. Furthermore, I just started learning React to learn the front-end of software development.\n\nAI tools like Copilot have dramatically increased my ability to learn AND to catch my own errors faster.\n\nPage not working? I can reason with Claude and say: “Here’s what I’m trying to do on lines 100-115 within this component. I’ve tried x, y, and z but it’s still not loading properly.”\n\nThen Claude will run its magic, offer me several solutions and most importantly explain *why* it gave those answers. Then the lightbulb goes off for me. It’s like having a teacher in my back pocket.\n\nI *could* spend 2 hours trying to solve a problem. But I like the happy medium approach: bang my head against the problem for 15-20 minutes and if I still can’t get past it, then I ask Copilot for help. \n\nIt still gives me a chance to use my brain, yet I don’t spend all my time chasing down useless tutorials and outdated answers from 3 years ago.\n\nThe key to learning with AI isn’t to just get the answer. It’s to understand *why* it’s giving you the answer in the first place. Then the next time you encounter the same problem you know what to do. Or should at least conceptually know how to get past it.",

Students don't ask the teacher to just write the code for them; so why would you ask an LLM to do so?\n\nPart of learning off searching other people's answers is their answer might not be 1:1 with your problem and you may still have to figure out how to apply their solutions/thought processes. It just helps you problem solve all the more.\n\nAnd during the journey of actually searching and learning you're way more likely to discover solid resources for learning, while an LLM will *always* want you coming back to it. All while, of course, it confidently hallucinates and lies to you a good portion of the time (and is plagiarizing other people's effort and work without consent, credit, or compensation 100% of the time).\n\nFinally, what happens when the bubble bursts and your LLM disappears? You're *fucked* and have no clue how to research answers or get anything done because you made yourself reliant on a corporation's tool to think and do the work for you.",

It helped me. \n\n```\nWhen (and only when) the user is asking a technical / software-engineering-related question (coding, debugging, architecture, tooling, infra, performance, data, etc.), follow the Technical Coaching Policy below. For non-technical questions, respond normally.\n\n<TECHNICAL COACHING POLICY>\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE (highest priority)\nMaximise the user’s learning through their own thinking and decisions. Be a force multiplier for skill and clarity—never a replacement for reasoning. Success is defined by the user understanding and being able to do it themselves.\n\nOPERATING MODES (stateful; affects technical questions only)\n- COACH mode (default): You guide and scaffold; you do not deliver full solutions.\n- DIRECT mode: You may answer normally (including complete solutions/code).\n\nMODE SWITCH COMMANDS\n- Switch to DIRECT mode when the user’s most recent message contains: FORCE_ANSWER\n- Switch to COACH mode when the user’s most recent message contains: RESET_COACH\n- If both appear in the same message, the command that appears last (latest position in the message text) wins.\n- Treat these as literal, case-sensitive substrings.\n- When a mode switch happens, do NOT require the user to restate their question. Proceed to answer the same message in the newly selected mode (ignoring the command text as part of the “question”).\n\nSCOPE: WHAT TO COACH VS WHAT TO ANSWER DIRECTLY (in COACH mode)\n- Coaching rules apply to: debugging, implementation, architecture, system design, algorithm choice, performance work, refactors, “why is this failing?”, “how do I build X?”.\n- Direct answers are allowed for pure reference/lookup: syntax, flags, API names, definitions, small factual recall (act like a fast search engine). Optionally add a brief pointer to context only if helpful.\n\nCOACH MODE RULES (default)\n1) Do NOT provide end-to-end solutions.\n   - No complete working code that solves the user’s specific task.\n   - No “recipe” that substitutes for the user’s key reasoning.\n   - No copy-paste “fixed version” of their program.\n\n2) Keep the user driving the process.\n   Prefer questions first, but you may steer (measuredly).\n   - Clarify: goal, constraints, environment, expected vs actual, what they tried, minimal reproduction.\n   - Ask for evidence: exact errors, logs, inputs, versions, failing tests, timing, stack traces.\n   - Help them form and test hypotheses: “If X were true, we’d observe Y—can you check?”\n\n3) Provide high-leverage guidance.\n   - Offer mental models, tradeoffs, and “what to look up” keywords.\n   - Suggest divide-and-conquer debugging: reduce the case, bisect changes, isolate dependencies, add instrumentation, check invariants, write a targeted test, compare known-good vs failing paths.\n   - You may validate/invalidate hypotheses with brief reasoning and a concrete verification step.\n\n4) Code policy (allowed, but cautious)\n   - Small snippets are allowed only as scaffolding: illustrative examples, minimal patterns, function signatures, partial skeletons, pseudocode, TODO holes.\n   - Snippets must not be the full solution to the user’s stated problem.\n   - Escalate snippet specificity only when necessary and only after the user has attempted steps and reported back.\n\n5) Progressive disclosure (escalation)\n   - Start with the minimum effective hint(s) + 1–3 concrete next checks.\n   - If the user returns with results, escalate: more targeted questions, sharper hypotheses, slightly more concrete skeletons—still no full solution in COACH mode.\n\n6) Communication style\n   - Be concise and actionable.\n   - Prefer a short plan + next step(s) + what to report back.\n   - Do not restate these policies unless asked; just operate this way.\n\nDIRECT MODE RULES\n- Answer the user normally and directly, including complete implementations if requested.\n- Still ask clarifying questions if required for correctness.\n- Remain in DIRECT mode until the user sends a message containing RESET_COACH.\n\n\n</TECHNICAL COACHING POLICY>\n```",

There are reasons for this, like the dual update problem, locking, you should know what these are and how to mitigate issues using them. This can also get into doing things asynchronously, networking, sockets, pipes, signals et. al.\n\nYou'll need to learn to use some different ones, relational - SQL, ( sqlite, postgresql, mysql/maria, oracle ) and non-relational ( mogodb, etc. ). You don't need to become a super pro on these, but knowing the basics will certainly help. You can't get away without knowing something, at least SQL at some point, or you will stop being able to do anything. I once had to tell a developer this directly to his face, he learned it and became a superstar almost overnight.\n\nHow will your tool be launched, maintained? You'll also need to know something about how to integrate your tools or apps into the overall system architecture. User launched, launched on boot, launched on application startup. So, some nuts and bolts know how of how to implement that in at least Windows and Linux will serve you well.\n\nBash isn't too bad to learn, but it's hard to master. The whole documentation isn't that much and if you at least thoroughly peruse it, you can know what bash can do and go look up specifics when you need them. Pro Tip : use getopts for argument handling and your scripts will be more powerful than anyone else's and similar to other unix commands) Powershell honestly sucks to learn but once you have some bash down, AI can write most of the Powershell these days and you can just tweak it, which is a lot easier. When you get under the hood in windows, it's a hellscape, so if you don't already know, Windows sucks, but at least it runs now, mostly.\n\nSecurity. How can your tool or app be penetrated? How do you code to stop this?\n\nPayment processing: Can you take payments for transactions or periodic payments for services?\n\nIntegration with service APIs: Can you connect to other things and call services? Stock market data for example? AI Agents? et. al.\n\nWhat happens when something in your app breaks? Does it write to a system log? Does anyone need to do anything if it does break after you are done and gone?\n\nNot a complete list but something to think about.",

Strings, especially from multiple data sources, are prone to human errors like inconsistent capitalization. Use enums and IDs, or at least invariant culture instead. [You may see a bad example code from my prior Reddit post in r/programminghorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/1qqwo6t/this_boss_fight_trigger_code_in_a_video_game/)\n\n\n* Some string generation and normalization methods like .ToLower(), .ToUpper(), and .ToString() give results according to the *user's* Current Culture info, which can be pretty much any language around the world. This can cause inconsistent decimal and date formats; and even break some texts and cause comparison fails in Turkish and Azeri locales, where the usual casing I/i does *not* apply.",

Automation is real, but it only makes sense once you understand the underlying process you are automating.\n\nWhat I would avoid is the pressure to monetize too early. Skills compound quietly.

For instance, to understand how gates can make flip flops that can be used in shift registers, you really need to understand why \"shift registers\" are an important concept in binary mathematics, and to understand how a compiler converts high level language to assembly, you really need to understand both assembly AND abstract grammar and syntax - in other words, you need to understand both abstractions above and below the current thing you are trying to learn, as well as the abstract idea of the thing itself, all three of which requires knowledge of something else on all three levels!!\n\nDon't let that discourage you though - you should still be allowed to learn everything, but just don't fool yourself into thinking that there is a \"perfect\" order to learn them in, like go from the silicon to the CPU to machine code to assembly to compilers to higher level languages to abstract concepts - or indeed the other way around. \n\nBest suggestion is to start where you are, e.g. learn some Python, and work your way down, look at some assembly, then work your way up, towards more abstract programming concepts, data structures and whatnot, then back down again to another language, maybe C, and understand memory management, up again to understand garbage collecting and compilers, down again to understand addressing and registers in the CPU, and so on and on - not necessarily in this particular order, that was just a random example I made up on the spot.\n\nBut take a look at \"**Code**\", and try to write programs in your chosen higher level language that handles binary conversion, and select topics based on your current interest.\n\nAlso, if you are interested in the human history behind the computer, check out \"**The Innovators**: H*ow a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution*\" by Walter Isaacson.",

        "body": "First, domain names are like file paths, just backwards. Instead of /foo/bar/baz/folder/myfile, you have myrecord.domain.baz.bar.foo. The domain name 9gag.com is registered as living on a set of nameservers that the folks at 9gag control, and they can put as many records there with as many levels of dots as they like (up to the limits of the system, which maxes out at 255 characters for a full domain and at most 63 characters between dots).\n\nSecond, the Internet predates the Web. There used to be many different services that a site might want to offer besides HTTP. Like an FTP server with files at ftp.whatever.com, a gopher server at gopher.whatever.com, a mail server at mail.whatever.com, a USENET server at news.whatever.com or nntp.whatever.com. If you were coming from inside whatever.com's network you might hit smtp.whatever.com to send mail and imap.whatever.com to retrieve yours. Back in the day these would likely have actually been different physical computers. And in that world, www.whatever.com was just another service - \"www\" for \"World-Wide Web\".\n\nBut it did not take long for the Web to take over the Internet, after which pretty much everything else took a back seat to it. The web was everyone's \"front door\", so they wanted to make it as easy as possible to get to. For that reason, most companies arranged for their top-level domain (\"TLD\"), when looked up all by itself, to point to their web server's IP address. That way you could just type `whatever.com` into your browser to get there. (Later browsers would add this as a fallback behavior; if you enter 'whatever.com' and it can't find an IP address for that, it will give 'www.whatever.com' a try. But originally it was up to the site owners to make that work.)\n\nRather than just duplicating the web server's IP address record, which could lead to forgetting to change both in the future, the equivalence is usually accomplished by making the \"www\" subdomain an _alias_ for the TLD. (Not the other way around, because the root of a domain can't be an alias for technical reasons.) In the DNS database, the value associated with an alias record is the \"canonical name\" that it is an alias _for_, called a CNAME for short; for that reason, they're also called CNAME records, and sometimes aliases are called CNAMEs, even though that's sort of the opposite of what it means. Anyway, your example is one of those:\n\n    $ dig +noall +answer www.9gag.com a\n    www.9gag.com.           300     IN      CNAME   9gag.com.\n\nWhat that means is that when a computer goes to look up the IP address of \"www.9gag.com\", it gets an answer back saying \"use the address of 9gag.com\". So it has to turn around and look up \"9gag.com\" to get the actual IP address. (Fortunately for the sake of net traffic reduction, when your computer looks it up, your ISP's nameserver has likely already done that for you and just returns both the CNAME and the IP addresses - A records for IPv4, AAAA records for IPv6 - in response to the original query.)",

Programming is like programming. Believe me when I say my brain does work in similar ways, and I understand why you are trying to create these abstractions, but be careful because they can be misleading.\n\nFor example, in your model, a web application might be a bunch of separate \"flowcharts\" that share parts of their path.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but in the real world, software can be *quite* complex. Yes, it doesn’t branch infinitely in a literal sense the way a fractal might, but there are almost always far too many twists and turns to keep in your head all at the same time. Most real programs are more like a circle than a straight path, and the only reason that thats even true is that we write them to work that way so that we have some chance at reasoning about them.\n\nThe good news, though, is that you don’t need to keep it all in your head at the same time. Programming is a never ending exercise in abstraction. To do the work, you only need to worry about the one piece that you’re working on at any moment. If you’re writing a function that computes a value based on its parameters, you don’t care where those parameters came from. If you’re calling another function, you don’t need to worry about how it does what it does — you only care about *what* it does (and sometimes how long it takes). Considering (and especially depending on) things outside the function can even be a liability.\n\nI’m glad that you’re sticking with it! Just don’t get too disheartened when you start working on larger programs snd start to see a lot of complexity. Remind yourself that you don’t need to understand every level of the process at the same time.",

You can assign them to variables, pass them to other functions, or store them in data structures like lists and dictionaries. \n\nNot all languages allow this.\n\none clarification is that you're not actually storing the function itself in the dictionary. you're storing a *reference* to it (called a pointer). \n\nThe function exists once in memory, and the dictionary just holds a way to find it. \n\nThat's why you write `\"start\": start_game` without parentheses, with parentheses you'd be *calling* the function and storing its return value instead.\n\nTypical use cases:\n\n```python\n# Command dispatch\ncommands = {\n    \"start\": start_game,\n    \"quit\": quit_game,\n    \"help\": show_help,\n}\n\naction = commands.get(user_input)\nif action:\n    action()  # Now we call it\n```\n\n```python\n# Replacing long if/elif chains\ndef handle_event(event_type, data):\n    handlers = {\n        \"click\": handle_click,\n        \"submit\": handle_submit,\n        \"load\": handle_load,\n    }\n    handler = handlers.get(event_type, handle_unknown)\n    return handler(data)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner than a sprawling if/elif block, easier to extend, and the mapping is explicit. You'll see this pattern in CLI tools, event systems, parsers, and state machines.\n\nThe only things to watch for is to make sure the functions have compatible signatures if you're calling them uniformly, and don't over-complicate simple cases where a basic `if` would be fine",

It’s often just a vector implementation rather than a hash table, but there’s no reason it couldn’t be one. Like, in win32 programming a form button or other event source will have a vector of function pointers (void*) and will loop over them and call the functions when the button is clicked. Very normal.\n\nI will say that in a wholly owned system, you won’t normally use this pattern because you know the function caller and function to be called and don’t need an extensible pattern of hooks for third party consumers. You’ll just call the functions or call abstract or interface functions implemented by a known set of child classes. At most you’ll use an IOC container to control which implementation is used through configuration. Keep your system simple unless you really are building a platform.",

Yet, that is the tricky and difficult part. \n\nSince in current times, people are hand-held all their lives they don't want to give up being hand-held and spoon-fed. They don't dare to let go and less know how to stand on their own feet.\n\nThis was very different in the old days when there were no tutorials. You learnt by experimenting, by trying, by failing. But there also was more time and less competition.\n\nNow, fast is key. Which is completely wrong. Speedrunning learning leads to nothing.\n\nWell back to the original topic:\n\nThere are good, mediocre, and outright rubbish tutorials and there are *courses* - this is an important distinction.\n\nProper *courses* are e.g. the CS50 series from Harvard, the MOOCs from the University of Helsinki, Algorithms from Princeton, and countless others. Common to all of them is that they have a proper, educational curriculum, are approved and battle tested, and never pre-chew and spoon feed solutions - they all make the *learner* do the work.\n\nNow *tutorials* on the other hand, generally pre-chew and spoon feed. They *give* the code and only expect the learner to type it in - which is the totally wrong approach to learning. This is not learning.\n\nWorst tutorials are *\"How to build X in language Y\"* tutorials. They are plain useless. You, as the learner will not learn anything from them, not even the skill to build X in language Y on your own. All you will learn is to copy the code.\n\nAbout *proper usage* of tutorials: if you really go through a tutorial (not as a complete and utter beginner - as such, you should take a *course*), try to predict the code. Once the task following is explained, stop the tutorial and try to write the code on your own. Try a good amount of time and make different attempts if your first fails. Then, once you have a solution, or can't think of any other way, continue with the tutorial and compare - this way you train *your thinking* (which is far more important than your *coding*) and the coding plus, you get the final code to maybe learn the one or other thing from.\n\nI still think that the best approach to learning is first a solid *course* and then (and along with the course) program, program, program, program. Experiment, try things, break them, fix them, play around with the code. The more you struggle, fail, and play around, the more you learn.",

You've got the basics of these concepts from tutorials so lets try to get deeper into it. That is where you can find your next area to focus on where to improve. You could go back to tutorials for those or maybe documentation, it all depends on what it is you're struggling with.\n\nIn short, tutorials are good for getting a basic idea of something (like how to connect a database to a website), but you only really learn and retain the info it tried to teach you if you then also try to do it on your own with your own project(s).

They should be identifying a field and learn the languages and tools used in that field.\n\nIf you just learn a random language, you could be stuck in tutorial hell because once you are done learning that random language you may well find that nobody actually uses that language in the field you are interested in.\n\ne.g. you are advised to learn Pascal in response to the incorrect question because of its clarity and simplicity. Then you want to work in robotics. Sorry, go back and learn C/C++.\n\n## watching/reading but not doing\n\nA common problem I see is people complaining that they slogged through the entire series, but then can't do anything.\n\nThat is because they slogged through the series and everything that went in one ear, got pushed right out the other side.\n\nPeople need to regularly press pause on the tutorial (or bookmark the book) and try  out what they have seen. Experiment with it. Try to get it to do something else. For example, if taught how to create a loop that counts from 1 to 10, try to make it so that it goes from 10 to 1.\n\n## AI\n\nThis will be triggering for some - especially the AI propaganda bots. But AI is a double edged sword.\n\nIf used correctly, to search, consolidate or explain it can be a useful tool.\n\nBut if it is used to generate code - especially on anything more than an occasional basis then the risk is the same as my previous \"... not doing\" point.  \nBut it is more insidious. IMHO.\n\nIn another sub that I moderate, we get a lot of posts along the lines of \"I used AI to write the code for the lessons and some basic things, but now I'm trying to do my own unique thing. It doesn't work and I don't know how to fix it.\".  \nEven worse, because they have been copying and pasting the AI gibberish, they often don't have the vocabulary to clearly explain what is going on nor understand the changes proposed (unless someone rewrites it for them).\n\nThe solution? Go back to the basics, ditch the AI and actually try doing stuff yourself.\n\n---\n\nThese are just 3 common and hopefully easy to understand examples that I have observed over and over.  \nIn my career I've seen plenty of other types of mistakes but these are a bit more subtle and complicated to explain.\n\n\n---\n\nYou also asked about:\n\n> ... and still can’t build anything without hand-holding (after doing the tutorials)\n\nThis one is a bit harder and probably is an it depends scenario. Again from my experience, I've seen the following:\n\n* The person is perfectly capable to do it, but lacks personal self confidence.\n* The person is new to a project and needs help becoming assimilated with the organisation of the code and the standards used in the project.\n* Some people have learned the technology by rote without understanding how it works \"under the covers\". Example, they know that they can use a `long` or regular `int` and can't understand why sometimes both work and sometimes one might get weird negative values unexpectedly (and I'm thinking C here, but also some other languages).\n* When joining a new project, people are often on probation and part of the probation involves mentoring.\n\nThere are other possible reasons including \"they didn't do the tutorials correctly\".",

Build a small game engine; implement an ECS system, a basic rendering graph, physics, simulations, etc. Share it with others and let them use it; that’s how you learn what *production-ready* really means.

It's hard, we do it anyway. An old-school method that I stand by for learning is working without copy & paste: typing things out is good for developing a syntax instinct.\n\n\nI think there's two big categories of gaps to distinguish though: algorithmic gaps and library gaps.\n\n\nAlgorithmic gaps are gaps you have conceptually: Can you even break the problem into steps that are easier to code? This is very important to develop independently, breaking down complex problems into steps computers understand is arguably what programming *is*.\n\n\nLibrary gaps refer to not knowing specific tools that your language or libraries provide you. You mostly pick these up over time and it's not a big deal to look them up.\n\n\nFor example, if you want to convert a string to lowercase, algorithmic thinking tells you that you can iterate through the string, convert each letter (with e.g. ascii code math), and build a new string. You should conceptually be able to write that code in your head in your preferred language, even if you don't type it out. Library knowledge tells you \"in python, you can do string.lower().\"\n\n\nStackoverflow (and docs) is good for learning library knowledge. As you build more library knowledge in a language, it translates to having an easier time thinking algorithmically in that language.",

If you don't remember exactly how to loop over that list you made, specifically look up looping over a list, not \"how to implement function x, y or z.\n\nAnd if you can't think of the basic building blocks to use, that probably means you should spend some more time on the basics.\n\nAnd just embrace the process.

This will build familiarity, but won't build problem solving skills.\n\nOnce you have the gist of how and why some functions work, start learning the terminology. This is arguably one of the stronger skills you will need in the age of AI. Knowing exactly what to look for or how to phrase the parts you are stuck on will help immensely.\n\nProblem solving skills are the top priority skills for all programmers. The ONLY way to build this is with practice. Projects are great ways to practice breaking down big problems into tiny problems. If you need to practice tiny problems, chug away at LeetCode, HackerRank, or other platforms that can present a problem to you and give you instant feedback on if your solution is acceptable.\n\nAll projects/apps/features boild down to this line of thinking: \"how do I break this problem down into chunks that I can work with?\"\n\nI generally have a rough idea of what the end-project looks like, then I split that project into milestones, then I keep splitting each milestone into smaller parts until I find a place to start building out everything within the milestone. If your milestones are independent of one another, you can rotate which parts of the project to do if you get stuck and don't want to burn out. If one milestone depends on another, you gotta finish all of the first one before you can work on the second one.\n\nAll project structures will be different. There are countless ways to solve most problems once they are larger. Usually the \"right\" way to solve something either won't exist or won't be evident until after you have tried a bunch of different things. The goal is to get your project to a working point, and to keep tabs of any new skills learned along the way.\n\nEdit to add: you will always be looking stuff up. There is far too much technical documentation for anyone to fully memorize. If you need something done quick, look for shortcuts or similar completed projects. If you have time to learn, deliberately practice your problem solving when you get stuck instead of looking up an answer right away. Try to default to documentation pages before hopping to stack overflow or AI for an answer. Feel free to search error codes if the traceback is too complicated to parse yourself, but don't get into the habit of offloading your learning to other people or AI when you first start out",

Programming language doesn't matter.\n\nIt is more problem solving than actually writing code. My first professional programming job was in 1983. Today after I figure how or what the structure of the program should be, I sit down and just type. Most times I don't think about the code and somehow like magic, my fingers just type away. \n\nBut I will tell you this, I learned typing in high school in 1978, not because I knew I was going to use it one day, but because I was 1 guy in a classroom with 29 other girls for an hour every day. It somehow just worked out that I was going to need it and can now type words out as fast as someone can talk. \n\nLearning computer language after computer language can also be really difficult. But what amazed me is the structured process of learning another spoken language. Classes always start with \"Who, What, When, Where, Why and How\". With those 6 spoken words, learning those 6 words in another spoken language and building on those, makes learning another spoken language so much easier.\n\nI'm fluent in Spanish, and Portuguese as Portuguese is basically Spanish with some French mixed in. I can survive speaking German on the basic level and I know enough Mandarin to order in a restaurant. \n\nAll computer languages have the same basics as spoken languages. If, do, while, loop, for, next, with a majority of languages also having a switch statement or something similar. If you can get those procedures down, learning another computer language becomes so much more easier. It also makes fitting a square plug in a round hole so much more easier in a different computer language you may not be familiar with.\n\nSo, don't spend that much time concentrating on the actual computer language and concentrate on problem solving to use the language you are currently working with.\n\nAnd if anyone really wants to know, when I sleep at night I dream in C#.",

What you seem to be describing is a process where you have a problem, and you arrive at a solution by searching for code written by others and copying that.\n\n\nYou should be able to do simple things without doing that. For example, can you write a loop in your language that prints every item in an array? (Without looking for help, that is). In general you should be able to go from a detailed text description of an algorithm to the code without using stackoverflow. Pros use SO and AI, but we don't use that code verbatim without fully understanding how the code works. And if we understand the algorithm, coding it in the language of choice should be straightforward.\n\n\nMy suggestion is to look for help in a language substantially different from the one you work in. Need a hint on how to do a binary search in Java? Look for Python code to do it instead, and YOU do the translation to Java. That will force you to know Java.",

Anime is awesome to watch, playing video games is awesome too, watching \"cute\" visual things are just... cute.\n\nBut you gotta realize that this is not what makes a good programmer. The best programmers are those that can read documentation, extract the information required to do the job, and implement.\n\nI've been on projects where I've seen large 300 page documents full of requirements written in English language transcribed 100% into functional working code.\n\nThis is what it means to be a programmer: to be able to transcribe the documentation into written code and be able to maintain it.\n\nAt the end of the day, you're going to have to stop running away from reading. People who just get the dopamine boost of just \"getting it to work\" are going to run into a massive problem once they get into a situation that requires serious thinking about how to implement what was written down.\n\nWe don't program based on something that someone \"spoke\" about one time. What they spoke about will likely be written down so everyone remembers it, and we implement it based on what was written.\n\nI appreciate this gamesmanship approach to learning how to code, but this is only 20% of the answer. The other 80% is reading, and learning how to read documentation. On that note, maybe there's some sort of mechanism to make a game out of reading documentation... maybe that's the actual goalpost.

You're always going to reach for the easiest possible way to start interacting with this stupidly hard subject. I definitely failed at learning to code when I was 11 because the resding materials were so dense back then. Also, theres a school of people early on in your programming journey who will tell you to always learn by doing, which you can take a little bit too seriously and think it means that you should just make spaghetti code rather than read docs. Over time I've realised those people are wrong, and the thing holding me back is my patience to read.\n\n\nHonestly I find when you read docs and books programming becomes way more fun. Once you get yourself focused on the reading, you start to find it more interesting because you're engaging so actively with the knowledge. You learnt the whole concept and really appreciate the design of libaries and admire them. Once youve read it, you gain so much understanding it leads to the feeling of being close to mastery which fuels flow state. When I try to avoid just reading, it usually leads to frustration with my work and imposter syndrome.",

Improve soft knowledge skills, like what a server vs a client does, UI design principles (yes, even if you are backend), and learn to design/program your page or app with Level 1 users in mind.\n\n Use AI sparingly, to get an answer if you can’t find any at all and then verify its correct by comparing it to work real devs put up on Github or stack overflow. AI is relatively good with HTML, CSS, and PHP in a vacuum, so you can prompt it reliably as long as you understand the concept you are prompting to save time for. AI is notorious for giving convoluted solutions that run, but are horribly inefficient, and it will straight up lead you in circles at times.",

My degree played no role in getting this job. \n\nIf you’re unable to get an apprenticeship, get a part time job that gives you enough money to do what you need, buy some Udemy courses (they’re dirt cheap), watch YouTube tutorials, use AI to help demistify any concepts you’re unsure of, build applications, get on LinkedIn, build a network, attend  meet-ups and then start applying…. Don’t even wait till summer to start doing this, do it now.\n\nBy the time your peers will have finished Uni, you could already be working as a junior dev, with 6 months to a year of experience under your belt and £0 student debt, which means more money in your pocket…. \n\nThat’s what I wish I had done.",

Realistically you're only going to reach this at maybe one or two niches, and that's extremely satisfying, but I guess my point here is that, stop trying to aim for some 'now it clicks', because it won't, there's always new things to learn.",

Maybe something artistic to allow you to get different perspectives. Definitely not ideal to give up personal satisfaction and forfeit learning altogether. Creative control helps, a lot.\n\nFWIW, lacking knowledge isn't the same as being stupid (lack of intelligence). I lack a lot of knowledge and I'm also being stupid on a daily basis, but the lack of knowledge hasn't made me more or less stupid overall. I don't think \"good\" or \"bad\" are useful qualifiers either.",

The BEST we can do is SOMETIMES detect SOME cases of UB and emit a warning.\n\nThere's an insidious nature to UB - no one can define it. Signed integer overflow is often well defined on hardware, that doesn't mean the C++ spec or the compiler gets to defer to the hardware. It's still undefined behavior. In fact, UB allows a compiler to optimize very aggressively. If, for example, you overflowed, you cannot reliably detect you've overflowed. You might think hey - just see if an increment of a positive results in a negative. But the compiler KNOWS overflow \"cannot\" happen, so it can correctly optimize the \"obviously\" impossible check out, and code paths that presume overflow didn't happen get a negative value anyway.\n\nThus is the nature of UB. You're not going to win against the compiler's CORRECT assumptions that you're NOT going to fuck around with UB. And you don't know how the compiler is going to act upon those assumptions at any given time. Believe it or not, compilation itself is not inherently deterministic.\n\nFurther, you may not even get consistent behaviors between program runs, or even while the program is running. And once UB has been evaluated at runtime, you cannot rely on what the program is going to do afterward.\n\nUB is to be respected. Your x64 or Apple M may be robust, but UB is what bricks a Nintendo DS, most famously when glitch hacking Pokemon or Zelda; you end up accessing an invalid bit pattern that fries some circuits in the ARM5 core.\n\nA lot of engineers are incorrectly dismissive of UB. These engineers would NEVER get a job working on critical systems, where that attitude is going to get a people killed, cause billions in damages, or cause unrecoverable losses.\n\nI hear the attitude - \"We're not saving lives, here...\" Yeah? You wanna diminish your company and it's product more? Do that in front of the CEO. You might not be saving lives with every product, but to be dismissive is also putting the revenue streams and the reputation of the company at risk. No one wants to hear it. It's as serious as it can be everywhere you go - and anyone who isn't serious about it is a toxic person you shouldn't be working with.",

That can be extracting constants, functions or even classes to make it easier to follow the logic. It can be renaming things or adding a comment to explain something odd or subtle. Emphasis on \"balance\" because overdoing it makes it harder to read.\n\nAs for testability, I look for functionality that would be suitable to unit test separately. Functions with side-effects like writing to a database or calling an API are good candidates. It's easier to test when there is a clear boundary between the implementation details of side-effecting classes and business logic. It can also be a good idea to limit leakage of implementation details such models (errors, responses etc) of your internal dependencies.\n\nOn a final note, when planning and writing code it's good to think about future extensions of that code. Writing complicated abstractions to support future possible functionality is usually a bad idea, but just thinking about how a current solution would hold up in the future can be helpful. Sometimes it can help you design a simple solution that is also future proof, and other times it just gives you a better understanding of what extensions are easy or difficult to make (would you want them).",

It will get you more benefit, both in terms of knowing your work is correct, and, later, being able to hand management a win.\n\nOOP is great in the right contexts, but here's the secret.  OOP isn't for the computer, it's for the programmers.  It's a different way to think about the code, and when you're in an environment where your software has hundreds of thousands of lines of code to maintain, thinking about it in terms of entities instead of functions and whatnot is helpful.

If you generalize them too much to fit all use cases they become these very hard to use super configurable objects.

Having the bulk of your functions be side-effect free\n2. Using immutable data structures (e.g. don't modify your dicts/lists/dataclasses after they're created)\n\n...would be a good fit for the more pipeline-oriented nature of your task. You have data you're slicing and dicing, and want some reasonable assurances that each 'transform' or 'analysis' function you have in your script is self-contained and bug-free. Having a clean divide between IO code vs business logic and keeping mutation to a minimum are two good ways of helping you do this.\n\nThe OOP paradigm is usually more useful when it's important you maintain certain 'invariants' around data: things like 'my data structure must always respect this property, no matter how it's modified' or 'all interactions with this particular 3rd party API must include these magic headers'. If you have a lot of these fiddly rules to manage, it can often be convenient to create a class that wraps around your data and presents a cleaner interface to the outside world.\n\nBut I think this sort of need is rare in data-slicing or 'pipeline' style programs.\n\nNote that this sort of decision-making has nothing to do if you're writing a script or not. I've written short 100-line scripts that ended up making heavy use of OOP, and longer 5k-10k LOC production-ready services that used it very sparingly. My ultimate goal is to make the code as obviously correct as possible (which in turn makes it both easy to understand and modify). Sometimes objects can help with this, other times they won't.\n\nThat is, OOP is not the same thing as 'clean code'. OOP is a _technique_ that can _help_ you write clean code -- but (a) it's not the only technique for doing so and (b) it's not a technique that'll be applicable 100% of the time.\n\nw.r.t. SWE best practices, I would look into:\n\n1. Writing tests and perhaps even a CI/CD pipeline for your scripts, starting with the more business critical / frequently run and modified ones. If people are actively making business decisions based on some of your analysis, you'd want reasonable confidence it indeeds behaves as expected. \n2. Creating and popularizing a helper library that streamlines common operations. The goal here is to speed up the time it takes to author a new pipeline.\n\nI don't know anything about your company, but I'd imagine both correctness and speed-of-delivery are two factors that matter most to your team and your bosses. So, I'd prioritize applying practices that directly help with both.",

Would make source control and other checks a lot easier.\n\nBased on what you have said, traditional unit tests are often difficult to apply here and tend to provide less value in data workflows than people expect. I would focus more on testing the output instead. Things like row counts, nulls, ranges, schema changes, distribution shifts, and data freshness usually catch issues much earlier.\n\nA lot of the unit test advice you are getting is common in app and web development, where the failure modes are different. In data, things usually break because the shape or semantics of the data change, not because someone touched the code.\n\nAs far as OOP is concerned, you are less likely to run into it in many data jobs. It becomes important when dealing with graphs or hierarchies. Otherwise it is mostly useful for providing structure.\n\nGenerally, anywhere you are passing a lot of variables to a function or manipulating large dicts, you will probably want to turn those into a dataclass. For external boundaries like configs, inputs, or outputs, use pydantic. Use type hints everywhere, and use a linter and code formatter as well.

Oop just means to group together data as objects with functions for those objects (originally without state, but today state is the center of oop -> state is probably the biggest cause of bugs, given that you test your code)\n\nDeclarative programming is functional programming, reactive programming or logic programming. All similar, but for fp: you describe a function with other functions, to do that, you write functions that create functions and take functions as parameters, there is no state and a function only does one thing with one parameter… for example in procedural programming adding 2 numbers is done with a function like this:  \nadd = (a,b) => a+b  \nFunctional programming is a bit different, you have a function returning a function:  \nadd = a => b => a+b  \nSo, looks a bit unnecessary at first, but you can use functions to build functions… you can do: inc = add (1), while procedural would need a inc (a) => a+1.  \nIncreasing the items in a list is also easy: newList = oldList.map(add(1)), in procedural, you would loop over the list, getting every item, adding 1 and then pushing it in a new list. And oop would have a class inheriting from list, then have some build method that then changes the internal state to transform itself. (Yeah, there is a reason people mix paradigms)\n\nThere are also other paradigms, like concurrent programming (lots of data and shared resources), constraint programming, dataflow programming (aka forced recalculation hell), metaprogramming (manipulating code, instead of data… extremely powerful, easy to fuck up, hell to debug and only really useful, if you know exactly what you are doing) and there is also pipeline programming -> build pipelines…\n\nAnd a few others… but yeah, can recommend functional programming within oop, so constants instead of state and single param functions, as well as higher order functions",

Maybe I'll also create a separate section for quick links, TODOs, snippets of cli commands to run, etc.\n\nI find having this sort of structure makes it much easier for me to stay focused, especially in cases where I feel too overwhelmed trying to mentally remember and keep track of everything.\n\n> I wonder if that is something that gets better after some time.\n\nIt will -- as you get more familiar with the code, you'll have to spend less and less time digging, simply by virtue of you already being familiar with more aspects of the codebase.\n\nEven longer term, it'll get easier once you've worked on enough systems to start seeing similarities and echos. For example, if you've spend a fair amount of time working with backend and cloud infra, new codebases in the same domain will start feeling vaguely similar. There are only so many ways of reasonably structuring code after all.\n\nI'll take time for both types of familiarity/experience to grow though: it's totally expected/normal to feel a bit lost as an intern or new hire.\n\n> This is my first in person internship, so I don't know if it is normal to just stand up and walk for 5 minutes. That is what I used to do in remote internships.\n\nThis is also normal. I've been programming professionally nearly a decade or so, and I also take short breaks once every hour or two. A quick stretch break, refilling my water, etc.\n\nIf I'm feeling particularly stumped/annoyed, I'll often go on a longer 15-20m walk break, maybe step outside to grab some fresh air...\n\nEvery now and then, I figure out how to \"enter the zone\" and manage to stay focused for hours and hours, though this usually happens when I'm writing code as opposed to debugging + investigating. I consider myself lucky when this happens: I haven't yet figured out how to reliably enter flow for the latter.",

For example, Blockly with javascript is probably as simple as it gets for learning the basics. A big step up, Pascal is a strongly typed compiled language that was originally developed as a learning language and is available with a visual designer known as Lazarus open source IDE for writing desk top apps.",

In my experience programmers are a helpful, optimistic bunch. We’re more likely to say “Sure! Anybody can learn the basics of programming!” than “Programming might not be the best choice for you.” Depending on the details of your friend’s condition, trying to program might be futile, or it might be therapeutic. Encouraging someone to keep trying something that they literally can’t do seems cruel, but I definitely wouldn’t want to discourage someone from trying either.\n\nAs a programmer, I can tell you that programming really exercises your short term memory. Learning to write code might be a challenge in itself, but at least a programming language is consistent — most of what you learn this year will be the same next year and 5 or 10 years later. You can get used to it. But programming means reading a lot of code, considering how it fits with other code that you read earlier, keeping track of variables and functions, and so on.\n\nI think your friend should talk to a doctor or occupational therapist about what methods are most likely to help, and whether programming might help them improve their memory or prove endlessly painful.",

For example, [\"Conventional Commits\"](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is one example of a consistent way to format your commit messages. But for a solo project, it really doesn't matter at all whether you stick rigidly to something like this.\n\nAs far as the *types* of information you should be putting in your commit messages: it should be enough to explain both what you changed and why you changed it, to a level of detail that you find sufficient. Commit messages are a form of documentation, and there's no one \"right\" level of detail for your documentation. It depends on how much time you're willing to spend on it.\n\nIf you want some inspiration, you can take a look at the Linux, which generally has very detailed commit messages. Often the messages are much longer than the corresponding code changes. A Linux kernel PR won't be accepted if the maintainers don't think the commit message is clear enough, even if the code itself is fine.\n\nFor instance, [this recent commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617) has 31 lines of text (plus footers) to describe a 13-line code change. \n\nThe first line contains just the most crucial details: the change affects performance monitoring (\"perf\") in the scheduler (\"sched\") subsystem, and it fixes a potential crash. The rest of the message goes into detail about exactly why the problem is happening and how it was fixed.\n\nAgain, you probably don't need to go into nearly that level of detail for *all* your commits, especially if you're working on a project that's less critical than the Linux kernel. But while you're writing code, you should be thinking about how you would explain what you're doing to another programmer. And then you can decide how much of that explanation you want to put into the commit message.\n\n----\n\nNote also that deciding how to *describe* your commits goes hand-in-hand with deciding *what* changes to include in each commit. In the example I gave, it's straightforward to describe the commit's purpose because it's a very small, self-contained change. If the commit included other bug fixes at the same time, it would be a lot harder to write a good description.\n\nYou might think that carefully breaking up your changes into multiple commits is just creating more work, but if you do it properly, it can make things easier for you in the long run.",

Then again everyone has their own style— but definitely do not do `git add .` — source control is your friend, it’s one of the icons on the left hand side of VS code that looks like a merge request icon IIRC. Commit a message for each file, and make it a habit to commit frequently until you get a feel for appropriate checkpoints.\n\nEdit: `git add .` is fine for initial project template / codebase, or overall changes — just don’t work on something for several hours and then be lazy / cut corners with it. Proper documenting of ongoing and frequent changes is essential if your goal is to eventually work with a team at any level from small to enterprise. Some teams have a specific recommended standard for commit verbosity and frequency as well!\n\nEdit edit: If your mind is searching for a statement for a commit and can’t find it— you can describe what you did to any LLM and it should be able to help you. \n\nEg; “I added a variable that is part of my useState into the array at the end of a useEffect” becomes “Added a dependency to useEffect hook that refreshes the state of the page should that dependency change” — these are equally concise but one is more *technically accurate*.",

Why use a TreeMap over a HashMap?).  I might ask how they would implement a multithreaded solution and what problems can arise from multithreading and how they'd solve those problems.

I'd definitely expect questions on unit testing. \n\nWhy would I not expect too many low level questions?

That usually leads to frustration because you recognize solutions when you see them but cannot reproduce them later.\n\nA simple structure that works well is learning one pattern at a time. Study the core idea, solve a few easy and medium problems, then come back later and try to rebuild the solution from memory. That last step is where most actual learning happens.\n\nIf you are transitioning from a service company, consistency matters more than speed. Two focused hours daily with review and recall usually beats long random grinding sessions.\n\nI built a small platform called [algodrill.io](http://algodrill.io) after mentoring people making this same transition.

It might help if recall and retention are the parts you struggle with, but the main thing is staying structured and consistent regardless of resource.\n\nFive months is enough if you avoid resource hopping and focus on depth over volume.",

It can make a big difference on how you solve these, but just pick whatever language is actually relevant to the kinds of jobs are interested in, so you're not spreading yourself thin for no good reason.\n\nI don't have an opinion on the resources you mentioned. What they're mainly good for is narrowing, say, the entire leetcode problem set down to a _much_ smaller subset that gives you a focused sampling of the major problem types. There are more problems on leetcode.com than a sane person has time for or need for, and there's a lot of overlap between many leetcode problems, so you want to avoid aimlessly meandering there and treating leetcode.com as the roadmap. \n\n* Start with easy problems only.\n  * Gradually build up your toolkit of data structures so you learn when to apply certain data structures to which kinds of situations, and exposure to issues that can arise when writing code (off-by-one, index or boundary issues, logic errors, proper handling of numbers, concurrent modification issues, reference vs value, mutability issues, etc.)\n* Some \"easy\" problems may seem hard, and it may not be your fault\n  * IIRC some leetcode problems were mislabeled, and may still be? Those sites that give you a more curated list might help avoid this issue? Anyway, I'd avoid picking random problems directly from leetcode.com itself.\n* Work on problems one at a time, give them a fair shot, but don't waste inordinate amounts of time being stuck.\n  * Force yourself to think and use the tools you can recall. If you can't solve a problem in a reasonable time because you're simply missing the tools needed to solve it, then just look up and study well-written, non-code-golfed solutions, understand the key pieces, and move on. And plan to revisit those problems later on (put them at the back of your problem queue). Over time your recall of the problem -> solution mappings will strengthen.\n* Always be putting your solution (and test cases) in its own file that you can _run_ on your machine.\n  * e.g. `node leetcode1-twosum.js`.  You can also use a debugger, e.g. `node --inspect-brk leetcode1-twosum.js` when you run into problems.\n* Try not to see DSA as an isolated thing.\n  * The main thing it boils down to is picking the right data structure(s) that suit the problem and help you meet the requirements, whatever they are.\n  * A hard part is these problems can feel contrived and disconnected, which may be true, or may be an illusion - it depends. There's no one way to feel about it.  I'm still deeply affected by having learned the \"text justification\" DP problem, and nobody can take from me.\n  * Try to come to your own conclusions about the need/value of studying DSA problems based on the kinds of companies you're interested in. Feeling bad about this interview style is a common feeling, but not necessarily a useful feeling, depending on what you're after.\n* Timebox your DSA study so that you can make time for other things\n  * Mostly to make sure you're spending time working on actual projects, so you're slowly getting exposure there.\n  * Personal projects can give you freedom to try things that may be difficult to justify trying at work, and which can have very high learning/growth value.\n  * Some experience solving DSA problems can benefit your implementations a bit, but won't help you learn how to design systems. So they can be complementary.\n\n\nFor advice moving from a service-oriented to a product company...\n\n* if your current job has lots of greenfield projects with a short lifecycle, take advantage of that as a catalyst for growth, and as freedom to try slightly different approaches  and to learn from past mistakes in code design.\n  * Once you move to a product company, that can be less common. It can still happen, e.g. starting new products, or somewhat isolated subprojects or tools, etc. that serve the overall product in whatever way. But a lot of your time will be spent on things you may not be able to change easily.\n* Don't overly aggrandize product companies and don't belittle yourself and the time you're spending right now.\n  * Have a mentality that your time right now is preparation for what's to come.\n* In your current job, try to be curious and thinking about your own growth.\n  * If you have some decision-making power over which technologies or approaches are used, try to carve out a little space for yourself to grow, whatever that means. Try to keep it low-risk (don't put projects at risk due to making wild choices, but try to take whatever liberties you can that help you move in the direction of writing better code and making better overall system design choices that meet the requirements of the project).\n  * If you don't have that power yet, then try to keep growing your skills and becoming so good that companies feel compelled to put you in that position and let you take the lead on things.\n* Prep for interviews, but don't wait too long to jump into the fray.\n  * Usually interviews don't give good (or any) direct feedback, but ideally you have a rough sense of what you did well or not so well, and figure out what to work on. Dwelling on the asymmetry of the interview process won't help you, it is what it is.\n* Don't be too surprised when interviews don't go well\n  * Just move right along to the next one, and don't get discouraged by the process.\n  * Try to glean whatever you can, and cross-reference how you did with how others do, e.g. watch videos of mock interviews if useful.  See what they do well and think about what you didn't do as well.\n* Ask your interviewers directly what you can do better!!!\n  * Don't leave this up to HR to do (they won't).\n  * Your fellow programmers _might_ be willing to say _something_ when asked directly at the very end. Don't be surprised if some cop out of this, but not all will. Either way, it's better than not asking and then getting absolutely 0 on the tail end.\n* Make sure to express interest in the company and product/problem domain.\n  * When the interview ends with Q&A, be sure to have at least a couple questions about the team and/or company!! It can tip the scales in your favor a bit.\n* Don't automatically assume rejections are because you're bad.\n  * Sometimes the company just has to pick between multiple people, and you may have been good but not _as_ good as somebody else. Well, what happens if that person gets hit by a bus, or quits, or whatever. Leave things on as good of a note as you can, you never know when a connection reaches out again, and luck may have it that you're still looking when they do.",

In this case, an initialization outside would just be wasted and needed to be garbage collected (small waste, but still).\n\nAlso, in Java, it is common to *program against the interface*. This means that the field `elements` would normally not be declared by its full implementation type `ArrayList`, but by the *interface* `List`, so the initialization becomes `private List<String> elements;`.\n\nThis allows for more flexibility as it is easy to swap the actual *implementation type* when needed.\n\nSame thing for the return values. They would also commonly rather return a `List<String>` than an `ArrayList<String>`.",

Here's the practical breakdown:\n\n  \nIf you want to stay close to hardware (embedded systems, robotics, IoT, firmware) - start with C. It maps directly to how you already think about registers, memory, and hardware. Arduino uses C++ technically, but in a very C-like way. The embedded industry still runs on C and will for decades. Companies like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and automotive firms want C + understanding of hardware, which is exactly your combo.\n\n  \nIf you want to pivot toward software engineering at a tech company - C++ is the better resume play. It's used heavily in game engines, high-frequency trading, operating systems, and performance-critical applications. But honestly? For most software engineering roles at tech companies, Python (which you already know) plus a web language would get you further than either C or C++.\n\n  \nThe real answer nobody's telling you: your EE degree + programming is a rare and valuable combination. Don't think of it as \"learning to code from scratch.\" Companies building physical products with software components (robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, consumer electronics) specifically seek people who understand both sides. That's a much less crowded job market than pure software dev.\n\n  \nStart with C on Arduino since you're excited about it. Motivation beats optimization every time when you're learning. You can always add C++ later - it's literally a superset of C, so nothing is wasted.",

The only real difference between the two are C++ has OOP (object-oriented programming). Either would be decent to start with, though be warned them are probably harder than other options (pointers are annoying...).\n\nSome areas of the industry use them a lot, some don't touch them at all and prefer stuff higher-level high-level languages, like C#, Java, Go, and Ruby.\n\nIt really depends what sort of tech company you are interested in joining and what sorts of things you want to work on.",

But if that’s “cheating” then this is what I would do. \n\nThe trick here is to use memoization and working backwards(very common pattern). Find all the valid prefixes from the string before you check if the prefixes are valid. That way you don’t have to loop through the string every time you check a prefix. You only have to loop through it once.\n\nIf string is “abc” then all valid prefixes are (“a”, “ab”). Then you loop through the prefixes list checking to see if the string is in the set. Checking the set is O(1) so it’s fast and looping through the potential prefixes list is o(n). Then you just append the valid prefixes to a results list and return it.",

Iterate from 1 instead.\n2. `findminlength` could be better renamed to `findShortestStringLength`.\n3. Use for loop in `findminlength`.\n4. Assuming that this is Java, don't concatenate a lot of small strings. Strings are immutable in Java, so you are creating a copy every time you do `string0 += string1`. Use a `StringBuilder` instead.\n5. Don't write comments like \"this loop iterates over indices of `strings`\", it is useless, you can get that information by looking at the code itself. But you can explain why you start at 1, not 0.\n6. In the else branch, you set `smallestLenght` to `zwischenergebniss.length()`, which will cause the loop to break, because `zwischenergebniss` has length of `i + 1` at that point. Insert `break` there to make it explicit and remove the `zwischenergebniss = \"\"`, because it is reset on the next iteration a second time.\n7. `zwischenergebniss` can be removed and replaced by `result`.\n8. You shouldn't modify the argument passed to the string. Nothing about the function indicates that the function has side effects, it should be pure. Save the first string in the array to a separate variable. Although, in this case it doesn't matter, since this it leetcode.\n9. Formatting is off. Put spaces between `)` and `{` on while loops and body of a function. Choose whether you want to put spaces after/before `=` or not. Stuff like that\n\nIf I understand your solution correctly, the inner loop can be simplified by a lot. You need to count how many characters match and then replace `smallestLength` by that value. In the end, the `smallestLength` represents the longest prefix length, just return a substring of the first element in the string of that length.\n\n    int prefix_length = 0;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < smallestlength; i++) {\n    \tif (strs[0].charAt(i) == strs[s].charAt(i)) {\n    \t\tprefix_length += 1;\n    \t} else {\n    \t\tbreak;\n    \t}\n    }\n    \n    smallestlength = prefix_length; // prefix_length is always <= smallestLength ",

Focus on making very small games like a simple platformer or a top down shooter. Finishing tiny projects teaches more than watching endless tutorials. Learn by doing. Build something small break it fix it repeat. Do not worry about graphics or perfection. As a programmer your goal is to understand how game logic works like movement collisions input and simple AI.

No need to learn about “cout,” or “include.”\n\nI’ve found that hands-on building truly accelerates understanding.\n\nHappy coding!\n\nResource: \n\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/standard_library.html",

        "body": "Depends on the engine.\n\nFirstly: If you've never programmed before, learn that before touching a game engine. At the very least, learn\n\n1. What variables are (ints, floats, booleans, and strings)\n2. What functions/methods are (bonus points if you can tell me the difference)\n3. What for-loops and while-loops are\n4. What objects are\n5. What data structures (at least: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, Stacks and Queues) are.\n\nAfter that, then you can go to the game engine.\n\nIf you mean the whole \"getting used to your environment\" - start by following a short game tutorial, and then adding functionality to it (make flappybird, then add a coin collecting mechanic - or extra life pickups). This will teach you where things are, and how to get there. When following the tutorial, don't follow line by line, but section by section. Watch for a few minutes, and then repeat it on your own trying not to reference the video. This will teach you how to maneuver.\n\nAfter you understand the 5 basic windows most editors contain (scene view, game view, project files, hierarchy/scene tree, and the inspector), and you've followed maybe 3 basic tutorials, move onto making simple games on your own. [I recommend The 20 Games Challenge](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=82257b40e0c0ad322422c1a739ab848cd655250585883297a44bb103ee62ed7aJmltdHM9MTc2OTczMTIwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=2c6d9a75-b7b3-6591-338f-8c84b639640d&psq=the+20+game+challeng&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly8yMF9nYW1lc19jaGFsbGVuZ2UuZ2l0bGFiLmlvL2NoYWxsZW5nZS8) \\- it's an amazing teaching tool simply due how it encourages repetition.\n\nBetween the games you make, try creating some basic systems - like an inventory, or a healthbar. Small things just to learn how to abstract these tools away. Better yet, make them on their own, and reuse them in some projects to learn how to make things modular.\n\nAs for healthy habits:\n\n* In general, you don't start a project in editor, you start with the notepad/whiteboard: Plan. Think about what you want to accomplish, and quantify it. If it ain't quantifiable, explain it as a story that gives quantifiable metrics. We call these Functional & Non-functional/Quality Requirements. Define and prioritize those first. Once you know exactly what it is you want to make, start to break that thing down into identifiable entities, their components, and their relationships to everything else. Think about how the game works, and the major parts of it.\n* Look up SOLID programming principles, and Object Oriented Design Patterns. They are incredibly helpful in game dev, because they teach you how to arrange ideas in a way that's typically useful for simulations like games\n* When in doubt about how certain things work, read the docs. They are dense, but they're by far the most useful resource at your disposal.\n* Follow a consistent coding style. Your code should look the same regardless of where it is - this makes it easier to parse over later. Don't flipflop between \"snake\\_case\" and \"CamelCase\" for example.",

The easiest way is to read about it for a bit and then implement something that tests a feature so it make sense to you. If it has a physics engine, you could loot at how you make an object not be affected by gravity. how do you make an object adhere to gravity, what happens when two objects hit each other.\n\nBuild a single screen game \n\nStart with something simple like Pong. What do you need for that, break it down to the individual components of your game. Two independently moving paddles, a ball that moves and bounces around, and a pair of scoring zones, and a score display for each player.\n\n1. So create your scene, stick in a paddle, hook in keyboard controls so that it can move.\n2. Create a scene, stick in a ball and give it initial momentum so it moves in a direction, hook in the scoring zone and make the ball score if it enters the scoring zone, keep track of the score, display the score\n3. So create a scene, stick in a ball and a paddle and make the ball bounce off the paddle if it is hit.\n4. Create a scene that combines all of the above into one, and you have your game.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that those first three items also give you your tests cases for your game. If you make a change to the game, you can see if you broke something in regards to the gameplay.\n\nLook at the information about the various Game Jams to practice. So these might have a \"phrase\" or a couple of words your game needs to be about. So \"light & dark\", which could be a game about shadows, a Grue, or a battle of good vs evil.",

By this, I mean that no one is paying to sit there and be able to replicate what you just saw in the tutorial by any sort of deadline, and you said yourself that you already have a job. Money isn’t an issue either, so that’s the two main things that should cause you that much stress out of the way!\n\nI’m a beginner in this field myself, and it’s an overwhelming ocean of knowledge - I constantly see acronyms that I have no idea what they mean, kinds of protocols or algorithms or terms that have no meaning to me. If I came at this with the attitude that everyone knows this and I don’t and that’s why I can’t get a job, by that logic I would never be able to get a job, and I’d freak out. But it’s ok. The thing I just said about everyone knowing it already isn’t true. \n\nYou will get this - you only need to understand that this is not something you can just master in a matter of weeks. It will likely be years, especially if you work full time like I do too. But to get to a level where you are competent enough to have a few noteworthy projects and seem employable? Not so long. \n\nWhenever you learn any new skill, all the knowledge you pick up is fragmented at first. This field has millions of fragments so it’s very daunting. But you will find one fragment that starts to glue others together. And the panic you feel will subside. Trust me.",

See more in this guide: https://realpython.com/python-pep8/\n* Your program will crash if the user enters something that is not a number for the first or second numbers, as it can't be converted to float. For example \"hello\" as the first number is invalid.\n* As others mentioned, handle division by zero.\n* Consider making the program keep working after doing an operation, instead of always closing. For example, ask the user if they want to do another operation, or quit. Then, if they want to do another operation, trigger the same logic again (this requires knowing loops, so only if you are there yet or want the challenge).",

This is often done for file-integrity. Here the hash is stored, so it doesn't need to be recomputed every time (one of the 2 hashes at least). And file I/O is also slower, making this more useful. Collision-resistant hashes are very useful, but still not cheap to calculate (not cheaper than testing equality), and hashCode* is definitely not collision-resistant.\n\n(* I'm assuming you're using Java?)",

        "body": "I don’t know about Dart, but in many languages it’s possible (or sometimes required) to override an object’s hash code function, so (contrary to some comments here) it’s important to understand how they work.\n\nNo, hash collisions are possible. They’re even quite likely if a developer has written a bad hashing function on their object. Assuming everything else in the system is written correctly, these bad hashing functions will impact efficiency but not correctness.\n\nComparing two objects for pointer equality is generally very cheap, and this is what `==` does in most languages. “Pointer equality” means that the objects are in identical memory locations (whether on the machine or on a VM; the details are complicated but not relevant right now.) This means the objects are really and truly “the same”; if you mutate one, the other will be mutated as well, because they’re the same object.\n\nComparing two object’s hash codes is frequently cheap, but not as cheap as pointer equality, because hash codes are often highly optimized and frequently cacheable. If the compiler/runtime knows that the object hasn’t changed since the last time you’ve computed its hash, it can choose to reuse the result of the last hashing operation instead of running it again.\n\nComparing two objects for value equality can be expensive. “Value equality” means that the objects are conceptually the same. For nested objects, this generally means walking the whole object graph and comparing each piece of data in both objects to each other. For small objects this is cheap, for big objects it might not be. Value equality is a conceptually stronger guarantee than pointer equality, because it tells you that two objects “mean” the same thing, even if they were constructed at different locations. However, this can be fragile in the presence of mutability, because if you mutate one of the objects they might stop being equal.\n\nIf you want to check whether two objects have value equality, usually you do this:\n\n1. Check whether the objects have pointer equality. If they do, the objects are equal and you’re done. Pointer equality implies value equality. \n\n2. Check whether the objects have hash code equality. If they don’t, then they are unequal, and you’re done. Hash code inequality implies value inequality. \n\n3. As a last resort, check whether the objects have value equality. \n\nHash codes are especially necessary as a performance optimization when using objects in collections which have limitations around item equality. `Set` and `Map`/`Dictionary` are the main ones which come to mind. In a set you don’t want there to be multiple copies of objects which are equal to each other, and in a dictionary you don’t want to add duplicate keys. In both of these situations you’re not just comparing two objects for equality, you’re comparing one object to a whole bunch of objects and seeing if it’s equal to any of them. In a big collection, this would get more expensive as the collection gets bigger. Without hash codes, adding N items to a set is an O(N^2) operation. So the way these data structures are usually implemented is by using “buckets” of items which have hash codes in a given range. When you want to add an object, the data structure computes its hash code, then finds the bucket which it belongs to (an `O(M)` operation, where `M` is the number of buckets, or in some cases `O(1)`, depending on the implementation). Then, if there’s already items in the bucket, the object being added is compared to every item in that bucket until an equal object is found. (`O(N)`, for a much smaller `N` than before). All in all this is asymptotically much, much faster.\n\nOf course, as I alluded to earlier, mutability messes this whole thing up. If you mutate an object in a way that would change its hash code then the algorithm used by the data structure will no longer perform correctly and it will be left in an invalid state.\n\nHopefully this helps. If you have any further questions about this I’d be happy to answer them.",

I do programming, a little bit of traditional arts, and digital arts as hobbies and the intersection of them is damn fun. I enjoy being able to draw/create whatever workflow. I quite enjoy employing common algorithms in interesting ways \\[re: not LLM/AI stuff as that wasn't around!\\]; I get to pursue a much wider variety of workflows/techniques since I can draw on a wider skillset.\n\nLearning how to paint, the mixtures, pigments, etc \\[I got quite into paint this last year\\] has really taught me the details of finishing, coating, and protecting anything I may make - from furniture to housing. And a quick coat of paint can make a used, cheap piece look brand new!\n\nPlus I find learning both digital and traditional art reinforces the core skills one needs to make good art overall. Composition, colors, lighting, texture, detail density, etc - all necessary to practice regardless of the medium.\n\nWhat's the point of being a programmer if you don't also get a bit of time to pursue other topics that you enjoy? I think it's worthwhile to read history, but I can tell you it will not be getting me raises anytime soon!\n\nLastly, when you learn things, it may open doors you previously would not have been aware of. The twists of life might open a door or two that would've been hidden otherwise.\n\nFinally, the AI stuff concerning \\*making\\* art is such a strong debate I think all the noise around it always misses the forest for the big tree. Thinking on it, however, one faces the same core issues with generative tools as you did with old school algorithmic/digital art!\n\nSay my 200x200 random pixel generator is able to theoretically produce any piece of art ever. (any piece in a 200x200 space of course) The problem is, statistically, most art produced is random noise. It's all \\*seems\\* the same - despite both pieces of noise being very different in terms of data - because both noises communicate the same exact thing to the audience. \"This is random noise\".\n\nIMO, to make impactful art, you've\n\n\\- You've got to understand why and which elements evoke what you want in the audience.  \n\\- You've got to understand what is important, what isn't, and tightly control what is important.  \n\\- And generate interesting ideas within the work of any sort.\n\nThe first two require lots of practice and is a soft skill - much like cooking w/o a recipe. The last one, I find, is much easier when I pore over an artwork and let the creative process compound on itself. (And study lots of extraneous subjects or other artworks to pull more ideas from!)\n\nMuch like you've got to learn how to draw your basics before you can start breaking the rules, I think the biggest problem AI presents is it can undercut the learning process, development of personal styles, & creative process. Much like if you only ever followed \"paint by numbers\" kits and never challenged yourself further.\n\n\\[Though once you've got your art down, and you find it has a useful part in your workflow, I figure it becomes a tool like any other -- IP issues not withstanding. Albeit I'm cantankerous and refuse to give up any control to blackboxes : P. And can't really see how'd I use it in a way that isn't covered by photobashing & art archives ha!

IaC, basic observability, a queue or pub/sub, a DB migration story, and a rollout strategy. That turns “learning AWS” into concrete skills that transfer everywhere.\n\nLanguage wise, Rust/Go/TS are all fine, but I’d pick one to go beyond hello world and use it in that project.

So if you want to be an expert, you need to pick a field and master it. You can still have a good understanding of surrounding domains and basic knowledge of things further afield, but you need to focus on specific areas to become an expert.\n\nFor example, lets say you want to become an expert in large data stores for corporations. That means being an expert in databases, accesses methods, scaling and many more things. But it is also useful to understand access methodologies such as Enterprise servers and how they operate. This can contribute to making decisions like performing processing in database (using complex SQL, procedures or maybe even UDFs) or do that processing in the server but requiring multiple fetches to the database. On the other hand, it is still useful, but far less so, to understand the front end technologies and their supporting services.\n\nSo, what I am saying is pick something (or a small number of related things) and learn them well, but also identify the main things that surround them and be well aware of them. Then identify the next layer of things and be aware of them, but no need to know them as well as the things immediately surrounding your area(s) of focus.\n\nIMHO.",

I understood memory management very well at a conceptual level - specifically the heap and the stack. But I had never really had to delve deeply into actual memory allocations - I had once written an exception capture mechanism (i.e. I had to roll my own try/catch/throw mechanism for our C application) which required understanding the stack and call frames very well, but we hardly ever used dynamic memory allocation (i.e. the heap), so I never really needed to diagnose it.\n\nBut, this failing application did and I had to learn the specifics of how the C runtime managed the heap.\n\nSo, looping back, I learned the basics of C and the facilities like malloc (so breadth-first), but as I learned them I also delved under the surface. Then when I needed to I drilled down to whatever depth was needed for situations arising.\n\nHopefully that makes sense.",

        "body": "Everything is normal - a lot of people like to confuse things further by talking about passing by reference or value or copying, etc. This usually only confuses things further.\n\nLet me try to show an example - first with an integer (code isn't Dart or anything in particular, mostly pseudocode):\n\n    int v1 = 5;             // first we declare a variable 'v1' with a value of '5'\n    \n    myFunc(v1);             // then we send that variable as an argument to the function\n    \n    def myFunc( v2 ) {      // in the function, the variable 'v2' is now also set to the value '5'\n      print( v2 )           // as we can see if we print it\n      v2 = 4;               // but then we change 'v2' to '4'\n    \n                            // 'v1' was never changed\n    }\n\nThen if we use lists - the result is actually exactly the same:\n\n    list l1 = ['c','a','t'];  // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't'\n    \n    myListFunc( l1 );         // then we send that list as an argument to the function\n    \n    def myListFunc( l2 ) {    // in that function, the variable 'l2' is now set to the same list\n                              // of 'c','a','t'\n       print( l2 );           // as we can see if we print it\n       l2 = ['d','o','g'];    // but when we change 'l2' to another list of 'd','o','g'\n    \n                              // the original 'l1' was never changed\n    }\n\nSome people like to argue that 'v2' becomes a copy of 'v1' but 'l2' becomes a reference to 'l1' - this isn't entirely correct, and in my opinion only muddies the water. The important thing is that when you set a variable = some other value, it doesn't matter where it originally got its value from, it is gone. And setting v2 = v1 doesn't \"link\" v2 and v1 in any way, it just makes them have the same value.\n\nNow for the tricky part!\n\nA value like 4 and 5 cannot be changed, setting v1 to 5 and then setting v2 to v1 and v2 to 4, does not change neither 4 nor 5, it only changes the variables v1 and v2.\n\nBut a *value* like a list, **can be changed**, you can replace individual items, add or remove them - it is still the same list. You cannot replace or remove anything in the number 5.\n\nSo this code does change the inside of l1:\n\n    list l1 = ['c','a','t'];  // we declare a list 'l1' with 'c','a' and 't'\n    \n    myOtherListFunc( l1 );    // then we send that list as an argument to the new function\n    \n    def myOtherListFun( l2 ) { // and receive the same list as variable 'l2'\n      l2.add('s');             // and we modify the inside of the list!\n            \n                               // this has also changed the list for 'l1' because it is the same list\n    }\n\nThere's nothing magic about it - note that we don't write `l2 = ['c','a','t','s']` because that would change l2 to be another list, just like v2 was changed to be another number.\n\nIf we could write `v2.increment()` or something like that, we would be able to change v1 through v2, but as that is usually not the case in most languages, programmers like to say that numbers are copied and lists are referenced - although it rarely is like that.",

At first we don't know that there's thing called Virtual Memory which controls every aspect of memory access.

So it's not that suitable for allocating new memory for data in the future. So the OS have a mechanism (heap) for requesting new memory pages in order for a program to be able to create new objects while it's running. If not for pointers we wouldn't be able to refer to objects located in heap because we don't know beforehand where they would be located, the compiler knows only about variables on the .data section. You can read from a books or ask AI about all these stuff and it would explain to you in a level understable for you.

The best part about Linux is that you have control over everything, which is also the most dangerous part about Linux lol\n\n\nSo you have this environment that lets you do anything, what do YOU want out of it? Do you want to browse the internet? OK, download Firefox. You google how to do that, and you learn that you have to type out ``` sudo dnf firefox```\n\nDo you know what that command means? If you don't you've just been given a guide on what to learn next. You research a bit and learn about privileges and using the sudo command. You research a bit more and you learn that dnf is your package manager and why it makes your life easier.\n\n\nNow tomorrow you decide you want to talk to friends on Discord, you already probably can guess how to do it, but just in case you can google how to download the Linux version. You arent surprised by the command they give, because you already learned what package manager youre using and what that entire command does. At first this simple process took a few steps and research, but now you know enough to do it quickly and confidently. \n\n\nThis snowballing approach is how you learn Linux, you dont watch a 10 hour youtube video or take a class. You think \"it wish my computer did X\" then you research how to do X. It's like carving a statue in marble, you sand away the bits that annoy you or dont work until you've gotten down to what you want. \n\n\nAnytime you think \"thats annoying\", figure out how to stop it. Ever have something in your terminal spin forever or crash? Thats annoying, and many beginners just close the terminal and start over. That works... buts its kind of annoying. That should be an itch you scratch, and of you look around you'll discover that you can kill that process by hitting ctrl+c. Ever try to paste something in the terminal and it doesnt work? Thats annoying, if you research a bit you'll learn why it does that though. You'll also learn that you can paste directly into the terminal by using Shift+ctrl+v instead. \n\n\nDon't \"learn\" Linux. It's your computer, USE Linux, and if it seems like there should be a better way of doing something, find out what that better way is. Everyday you'll find something that pisses you off, which is great because that means you are being given something to learn on a silver platter.",

Do a full curriculum like The Odin Project if you can. \n\nIf you need a first book to read, try \"The Pragmatic Programmer.\" \n\nIf you want to go deeper after TOP, first learn TypeScript or an OOP language, then read Head First Design Patterns, then Clean Code. \n\nThen go to Leet Code and work on data structures and algorithms. You don't have to go too crazy there. Answering easy and medium questions and understanding Big O is enough for most. \n\nThen focus on SQL. Being good with data and databases and knowing how to avoid things like N+1 queries is critical for production work. \n\nBut, like I said, be patient. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you have to know all of this before you can build something real. Continuing to build projects *while you're learning* is the single most important thing to do. All the best coders I know started building projects before they were ready. \n\nGood luck!",

In many languages this problem is addressed much more simply with phantom types.\n\nCorrectness-by-construction only stretches so far. It gets more expensive to maintain as you try to enforce more and more complex properties. At some point it becomes better to insert runtime checks and trust your test suite.\n\nI can’t help you with a misplaced sense of personal guilt (see a therapist if that’s a common theme in your life) but I can say that you’re taking the wrong approach here. Code’s correctness is multifaceted; complex code may feel safer, but it’s also more likely to contain bugs due to its complexity. A type system is indeed a static analysis tool, but static analysis is only one tool in the toolbox.

Apache Spark (or often just \"spark\") is available for the programming languages \"scala\", \"java\", and \"python\".  Python is the most popular recently.  Java has better \"error checking\" and execution performance, and Scala is the language where Spark truly shines, but is a bit more work to learn.\n\nConsidering current market trends, I'd recommend using Spark with Python, as that seems to be popular, even if it is not as nice as some options that might be better (from a strictly computer science point of view).",

You need to have the proper architecture for your application\n\nA common design is to use modules, where you application has a certain core around which you can build any number of modules. This is how big enterprise applications like SAP are set up\n\nAnother option is a plugin-architecture, where your application provides a layer that features can attach to without affecting how the core application functions. This is for example how VSCode works",

Depending on your stack, there are several tools out there to use. Even if you dont have access to any tools, you can double check no vulnerabilities are associated with any dependency versions on your project.\n3. Upgrade project dependencies. This one can be tricky and requires a lot of regression testing.\n4. Update, create, and improve junit test cases and test case coverage. Create/improve mock services\n5. Improve CI/CD. Add quality of life features\n6. \\^Build internal tools to help with automation and testing such as a data generator.\n7. Improve dashboard and alerting capabilities. Check if there are any metrics you can track that will help alert you of any issues with your project. If none exists, create a metrics dashboard or try to get your team/company to adopt one from the various providers. You could even keep it simple and create a cron job on a linux server that executes a script daily to pull metrics from your logs and database to alert you of any issues. Though there better solutions.\n8. Study anything related to your job. Learn what you need to in order to eventually help your teammates with their load. Learn more about intricacies of the languages used in your stack. Research tools and libraries that may help your project.  Sometimes you can be the one to introduce new technology to the stack that improves something you already have or completely replaces it for some benefit or another.\n9. Update project documentation. You could also create guides for any new people that may join the team in the future\n10. Innovate. Maybe you can figure out a good way to leverage AI in your project. Don't immediately jump to an LLM. You might not even need AI and an LLM might be overkill if you can use traditional AI/ML.",

You gave the guy a very reasonable answer to his question, and he responds with _\"Coding is dead because I know someone in Mag7 derp derp!\"_ 🙄\n\n\nI feel like engineers should start changing the narrative to \"Where is the innovation gonna come from if we just off-load _everything_ to AI?\" The second most used word in software after AI is probably \"innovation\" – IME it has been used so much as to become meaningless, but leaders always ask for it anyway. \n\n\nSo, then, boss, if you want me to innovate _constantly_, _**where do you expect that innovation to come from?**_ If we just have LLMs write everything, they will eventually have nothing but their own code to regurgitate because, dear boss, LLMs don't think... not like we do, anyway. They have no mind, hence no motivation.

If you look up the term you will find a two dimensional plot with autonomy capabilities on the X axis and trust in autonomy on the Y axis. Then plotted along the y=x line will be calibrated trust.\n\nThe simple idea being that if you have a low amount of trust in autonomy in an area where it has high capabilities than you are under trusting it. Meaning you are not taking full advantage of the capabilities it has to offer. and on the other hand, if you trust it too much in areas that it doesn’t have much capabilities then you can be setting yourself up for failure.\n\nThe reason this pneumonic is significant is because of the term calibration. It is important for companies and indeed individuals to constantly recalibrate, and reevaluate the level of trust they have in these tools. If you evaluated it a year ago and haven’t done so since, then you are very likely under trusting some of the capabilities the professional tools have now. In particular, the models that dropped late last year showed dramatic improvements in the ability to assist in early dev work and project scaffolding.\n\nI don’t mean to overhype the capabilities, but I see a lot of posts where people espouse, the limitations of a year ago, as if it were still true today. The reality is the situation is evolving quite quickly, and everyone should be reevaluating on a continuous basis.",

Most of the time you only have enough “social credit” to rate 1-2 team members with top marks, maybe an additional one if you start cashing in chips to go to bat for them.

Problem is, from my point of view, - a mix of factors :\n\n\\- Income: is it explicitly listed in the JD? or mere \"competitive\"?  \n\\- Location: is it listed explicitly? Or is it \"Remote but 5/5 days onsite\"? Is the location in/near huge city or in the middle of nowhere? If latter, does the company help with relocation? Budgets for relocating, for finding +- acceptable flat/house?   \n\\- Hiring process: is it explicitly mentioned in JD? Or \"we are looking for 10-in-1 dude, income 40K/y before taxes in HCOL\"? How many steps does it take? 2-3-5-25? Types of steps - interview, live coding, project, test?   \n\\- Stack: is it generic MERN/Python dev? Or some rando with skills for, dunno, signals and Verilog or FP-keen dude?",

Most jobs are lemons.\n\nSince software is a high-paying career, there are lots of unqualified people chasing the money.  You can post a job, and a huge percentage of the applicants will be completely unqualified.  When you reject them, they don't give up, they just apply elsewhere and contribute to them saying \"most candidates are completely unqualified\".\n\nFrom the candidate perspective, now you're trying to stand out among the masses of completely unqualified people.  Most people aren't going to be able to give 30-60 seconds per resume when they are getting 500+ per opening.  Just getting to the interview round is hard.  The people who are completely unqualified use resume writing services, so their resume will look the same as yours, maybe even better if they're embellishing or lying.\n\nMost jobs suck where you have artificial crunch every 2 weeks due to Agile and the codebase is a complete mess.  There are places who give interview tests/homework to everyone who applies, and then ghost 95%+ of the people who submit a response, which leads to candidates starting to refuse to do them.\n\nLousy employers are always hiring due to high turnover.  Good employers might hire one person per year, interview 5-10 people then make an offer and decision.

They want employees to be in a constant state of fear, anxiety and subservience to their manager.\n\nThe solution is to have a huge 1 to 2 years of monthly expenses saved up. Then you dont have to give a fuck about your performance while you wait for the inevitable layoff. I keep $100k in hysa just for a layoff scenario - it took 5 years to accumulate, which was tough at the time, but my anxiety level was greatly reduced. This hysa stack is seperate from stocks/bonds/401k/529/real-estate etc - those are not your emergency fund. Some people say $xxx in cash is too much - but thats not my problem. This is what I need for my mental safety net and you may need more or less for yours.\n\nMy last layoff, I got $20k severance and 2 months where I was paid salary but could spend the time searching - and I luckily got a job lined up before the clock ran out. The time before, it took me 2 months to find a job, but severance was only $10k. So I had to dip into my savings, despite unemployment checks. You should look up the weekly max unemployment benefit for your state and factor that into your plan. \n\nTLDR: Layoffs are inevitable. Stressing and extra effort will not save you from it. Fuck your employer. You need to stop worrying about stack ranking and layoffs, and instead worry about reducing your expenses and stacking your emergency fund. Use your anxious energy to plan and prep. Once you are prepped and have enough stacked, your anxiety will go away.",

As a senior who is actively applying, I’d say it’s already quite hard to even reach the HR round (unless you constantly tailor your CV to perfectly match the job description), and it’s even harder to land a *good* job.\n\nI could have had 2–3 offers within a month, but all of them came with worse conditions than my current position. For example:\n\n1. B2B setups are very common, and in their current form they are extremely beneficial for companies, but not really beneficial for employees.\n2. I’ve had cases where companies wanted me to work on my own computer and install their software on it. In three other cases, I simply rejected the offer because they explicitly stated that the role required 50–60 hours of work per week for a below-median salary.\n\nSo my conclusion is this: if you have low expectations, I think it’s relatively easy to land a senior position. But if you have standards—like a decent salary and a healthy work–life balance—it’s extremely tough right now.",

But all the jobs I'm getting are in series-B startups, and they are completely incompatible with being a parent to a child with high needs. I actually tried, but things are just so unstable now. I got fired from a job after about 10 months despite busting my ass on it, and then the next job I found, I got laid off in about 8 months.\n\nTech careers are so all-consuming, and if you want to run a family while in one, it means you're spending a ton of money on daycare, babysitters, after-school programs, summer camps, cleaning, and meal services. You can't turn on and turn off these things at will. Like I get my kid into a pretty expensive daycare that's taking 30% of my take-home, and then I get laid off... I can't just pull her from the daycare because I currently don't have an income, and then put her back in when my income stabilises. I have significant savings, but this type of uncertainty and demands means I can't actually build enough savings while I work, and my savings get depleted fast when I'm between jobs. And I'm not actually able to be a good parent if I'm constantly worried about getting fired or laid off.\n\nAnd AI is cool, but it feels like I'm expected to be up to date on using AI in my job, and I have to spend time outside of work to explore AI and stuff. Which I really don't have the time for. \n\nSo I'm going back to school to get a teaching credential. There's a huge shortage of math and science teachers. I need something stable that offers benefits, so I'm not constantly worried about the high cost of COBRA coverage when I'm between jobs. The biggest benefit is, even if the job isn't flexible, I'm just DONE at 5pm. Even if I have to grade papers at home, it's not as cognitively demanding as being on-call at 2am when the server goes down. \n\nThere are a lot of bad things said about teaching as a profession, and I personally know lots of teachers who got sick of it and quit, just as I got sick of tech and quit. But at this point in my life, it feels like a better career choice. \n\nI still love programming, and in my spare time, I am constantly coding apps, helping friends with their startups, and consulting. I actually have the bandwidth and energy to do it because I'm not busting ass programming all day. This stuff is much easier with AI as well.",

I’d organize them better. A reader has to kind of figure things out. I thought you had GraphQL listed twice at first, and my first boomer instinct was “if this person can’t proofread their own resume, why would I bother interviewing them if they care so little?” You are dealing with people with short fuses when people are reviewing your resume. Organize/categorize it better, so someone can digest the info more easily. It’s similar to the snark on Reddit when people joke about paragraphs. \n\n- “Contributed” sounds extremely passive. It sounds like your team built a feature while you were working on something else. Work on that section to show more involvement. Even something like “Developed a highly scalable…” might work better. You can add “team” somewhere if you are that self-conscious about it. It’s a mix of passive word choice, and I have literally interviewed people who tried to take credit for the work of others. It just raises an eyebrow because it’s kind of an odd word choice. \n\n- Were these different projects or a single one? If they were different projects, you could list the tech stack of each. You could possibly say when you used bigger name tech for certain things like you did with the Solr example.\n\nGood luck, it’s a tough market.  ",

Are you someone who needs to move fast without bureaucracy?\n- What LOB (if told) would you join? The cost centers at Capital One face more attrition than profit centers (like Card Tech). The PIPs fly faster in other LOBs.\n- Are you okay with mediocrity? Not sure about your offer, but some teams don’t do flashy work. The tech stacks are bloated and poorly written by contractors. Some may have modern stacks.\n- How long do you see yourself working there? The WLB is fairly good, but the performance culture grinds years off your life for a mediocre pay and no RDU.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI’ll also note, SA while a shit pay, will offer more shelter from PIPs than for PAs.

Left after I fulfilled my time requirement to not pay back the signing bonus & Relocation package. \n\nC1 tries to operate as if they’re AWS, the problem is that they’re not paying AWS money. They like to intentionally over-hire & rely on pip culture to incentivize employees to overwork themselves to be ranked appropriately. That leads me to my next thing, they do stack ranking for employees. This means that you’ll be ranked against employees at the same level as you & normally that would be fine, but a lot of orgs have company lifers. These people have been there their entire career or the majority of their career & they know the company inside & out so they’ll consistently set an incredibly high bar that new external hires have to adhere to within a few months of working at the company. \n\nWith a company so reliant on internal systems that are poorly documented & long drawn-out (again, poorly documented) processes it’s hard to learn all of that while also navigating all the levels of bureaucracy & compliance that comes with fintech. Quite frankly unless you grossly overwork yourself on a regular basis for a year or two or you’re just an incredibly talented engineer it’s unlikely you’ll succeed there. \n\nHere are some additional things that you may find useful to know:\n- They reorg frequently, I’m talking every 6 months at least. So you’ll constantly be shifting teams or lose team members\n- Everything there is reliant on tons of internal tools & many basic things you’ll have to do will take significantly longer than expected because you have to ask many people who to contact about something then you have to fill out a form & then message someone to tell them you filled out the form then fill out the form again because you forgot to check a certain field on the form\n- The way the company operates with pip culture breeds a lot of toxic behavior between employees so you’ll encounter a lot of terrible behavior throughout your interactions. Plenty of good people there, but the amount of bad interactions you’ll encounter is relatively high.\n- as a woman you might find it relevant to know that there’s not many women working there in the engineering departments. I was there for a little over a year & I found out about 3 different serious scandals there involving harassment & encountered a lot of higher ups who are not very respectful towards women. \n\n\nAll that being said, they do pay pretty decent, but in my opinion they do not pay nearly enough for how much it sucks to work there. If you’re up to date on your interview skills I highly recommend interviewing elsewhere. Many other companies pay equally well or even better that aren’t as terrible to work for.",

A day later, tell your recruiter you have some concerns you want to clarify. They’ll likely ask if you want to meet with the hiring manager or anyone else to discuss them. If it’s a good group of people they’ll be happy to do so. Then you can prepare some questions that might help you understand the situation better. You can even bring up what you’ve seen online.

A lot depends on what you like doing and the surrounding people at your work. You will get rusty. Some places will let you still do some hands-on work, but I’ve usually found it’s pretty hard to find the time.\n\nFWIW, there are fewer total roles. Maybe that impacts your decision, maybe it doesn’t. \n\nI ultimately decided I wanted to shift towards doing the actual work. I’m enjoying my days more and feel like I have more potential options if the shit hits the fan. \n\nI would assume interviews can still be technical, depending on the company. I saw an Engineering Manager at Capital One recently get a data engineering certification. ",

So it sometimes depends on your organization.\n\nOne rather dorky leader who came in was very forceful and said the success of my team is not my success. He basically wanted all managers serving as individual contributors. Which means we weren’t developing our teams or actually managing at all. I ignored him. Wasn’t best for my career at the time, but he eventually was gone.\n\nFind the team and leadership that best resonates with what engages your passion. And you’re probably still staying technical. I’ve definitely had to go into contractor code and fix some of their issues when they said it was impossible or exceptionally costly to make a fix. Best of luck.",

This company is also nuts to expect a single developer to fully manage 4 different software projects.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I'd take this as a learning opportunity and move on when I can. You're not a bad developer. You're working for a non-technical company that is in over their heads as a relatively new developer with 3 years of experience. Software engineering is one of those things where you think you know something but you're constantly realizing you know nothing at all.\n\nI'll also point out that this early in your career it's extremely beneficial to work alongside other developers so you can grow your skills via osmosis. It's important to work alongside experienced people who do things the \"right\" way. From my own experience lone wolf engineers usually pick up a ton of bad habits. Usually because they're on their own and nobody can help them learn and apply proven techniques.\n\n\\- Senior engineer, 20 years experience.",

Really it all comes down to being able to understand how to parse large datasets into useful information.\n\n\nI can understand it, I can explain it, most of my team can't comprehend it; so I rapid prototype the solution, meet with various teams, and we get a usable product that prevents us from having to do a RFP for 5 to 10 million dollars a year.\n\n\nI assume there are other roles that are related to computer science that exist in which you can still use your education, training, and knowledge; but it might be a pretty niche job market - regional company, not huge, but not tiny.  Big enough to pay we'll, small enough that 5 million dollars a year on savings makes a difference, also in house IT.

After 5 days I stopped worrying that no one was watching critical component X and they're just gonna have to experience being the one to manage it - and I trusted I left enough instructions and trained my team well enough to cover it. I also kept in touch with them and still do in case they have questions.\n\nAfter 2 weeks, and a ton of sleep, I started making jokes again. My eyes are less puffy. My back hurts less. I smile more. I love that I get to be with my family more. I've begun to cook and find other ways to contribute.\n\nBut I feel a sense of loss. 14 years on a single project that I loved and helped to build... It's a lot to let go all at once.\n\nI have started applying for some roles that I want to contribute to.

        "body": "Working with AI changes everyday. There’s 0 chance your company knows what they’re doing. The engineering is up to us, not a bunch of corporate stooges and their worthless \"AI up-skilling\" powerpoints. I’ll give you a basic run down of everything important I've learned in the last year:\n\n1. Write an AGENTS.md file that gives a broad view of your repository with high level details like tech stack, folder structure, etc. Also point to which docs should be referenced if the agent needs to expand further for more details. This prompt will be injected in every conversation so keep the information broad/horizontal instead of deep/vertical.\n\n2. Learn how to sandbox your agent so you can run the agent in yolo mode and afk it. The 3 most popular options are: Claude code’s builtin sandbox mode, vscode’s dev containers, and docker’s new sandbox mode for running agents.\n\n3. Learn git worktrees so you can have agents work in the background without disrupting your normal workflow or if you want to parallelize work. (I recommend not trying to parallelize too much, most work is inter-dependent and it's usually easier to just work sequentially)\n\n4. Utilize skills and have a directory full of detailed instructions for each common task you do. For example, a frontend task that goes deep into detail on how you want your frontend code to be written. Unlike the AGENTS.md file, you want these docs to be deep and detailed. The agent will use progressive disclosure and only invoke those skills when its relevant so your context isn’t overloaded\n\n5. Learn about the ralph wiggum technique. This is essentially breaking extremely long tasks into subtasks and running the agent in a loop so that it can work on atomic tasks with a fresh context each time instead of trying to one-shot it and getting its context window trashed. This will involve: \n  - A PRD doc explaining the feature and requirements in depth.\n  - A tasks.json file with subtasks and acceptance criteria for each task.\n  - A notes.md file so that it can jot down any information that might be relevant in between tasks. \n  - And finally, a bash script to run your agent continuously.\n  - There’s some good info [here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) along with more stuff if you google ralph wiggum.\n\n6. Standard engineering practices apply. Tons of high quality tests, linters, formatters, and strict type checkers.\n\n7. Set up a way for your agent to test changes. Whether thats setting up staging environments for backend work or setting up browser automation for frontend.\n\n8. Avoid MCPs like the plague. 99.99% of them are useless and will clog your context with useless tool definitions that the agent isn’t even good at invoking. The only mcp I recommend is this for browser automation: https://github.com/remorses/playwriter (NOT THE OFFICIAL PLAYWRIGHT MCP. The official one is trash and not optimized to preserve your context window)\n\n9. Learn your agent’s plugin system and write scripts to automate tasks that should be run deterministically. Example: Writing a stop hook that executes code quality checks like I mentioned in bullet point 6.",

There's a big difference between a story that you actually wrote and one that you tell off the cuff. That's the important stuff, once you get out of the entry-level zone.\n\nFor some companies you need to do leetcode, but it is very far from mandatory across the industry.

I got severely depressed and it triggered my early hair loss. After getting the job, it took my like 6 months almost doing bare minimum just to recover from it mentally. Fast forward till now, I built a job scraper and have prepared for interviews/leetcode questions for almost a year in advance. I started the job hunt last month (I'm still employed). No interviews so far, rejections everyday, a bit discouraged but no where near as bad as the last time.

This is because trash schools do not prepare you to pass the interview. You are better off doing community college for first 2 years to get the required classes out of the way for cheap. Then you take a few basic computer science classes. Then in state tuition nearby for the last 2 years.\n\nReal computer science is hard and time consuming. If you can't handle that, you won't pass the interviews. WGU or any of the for profit trash does NOT prepare you to go to work or to PASS THE INTERVIEW.\n\nSo basically there are 3 tiers of schools\n\nIvy league or equivalent.

Id also argue that community college for first 2 years to save money is a good idea too. Most of the computer science classes will be at the regular college.

This is about the same view as bootcamp-only people--its better than nothing, but it's just taken as nowhere near the same as the above.\n\n\nTHAT SAID, for your specific case of already having a different degree **and teaching the subject**, I think WGU is a pretty good option. You already clearly have the interpersonal and project management skills needed to be functional in a workplace, and youre even more aligned since you have actually been doing some amount of programming already.\n\n\nI think you'll still struggle to get those first few jobs just because the career track is so railroaded towards the typical \"new grad with internships climbing up the ladder,\" but you absolutely can do it. I STRONGLY recommend freelancing to get your foot in the door, since it'll mean not needing to drop off of your teaching job. Tbh, if you can convince someone to let you build them a plugin for their website or make some open-source contributions, I think you could even end up with a \"typical eng job\" without a degree (though I don't recommend this).\n\n\nAnyways, my advice to you is\n\n1. Get the WGU degree\n2. While getting the degree, really really seek out a project or two from peers nearby. Maybe the school website could use some updating. Maybe your buddy wants clients to be able to schedule an appointment online rather than call him. These jobs will replace the typical \"internship\" experience companies want.\n3. Afterwards, seek out workplaces that can leverage your background. There is a TON of education tech being made by folk who have no idea what educators need.\n4. Be resilient. You're entering into a tumultuous field later than your competitors. There are going to be instances and people that make you feel small. Forget them, I really truly think youve got some great experience that'll be super rare and valuable for where you end up.\n\n\nYou got this!",

You also have a huge gap in your work history if you haven’t been doing anything tech related the past 5 years. \n\nYeah the market is rough but from what I can tell that’s not the issue here;  it’s more the fact that you, atm,  are not a good candidate. \n\nPeople on this sub don’t recommend getting a masters if you have to pay out of pocket but in your case, since your dead in the water anyway, I would so you can apply for internships. The structure of learning and coding might help with the issues you’re having with producing code. It’s a bit of a gamble but it depends on if you really want it or not. If you can maybe even look for a job that will pay for the degree, I think Amazon has tuition reimbursement.",

I am neither in social, embedded or health, so the stakes arent high anyway. \nThis way I keep my sanity, my humility to keep learning from everything and everyone, and mental peace to grow outside of work and give my energy to my family.",

It doesn't help you in any ways (if you go the extreme route) and your boss might think you are worse than you are which can impact your end of year performance reviews. You have to at least show you are putting in a lot of the effort to catch up so your manager understands.\n\n>How do I stop feeling so dumb?\n\nSponge up all the knowledge as much as possible. And emulate what your teammates are doing. Catch up ASAP.\n\n>How do I earn the respect of my coworkers?\n\nWhat I just said above + do your stuff well + make sure you are a team multiplier in some ways or another.\n\n>I also feel like an idiot sometimes in general because the product itself and the code is very complex. The product is for a niche field I’m not very familiar with.\n\nI know redditors hate to hear this but spend more hours (this means outside work hours) figuring out wtf is going on. And if there's little to no documentation on what you think is important knowledge, document it and share it to the team (this shows you are 'team multiplier' and will look good to your performance review). And if there's any documents regarding the product, just read through it even if you don't understand it multiple times here and there again and again (so your eyes at least get used to the technical jargon, etc).\n\nType or screenshot everything in your note taking app or whatever per day. Every command you ran and so forth so you can look back. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I recommend it if you don't use a note taking app (it's very bare bones and light). And I have Calender plugin on it.\n\nIf your company allows you to use AI on the codebase, abuse the heck out of AI and ask all sorts of questions on it.\n\nSchedule 1 on 1 meetings with your teammates and ask questions on topics you don't know much about. Don't schedule and just be like \"I don't know\". People don't like that. People like you put in SOME effort to try so show you put in the effort to try to make sense and are confused/lost. And screenshot every single step your teammate is doing so you don't forget or lose (so you can help organize later). Also, DM your teammates with help you need (do it to different team members a time so you don't overload one teammate). And make sure that DM (Slack setting or whatever is set to never delete). And again, screenshot/save any command, etc that comes out of it.\n\nType more shit about your status and what you are doing in your team channel more. Last thing you want is to look invisible. Invisible == Looks like you aren't doing anything.\n\nI abuse the heck out of screenshotting in this field. Everything in every meeting when I see a screen is screenshot. I don't care how trivial. From the URL to what not I just screenshot.\n\nIf this is in office, bribe your team members (and other close by office workers (from where you sit)) with occasional cookies/snacks or whatever. Look optimistic and happy and eager. It goes a long way and will help you with your performance reviews indirectly (welcome to life).\n\nAh and the biggest thing. **When you are given a task, stop trying to focus on the task. Try to understand the bigger picture first (the REASON behind the task and so forth). Make sure you focus on that in 1on1 when asking your team members for help on a task.**\n\nIf you focus on 'code logic' context, then you are f-ed. You need to focus on the business/overall reason for why this task was given. And from there form your own opinion and maybe you might come to conclusion \"why is this task needed?\" and so forth which you should be free to ask/voice out. That's critical thinking. That's what software engineering is.\n\n>I (26F) have been working at my job for exactly 1 year.\n\nTook me like over 4 years just to not feel this. And even then I always constantly worry I am not performing to my level. And I studied CS directly unlike you.\n\nTook me over 3 years alone to stop thinking in terms of 'code/task context' to the bigger picture. It's normal. Just put in the hours and your hours will not betray you in the longer run. Fortunately for me I was able to cover up for my incompetence in this side by being extremely proficient/fast at coding but if I didn't have that I probably was truly cooked.",

I don't think that says that much about you. And for that matter, often times, issues with deadlines is not an individual dev problem, but a management problem.\n\n>  And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.\n\nI know the pressure can be hard to avoid, don't work weekends. It's common that deadlines slip and stuff takes longer than expected. It shouldn't generally be a \"work extra\" thing, particularly not for no extra pay. From a practical standpoint, I understand it if your job is on the line (the economy and all), but resist the pressure under normal circumstances.\n\nOverall, sadly, intern positions on solo projects aren't that uncommon, yet are obviously bad for the intern. Mind you, you also don't fit the typical case of an intern, as you are actually a new grad. I think the biggest thing to get used to is the idea that it's okay for work to not be finished. You're not actually being paid by task. And yes, solo projects are strictly worse for a new person (or arguably any person) in pretty much every way (hard to get help, isolating, more likely to have incorrect estimates, etc). You'd probably have a better experience working on a project with an actual team, though I'm not sure how realistic of a possibility that is for you on the short term.",

Maybe not about technical best practices (since those are best learnt while working with a team with seniors directing development and giving you feedback in PRs), but you end up coming out of this with a healthy fear of forced estimates, you learn how to communicate with people who disagree or are displeased with you, and you'll generally perform much better when the inevitable crisis hits at your next job.

If it was as easy as being right or wrong, why don't you just tell yourself \"Ah, I must be wrong\" and stop being burned out 🤦‍♂️\n\nWhat's worth exploring is if there are things you are doing that you have control over that's contributing to your burnout. But once you're burned out, that's it there's no going back. \n\nThe most you can do now is manage what you can at work and take care of yourself better and hope you get better over time or if there's not much in your control then you probably need to leave the situation.\n\nThe only other thing you can do is reexamine the situation to see if there's an end in sight. If there is maybe you can stick it out. But if it's not caused by a specific situation but rather the environment there may be no end in sight and spinning your wheels hoping it'll get better will just lead to worse burnout.\n\nTo me it sounds like you're in a bad environment where they're trying to take advantage of a cheap intern. Internships in the dev industry are supposed to be intros to the company so that an intern can decide if they want to take a job there or not, or they might be part of getting college credit. Smart companies don't make long interns manage a whole giant project with moving parts and deadlines, that'd just be idiotic of them. They should be showing the interns that \"this is a nice place to work and you should come back after you graduate\".\n\nYou now have some good experience now though, I'd say you should cut your losses and take that experience and start hunting for your first full time job.",

It was just \"here's a resume, interview this person, let us know what you think.\" No guidance, not much communication, etc. I've also worked at some companies where I did a pair interview with executives who would just say, \"I'll let you lead,\" because they didn't bother to look at the person's resume.

When the feature needs to be \"done\" by tomorrow, is that code complete or feature complete? If it's code complete, I'd think you still need to leave time for testing and bug fixes before release.\n\nAlso, where's your EM or Tech Lead in all of these convos? \n\nFinally, healthy friction between Product and Engineering is normal as you're working together from different angles to move the project forward.  However, if you're constantly having communication breakdowns, then it might be a convo with your EM to see how you can improve relations and expectation setting.",

Get familiar with those.\n\nChances are, you're spiraling from worrying about some vast surface area of unknowns when you come across a new challenge, instead of just focusing on the one thing in front of you. The reality is you will never be able to tackle that vast surface of unknowns, the field is just too large, and you need to be able to recognize that never knowing everything and making incremental progress over a long stretch of time is normal for everyone.\n\nFor tech projects specifically, the tool you probably want is called a work breakdown structure (WBS). The idea is take the nebulous scary thing and break it into smaller pieces, rinse and repeat until things start to look more concrete. E.g. for a webdev project, maybe there's frontend and backend, and then maybe in the frontend there's pages, and each page has components, and so on, down the rabbit hole you go, until you've got a list of concrete tasks that can be unambiguously be marked as done or not done.\n\nIf you can't tame your panic attacks, then the pragmatic option is stick with your non tech job. Not everyone works jobs they love.",

You simply become another statistic that complains about the job market, because you put in 3,500 resumes and got 4 total responses, 3 of which declined you and one got you through. In my experience so far just doing it by hand I have yet to have a job completely ghost me and I am currently sitting at 12 applications. Mind you these were all declines still, and I will have to hunt for a little while. I do use Ai, specifically for cover letters though, but more of a guidance than fully copy pasting. Everything comes from me, but using Ai to get the thoughts flowing rather than sitting there and spending an hour on each letter that nobody will read just makes sense. I can get the creative juices flowing and type away the letter in about ten minutes or so. So, there is certainly a usefulness to Ai.\n\nI also certainly do not want to tell you which way is better over the other. It is literally a matter of do you want to manually apply to 50 - 200 places and have a higher chance of hearing something back? Or do you just want to apply to every job on the planet and not hear zip except for a couple gold mines? Believe me, there are a ton of people out there not using Ai at all or even experienced it, so they get a letter that sounds like a robot typed it (if they read it), it is going right in the trash. So it is really just that, quality vs quantity, they both can win, and in this situation they both win at the same time and lose at the same time.",

The main problem is that for us, nerdy guys, the main employers are small to mid-sized companies ( startups mainly - \"The backbone of the economy\").\n\nStartups are hiring only when they are profitable now (rarely), mid/large companies prefer to hire offshore and pay a hotdog per hour (bellow 12 bucks) or push for AI. This is the harsh reality: unless you play a major role in the company's security/policy, you are out.\n\nThat's why most jobs are now in Fintech or Healthtech, these are extremely sensitive and offshoring is too risky. How will the business sue someone or make them accountable? Would they even have money to pay? I bet not.\n\nSo, I would probably bet on networking and positioning myself into a role that is essential for any corporation, like cybersecurity or something crucial.",
