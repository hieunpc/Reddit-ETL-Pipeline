The \"silent schema change\" and \"currency confusion\" cases are exactly what drift detection can catch.\n\nI've been working on profiling/drift detection for similar reasons. The pipeline can be green, but if a source system changes how it sends data (format shifts, new status codes, distribution changes), you won't know until someone notices downstream.\n\nWhat I've found useful:\n\n* Track distributions over time, not just point-in-time checks. If average transaction amounts suddenly double, that's a red flag even if the values are technically valid.\n* Monitor schema changes proactively. When a new status code appears or a column's type shifts, alert on it instead of silently dropping data.\n* Compare against historical baselines. A 15% change in distinct customer counts might be normal growth, or it might be double-counting. Context matters.\n\nThe tricky part is reducing false positives—weekend vs weekday patterns, seasonality, etc. I've been using type-specific thresholds and adaptive baselines (moving averages for high-variance columns, prior period for seasonal ones).\n\nSchema and row counts are easy; catching that a source system changed from dollars to cents is harder. That's where statistical drift detection helps.",

How complex the data is and how forward you go towards the insights/analytics layer? If the data is not complex and you insights to be extracted, delegate this to a modelling tool like dbt and use your pipelines to pull data only and trigger dbt to keep it simple. \n\nIf data is complex requiring many normalisations or multiple sources that a simple sql cannot do, threat your pipelines like a library to process data in its context. \n\nBut remember early optimisation is the evil. \n\nSo its not a question of preference, is what you have to do at THIS time to keep it simple, readable and maintainable for your future self without over engineering. This rule is only yours (or maybe also for your team). \nSometimes it is ok to over-bloat one or two flows because you will touch that once in a year and nobody else will or if it fails nobody will get hurt. I personally consider this and also I don't mind to have duplicated code 3x into 3 flows, so the 4th one will justify a refactor.

Mixed experiences. \n\nThe bad:\n- There is at times a large desync when reading and writing to lakehouses and warehouses. PySpark operation will complete and show transformations applied within a session only for the data to not match at the endpoint for... A while. No hard numbers on this but seen others talking about it. Bottlenecks development and is really frustrating. \n\n- The low code solutions are terribly inefficient. My first time testing a basic Dataflow Gen2 operation ran for way too long and had a ridiculously large CU consumption, so if you want to handle ETL processes better get dug into Spark notebooks (I've been using PySpark which is considerably faster and more performant than the Dataflow seemed, not sure how other Spark modules behave) \n\n- Speaking of CU consumption, interrogation of compute is so... Opaque. Want to see how much CU your new code block uses? You're out of luck if you've ran it multiple times for debugging and testing - there's no way to get a granular report on costing. The documentation here isn't much better. \n\n- Managing a traditional Dev -> Prod pipeline feels harder than necessary. Currently I'm running a NonProd/Prod architecture where end users only have access to a workspace with models loaded into a warehouse because as far as I can tell there is no object level security available within a workspace. There's also no way that I've found to directly write across workspaces, so I'm shortcutting my endpoint data in the NonProd workspace to a lakehouse is the Prod workspace, then using cross warehouse T-SQL to create views for the end users.\n\nThe good:\n- For an organisation with a large investment in PowerBI with multiple workspaces and satellite teams within the business, I can see how Fabric might be a good solution that slots in nicely. In it's current state I'm not sure that it pulls ahead of any other architecture solutions. \n\n- It's an interesting playground for less technical users to 'get their hands dirty'; I see the appeal. As mentioned before however, I discounted the low code options pretty quickly so it remains to be seen how this will progress. \n\n- There is native CoPilot integration in Fabric (when set up with the right licence option in workspaces). I haven't tested this out yet but I imagine this will be useful for people in the business to ask questions and interrogate data without requiring models to be built or a knowledge of SQL or PowerBI development. \n\nOverall it's not terrible and if you're already paying for a fabric capacity you're not incurring additional costs if your capacity has headroom. For users with a less technical background I'm not sure if the juice would be worth the squeeze as every end user I've spoken to has gravitated to Dataflows for ETL work as it's familiar to them (it works like an online PowerQuery interface). \n\nMy background is in analytics and I have less experience with data engineering so my observations should be taken with a grain of salt.",

Don't forget to add in upload/download times too.)",

As part of the batch process, an environment variable representing the job number can be accessed via int(os.environ\\['AWS\\_BATCH\\_JOB\\_ARRAY\\_INDEX'\\]). Use this and your mapping from step 2 to get the list of files this job should process.\n5. Make sure all of your jobs succeed and/or check the results bucket to see if all is good.\n\nMaybe there's a more elegant solution that a more seasoned DE would suggest, but this is what I'd do.",

Split queues: platform/ingestion tickets separate from analytics asks, and require an impact brief with an accountable owner and an SLA before any net-new pipeline. Centralize definitions in a semantic layer (LookML, dbt metrics, or Cube) so “revenue” means one thing; DS shouldn’t redefine metrics in notebooks. Add cost/freshness SLOs and auto-archive unused tables after 30 days to keep the estate tidy.\n\nWe run Snowflake with dbt, and DreamFactory lets us expose curated tables as secure REST APIs so product and apps teams ship without custom glue.\n\nYou get closer to that 90% DS focus only when contracts, ownership, and pruning are non-negotiable.",

Could be good for someone who wants to become a dev for a data solution or company like that\n\nAs far as ML and AI, I think this would just be relevant from an operations perspective — eg how hard/expensive would it be to train or infer from a massive amount of data? What are the systems behavior and considerations involved? I don’t think it’s the most relevant topic for advancing an ML/AI career. I would think you’d be better off focusing on how to get quality data for models, which models to use for which scenarios, and in the case of agentic AI the big learning area might be systems integration via things like MCP and how to evaluate for sufficient performance/improvements, plus security. I wouldn’t necessarily expect there to be courses really relating to agentic AI since it’s still so new",

The aim is to stop people editing 'data storage' spreadsheets directly (each form should also be an easy thing to set up).\n\nSo what have we achieved?\n\n- added some level of control over data entry\n- introduced BigQuery, allowing you to start defining transformations in SQL (e.g. Views, Scheduled Queries), and setting up the foundation for the future\n- decoupled data analysis from data storage. Data analysis with spreadsheets reading well-managed data from BigQuery is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight pattern\n- prepared everyone for a future where you have data entry methods write directly to BigQuery, without spooking the horses\n- oh, and for free your data is ready to analyse out of the box with 'Looker Studio' (free, not to be confused with Looker 'proper'), allowing you to set up reasonably nice dashboards",

The docs describe the output in JSON or XML and I get the LLM to turn it into SQL for me.\n2. Basic coding when I forget the syntax. My Python-Fu is not strong and instead up looking up the syntax for filtering a data frame for the 100th time, I tell the LLM to do it. Here's a real example from a few days ago: from <table>, select the most recent <field I need> using the <date> field. You could argue if I didn't use the LLM I would learn the syntax and not have to look it up all the time. You would be correct.\n3. Generating regex expressions from sample data. It's surprisingly good at this.\n4. I had a circular reference in a model a few days go. I knew how to resolve it, but wanted to see how the LLM would approach it. I gave it a screenshot of the UML data model and it actually did a really good, and accurate, job of explaining what the reference was, what caused it and gave a few ways of resolving it.\n5. OCR, but check the results VERY closely. It'll get you about 90% of the way, but I picked up a lot of small errors that on first glance looked ok.\n6. Basic debugging. I use the Agent in Databricks quite a lot. It's good at fixing missing brackets, forgotten imports, and basic stuff like that. More complex stuff is hit and miss so I'll usually debug those myself, but it saves me time looking for a stupid ).\n7. Advanced find and replace. Stuff like, 'In the attached csv, find all instances of x that are postfixed with \":2\" and replace that with :3 if the date in the valid\\_to column is over two months from today.'\n\nIn all cases I check the output because I know they're just advanced statistical models, but I must say I've noticed the accuracy increase in the last year or so.\n\nI probably wouldn't consider this a 'next gen workflow', it's all stuff I can do without an LLM, but it really does save me a huge amount of time. Further, you still need someone who knows the work and what they're doing. There's no way my manager for instance would be able to use the same LLM to do my job without me.",

I work cross-cloud in Azure and GCP managing data pipelines in Databricks or Airflow. I build consumers/producers with Kafka. I work in Python mainly but occasionally run into Java. My role has always been this way for the last 5 years. As a tech lead I also do some product work like epic breakdowns, quarterly planning, sprint planning for my team. I also manage a team of 6 devs and do performance reviews etc. My job isn’t stressful because I push back if a request isn’t reasonable, and if the PM insists on making my team pivot then I insist on dropping an epic to make room for the new work. The only thing that ever gets stressful to me sometimes is dealing with people who either don’t do their job or do their job very badly, and I end up compensating.

The way I think about it is the DB serves as your UI and this simplifies worrying about security and misuse. Not to say these concerns don’t exist, but I don’t feel like they’re as complex to resolve. The real complexity/stress comes in taking disparate data from various systems in various formats, that’s available in disjunct timeframes and making it fit into a cohesive/canonical model that represents how the business/analysts thinks about operations. Applying and understanding business rules can be very difficult/stressful. \n\nInherently I don’t think one or the other is less stressful, it depends on the job and your interests… good luck :)",

Deadlines are everywhere.  Hard-to-diagnose problems are probably everywhere, too, especially when you inherit things.  Sometimes specific tools are worse for it (I've heard comments in this regard about Spark, for example).\n\n\n\nI've done this transition, albeit kind of unconsciously.  It's been good.  Having software background is definitely valuable, I think.  It probably depends some on your stack, but I also think there is *a lot* of crossover.  Especially if you consider that often it's the soft-skills that count, too.\n\n\n\nI started in general development, primarily working on an internal web-based system using .NET Core.  That job started having more and more \"reporting\" work, using the same backend database, but SSRS was the frontend instead.  From there, into an analyst type role, which rapidly became a catch-all ETL-developer-report-builder-platform-admin role.  Last few years it has become more about \"engineering\", admin, and architecture.  I'm very much enjoying it.\n\n  \nEarly on, I did miss working in code that wasn't primarily SQL (and especially wasn't DAX), and the ways in which we did it - like devops processes and dev tools.  I've seen that shift where I am now, partly because team, partly because tool set with us jumping into Databricks.  The inner software dev has much more cause to come back to the surface.  I've been in a position to bring devops practices in.  I'm thinking again about things like encapsulation and DRY.  I was not the whizz-bang top-dog developer, but I picked up some good fundamentals and experience.  It's helpful as a data-focused engineer.\n\n  \nIs DE a good fit for you?  Probably if you have an analytical mind, enjoy the problem-solving, and sometimes having to help discover what that problem really is.  I would also say that it's all just input-to-output.",

Data volume is not a problem here, listing the files - it’s the biggest issue. \nUnfortunately with Glue there is not so much you can do, but next things might help a little:\n1. If possible remove asterix, so you can use recursive lookup and listing won’t take place on driver. Do ‘s3://../parsed-data/us/‘ instead and  .option(recursiveFileLookup\", \"true\")\n2. Increase number of workers\n3. Tune up a config a little bit for working with small files\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes\", 64 * 1024 * 1024) \nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes\",   4 * 1024 * 1024)  \n4. Use repartition instead of coalesce, because your bottleneck is read, not write. \n\n\nBut really, that’s not Spark use case, there is nothing “analytical” about this kind of processing. So the only valid approach - stop producing tons of little files or switch to another technology. You just wasting lot of money by trying to use not suitable technology for a quite trivial job. \nDatabricks have ‘cloudFiles’ functionality to handle such things and it works perfectly, but unfortunately there is nothing similar to it in pure Spark or Glue.",

Keep outputs structured JSON and validate; for long docs, RAG over a small, approved glossary so definitions stay consistent. CI matters: canary prompts with golden answers per dataset, block deploy on regressions.

You can use materialized views to re-order the tables by different sorting keys keeping the data \"raw\" or use clickhouse projections.\n\nIf this is not enough, ask what metrics are needed and the time aggregation (e.g. hour) for certain dashboards and use aggregatedmergetree + materialized views.",

E.g: denormalized data are normalized to store quality data (center of star), then denormalized (dimensions) for reporting for example.  \n2. Generally, it's a combination of the data management stage where we decide sources to use (maybe reliable ones) and define \"rules\", and the data architecture stage where we structure data. For examples, from three sources S1, S2, and S3, maybe we keep only S1 and S3 because data from S2 are not reliable (bad quality). Then data shapes and values from S1 and S3 which may differ at multiple points but generally unique identifier is used (like email), here is where \"rules\" are applied, for example use the email as identifier, set data with no value to NULL, if two other addresses have different values, keep the one which match the phone number, ...  \n3. An example is where instead of creating dimensions which is a transformation, we directly serve the data, and then flexible queries will retrieve them on demand.  \n  \nI hope it helps :)",

Denormalized only means attributes are combined, not that the structure matches the grain or logic needed for reporting. If the current shape works, you can keep it. If it doesn’t, you transform it into whatever structure performs well-normalize first, remodel into facts/dims, or rebuild a wider table. The model itself isn’t the goal; usability and query performance are. So denormalized is different with ready for analytics. Adjust the structure when needed to make it clean, fast, and reliable.\n\n2. Multiple customer sources with different IDs and attributes usually lead to a conformed customer dimension. The goal is to unify identity across systems using a surrogate key, then merge records via deterministic or fuzzy matching rules. You track history using SCD when attributes change over time. From the conformed dimension, you can also generate shrunken dimensions when a specific process only needs a subset of attributes - reducing complexity and improving performance while keeping consistency. The key idea is: one enterprise-wide definition of customer, multiple shapes depending on analytical needs. For more details, you can read the chapter \"Integrate via conformed dimension\" of The Data Warehouse Toolkit.\n\n3. A star schema is part of dimensional modeling and works great for data warehousing because it’s simple, performant, and easy for business users to query. But it isn’t the only modeling approach. Data Vault focuses on flexibility and historical tracking when dealing with many changing data sources, while the Inmon approach builds a 3NF enterprise warehouse before data marts, or One Big Table stores data in wide-tables,... Each method has strengths and trade-offs, so the right choice depends on requirements - speed to deliver, data complexity, volume, regulatory needs.",

If so, you may find it more useful to create a set of compound keys (which could also be expressed in a singular column as a hashkey, which is my preference) - which contain all identifier columns that make each record unique. \n\nThen there's a question of data consistency - are we dealing with slowly changing dimensions or static facts? You don't want to create a key with nulls in it, but equally so you don't want to establish a new record each time a customer updates their info. So much of these considerations are determined by both the business logic at the point of collection (data source) and the desired update pattern for your tables.\n\nGetting this all diagrammed out alongside mapping out the business rules ahead of the engineering process will make everyone's work much easier, as at that point it's mostly plug-and-play to build your DDL and DML pieces.\n\nAs much as I personally bristled at Medallion architecture when I was first introduced to it, I realized you can think of your raw sources as the bronze layer, the normalized star schema as the silver layer, and all downstream transformations as your gold layer. Alternatively, you can stick with the classic approach of a raw dataset, staging tables, production tables, and data marts for specific user groups if your governance plan allows for it/business needs require it. You can also mix and match with materialized views substituting for tables if they fit your needs and your platform supports them.\n\nThis doesn't work for all types of data or use cases, but hopefully gives you something to work with and learn from.",

This means you can run Python anywhere, and not limited by what Snowpark or similar platforms allow you to do with dbt Python models.\n   * Bruin uses `uv` in the background, meaning that your pipelines will work even if you don't have Python installed, and each task runs separately in isolated environments.\n* Native column-level lineage in open-source and open-source [VSCode/Cursor extension](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/vscode-extension/overview.html).\n* Bruin allows [defining policies](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/policies.html) in code to apply your SQL statements, e.g. \"this SQL model must have an owner\" or \"it must follow these rules\". You can enforce these in your ci/cd pipelines.\n* `bruin validate` validates all your queries via dry-run to check if they are valid, this means invalid code never lands. \n* Bruin contains embedded sqlfluff for linting with your existing rules.\n* Bruin has an open-source MCP server to let agents build/help with your T layer.\n* dbt has \\`doc\\` macro, Bruin contains a built-in [glossary](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/glossary.html) instead.\n\nBoth tools are useful in their own ways, and share different approaches, hope this comparison is helpful.",

Airbyte and Pipelinewise are good, but as you noticed, they can be brittle with type mismatches. Debezium is great but only if you want to own the complexity.\n\nIf you end up syncing Postgres into a warehouse and need the targets to stay correct without juggling all the CDC edge cases, a real-time sync layer such as Stacksync can help keep those tables aligned so you don’t have to chase failures down the chain.",

For Protobuf, if you have a descriptor set (.desc), protoc --decode or grpcurl (with reflection or -protoset) gets you readable output; with Confluent’s Protobuf support, the same schema‑id header flow applies. Redpanda Console or Conduktor are nice when you want a UI that decodes messages against the registry. Confluent Schema Registry and Redpanda Console do the heavy lifting day‑to‑day; DreamFactory has been handy when I need a quick REST shim around decoded records plus schema lookup.\n\n\n\nIf you build a visual inspector, make it registry‑aware (Confluent/Karapace), handle Avro/Protobuf wire headers, accept .desc files, and show schema diffs; otherwise quick scripts will still win.",

Since everything is staying inside GCP, there are no data egress costs either. When it comes to cost efficiency, you can't beat free, and you could even use this as a selling point for your clients.

That might include starting your own project, or applying yourself to solving some of the \"meta\" that you currently have to deal with. Say you're currently writing and deploying SQL to meet certain requirements. Take what you're doing, and see if you can't automate it.\n\nPython's got a bunch of useful modules that you can bend to meet your ends - between a bit of NLP and for example sqlfluff, it should be possible to put something together to write your SQL for you, document it, run tests and then deploy it for you.\n\nNobody will ever hand you a pre-packaged career that will always be interesting, you have to dig for the interesting stuff yourself. That will keep you busy, and (hopefully) in an interested, learning, developing mindset - it's not ideal, but you'll at least be more in control. Meanwhile, keep an eye open for something that you'll feel more excited about.",

        "body": "Hi,\n\nYes, it’s definitely possible to retrieve this kind of metadata. Power BI (and now Fabric) provides several REST APIs that can help you. One of the most useful ones for your scenario is the **Get Activity Events** API:\n\n[Admin - Get Activity Events - REST API (Power BI Power BI REST APIs) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/admin/get-activity-events)\n\nThis API gives you detailed activity logs, including actions like **ViewReport**, **EditReport**, **CreateReport**, and more. It covers most of the user interaction events you mentioned. A few key points:\n\n* **Permissions:** You need to be a Fabric (Power BI) Administrator to access activity data for the entire tenant.\n* **Retention:** The API provides data for the past **30 days**.\n* **Format:** The output is JSON, which you can easily process and load into Snowflake or any other data warehouse.\n\nIf you want to go deeper (e.g., dataset usage, queries, refresh history), there are other APIs like:\n\n* **Get Refresh History** for semantic models\n* **Get Reports / Get Datasets** for metadata\n\nYou don’t need Purview for this; the audit logs are part of the Power BI service itself. Purview is more for data governance and lineage.\n\nIf you’re planning to replicate what you did in your previous org (loading into Snowflake), you can schedule calls to these APIs and push the data into Snowflake via an ETL process or a simple script.",

After completing it, you'll have a solid foundation in data engineering, but there's always more to learn, of course.\n\nOne downside is that they used AI voices for most of the videos, and when they do have real people in the videos, you can tell that most of them are reading from a script. Another thing is that it focuses on IBM's offerings in the data engineering space, when offerings from other companies are much more popular in the job market. It is an IBM cert, though. Why wouldn't they teach you IBM stuff? Fortunately, they made a lot of the IBM-specific parts of the courses optional.\n\nIf you can get past the negatives, it's a pretty solid starting point for getting into data engineering.",

For this specific table we would do a initial load from 2015 to today if we would build the table now and then starting from tomorrow we would load a full year back every day. When loading, we would then compare only records going one year back as otherwise the query would close all records between 2015 and the 28th of November 2024. \n\n3. Yeah, considering Iceberg here! Played with it and the \"timestamp\" function really makes it way easier to go back then playing with the valid from/ valid to date columns. \n\nThe only thing i can't get my head around is. When we would use snapshots instead of SCD2, then i  assume it would be something like:\n\n\\- Initial load - All rows ranging from 2015 - today with snapshot date today (\\~12 mln rows)\n\n\\- Every day after today - All rows for the last 365 days - snapshot date of that specific date (\\~1 mln rows)\n\nIt adds 365 mln. rows in a year and when i want to know the last version of a PK on a specific date i would need to partition by and order by the PK to get the latest version. Thereby, if a record gets deleted in the source system there's no way to mark it in my append only db without making a SCD2 kind of script that fills in a valid\\_to or is\\_deleted flag. i'm probably wrong but the snapshot system seems to be best fit in cases you know your source system will never delete anything.",

If records are deleted in source ( in the last 366 days) and you want to remove it form snapshot, it is also possible via Iceberg.

The use case you describe, barring any complexities, is actually one of the more common use cases for MV. \n\n[(The following use cases highlight the value of materialized views.

Fabric has a CDC/Copy job feature and you can also use Delta Change Data Feed in Lakehouse tables to capture row-level changes for reliable upserts.   \n(3) automate discovery of new tables by keeping a metadata table or using the Fabric REST/metadata APIs in a pipeline to list Lakehouse tables and loop over them to create/update copy jobs. Community threads show people scripting this when they need to scale. \n\nAbout schema drift: Fabric’s copy tools can do mapping but they are not perfect at automatically absorbing arbitrary schema changes for all workloads. If you expect frequent schema churn, consider an ELT pattern: keep canonical data in the Lakehouse and run periodic MERGE queries from Lakehouse into Warehouse tables (or materialized views) using the Delta CDF or SQL MERGE so you have deterministic upserts. \n\nIf you want a starting checklist: pick Copy job for initial load, enable incremental or CDC for high-change tables, build a pipeline that enumerates tables and triggers jobs for new ones, and use Delta CDF or MERGE for schema-safe upserts. If you want, I can sketch a simple pipeline loop (pseudo-SQL and pipeline steps) you could drop into Fabric.",

Oftentimes if DE's are a part of an analytics group, you are treated as an analyst or at least not as a serious engineer.\n\nFor me another con of this offer is it's in the healthcare industry. I worked in healthcare before and I hated it. The kind of people you deal with are not technical, rooted in legacy ways, and rely a lot on Excel. You'll pick up domain knowledge in the healthcare field which can help you get other healthcare engineering jobs, which will suffer from the same things.

But imo there are 2 different types of data engineer. 1 more swe focused and 1 more sql focused. Swe focused ones pay the same and sql ones are usually a little less. An example is at my company I am under the swe name but work on and own some DE and my org is paid very well. But we also own the data for lots of high priority ML products. \n\nI also think saying data is a cost center is just not super true. I think a lot of companies are viewing data as a service. ML teams require lots and lots of data that is accurate and growing in complexity. This requires lots of work. Most companies are putting a lot of money towards data teams now and are viewed as essential.\n\nSo in terms of pay I think this is a non factor (there are more important factors like what company you work at and how fast you grow and promote). Unless you just straight prefer be work over de work (fair as it’s subjective but I’ve enjoyed it), then  you shouldn’t worry too much.",

I would avoid low code personally as it lacks flexibility and you get locked into a platform or face a huge rewrite based on XML output to switch.  Dbt at least is SQL with some jinja that you can pretty easily port to something  else.  Also I rarely  hear about this platform so likely you will have a hard time finding developers that know it and those numbers are declining as the industry has moved on from such platforms.  \n\nI saw coalesce in a demo once and it looked interesting, but didn't really get a feel for how it worked since the demo was about something else.

A job doesn't need to be something you're passionate about, a job needs to be something you can tolerate doing every day, even on days you're feeling uninspired, even on days you kinda feel like shit. Having at least mild interest in the job helps with that, but it's not the focus. Interest and passion is something that better comes from your *life*. A job is how you pay for it.\n\nMy direction after art school was getting a phd in math and working in machine learning, and that's something I never would have thought I would find fun until I did it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone else, it was just something I resonated with when exploring, and my interest in it is unique to me. What I would recommend is not being afraid to change direction if you realize the path you're on is making you miserable. If you really can't stand compsci, don't power through the degree, all that does is set you up to do something every day that you hate. But if you pivot, don't look for passion, look for stability, for contentment with the day to day. A good sign is if something seems *kinda fun*. Not amazing, not cool, not noble, not virtuous.

It's disappointing but usually the point of degrees is to get a good source of income, what the current state of degrees in your country's economy is matters too. \nEdit; but take my advice with a grain of salt. Because if you are ready to face any economic hardship, or living in shitty apartments or not having any stable career, if you have enough passion (not just interest eg '\" I really like this but I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it either but true burning passion & dedication)) you know what you want with it and if you're ready to face anything for it, who knows there is always a possibility it'll work out",

I'm still looking for work, but part of this was my own doing for not doing a technical internship while I was in school and not doing more personal projects (I want to teach as a 2nd career, so I tutored/did teaching jobs for CS during my summers. At the time tech was still stable, so I did not think I had to do a technical internship. You live, make choices, and you learn). \n\nI'd think about first why you hate CS and why you have negative feelings about it. For people I've tutored, usually their hatred for CS was resentment for not pursuing their passions, feelings of frustration for not understanding the material (often trying to do the work alone), math phobias, not connecting with the material, or a mixture of those reasons. All extremely valid reasons and reasons often reliant on your environment (bad profs, depression, lack of community, etc). \n\nBefore you decide to jump ship from CS, be extremely honest with yourself. Did you give CS your full effort? This means if you had the time, did you attend Office hours, talk to your professors, try to talk to peers, go to tutoring (if you could afford/uni offered it), join CS clubs, etc? If the answer is no, then something was holding you back from giving it a full shot, so you need to figure out what that is and if it's within your control to get past it. Some people, even with the best tutors, need more time to learn STEM subjects than the 4 years expected out of uni- this is completely normal, but may not be a financial option for all students (which is an unfortunate position to be during later years of uni and will require some tough decisions).\n\nIf you have managed to stay in your CS program this far without acidemic probation, then you likely understand *some* aspects of code, but too many knowledge gaps are there to make you see the big picture (which in CS is important, its when everything begins to click). With enough hustle, I think you can salvage the rest of your degree and make it through- but this will require complete humility to get there. You making this reddit post in full honesty about your knowledge gaps makes me think you might be able to do it. Next steps would be scheduling meetings with your profs, get a tutor if possible, talk to your GTAs, joining study groups, etc. The key part of wanting anyone to support you in your success is to take the initiative (with humility) and be consistent (show up, do the work). I've had students reach out to me with failing grades halfway through the course with humility, and it was that act of bravery that lead to them passing the class (if they put the work in).\n\n\nMy best advice is to find a prof you like/trust in your CS department and have an honest convo with them. I'd also schedule an appointment with career services and talk to them too (you pay a ton of money to be in uni- use your resources!!!). Ask them if there is a realistic way for you to finish your degree with the knowledge gaps or if it's for the best you switch. I know plenty of people that made CS a minor and switched to business with a technical component- there could be options you aren't aware of, but you need to have those conversations with people who have that knowledge.\n\nEven if you do switch- get that internship! It's extremely important in this job market, and the easiest way to get and prove you have experience.\n\nGood Luck! Always happy to chat further. I have personally supported many CS students to find the acidemic path right for them (even if it meant a different major) and also helped many find the fun in CS to get through it (a lot actually went from hating to loving CS). I will say in learning anything, community is extremely important to help you get over hurdles and where you need to go, so don't take any resources you have for granted :)",

But you're old enough now where the income has to be a factor in these decisions.   \nIn summary, just figure out how you're going to make $80k per year and all the other answers will come to you and when the answers arrive you won't have any doubts.

It will essentially go through line by line, and then look for similarities to the library. I can only think of how to apply it to essays and papers, but it could be:\n\n1. Step 1: Start with similar words. The checker will take the piece you're working on, and compare similar words to others. If the piece you're working on reveals a high number of shared words, then it gets \"flagged\" for further examination. \n2. Step 2: Take the piece you're comparing, and the other pieces of work that share some close similarities, and then reveal similar phrases/sentences. If the similar phrases ended up being long enough (multiple words/sentences), then the likelihood that it was plagiarized increases. (ie: a phrase \"too bad\" isn't going to flag it, but if someone quotes a full abstract from a scientific paper then it flags it as copied).\n3. Step 3: determine a way to program it to detect plagiarism vs referencing/quoting other works. You'd have to look up formatting options (like the usage of quotation marks, and other steps required to reference other notations). \n4. Step 4: Iterate and reiterate the process until it becomes better, faster, or more robust. \n\nFor code and math, especially on the lower scale like cs50, it's harder because a lot of the solutions for dedicated questions have 1 solution. But if you had a \"custom project\", where the person has to come up with their own project that isn't guided, then you can determine if they've copied work based on what they end up with.",

Then you keep building several until it looks a little less crappy. Then you build other objects and repeat the process. If you do that enough times, you'll naturally pick up other tools and methodologies that'll help you with your building. Over time, you'll be able to start building a house with your experience. \n\n\nYou won't know what many tools are called, names of all the screws, and the best way to use everything. You just pick them up and try them out, learning as you build things.\n\n\n.\n\n\nYou're a **beginner** trying to build a house (Minecraft mods) when you don't even know what a hammer does (Java). Of course that'll feel overwhelming. \n\n\nFirst, play around with Java. Follow a tutorial or two about it. Maybe do a course or make something cool. There's no \"am I ready?\" You're ready whenever you say you're ready, whether that's after a 1hr yotube playlist or a several week MOOC. You'll *never* know everything about Java. Never. You can get a PhD in CS with Java and not know how to build a single project. Fortunately, you don't need to know *everything* about Java or CS to accomplish your goals. \n\n\nDon't let that lack of knowledge make you afraid to start building with it. You can start building things even after a simple 1hr tutorial. It would be a far cry from MC mods (little chair vs a hige house), but it's definitely enough to start your journey. \n\n\nI'd probably go through a beginner course utilizing Java. Udemy? Coursera? mooc.fi? Pick your poison. Anything works. [Pick one of the links at the beginning and get started](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/1kla4xc/comment/ms0p7yn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n\nI'd probably go for the Udemy one. Hyperskill is more expensive, but it'll probably be the easiest intro to Java. The mooc is probably going to be very in-depth, and very hard, but free. Probably overkill. Coursera might have some free courses. There are many. Just choose whatever beginner Java course you can find. \n\n\nWhatever your choice is, just go through it until you know a little bit about Java. Your goal is simple exposure and to be able to build small little things that output into a terminal. They likely won't teach you how to build things in MC and you may be exposed to a lot of concepts you won't find immediately useful. Just get comfortable seeing code, using code, and thinking like a programmer.\n\n\nDon't go down a rabbit hole of things (remember the PhD comment?). Java can build practically anything, so you'd be able to learn so much without achieving your goals. Just get the basics down until you're comfortable. \n\n\n.\n\n\nOnce you have a basic understanding of what Java is, go straight into learning how to mod.\n\n\n[Here's one resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1csh3yp/comment/l44waul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Here's another](https://www.mcjty.eu/docs/intro)\n\n\nThere are a lot.\n\n\nDon't freak out. You won't know anything really. The above Java stuff was just getting you used to the hammer, nails, properties of wood, etc (depending on the resource, you may have built a chair or two).\n\n\nThis, however, is the real deal. You're actually going to start building chairs, and it's going to suck and it will look like crap. You won't even know a lot of the things being talked about and you'll feel like you're at the very beginning again. That's okay and perfectly normal. You have to acquire a few more tools, but Java is the biggest learning curve and the one everything interacts with, so it's the one I recommended getting comfortable with first. \n\n\nGo through tutorial after tutorial about Minecraft mods, follow the beginner steps, and try to recreate things as they do it. Then try to do it again without the video, pausing each time. Then try to manipulate what you've created, or even break it. Then try to repeat the entire process from scratch until you recreate it (minus the setting up your tools part).\n\n\nThen move on to the next tutorial. Once you've acquired enough small skills, try to go about building a simple little thing yourself (you can even try after your first tutorial). This simple thing might be insanely hard. You might have to reference different documentation and videos to help you out. Once you finally finish it, try to improve it. Try to recreate it if you really want to reinforce the knowledge. \n\n\nThen move onto the next idea. \n\n\nOnce you do that enough, you should be able to see other people's source code for their projects and be able to pick out little bits and pieces that you might want to try yourself, or research about to see what it does. Try to contribute to an open source mod or pull from their projects and play around with the code. \n\n\nThat series of building is what will eventually get you to creating your own big ideas. \n\n\nPeople legit go through the Kaupenjoe videos (first link) without even knowing *any Java* and successfully learn how to build projects after a year. You can start that way too, but I thought maybe it'd feel better knowing a little bit about Java first (if you already don't know anything). If you're overwhelmed, skip everything I told you and go straight to that. It'll be very hard and scary, but learning to program is a marathon, not a single sprint.\n\n\n.\n\n\nI can't really help you beyond that. Things take time. Don't stress about memorizing everything, being perfect in everything you do, or finding the best paths. Just progress, 1hr a day, every single day. \n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nA painter doesn't get good after their first stick figure. They do tens of thousands of failed small attempts that build up to the occasionally solid large attempt. As they build up their skills from a ton of small, crappy projects, the eventually move onto more and more quality on each piece. \n\n\nTheir skills don't manifest from perfecting their pain brush, getting the best pigments they can, or knowing absolutely everything they can about color theory. \n\n\nDon't worry about getting the best tutorial, learning Java perfectly, and being overwhelmed by all these new ideas. Just go through the first thing you see related to MC mods, that makes sense to you, and work up your skills, little by little. ",

You will be overwhelmed, drained, annoyed and disappointed regardless. Learning is never a cake walk. You'll hit barriers and it will take effort to get over them. Programmers are just the people who stuck with it longer than others. Nothing special about them. \n\nA good way to retain what you learn is trying to apply it to your goal. Since you have one already that's excellent and a great motivator. Every time you learn something think of how you can apply it to that goal of making apps and modding Minecraft. No matter how small there is always a way to apply it. \n\nThe first language is always the toughest. You're not only learning the syntax of a language and how to order things, but you're also learning computer science concepts at the same time. Once you get the concepts though you can easily transfer that knowledge to another language or project. It's like you're building a house. You need to learn how to hammer nails and which screws go where. But you also need to learn how to make a foundation and how to support a roof. \n\nSo keep it up. You can't force things so take breaks and decompress and let things sink in. You won't become making apps tomorrow, but you can learn the building blocks a little bit every day or every other day or even once a week. Persistence is the name of the game.",

You learn *out* rather than you learn *up* if that makes any sense. And you advance in terms of your general maturity, rather than specific knowledge building on each other as theorems imply further theorems. \n\nThe other thing is that programming sits in this place between academia and a trade, where there’s a ton of “craft” and professional knowledge that exists in the form of essentially folk wisdom transmitted via forums and blogs, not books. \n\nAll that is to say, it’s harder to curate a list like you imagine, and there’s going to be way more disagreement about it when they do.\n\nHere is a list of articles about software which I think are all excellent, but decidedly mostly on the advanced side.

Tech is arguably one of the most community oriented STEM fields out there, especially evident in it's history. Lean into this strength!\n\nI guarentee you have at least 5 classmates who feel exactly like you. Next time you go to class, talk to a few classmates and ask them if they are doing any side projects, how they feel about leetcode, etc. Do not feel discouraged if you hear a few people talk about their side projects/ease with leetcode- find comfort in being aware of people more knowledgeable than you in your community- you can learn a lot from them! \n\nOnce you got enough feelers, start figuring out what you want to do with that info. Is someone working on a side project that sounds interesting? Then see if you can do something similar or ask if there is any way you can join in on it. Are a lot of students struggling too? Then form a study group together and collectively figure out what projects you can work on either together (get that github practice in) or independently. Even if you are surrounded by many people who \"have it together\", ask them what got them there and how you can be more involved. Whatever you do with the feelers, make sure it's rooted in community and doing work consistently. Personal projects have really frustrating hurdles, so you need that support system to get you to keep going.\n\nYour professors are also goldmines of knowledge too, so ask them what types of personal projects you can work on or some general guidance- literally email them to schedule a meeting.\n\nIf there is one thing college gives you, it's the opportunity to connect with people (your first network). One of the best lessons I took away from college is it only takes one person to get the momentum to build a community- so if you can't find community that will help you grow, then that is a sign you need to put in the work to build it. The other big lesson I learned in college is that people really admire someone who openly wears humility and accountability on their sleeve- it builds trust and leaves room for stronger connections to grow.\n\n\nWhenever I have feelings of imposter syndrome kicking in with thoughts like \"I could never achieve x\", I pause and ask myself \"But why not me?\". And I keep asking why until I have measurable steps I can take to improve.\n\nHope that helps! Even with the stuff we are passionate about, it's easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when we try to tackle it alone. Most of the time, a bunch of people feel the same as you and are waiting for *anyone* to say the frustrations/insecurities no one else is saying outloud.",

The real metric of general knowledge/skill is what projects you have made. Since you say you haven't made anything, the best time to start making a project is right now, whenever you have some free time to spare. Pick something you find interesting and just start making it. The hardest thing is looking at a blank editor, but once you write the first few lines (even if it's just a bunch of comments outlining the general program flow you are going to implement), you'll naturally fall into a pipe-line of problems you have to solve, allowing you to iteratively reach a solution over time. There's no shame in using google or any other forms of documentation, everyone does it, and if they don't then they're either lying or making something trivial. The only thing I'd avoid, or at least use with extreme caution, is any form of generative A.I. Ideally, you'd use it as a tool or a tutor, asking it to explain concepts or answer some questions you might have. However, in reality most people (especially beginners/learners!) fall into the trap of having the A.I. do everything for them, and essentially \"outsource\" their thinking to the machine. By that point, you may as well not waste your time, since you will learn nothing.\n\nYou should also avoid falling into the trap of \"collecting\" languages as if they are Pokemon. You should be focusing on language-agnostic concepts, which can be implemented in a variety of languages (some of which will be better suited than others to whatever you're making). Of course, it's ideal to have a basic grasp of the language you are going to use, but if you're firm in your language-agnostic concepts, it will be easy to just pick up the syntax along the way.\n\nAs an answer to your question, it's definitely not over. You just need to change your approach to education. And you need to ask yourself if you really enjoy Computer Science, because if you do, then everything you do will feel a lot less arduous.",

Keep in mind if you have no gone to college or taken a lot of high level CS/math courses, there might be a language barrier between academic speak and how you are used to reading things, but it can be learned just like anything else.\n\nAlso, books are great and more comprehensive in my opinion.  You say you want to get into a website; I HIGHLY recommend checking out Jon Ducketts HTML/CSS, Javascript/JQuery,MySQL/PHP books if you ever have some extra money.  They are absolutely excellent, and while they use some outdated tech like JQuery and PHP, I think they really teach you the fundamentals of web development to allow you to harness the power of whatever is at your disposal rather than relying on cobbling together frameworks.  \n\nHope you find some other good stuff as well, good luck!",

Postgres migrations, RLS rules, serverless functions, auth flows, environment variables across local and production, production/preview deployments, recreating the wheel instead of using battle tested code, running 2/3 projects in parallel, trying to get plugins to work together that don't offer api, customizations the whole stack… I touched all of it way before I “should have,” but it forced me to actually understand how systems fit together instead of just syntax.\n\nThe wild part is I used to think feeling confused meant I wasn’t good enough.

I’d highly suggest pairing the study with personal projects in between each section (make a couple things in python after the python section, redo the https section without the sites help, etc) and it can become more. \n\nI was able to make a game review site with database, front and back end in full though wildly unpolished. \n\nI don’t expect myself to be able to break into a job position without a ton more practice and luck for a job opening and place I can work being willing but I can easily see someone more diligently studying using boot.dev capable. I echo advice from the YouTube programmers with no matter how you study, make sure you are making things on the side all the time, especially things that that fix problems you have so you can have more natural investment.",

The fact you built it and it's functional is RIDICULOUSLY good.  This will help you when you are interviewing as well.  They will ask \"blah blah\" and instead of the standard boilerplate response everyone else gives you are gonna be able to be like\n\n\"Oh man I had this weird DB table issue and I just couldn't figure it out.  Took me like 2 days of just troubleshooting and debugging and then I realized it was this thing\" or something along those lines\n\nWhen I was a part of the hiring team we looked at projects but if it wasn't \"polished\" we didn't care cuz we know what it takes to get a polished site done and it's not just one person it's like 10 LOL\n\nKEEP IT UP",

I would create a static instance of the class and try to do everything with that.\n\nI finally understood that a class is essentially a \"cookie cutter\". You use it to create an object which looks like the class. Then you call the methods on that object. The reason you would want to do this is because you have multiple objects which are essentially the same, or similar. \n\nFor example, take the ghosts in Pac-Man. You could write this by declaring X and Y co-ordinate variables for each ghost, but then you'd have a bunch of variables like ghost1x and ghost3y and ghost4x and so on. Think about how writing collision detection would work. You'd have to check if ghost1x==playerx && ghost1y==playery || ghost2x==playerx && ghost2y==playery.... nightmare.\n\nInstead, define a ghost class, and instantiate it four times, once for each ghost. The ghost class could include a collision detection function, to check if its *instantiation* hit the player. Now you can just write something like:\n    if greenGhost.hitPlayer()\n        player.gotCaught()\n\nYou don't have to worry about how the calculation of the collision detection works any more -- at least, that is the theory.\n\nHave you searched for beginner-friendly OOP tutorials outside of video sites?

The real way you learn OOP isn’t by studying diagrams, it’s by modeling small real systems, giving each class a clear responsibility, and avoiding the “giant class with 20 methods” trap. That shifts your thinking from: the procedural way: “What steps do I need to do?” to the OOP way: “What objects exist in this world, and what responsibilities do they have?”\n2. Tutorials don’t teach design, books do. If you want actual design and not just syntax, these beginner-friendly resources are gold: **\"Head First Design Patterns\"**: the best intro to OOP thinking, **\"Practical Object-Oriented Design\"**: very readable and extremely practical, and **\"Refactoring improving design of existing code\"**: not OOP-specific, but teaches you to *see* structure and smell bad design\n3. Another underrated tip: read good OOP code. Python libraries, open source github repositories, or even frameworks.\n4. On the language choice: Python can teach you OOP, but it’s a multi-paradigm language, so beginners often get mixed signals. If you want the concepts to crystallize faster, something more “pure OOP” like Java, C#, or Ruby tends to make the underlying principles way clearer. Once it clicks, you can apply it in any language.\n\nAnd honestly, everyone writes procedural code inside classes at first. Keep going. The moment it clicks, it really clicks.",

You’re receiving formatted text that your host binds to a handing method which in turn returns formatted text. Taking the long view, Rest is simply a point of view that “the http verb in the formatted text header should dictate the operation” which replaced the previous opinion which more or less said “just use post or get for that mandatory verb header and name your operation in the relative path and the name should usually match the handling method so you can find things”. Neither is wrong. People just have strong opinions about formatted text. \n\nBonus: If you really want to annoy people, go take the position that soap with xsd-defined payloads is more precise, more extensible, and can be more secure than rest with json (it is) and that devs were simply too lazy to learn the spec. It’s a bit better now that swagger (open api) is more mainstream, but for a while rest was a real pain to consume.\n\nThe next thing to remember is that your reaction is valid and you’re often going to have more tailored controller services for web front ends. These aren’t enterprise APIs. They’re part of the same logical application and are only services because the halves run on two different computers. Otherwise they would just be helper or data layer methods. We do this because chattiness and sequential service call latency is the death of web pages. So if a commonly used page needs a getMyStuff composite method that returns a splittable json payload in one hit, that’s not crazy. \n\nIf you need that to be available generically, you can expose a graphql or composite endpoint that allows you to specify an object and specific children and fields.

If it’s a 16-bit short, the CPU may have to do a bit of extra work to align the data properly to a word boundary, especially if you’re going to run vector calculations.\n\nOf course, in 99.99% of cases, this probably doesn’t matter and you should optimise for correctness, for readability, and for efficient algorithms.

That being said I'm not sure if there are any FP units that do 64 bit faster than 32 bit.\n\nAs for your programs, you should always ask why you need more precision.   IEEE supports FP32, FP64 and FP128 as for what you are calling shorts I suspect that is language dependent and is not a floating point type.   Often we are talking about \"floats\" as 32 bits and \"doubles\" as 64 bits (C++).  There is also a potential for long doubles.   Again in the context of C++, shorts are integer types, so shorts would almost always be faster than the floating point unit.   The big but is that this can be execution unit dependent.    I can't help with C# as i know zip about it, but if shorts are integers there then you might want to look into your understanding of the language.   Integers and floats have two different use cases.    it is important to understand that floats are approximations.\n\nSo when you ask which is faster, you need to ask what hardware is it running on.   GPU's can really muck things up because of special types and optimizations.    One of those optimizations is what can be done in parallel.    For example if the GPU (for example) 128 16 bit integer operations per cycle as opposed to say 32 doubles per cycle which is faster?    What I'm trying to say here is that it depends on the specifics of language and hardware the code runs on.   In the made up numbers above the processor would complete 4x more operations per cycle.\n\nCaches are a wholly different discussion.   Generally shorter types means more data in cache but you also need to consider cache line length and other behaviors.   If you have truly time critical code you may need to optimize for cache behavior on a specific processor.    It is completely possible to arrange things (floating point operations) such that cache might not be a problem compared to integer.",

        "body": "on most cpu, there is a lot of conversion going on.  The FPU converts all floating point type to a large type with excess bits to help reduce errors, so those floats get a double (pun?!) conversion from their 32 bit value to a 80 or 120 or whatever it is now bit value, the computations are done, and it gets converted back again to the smaller value.  Integers don't suffer as much of this on some hardware, it just depends.  X86 type chips for example has overlapped registers for 1, 2, 4, and 8 byte integers all in the same physical circuits, so it does not have to promote a 32 bit int to a 64 bit and back to do the computations.   Also, integer circuitry \\*in general\\* is simpler than floating point, due to how it has to handle the exponent and base for floats while integers are pretty much simple math.  I mean a multiply in binary is either a copy of the value (multiplied by 1) or all zeros (by zero) so a multiply is just steps that shift and add.  A multiply in floating point is notably more complicated.\n\nI don't know the modern timings.  FPUs are VERY fast.  Integer math circuits are also VERY fast.  But all things being equal, the extra work for floating point makes me feel pretty confident that its probably at least microscopically slower than integer math if you can actually do the same work using both types.  It may take a billion plus repeated operations to show a meaningful difference when timing it, though.  And repeated operations MAY skip the double conversion stuff, if you are working with the same entity over and over that would be optimized to have far less impact, so the actual task being tested matters a lot too.\n\ncache and bus stuff outside the CPU has an impact, and THERE, bigger is not better.  Its a totally different conversation.\n\nLanguage does matter, at least somewhat.  Or the compiler, and how good it is.  Some less popular languages may not have the A team working on the compilers the way we have for big languages like c++ and so on, as one issue.   Others stuff like interpret vs compiled can make a big difference.",

But the AI isn’t entirely wrong, it’s just answering a question that doesn’t matter for you.\n\n\nModern CPUs are optimized for 32/64-bit operations, and short arithmetic can require extra sign-extension instructions. Float SIMD (SSE/AVX) is also absurdly well-optimized compared to integer SIMD. So in a tight loop doing pure math on individual values, floats can genuinely be faster per-operation.\n\n\nBut that’s not what data-oriented design is about. The win from smaller types is memory bandwidth and cache — if you’re iterating over millions of values, smaller types mean more fit in a cache line, fewer misses, faster overall. The AI conflated ALU throughput with memory access patterns, which are completely different concerns.\n\n\nNone of this matters unless you’re in a game engine’s hot path or crunching massive datasets. In normal application code, you’ll burn way more time on the code smells: constant casts when APIs expect int, subtle bugs from implicit narrowing, maintaining mental overhead about which precise type lives where.\n\n\nConstrained types absolutely make sense for semantic clarity though — using sbyte for a deck index or ushort for a port number communicates intent and gives you some compile-time bounds enforcement.

Gives a lot of learning opportunity. You need to think what tools you need to use, how to use them, etc.\n2. Similar to 1, but it's more about some domain knowledge. e.g. if you decide to build a language learning tool, you'd probably research some established tools and will either copy their UI/UX or even improve them. You'd understand what challenges users have while using these kinds of apps, etc\n3. Builds confidence. Once you have a couple of very small projects under your belt, you can gradually move to more and more complex ones. Over time, you will feel more and more confident in your skills\n4. Builds your portfolio that you can show to your potential employer.

        "body": "I can't answer questions 1 and 2 because I have no certifications, just my degree. That isn't to say getting a certification would definitely be worthless, but in my mind, if your goal is to be able to show a potential employer \"Hey, I can do X thing,\" it's actually probably more effective to just focus on talking about interesting projects you've done (don't need to be external to school, can just be school assignments or final projects) at a level that shows that you have a good conceptual grasp of what you were doing, along with some experience with the tools that are common to the industry you're interested in. Tools that you might get asked about are ones related to version control (e.g., git), debugging (e.g., gdb), and unit testing (lots of options, and you may not use anything formal for this purpose, which is also OK). It is not necessary to fully master any one tool, you're just trying to signal \"Hey, I have used these tools as part of my process, and I can fairly quickly pick up different ones that do the same job.\"\n\nAs for questions 3 and 4 about what else you should be doing right now and how to stand out, I will first say that I admire your willingness to think ahead. On the other hand, I will also say that you should not feel compelled to do extra work beyond what is already being assigned to you at school. This is because, imo, the amount of hard work and effort it takes to stand out is not worth the payoff *if* your only goal with that effort is to stand out a little more. Your driving motivator should just be what you're interested in, especially because what you're interested in may change, which can lead to you going into a different field than the one you're currently considering, at which point any past hyper-specific work done for the purpose of standing out may not be very useful to you.\n\nThat being said, projects are a good place to start. A project can be anything you're interested in: a website, a game, a tool, an extension of a school project. The important thing is just that there's some overlap between your project and the field you're interested in. For example, if you think you might want to work in embedded systems, then building a web app won't help you very much (it may still help a little, though). However, you want to be willing to devote some proper time to it -- probably at least 50 hours in total, spread out over the course of a summer or school year.",

Personal projects are amazing when you lack experience by the way, employers always asked me about the personal projects I have in my resume in interviews when I was a student. Also, being good at more languages is ALWAYS a plus, it increases opportunities you can apply for AND makes it so much easier to learn other languages cuz you'd see a pattern of common things between languages. It's true that Python is getting more and more popular, some of my projects would have been brutal without the Python libraries, but there's always jobs that require C++. Finally, remember, you're not cheating on C++ if you learn Python (no judgement, I felt like I was too).\n\nGood luck and enjoy programming!",

Be able to debate their side of an argument better than they can. \n\nWhen you come back to programming, you’ll be able to drill into problems better. You’ll be better able to take ownership of the concepts and will feel at more liberty to play with them. \n\nPhilosophy will teach you to not take your understanding for granted, and how to dig into the details. \n\nAlso if possible, dialogue with yourself as if you are two people. So like\n“What is a variable?”\n“Well, I don’t know, what do you think a variable is?”\n“A variable is some piece of data assigned to a name”\n“And what do you mean by assigned to a name?”\n“Well, I take a word and I set it equal to something, could be a number a string of characters”\n“When you say set it equal, do you mean like 1+1=2 “\n“Well no, the variable is a placeholder for whatever value ive assigned to it”\n“Oh, so you use it instead of the value “\n“Yes”\nEtc…\nMost programmers will say slow your thinking down, dialoging like this is a way of doing that. \n\nGood luck",

Then jump into the problem sets.  \nIt's a great introductory course that does set you up well to expand your learning in different directions.  \n\nJust reading documentation would be an unnecessarily hard road considering the multitudes of resources available these days. Docs aren't really a learning resource for new programmers. They're written expecting the reader to have a certain level of knowledge already.  \n\nBut I'm sure a quick search would bring up loads of free and paid courses, and other resources. Any source recommending CS50 will likely recommend others too.  \n\nMy tip as an educator, is to pick whatever you want. It doesn't really matter as long as you're making forward progress. But really try to stick to it. Consistency, and a good sleep schedule are the keys to success in learning.",

Is able to reproduce his error and describe it. Is willing to ask for help. Has some idea where the issue is NOT. etc. He is proactive as much as he can. Yes, he struggles and is stuck. But he communicated with his team mates. Perhaps he has some ideas but does not know how to put these ideas into a code. But has a theoretical solution.\n\nAnother one takes his task. During standups he says \"I'm working on it.\" Then \"I still need some more time.\" When being asked if he needs some help he goes with \"No. It is okay. I will figure it out.\" and so on. Or, if there are no morning standups but just some meeting in the end of the sprint (2 weeks or so) he just disappears for these days/weeks. In the end he has not progressed nowhere.\n\nWith these two juniors it is clear that the first one is willing to learn. He is a team player and seeks help when he has done his part but still being stuck. He listens to the advice of his team mates. But the second one is a lost case. He does not function in a team and is unable to work on his tasks. He requires a constant handholding and even with handholding is unable to pick up any new knowledge. Eventually he either quits or is let go.\n\nCoding interviews are not just there to see if you can write code. How do you approach a problem. How do you analyze it. What you are trying and what you are not trying. How do you react to a stressful situation. How do you communicate with your \"team\" (your interviewers and such). etc.\n\nEither you succeeded or you failed. No point to worry over something that is out of your control. If you succeeded then well done. If you failed then ask them for a feedback in what was lacking and what you can improve in yourself before you start applying to jobs again.",

By the time I got to a bigger class, I already had a toolkit of small wins to rely on.  \n  \nFor you, over break, I’d suggest small Rust or C++ exercises — calculators, mini games, anything you find fun.

Backend work is a perfectly solid direction, and the fact that you enjoyed wiring APIs to databases is a good sign. You do not need to be great at front end to have a career. You also do not need to master data structures in one pass. Most people only internalize that stuff once they use it in real projects.

Sure, it's not as fresh as it used to be, and recall is slow (because I haven't used it in a while), but I still have a fundamental understanding of backend frameworks, rendering pipelines and game engines for example. (and yes, they all (TM) basically work the same) It's not as much decayed knowledge, as just background knowledge. When I need it, I normally have some time to refresh it first. (It's very rare that someone wakes me up at 4am, holds a gun to my head and forces me to implement a raytracer from memory) Once you have learned something once, it's easy to re learn it; like visiting your home town after some years not being there. \n\nEverytime I needed something I used to know by heart again, it took at most a few hours to get back up and running. Be that algorithms and datastructures (I recently looked up maximum flow again for example), how to build a raytracer/pathtracer (currently looking at some papers that came out after I left university) or just a language I haven't touched in years (rust, even though it is still pretty new). \n\nI never saw any reason to \"keep up to date\".

If you let it hand you full solutions, you won’t build your own internal map of how things fit together. But if you treat it like a senior engineer who gives hints while you still write the code yourself, your skills level up fast.\n\nWhat helped me early on was giving myself stretches of time where I didn’t ask anything until I had at least tried to outline the solution. Even a rough plan is enough. Once you have that, AI becomes a tool that fills in gaps instead of a tool that replaces the entire thought process. You’ll be surprised how much you actually know once you force your brain to engage first.\n\nVue is a great choice to learn because the mental model is clean. If you keep building small projects where you write most of the logic yourself, you’ll break through that “wall” feeling. And once you’ve done a few builds where you genuinely understand the moving parts, AI becomes a speed boost instead of a crutch.\n\nYou’re in a good spot. You just need more reps without a safety net so your confidence catches up.",

For persistence, use localStorage (easier) or IndexedDB (harder) and create a JS ORM for persistence so you exercise these muscles. This will make it a fully functional todo list that works for that browser. From there add a backend with database. Modify your ORM to connect to the backend via REST. That will make it work in any browser (locally).\n\nNext turn it into a SaaS app with OAuth2 signup/login, member management, Stripe subscription processing, calendar scheduling, email reminders, SMS, CI/CD with automated testing and deployment.\n\nYou will be able to build almost anything with the skills you learn through these TODO exercises.\n\nStart small and keep adding the next small thing to it.

You could definitely look into second hand ones into your area, or maybe ask for it as a Christmas present if that's an option, it won't run any games but for second hand stuff you can get that, a monitor and keyboard and mouse for under 100 bucks and have a fully functional setup for programming and browsing he internet and your parents could use it as a computer too if they need it (might be a good selling point for them idk).",

For example when a user is updating data, we might even need his ip address to validate things, whereas in the case of admin we don't have this requirement. Many other possibilities could arrive. What approach Will you suggest in those situations. We might end up preparing and passing a lot of data that is not needed for processing the request and this, data has to be passed a lot from parent to child functions, this reminds me about the prop drilling hell of react, I don't want this problem in my backend.

Are you asking if the win rate is too low to be fun, or are you asking if the program is behaving incorrectly?\n\nIt's straightforward to calculate the exact probability of each possible outcome of a spin, and thereby calculate the probability of a win. One way to do this is by brute force: there are 116^3 = 1560896 possible outcomes, all equally probable, and you can write a program to count them up *without* randomness.\n\nWith a little work, you can calculate the same win probability more efficiently, by avoiding repeatedly considering all the duplicate ways to get the same outcome.\n\nOf course, even if the probability of a win is 1/100, that doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly one win every 100 plays. The actual outcome is very likely to be higher or lower due to random variation. If you want to check your program for correct behavior, you can do a large number of runs (say, 10000) and then use an appropriate statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) to see where the observed number of wins falls, in comparison to the statistically likely range.\n\nI'm not a gambling expert, but I believe real slot machines don't *only* pay out if all of the symbols on a line match. They have additional lower-value payouts that are more frequent, designed to keep the player engaged and addicted in hopes of a jackpot.",

You could crack it within a few weeks. And solving problems can be fun, especially when you begin to understand the mechanics. Sure, you would never solve Leetcode problems in a real job but you would use the problem solving muscle all the time. Think of it like going to the gym and working out this muscle.

It's the difference between being able to put together scripts that automate things and generally glue other people's code together without knowing (or perhaps caring) how good it is (or could be), and being able to write whatever you need to, from scratch if necessary (given other time/resource/knowledge requirements are met, of course).\n\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks) is a mostly-applicable example of the above.

It sounds like you are going for a Computer Science degree, and wondering, why they don't teach you to be a programmer, but a scientist. \n\nMaths (and DSA and all theoreetical CS courses) are very much required to become a computer scientist. You have to learn all of the basics, so you are able to specialize in any CS subfield later. This also enables you to understand, to have a common vocabulary and knowledge base with others, even if they have a different specialization. I spezialized in computer graphics at uni. One of my best friends in networking and distributed computing. Although we barely had any courses in common after the first 2 years, we could talk to each other and explain one another what we were doing and how it works, with barely any problems. \n\nThose skill are not immediately, obviously useful. But they are necessary for computer science. \n\nAnd as someone who was a tutor for a DSA course: Those courses are there to give you the toolkit to reason about algorithms, analyze them and even figure out new ones if you need to. They don't teach you how to program, and that's by design. It is a different skill. \n\nProgramming on the other hand is something completely different. It is a craft. The program doesn't care if you know Dijkstras Algorithm, can integrate in multiple dimensions or know the difference between average and median. If helps to know those things about as much as a knowledge of a structural engineer helps you building wooden cabins. Good to have? Sure. Can you learn it quicker and easier for this specific usecase? Also yes. \n\nIf you want to learn programming, you will either have to hope that your school has some courses in that direction that will be helpful, or you will have to take your foundational knowledge (like maths and DSA), get some tutorials and get programming. \n\n>Should I choose a specific field of software engineering\n\nNot 100% sure, but it sounds like you really should focus on the fundamentals first\n\n>I tried to read books on software design\n\nagain, fundamentals. You are trying to run before you can walk. \n\nIf you are still at uni/school at a level where you just had your first DSA courses, and maths, the size of project you are supposed to tackle is tic tac toe in the terminal. A calculator. An CLI that simulates how fast your money can grow with a 5% annual compound interest. \n\nOnce you have that, a good next set of problems is the size of small games. Rebuilt Tetris. Flappy Bird. The Akinator! \n\n>and we didn't actually code in class because we were told \"I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science.\"\n\nAnd I nearly missed this quote, but it fits too well with what I tried to convey before: This is not a problem, this is how it is supposed to be. You are in a course designed to make you a scientist, not a craftsman! Sure, most people in Cs degrees end up going into programming, and I would argue we are better at it because of out degree, but you really should listen to your teachers.",

For projects, if you are doing this to get a job then REST and CRUD are your friends. REST is mostly frontend to backend. CRUD is mostly backend to database. There is a lot to learn there and also around those two main things.\n\nFor the projects you build, incorporate those things into it. TODO app? Add  REST, backend, and database. If you really want to learn how to become a software engineer, turn this into a SaaS. Add signup/login, membership management, subscriptions and payments, calendar scheduling, email reminders. SMS. Learn how to deploy this to the cloud with automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.\n\nUse git/github throughout and create pull requests for each new feature. Start small and add new small things one at a time. Pull request in between.\n\nThis sets your roadmap for learning how to do this.\n\nOnce you can do that, pick an existing project you use or have seen. Think about how they built it using what you learned from the full stack TODO SaaS application. Start building it to learn how they did it.  \n  \nThat is how you build projects.

Despite that I stilled used codecademy, CS50x, etc, I just don't know how to move past the intermediate programming phase. A lot of it is self learning yes, but the structure has been confusing. Most bootcamp esque courses have not exactly helped me move past intermediate programming courses in a programming language such as java, being bombarded with custom libraries and highly abstract methods & library attributes didn't really help for the software design & implementation we had to do in class.",

For everything else, you need to go the the TAs, tutors or whatever structure you have. They normally have a lot more time alotted to helping students. And if that doesn't work, fellow students were a huge help when I was at university. \n\nAnother important note: You are not expected to become more than an intermediate programmer at this point. That takes experience, which you don't have yet. Being intermediate is totally fine until you get your degree. That is more or less everything you are expected to know as a junior developer anyways: You have the basics needed to produce code under guidance, and you have the background (CS degree) to learn fast, because concepts you will need are already somewhere in your brain. There is no expectation to be much better than that. \n\nIf you want to be better than that for yourself, there is no shortcut: You need to build real projects. No tutorial, bootcamp or lecture can really prepare you. We had two project seminars at my university, which were basically: \"Here is a team of 5/6 people, this is your task, we will check in with you in 6 weeks / after the semester\" and that is where I personally learned most about programming. If you don't have seminars like this and/or cannot find a group, you can also do this on your own. (Although a group helps, both with productivity, motivation and learning)",

Just treat it as gobbledygook that *has* to be written for a program to work.\n\nHowever, it's great that you are curious. The `main` method is what the Java runtime invokes when you run a Java program. It has the specific signature you described, and here are the reasons for the questions you asked about the method signature:\n\n1. All methods are supposed to either return a value, or indicate that they do NOT return a value using the keyword `void`. Java does not expect the `main` method to return a value, which is why we use the keyword `void`.\n\n2. `main(String[] args)`: This is just the name of the method that takes a string array as an argument. This does not directly result in any user input. The Java runtime receives the user input arguments from the OS, and then passes them into `main` when it invokes the `main` method.\n\n3. The method is marked public because it has to be invoked by the Java runtime. It needs to be accessible to the outside world, it wouldn't make sense for it to be private.\n\nHonestly, I don't know if any of this explanation would make sense to a beginner. When I was learning Java, I just accepted that these are lines that have to be there. It made sense only after I had learned a lot more about data types, arguments, return values, classes, etc.",

Most learning in programming is done by working with things you don't know and need to research. You really need to get comfortable with working outside of your comfort zone in this field, as you will very rarely be interacting with things that you know already. You should instead choose something that you're interested in and motivated to learn more about. You'll probably struggle a lot first and write terrible code, but it will be insanely educational.",

People who go that track have to work a lot harder to prove they know what they are talking about to even get their foot in the door.\n\nThat said, keep up with the programming.

Look up the pareto principle and lean six sigma. You can find ways to adjust your life so that you can fit all the things you want to do into the time that you have. \n\nFrom your description,  it sounds like you're talking about a school like WGU that's self-paced. If you can't manage to stick with your personal coding projects now, you're going to have trouble following a self-paced study regimen. Academic tracks are slower, but they offer structure. Also, they offer far more opportunities to network, which is 50-70% of the importance of going to uni. So, choose whichever path seems best for you, but know that you have to get your schedule under control either way--especially with an accelerated,  self-paced program. \n\nThe Third option is getting a job first and either waiting a little bit or doing school simultaneously. This is tough, but also an excellent way to gain experience and get a feel for the job market and which degree program would suit you best. \n\nIf you do the job first, put as much of your paycheck as you can into a roth 401k and pretend it doesn't exist. If you do the schooling first, avoid loans or work concurrently so you can pay them off before the interest becomes overwhelming. Even a 10k loan at 5% means you're paying $500 bucks a year for the privilege of owing other people money. A 30k loan at 7% means you're paying $2,100 just to hold the debt, and that is on top of payments to principle and loan origination fees. And this compounds year over year. You might want to think about working for a company that will pay for your school so that you don't have to face this kind of debilitating debt. The armed forces also are a good option in this regard. And if you have a high IQ and decent technical knowledge, they'll be able to place you somewhere where you can learn on the job and get hands-on experience. Plus the GI bill, medical, and housing assistance when you've finished. Anyway, lots of stuff to think about. Good luck!",

Android also has a service discovery API for looking for services on the network, but I only played with it briefly IIRC.

If you want to control a music player, you'd need to see if the player has some API to allow that. If it doesn't, you may need to resort to something like PyGuiAuto to simulate clicks on a UI to pause/play/next song/whatever.\n\nSo, you'd need to be able to write code that can run on your phone (either a native app or a web app), and then some code to run on your computer to do the controlling. Both ends would likely require different languages as well unless you do everything in a broadly explicable language like JS.\n\nEdit: If the two devices will always be on the same network when you want to make use of this functionality, you could skip the broker and just run a typical web server on your computer. Then you could have the phone load up a web app that you write served from the computer, and the server could do the controlling actions directly.",

Leetcode is by far the best way of interviewing for several reasons:\n- It takes at most one hour of your time, in contrast with take-home assignments, which can take several hours.\n- It limits the number of possible questions asked. People don't realize how many things can be asked, even for a single language.\n- It's usually language-agnostic, which is good when your profile doesn't match 100% the job requirements but you have the potential.\n- It provides a clear metric to compare between candidates. It's not so focused on previous experience, but on how good can you solve and explain a new problem.\n\nAccording to many here, interviewers should read their CV, believe all the fake metrics they have put there and hire them in the spot.",

If you have a professional network / connections, they are your best resource for getting past all the noise created by AI resumes and all the tactics that HR / recruiting departments are using to thin them out.\n\nA friend at another company said they just fired an offshore guy who they later found out had 6 jobs at the same time.  That's what you're competing against, the noise of professional job applicants using every tool at their disposal.\n\n>Also, does anyone have experience applying for a TPM or manager position after being a software engineer? Thinking of pivoting.\n\nYou need to pivot in place at your next employer, rather than try to pivot between jobs.  It won't work, you have no experience in the role you're applying for.  My advice would be to try to be your next team's Scrum Master, if they don't have one.  Get the certs for that, get some experience, then look at pivoting again to Product Owner or TPM based on your preference.\n\nFYI these \\^\\^\\^ roles are getting even worse for cold applications because all the offshore that can't code (or get their cousin who can code to do the interview for them) get scrum / PM certs instead.  Every cert class I teach / attend has a disproportionate number of offshore attendees, most of whom couldn't create a dashboard in Jira to save their lives.\n\nNot to be irrationally negative about offshore but there's so much noise in the system right now that it's hard to match US workers to US jobs.  I can't even get callbacks on ITAR / DoD jobs that get relisted 2-3 times, and these people were throwing all the money at me 3 years ago.  The whole system is broken.  Rely on your network.\n\nEdit:  TPM, PO, Scrum Master, Agile Coach etc are all excellent places for former devs to go.  Moving to coaching was the best thing for my career, as most of your competition won't even be close to your technical skillset.  You need to like people more than the average dev does, and you'll need to learn how to navigate some of the politics.  I'm paid at a Sr Mgr / Director grade (Fortune 100 tech company you've heard of), have frequent access to organizational leaders, and am basically the wizard who has the data and the dev background to tell them where their orgs are running right and where they aren't.  Get a good leader or five who like you and know what you can do, and they'll take you everywhere they go.",

I was a maniac going from forums to forums reading difference in lib implementation, about middleware optimisation, even reducing stuff from custom middleware where certain parts were not required so it could save cpu cycles etc.....\n\nMate people can still implement redis , and if possible even write code for redis cleanup and all... But not everyone would be able to optimise or know how things are implemented under the hood, anyhow..... If you are doing things fast, you are skipping the time which would be better utilised if you were manually doing something and searching forums, seeing different architectural codes of diff people made me get better... Good luck with claude solution..... \n\nRemember as one member here said, its a layer of abstraction\n\nSOME PEOPLE USE LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION AND SOME CREATE.....

I needed a good string proximity comparison in SQL so I did my own research and found a few implementations of the Levenstein algorithm (number of changes). Added a few more heuristics and the built in soundex and it's actually pretty decent. Asked AI and it came up with a few good suggestions including what I did with some more improvements which works even better. This is good and we'll put it to good use. (If this doesn't work as needed we probably will do it in the backend on Azure In C#)\n\nThe second one failed epically. It's a bit more complicated, it's tracking dynamic row dependencies via good ole parent and children rows. Also SQL. Classic case of hallucinations as it kept giving reasonably looking suggestions that didn't work. Oh well. That's too deep in the code to change. I ended up optimizing it by using precalculated dependencies rather than calculating them dynamically. \n\nThere's good potential but to paraphrase the TV person, \"know when to say when\".",

As far as I can tell, the improvements in LLMs have really started to slow down, and I see no reason why they shouldn't continue slowing down even more given that:\n\n* There are limits to how much energy can be allocated to LLMs; this ultimately puts a limit on how much training can be done.\n* We are running out of additional data to train LLMs on; this is another thing which puts a limit on how much training can be done.\n* Low-hanging fruit of algorithmic/architectural improvements have largely been solved (from models like DeepSeek) so there are now fewer and fewer stones to turn in this regard.\n* Moore's Law is dying and the low-hanging fruit of hardware architecture improvements seem to be picked by and large, meaning that hardware efficiency improvements will likely plateau. (see [https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance](https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance) for what I'm talking about)\n* Neural scaling laws which model performance are inherently increasing BUT concave down when more parameters/data are added, meaning that improvements should continue to get smaller over time; and this is not just the case for LLMs, but for any AI that could exist.\n\nOn top of that, there's reason to believe that the models may get worse. Much of the data now on the internet is AI-generated and it is inevitable that a great deal of it will be used to train new LLM models, thereby causing them to overfit and degrade somewhat. Let's also not forget that the CEOs and researchers have a lot to gain by hyping up AI, so if that is what is causing to feel concerned, try to not to let it get to you; there's a long history of this kind of stuff happening when relatively new technologies emerge, but the end result has always been exaggerations.",

Once you start to micro manage it, and you must, because you have a spec of things that need to be this way and not that way, it kinda falls apart, sometimes failing to implement something altogether. \n\nSo, for now, human developers are totally safe, because LLMs can't write production ready apps. Another thing: LLMs very often take the worst approach for anything unless you tell them to do thing a specific way. This is because the code its been trained on is garbage.",

This means a few things:\n\n1) you’ll find a good amount of people that have little to no desire in growing themselves or improving the environment they are in. People can be close minded and would rather maintain existing process. You’ll need to track down like minded individuals\n\n2) everything is a risk assessment. The approval process to get new tech is a pain. Bureaucracy slows down initiatives, you’ll figure out “work arounds” that’ll help you continue to work when waiting for permits or approvals. For example, maybe using localstack to build a POC because your new AWS feature isn’t approved yet\n\n3) tech debt… classic right? Except it’s a little different in that it’s harder to introduce new technologies that could alleviate tech debt. These people have also been in a bubble, so they don’t know about all the new stuff\n\n\nIf you’re worried about the title, honestly don’t be. You’ll find that there’s a good amount of people that have title based on tenure over skill. Sure, they may know the domain better, but they’ve been out of the game for a long time. \n\nKeep your head up and maintain a growth mindset, you’ll be just fine and maybe you’ll guarantee your retirement.

I do have some listed on my linkedin/github profile page but these are the ones from when I was applying for my first role and for my resume I removed all but the one that was most fleshed out.\n\n> What should a senior dev actually focus on when entering the market for the first time?\n\nThis might depend on your specialization/target role. For a senior level role, I would expect a lot of interviews to focus on strong system design (differs a bit between backend and frontend though). If you're targeting big tech, you're likely going to encounter some form of algorithm interview rounds. And of course, prepare for your standard behavioral questions as needed. A lot of times, these boil down how you resolve inter-personal issues of deadlines, disagreements, prioritization, etc.\n\nOutside of technical skills though, linkedin premium is probably a good place to start, though you might want to only use it for 2-3 months and decide from there if you still need it. I also think the primary thing to focus on is applying to listings early. Another side note for linkedin is to reply to recruiters if they do reach out, even if you are declining them. I believe doing so increases your profile's score/visibility to recruiters as someone that replies so you'll likely receive more recruiter outreach in the future. I don't have a concrete source on that though 😅",

When you can though, you should endeavor to learn from first principals. I could jump into a Go project and fix some bugs and probably learn a bit, but I'd be much better served by augmenting that with doing some quickstarts and writing my own programs and tests that encapsulate the problems I'm trying to learn how to solve. There's a lot of learning that comes from there and that stuff tends to \"stick\" better than copy & pasting and error and looking up how to solve it.\n\nSometimes I even see devs _refuse_ to read the error message. Just copy and paste and if the answer isn't online then they don't know what to do. We had an internal script that required 2 args. Someone tried to use it with 1 arg. The error message says, \"You need to call me with 2 arguments\" and described what those args should be. They just posted the error on slack and asked for a fix.",

If anything use LinkedIn and Indeed as a search engine and straight to the company’s website to ensure the job is there and apply there!\n\nI would also apply to recent listings as much as possible, favoring hours ago listings rather than days ago. ATS systems sort applicants in chronological order so once recruiters go through the first 50-100 applications they’ll probably have a good handful to push to the interview stage and that’s it they’re moving on. The back half never gets checked! So apply as soon as you see that job. Get creative, I even made my own alert system that alerts me when my scrapers sees a new job was posted to an ATS system and send me a notification on discord. Let me know if you’d like to try it out, completely free!\n\nAnyways, I wish you luck! It will be long and there’s no guarantee even all of this ends up working",

Mainly focused on systems I've worked with\n* Technicals: Focused on CS concepts (paradigms, concurrency, databases, patterns, networking, etc.) and their applications\n\nFrom the hiring side (major US tech hubs), even with a small sample size, the majority of interviewees lack problem solving skills and/or have mediocre communication skills.

It's pretty vague.\n\n\nIn general, I'd say mature companies that are profitable and where the majority of employees are over 30.\n\nGreenflag if on Linkedin, you find developers on the team/adjacent to the team with graduation dates before like 2008 who have been with the company for more than like 5 years.  People who are over halfway through their career usually aren't trying to prove anything, and they just want to live their life and coast in stability until retirement.   The lack of this doesn't mean it's not chill, but if you see people like this there, then it probably is.\n\nPeople work hard because the moment you truly relax is the moment you stagnate in your career.  So you'd want to look for people who are probably satisfied with where they're at in their career.   Which also kinda lines up with Google being chill.  If you're at Google, you're close to the peak of software engineering.  Of course, you do have to do occasional overtime for deadlines, but from what I've heard from people, it's not so bad.  Generally like only 40-50 hours per week.

You will have to **prove** that you are interested and passionate about CS in the Masters application, and you will have to convince a professor to take you in in their lab.\n\nWith all due respect, unless your parents are currently working in the industry and know what's going on, why would you listen to them? Their only argument is that 2 years is shorter than 4 years. Do your own research and cost/benefit analysis of a bachelors vs masters.\n\nIf I were you, I would go through a bachelors and do internships every year during the summer break until graduation.\n\nPersonally, I think that CS Masters that only teach you \"coursework\" don't have much value. The value of a \"Masters\" is to have deep knowledge and research experience in a particular field (for example Computer Vision, or NLP or...). That's what companies are looking for when hiring for ML roles and requiring Masters/PhDs.  (Source: I work in the industry).",

Initially, I was going to get a second bachelors but decided to get my masters instead once I got into the upper tier of courses. \n\nThe MS program is from a more reputable university (Georgia Tech) and the curriculum is more in-depth, so it was a relatively simple decision for me. Jobs aren’t guaranteed ofc, so I’m just in it for the love of the game and we’ll see what happens. \n\nYour situation is different, ofc. It sounds like your CS bachelor’s degree will come from a reputable school with a coop program, so I’d probably just do that.",

They have to be listening to what the other person is saying and understanding why they have said it. In a properly functioning disagreement you will be asking as many questions as you will be giving answers.\n\nEventually, you might get to a point where you both fully understand each other, but do just fundamentally disagree. At this point, you will typically involve a 3rd party (another colleague, a team lead) to give a fresh perspective, and to act as a tie-breaker. \n\nIf you still can't come to a consensus after that, then your only option is to disagree and commit. A senior decision maker (e.g. a team lead) will pick one of the options, and you will all agree that, even if it's not your preferred option, you will commit to getting it done on the basis that doing the wrong thing well is often better than not doing anything at all.\n\nKey rules when disagreeing:\n\n1. Authority is irrelevant. If you can't explain and justify your view, your job title of Fancypants Principal Senior Architect is meaningless.\n2. Listen. Listen and understand what the other person is saying. Ask clarifying questions or suggest concrete examples if you don't.\n3. Go for a beer afterwards. This is the importance of relationships. I can have (sometimes quite forceful) disagreements with colleagues, but it is fine because we are also friendly with each other. Grab a beer, or a coffee, or have a game of pool, or whatever, but just build that relationship so it can easily survive disagreements.\n\nFinally, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a common approach in software development, and it has it's place, but when it comes to security concerns you _are_ going to need it!",

By comparison, startups and consultancies scale their team sizes very rapidly (both up and down). So, unless you thrive in that kind of fast-paced environment, startups can be really challenging workplaces.\n\nAnd because the organizational structure changes so rapidly, a lot of decisionmaking is informal and workplace politics are more nuanced/difficult.

It allows you to build for every platform, it uses native OS bindings, and it's performant. So, ***yes absolutely*** the move to React Native sounds like a good idea to me, however, you could also just stay a webdev, and learn tools like React Native, Electron, and Tauri (and then you'll be building mobile apps and desktop apps anyways).",

        "body": "For ML engineering, I think Masters helps with that. But plenty of people get an MLE job even without a masters. MLE from what I gather is, SWE in the context of ML. There is an additional interview round for MLE jobs where they ask you ML trivia like \"what it is the difference between L1 and L2 normalization\" or \"Explain K-fold cross validation\". You may or may not get to do model development in an MLE job. But you will be involved in productionalizing an already developed model.\n\nFor applied scientists type of a role though. I have seen a few of my batch mates get those type of roles with just a master's degree. There are a few caveats though.\n\n1. These roles were in Amazon. In Amazon Applied scientist role is more of a SWE role than an AS role from what I observed. Most of the Amazon Applied Scientist roles are not the same as Microsoft research Applied Scientist role or Google Brain Research scientist or even Facebook AI research applied scientist roles. A lot of Amazon AS people get to churn out research papers every year. But I have seen even MLEs churn out research papers as well.\n2. You need to have at least 1 publication even for the Amazon AS role, when applying from outside. A thesis in the Master's program helps with that.\n3. The school I attended was a top 20 school for CS back when I was applying. And a few of my Batchmates are now working as Applied scientists in Facebook and Amazon without a Ph.D with just a master's degree. And these were people on H1b. Not even US citizens. Your experience might not be the same however.\n\nAlso applied scientist interviews are far more mathematical in nature than SWE/MLE interviews. You go into an interview and they might ask you to derive the expected value of a normal distribution or something on a whiteboard. A math heavy master's program from a top US university definitely helps with cracking that type of an interview.",

Unless you get lucky and find something that increases all desires. \n\nPersonally, I have made this decision in my career and it achieve all my desires. I was working in small company that wasn't the greatest in innovating, so I hopped to another small (but bigger) company that used and stride to use the latest and greatest tech. Got a better pay, remote work, and better team, a win-win. I did this hop about 1 year in because early in your career you're still hungry for knowledge and have relatively alot of time on your offtime to learn new concepts. Many people once they start a family just want to settle down and don't have the mental capacity to want to learn new things.",

The system design track on educative.io is actually really good for this, it walks you through requirements, tradeoffs, and scaling without overloadng you with theory. You could also check out donnemartin/system-design-primer or binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability on GitHub for more patterns (but those can overwhelm you a bit - only do it if once you've got the basics down and i'd also recommend using GPT to identify the best ones based on your existing prep)\n\nAs for the E5 interview, I think you can totally ace it if you stay organized and consistent! Just set your constraints early, pick a clean baseline design, call out the obvious bottlenecks, and talk through how you'd scale or handle failures gracefully. If you've got time, running through a couple full mocks with that approach would definitely help (educative has those built in too).\n\nGood luck! You've got this!",

Split the monster PR into small slices with contract tests; pair each with a Flyway/Liquibase migration and rollback.\n\nI’ve used Hasura for fast read models on Postgres, Kong to centralize auth/rate limits on legacy endpoints, and DreamFactory to auto‑generate REST on ugly SQL so the frontend stops hand‑rolled queries.\n\nIf leadership won’t allow flags, canary, and sign‑offs, start interviewing.\n\nBottom line: document and gate the risks, ship behind flags with observability, and make incremental fixes instead of another big hack.",

Consistently the people I hire are able to confidently tackle a problem I put in front of them, whether they know how to or not. The last two people I hired immediately started collaborating with me on a simple real world coding challenge that they had zero exposure to before the interview. A good software engineer knows how to break tasks down into manageable pieces, ask questions, and systematically work through a problem I know that I'm relatively unusual in my interview approach because Leetcode is still out there, but all the best jobs I've had have had similar practical problem solving interviews.\n\nSo, my primary advice is to work on those problem solving and communication skills. When you're approached for an interview, you should be able to reflexively start diving into how you'll tackle the problem they put in front of you.\n\nI think Azure is an excellent choice for boosting your desirability in the market. Despite spending most of my career as an individual contributor programmer, DevOps knowledge has been the thing that has helped me the most. \n\nAlso, don't forget about Python's use as a back end language for building APIs. Back end developers might not be as cool as ML or AI engineers, but there's still a huge need for them. It will be far easier to find a job and demonstrate your competence as a dev. The fact that you've already worked on practical projects in school is a big boon here.",

Now it’s the bare minimum due to oversupply.\n\nAs someone with a bachelors in IT, I can tell you that each cert is equal to about one 3-credit college course. The certs are slightly more difficult as it’s just the one exam. \n\nSo if you look at it that way, it’s basically one semester of college IT that’s required to get a job. It’s not much, but it is a step above “knowing how to use task manager”.”",

You are still in school hopefully so max out with all AP classes if you can so you can get all your math and general cs courses out the way.\n\nIf you want to build something build something through action and consistency, do not stop until you have actually made something.  Don't overdue it but don't just stop either and have a finite timeline in place so you can get it done within a reasonable time without spending all of your time on getting it done.\n\nIt sounds like you had interest in videogames, ok that is nice, go build a something using a framework or engine like Unreal that is simple but functional using something custom you built in C++.  Once you do that create another project to incorporate what you have learned in school.\n\nLearning is always worth it as it is a hard requirement to stay relevant and marketable.

I have seen people get jobs in the first semester dude just because they got paired with teammates who worked in FAANG or their desired role. Also one huge advantage with OMSCS is you can check out all the career fairs available in-person if you're willing to drive/fly to Georgia.

They were mostly focused on my decision making (ie why would you use such a framework or library, when would you not, what are some of it's features and strengths).\n\nIe a position with go and erlang asked me about my extensive next experience, why would you use it (forward facing web app, fast server supplied applications) and when would it not be as useful (super immediate information like real time financial information where you want it client side rather than server side). This was relevant to what the position was about (financial position basically).\n\nWe briefly discussed what they used, I let them know I was aware of it and it's strengths, and that was about it. 90% of the interview was focused on system design decisions and AWS which is both language agnostic.\n\nTake homes or assessments will likely just be done in the language you're familiar with, and syntax lookup is usually allowed.\n\nGot to 4 interviews with them and waiting to hear back, but they said I did well on the technical interview.",

Since you ostensibly own the entire project, you should be able to explain *every* decision - even if your explanation is \"I just didn't know any better, and this seemed to work\".\n\nOver time you'll learn how to spot \"decisions\", i.e. which tools to use, how to design your classes, entity relations, etc. \n\nI can't imagine the expectations being very high for your first semester. Ask your lecturers/tutors for advice on what to expect if you're really nervous.\n\nMost importantly,long term: own your fuck ups, it happens. I just bombed a pretty basic question from my manager about code I spent way too long writing because I was not prepared for that questioning and did not consider their angle, as a proper consideration, it made me reconsider how I approached my problem framing (i.e. what assumptions to make).\n\nIf you're looking for more practical advice though, and you're going to be \"reviewing\" your code, I suggest keeping things small and encapsulated. By having logical units and API calls contained within well named methods and classes, and code sections small, you'll be better able to reason about your code, making you more likely to remember or at least be able to invent your rationale.",
