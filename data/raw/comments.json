It is very much a distant third place in the cloud provider market share competition, but it's not insignificant, and arguably has an edge in certain areas (e.g. many related to data).\n\nI may be extrapolating too far, but I wonder whether you've tended to work at larger, more established companies? AWS benefits greatly from being the first mover, while Azure has good synergy with companies using Microsoft products and puts a lot of effort into Enterprise relationships.\n\nSmaller organisations are more likely to use Google Workspace.

How complex the data is and how forward you go towards the insights/analytics layer? If the data is not complex and you insights to be extracted, delegate this to a modelling tool like dbt and use your pipelines to pull data only and trigger dbt to keep it simple. \n\nIf data is complex requiring many normalisations or multiple sources that a simple sql cannot do, threat your pipelines like a library to process data in its context. \n\nBut remember early optimisation is the evil. \n\nSo its not a question of preference, is what you have to do at THIS time to keep it simple, readable and maintainable for your future self without over engineering. This rule is only yours (or maybe also for your team). \nSometimes it is ok to over-bloat one or two flows because you will touch that once in a year and nobody else will or if it fails nobody will get hurt. I personally consider this and also I don't mind to have duplicated code 3x into 3 flows, so the 4th one will justify a refactor.

But even that is dumb because in a lot of cases your teammates won’t know Go, so you’re creating a potential problem. I work mostly alone so i justify it that way, but still - not best practice.\n\nOnce you become more proficient in other areas, sure try Go have some fun.

Mixed experiences. \n\nThe bad:\n- There is at times a large desync when reading and writing to lakehouses and warehouses. PySpark operation will complete and show transformations applied within a session only for the data to not match at the endpoint for... A while. No hard numbers on this but seen others talking about it. Bottlenecks development and is really frustrating. \n\n- The low code solutions are terribly inefficient. My first time testing a basic Dataflow Gen2 operation ran for way too long and had a ridiculously large CU consumption, so if you want to handle ETL processes better get dug into Spark notebooks (I've been using PySpark which is considerably faster and more performant than the Dataflow seemed, not sure how other Spark modules behave) \n\n- Speaking of CU consumption, interrogation of compute is so... Opaque. Want to see how much CU your new code block uses? You're out of luck if you've ran it multiple times for debugging and testing - there's no way to get a granular report on costing. The documentation here isn't much better. \n\n- Managing a traditional Dev -> Prod pipeline feels harder than necessary. Currently I'm running a NonProd/Prod architecture where end users only have access to a workspace with models loaded into a warehouse because as far as I can tell there is no object level security available within a workspace. There's also no way that I've found to directly write across workspaces, so I'm shortcutting my endpoint data in the NonProd workspace to a lakehouse is the Prod workspace, then using cross warehouse T-SQL to create views for the end users.\n\nThe good:\n- For an organisation with a large investment in PowerBI with multiple workspaces and satellite teams within the business, I can see how Fabric might be a good solution that slots in nicely. In it's current state I'm not sure that it pulls ahead of any other architecture solutions. \n\n- It's an interesting playground for less technical users to 'get their hands dirty'; I see the appeal. As mentioned before however, I discounted the low code options pretty quickly so it remains to be seen how this will progress. \n\n- There is native CoPilot integration in Fabric (when set up with the right licence option in workspaces). I haven't tested this out yet but I imagine this will be useful for people in the business to ask questions and interrogate data without requiring models to be built or a knowledge of SQL or PowerBI development. \n\nOverall it's not terrible and if you're already paying for a fabric capacity you're not incurring additional costs if your capacity has headroom. For users with a less technical background I'm not sure if the juice would be worth the squeeze as every end user I've spoken to has gravitated to Dataflows for ETL work as it's familiar to them (it works like an online PowerQuery interface). \n\nMy background is in analytics and I have less experience with data engineering so my observations should be taken with a grain of salt.",

Even if you don’t directly use these tools, familiarity with them would help you understand how Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery and other data warehouses/lakehouses work under the hood. Could be good for someone who wants to become a dev for a data solution or company like that\n\nAs far as ML and AI, I think this would just be relevant from an operations perspective — eg how hard/expensive would it be to train or infer from a massive amount of data? What are the systems behavior and considerations involved? I don’t think it’s the most relevant topic for advancing an ML/AI career. I would think you’d be better off focusing on how to get quality data for models, which models to use for which scenarios, and in the case of agentic AI the big learning area might be systems integration via things like MCP and how to evaluate for sufficient performance/improvements, plus security. I wouldn’t necessarily expect there to be courses really relating to agentic AI since it’s still so new",

As part of the batch process, an environment variable representing the job number can be accessed via int(os.environ\\['AWS\\_BATCH\\_JOB\\_ARRAY\\_INDEX'\\]). Use this and your mapping from step 2 to get the list of files this job should process.\n5.

The aim is to stop people editing 'data storage' spreadsheets directly (each form should also be an easy thing to set up).\n\nSo what have we achieved?\n\n- added some level of control over data entry\n- introduced BigQuery, allowing you to start defining transformations in SQL (e.g. Views, Scheduled Queries), and setting up the foundation for the future\n- decoupled data analysis from data storage. Data analysis with spreadsheets reading well-managed data from BigQuery is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight pattern\n- prepared everyone for a future where you have data entry methods write directly to BigQuery, without spooking the horses\n- oh, and for free your data is ready to analyse out of the box with 'Looker Studio' (free, not to be confused with Looker 'proper'), allowing you to set up reasonably nice dashboards",

My Python-Fu is not strong and instead up looking up the syntax for filtering a data frame for the 100th time, I tell the LLM to do it. Here's a real example from a few days ago: from <table>, select the most recent <field I need> using the <date> field. You could argue if I didn't use the LLM I would learn the syntax and not have to look it up all the time. You would be correct.\n3. Generating regex expressions from sample data. It's surprisingly good at this.\n4. I had a circular reference in a model a few days go. I knew how to resolve it, but wanted to see how the LLM would approach it. I gave it a screenshot of the UML data model and it actually did a really good, and accurate, job of explaining what the reference was, what caused it and gave a few ways of resolving it.\n5. OCR, but check the results VERY closely. It'll get you about 90% of the way, but I picked up a lot of small errors that on first glance looked ok.\n6. Basic debugging. I use the Agent in Databricks quite a lot. It's good at fixing missing brackets, forgotten imports, and basic stuff like that. More complex stuff is hit and miss so I'll usually debug those myself, but it saves me time looking for a stupid ).\n7. Advanced find and replace. Stuff like, 'In the attached csv, find all instances of x that are postfixed with \":2\" and replace that with :3 if the date in the valid\\_to column is over two months from today.'\n\nIn all cases I check the output because I know they're just advanced statistical models, but I must say I've noticed the accuracy increase in the last year or so.\n\nI probably wouldn't consider this a 'next gen workflow', it's all stuff I can do without an LLM, but it really does save me a huge amount of time. Further, you still need someone who knows the work and what they're doing. There's no way my manager for instance would be able to use the same LLM to do my job without me.",

Data volume is not a problem here, listing the files - it’s the biggest issue. \nUnfortunately with Glue there is not so much you can do, but next things might help a little:\n1. If possible remove asterix, so you can use recursive lookup and listing won’t take place on driver. Do ‘s3://../parsed-data/us/‘ instead and  .option(recursiveFileLookup\", \"true\")\n2. Increase number of workers\n3. Tune up a config a little bit for working with small files\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes\", 64 * 1024 * 1024) \nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes\",   4 * 1024 * 1024)  \n4. Use repartition instead of coalesce, because your bottleneck is read, not write. \n\n\nBut really, that’s not Spark use case, there is nothing “analytical” about this kind of processing. So the only valid approach - stop producing tons of little files or switch to another technology. You just wasting lot of money by trying to use not suitable technology for a quite trivial job. \nDatabricks have ‘cloudFiles’ functionality to handle such things and it works perfectly, but unfortunately there is nothing similar to it in pure Spark or Glue.",

I work cross-cloud in Azure and GCP managing data pipelines in Databricks or Airflow. I build consumers/producers with Kafka. I work in Python mainly but occasionally run into Java. My role has always been this way for the last 5 years. As a tech lead I also do some product work like epic breakdowns, quarterly planning, sprint planning for my team. I also manage a team of 6 devs and do performance reviews etc. My job isn’t stressful because I push back if a request isn’t reasonable, and if the PM insists on making my team pivot then I insist on dropping an epic to make room for the new work. The only thing that ever gets stressful to me sometimes is dealing with people who either don’t do their job or do their job very badly, and I end up compensating.

Roles of DE’s vary quite a bit so it’s going to depend on the position you switch to… \n\nWith that being said, in DE you don’t have to worry about the 1,000 ways an end user can misuse and crash your site, or covering every edge case for security vulnerabilities… you probably won’t need to learn 5+ languages and frameworks for one project. These are things I didn’t consider stress wise when making the switch to ‘SWE’, however I enjoy the struggle of this. \n\nWith DE you’re extracting data, transforming and loading it into a space where DA’s and DS can easily retrieve accurate data. The way I think about it is the DB serves as your UI and this simplifies worrying about security and misuse. Not to say these concerns don’t exist, but I don’t feel like they’re as complex to resolve. The real complexity/stress comes in taking disparate data from various systems in various formats, that’s available in disjunct timeframes and making it fit into a cohesive/canonical model that represents how the business/analysts thinks about operations. Applying and understanding business rules can be very difficult/stressful. \n\nInherently I don’t think one or the other is less stressful, it depends on the job and your interests… good luck :)",

Deadlines are everywhere.  Hard-to-diagnose problems are probably everywhere, too, especially when you inherit things.  Sometimes specific tools are worse for it (I've heard comments in this regard about Spark, for example).\n\n\n\nI've done this transition, albeit kind of unconsciously.  It's been good.  Having software background is definitely valuable, I think.  It probably depends some on your stack, but I also think there is *a lot* of crossover.  Especially if you consider that often it's the soft-skills that count, too.\n\n\n\nI started in general development, primarily working on an internal web-based system using .NET Core.  That job started having more and more \"reporting\" work, using the same backend database, but SSRS was the frontend instead.  From there, into an analyst type role, which rapidly became a catch-all ETL-developer-report-builder-platform-admin role.  Last few years it has become more about \"engineering\", admin, and architecture.  I'm very much enjoying it.\n\n  \nEarly on, I did miss working in code that wasn't primarily SQL (and especially wasn't DAX), and the ways in which we did it - like devops processes and dev tools.  I've seen that shift where I am now, partly because team, partly because tool set with us jumping into Databricks.  The inner software dev has much more cause to come back to the surface.  I've been in a position to bring devops practices in.  I'm thinking again about things like encapsulation and DRY.  I was not the whizz-bang top-dog developer, but I picked up some good fundamentals and experience.  It's helpful as a data-focused engineer.\n\n  \nIs DE a good fit for you?  Probably if you have an analytical mind, enjoy the problem-solving, and sometimes having to help discover what that problem really is.  I would also say that it's all just input-to-output.",

Enable AQE with skew handling, and set preferSortMergeJoin=false. If you truly need zero shuffle, write both sides as bucketed tables with identical buckets/keys (Delta/Iceberg works best) or drop to RDDs: partitionBy the same HashPartitioner, persist, join in mapPartitions. I’ve used Databricks and Trino; DreamFactory helped by exposing small dim lookups as REST so Spark could just broadcast them. Bottom line: you can’t force Catalyst to respect cached distribution; use broadcast/bucketing or RDDs",

After completing it, you'll have a solid foundation in data engineering, but there's always more to learn, of course.\n\nOne downside is that they used AI voices for most of the videos, and when they do have real people in the videos, you can tell that most of them are reading from a script. Another thing is that it focuses on IBM's offerings in the data engineering space, when offerings from other companies are much more popular in the job market. It is an IBM cert, though. Why wouldn't they teach you IBM stuff? Fortunately, they made a lot of the IBM-specific parts of the courses optional.\n\nIf you can get past the negatives, it's a pretty solid starting point for getting into data engineering.",

Keep PII out by default; allowlist columns.\n\n3) Wrap actions as stored procedures with typed inputs, e.g., getcustomersummary(customerid, requesterid). No free‑form SQL.\n\n4) Put a gateway as PEP (Kong or Apigee) and a PDP (OPA or Cerbos) that checks user, tenant, action. Enforce quotas and circuit breakers per tool.\n\n5) Bind each tool call to the human agent via token exchange; short‑lived, scoped creds only. Log user→prompt→model→tool→DB so you can replay incidents.\n\n6) Implement fallbacks: small batch sizes, human review for destructive ops, and strict schema validation.\n\nI’ve used Hasura and Kong, and DreamFactory helped turn a legacy SQL Server into curated REST with RBAC so the agent never touched raw tables.\n\nBottom line: keep agents off SQL and force everything through a tight, policy‑checked API over curated views/procs",

In a scenario if prompt injection happens or there is a case where the policy gets bypassed, the attacker would only get access to details in the isolated view and have no way of accessing the entire database.

These talk mostly to SREs and app engineers, not execs. You’ll still need some business context and incident comms, but you can gate it with written intake.\n\nTactics: require ticket intake with the business question, SLA, and data owner; define data contracts and a schema change policy; set office hours; post async updates after deploys/incidents. Interview filters: Who writes requirements? Who prioritizes? Who handles stakeholder meetings? What’s the meeting-to-maker ratio? Do you have a PM or analytics engineer buffer? Is there a solutions team for external clients?\n\nSelf-serve reduces chatter: clean schemas, lineage, a data catalog, and stable APIs. I’ve used Snowflake and dbt for curated marts, Confluent for event streams, and DreamFactory to expose read-only REST endpoints so product teams ship without ad-hoc asks.\n\nPick platform-focused DE and enforce process and you’ll mostly talk tech.",

Wrap execution in a Snowpark Python proc that auto-adds LIMIT and a time window, uses a tiny warehouse, times out fast, parameterizes inputs, and logs prompt/SQL/cost/bytes scanned. Precompute the top questions with Dynamic Tables/Tasks, cache results with TTL, and invalidate via lineage.   \n  \nAdd checks before returning: compare to last week/last month, cap variance, and if it trips, return a warning plus the vetted dashboard. Keep outputs structured JSON and validate; for long docs, RAG over a small, approved glossary so definitions stay consistent. CI matters: canary prompts with golden answers per dataset, block deploy on regressions. We run dbt and Airflow for orchestration, and DreamFactory to auto-generate locked-down REST endpoints so the agent only touches curated Snowflake views.\n\nDon’t chase perfect answers; ship a guarded assistant that’s easy to verify:)",

Your objective should be to make everyone building on top of the data platform able to move as efficiently as possible while being on pattern.\n\nStart to bring your eyes up to strategic objectives and work out how you can close gaps so that once others are trying to build you will already have an mvp for them to consume.",

Then you'll start to think \"what would I've done differently here?\", or answering questions like \"what would need to change if I change component/requirement X by component/requirement Y?\" (simple example: what would need to change if our requirement change from batch to streaming?)\n\nFor the bonus: I was a researcher, then worked as data scientist and software developer for a few years, then as data engineer for a couple of years, and now I am a mix of data engineer and data architect.\n\nThe architect part is really fun. It gave me the possibility to put into practice a lot of the theory I read before. It involves considerably less coding, but more about understanding business and systems (in my case, how the backend works on a high-level) and being able to come up with solutions that match the technical and business requirements. \n\nIt is smart that you are thinking ahead, good luck!",

Say the company is AWS based, they're gonna shift to Azure. Architect would be tasked with getting an edge on discovery in Azure. \n\nGenerally, senior and staff+ engineers still hold primary weight and control over the products and tech stack they own. Especially anything technically detailed, architect would have 0 say. Like best practice for modeling, how to design some major ETL system and etc. All engineering decisions, not architect. Architect would be whats the tech for shifting from AWS to Azure, how do we follow Europes data privacy laws, how do we implement this org level data requirement from legal, how do we standup this technology that all of engineering will use?",

Define data contracts and schema versioning; require an RFC for breaking changes. Bake in observability: OpenLineage/Marquez, Great Expectations, freshness and cost SLOs to Slack. Standardize access with RBAC, masking, and secrets rotation; document the request flow and SLAs. Timebox thin slices ahead of demand (one CDC source, one model, one serving pattern) and track adoption, cost per query, and incident rate. Treat the platform like a product: backlog, office hours, and clear deprecations.\n\nWe used AWS API Gateway and PostgREST, and DreamFactory to auto-generate REST APIs from Snowflake/SQL Server so app teams shipped without custom services.\n\nBottom line: build products and policies that make the happy path easy and the risky path rare.",

If you must keep SSIS, point it to ADLS via the Azure Feature Pack; otherwise use ADF with a self-hosted IR from on-prem. Enable SQL Server CDC and push changes to ADLS (via ADF or Event Hubs) to avoid nightly fulls.

Pick one orchestrator (ADF is fine), version pipelines, and test backfills early. A measured skip-to-DB approach works: run a 2-week spike for one domain using Autoloader + Photon and keep MI only for legacy apps.\nWith Azure Data Factory and MuleSoft, DreamFactory helped us expose legacy SQL Server as secure REST endpoints so Databricks jobs could ingest without custom middleware.\nSo, keep Phase 1, but aim everything at ADLS/Delta and Databricks from day one so almost nothing gets thrown away.",

Set one changelog per DB, small ordered changesets, and enforce a mainline flow (feature branches rebase to avoid merge conflicts). Always dry-run and generate SQL for review; treat rollbacks as forward fixes, not “undo,” especially on prod.\n\nBytebase shines when you want review workflows, SQL lint, environment pipelines, and permission guardrails without building your own. It also logs who approved what, which kept auditors off our backs. For near-zero downtime: MySQL via gh-ost/pt-osc; MSSQL with online index rebuilds, adding columns with defaults that are metadata-only, and pre/post scripts to backfill.\n\nUse a deploy service account per env with least privilege. Gate releases with tSQLt or SQLFluff, and wire CI in GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. We used Redgate SQL Compare for drift checks and GitHub Actions for pipelines; DreamFactory gave us quick REST APIs over MSSQL/MySQL so app teams didn’t need direct DB perms.\nSo I’d go Liquibase by default; choose Bytebase only if you need built-in approvals, SQL review, and audit trails your auditors will actually use.",

E.g: denormalized data are normalized to store quality data (center of star), then denormalized (dimensions) for reporting for example.  \n2. Generally, it's a combination of the data management stage where we decide sources to use (maybe reliable ones) and define \"rules\", and the data architecture stage where we structure data. For examples, from three sources S1, S2, and S3, maybe we keep only S1 and S3 because data from S2 are not reliable (bad quality). Then data shapes and values from S1 and S3 which may differ at multiple points but generally unique identifier is used (like email), here is where \"rules\" are applied, for example use the email as identifier, set data with no value to NULL, if two other addresses have different values, keep the one which match the phone number, ...  \n3. An example is where instead of creating dimensions which is a transformation, we directly serve the data, and then flexible queries will retrieve them on demand.  \n  \nI hope it helps :)",

        "body": "1. Even if data is already denormalized at the source, it may or may not fit the analytical use case. Denormalized only means attributes are combined, not that the structure matches the grain or logic needed for reporting. If the current shape works, you can keep it. If it doesn’t, you transform it into whatever structure performs well-normalize first, remodel into facts/dims, or rebuild a wider table. The model itself isn’t the goal; usability and query performance are. So denormalized is different with ready for analytics. Adjust the structure when needed to make it clean, fast, and reliable.\n\n2. Multiple customer sources with different IDs and attributes usually lead to a conformed customer dimension. The goal is to unify identity across systems using a surrogate key, then merge records via deterministic or fuzzy matching rules. You track history using SCD when attributes change over time. From the conformed dimension, you can also generate shrunken dimensions when a specific process only needs a subset of attributes - reducing complexity and improving performance while keeping consistency. The key idea is: one enterprise-wide definition of customer, multiple shapes depending on analytical needs. For more details, you can read the chapter \"Integrate via conformed dimension\" of The Data Warehouse Toolkit.\n\n3. A star schema is part of dimensional modeling and works great for data warehousing because it’s simple, performant, and easy for business users to query. But it isn’t the only modeling approach. Data Vault focuses on flexibility and historical tracking when dealing with many changing data sources, while the Inmon approach builds a 3NF enterprise warehouse before data marts, or One Big Table stores data in wide-tables,... Each method has strengths and trade-offs, so the right choice depends on requirements - speed to deliver, data complexity, volume, regulatory needs.",

Reuse the same cleaned staging models so you’re not doing the work twice. Materialize dims/facts as tables and use incremental loads where it helps.\n\n2) For customer, create a surrogate-keyed dimcustomer and a customerxref (sourcesystem, sourceid, customersk, matchconfidence, matched\\_on, rule). Do deterministic matches first (tax ID, email+dob), then fuzzy for names/addresses. Store survivorship rules for attributes, run SCD2, and route low-confidence cases to a review queue so ops can merge/split and you can replay history. I’ve used Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for modeling, Great Expectations for tests, and DreamFactory to expose a lightweight approval API for those manual merges without giving warehouse write access.\n\n3) Skip strict star when you need event streams with nested arrays, high-card time series, graphy relationships, or an ODS/Data Vault layer feeding multiple marts.\n\nMain point: keep raw raw, standardize once into conformed models, denormalize only where it serves the queries, and treat customer identity as a first-class process :)",

        "body": "Your response for number 2 sounds a lot like thinking through the ERD for normalization: from the raw sources you develop a Kimball inspired normalized star schema using the higher quality inputs (which makes you wonder why you even bothered with ingesting and storing source 2 to begin with). \n\nIn the case of primary keys, which join to the foreign keys of the desired tables, you have to figure out if each is a one-to-one, one-to-many, or a many-to-many relationship. \n\nIf it's not one-to-one, are there any other tables that need to be joined? If so, you may find it more useful to create a set of compound keys (which could also be expressed in a singular column as a hashkey, which is my preference) - which contain all identifier columns that make each record unique. \n\nThen there's a question of data consistency - are we dealing with slowly changing dimensions or static facts? You don't want to create a key with nulls in it, but equally so you don't want to establish a new record each time a customer updates their info. So much of these considerations are determined by both the business logic at the point of collection (data source) and the desired update pattern for your tables.\n\nGetting this all diagrammed out alongside mapping out the business rules ahead of the engineering process will make everyone's work much easier, as at that point it's mostly plug-and-play to build your DDL and DML pieces.\n\nAs much as I personally bristled at Medallion architecture when I was first introduced to it, I realized you can think of your raw sources as the bronze layer, the normalized star schema as the silver layer, and all downstream transformations as your gold layer. Alternatively, you can stick with the classic approach of a raw dataset, staging tables, production tables, and data marts for specific user groups if your governance plan allows for it/business needs require it. You can also mix and match with materialized views substituting for tables if they fit your needs and your platform supports them.\n\nThis doesn't work for all types of data or use cases, but hopefully gives you something to work with and learn from.",

This means you can run Python anywhere, and not limited by what Snowpark or similar platforms allow you to do with dbt Python models.\n   * Bruin uses `uv` in the background, meaning that your pipelines will work even if you don't have Python installed, and each task runs separately in isolated environments.\n* Native column-level lineage in open-source and open-source [VSCode/Cursor extension](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/vscode-extension/overview.html).\n* Bruin allows [defining policies](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/policies.html) in code to apply your SQL statements, e.g. \"this SQL model must have an owner\" or \"it must follow these rules\". You can enforce these in your ci/cd pipelines.\n* `bruin validate` validates all your queries via dry-run to check if they are valid, this means invalid code never lands. \n* Bruin contains embedded sqlfluff for linting with your existing rules.\n* Bruin has an open-source MCP server to let agents build/help with your T layer.\n* dbt has \\`doc\\` macro, Bruin contains a built-in [glossary](https://getbruin.com/docs/bruin/getting-started/glossary.html) instead.\n\nBoth tools are useful in their own ways, and share different approaches, hope this comparison is helpful.",

Airbyte and Pipelinewise are good, but as you noticed, they can be brittle with type mismatches. Debezium is great but only if you want to own the complexity.\n\nIf you end up syncing Postgres into a warehouse and need the targets to stay correct without juggling all the CDC edge cases, a real-time sync layer such as Stacksync can help keep those tables aligned so you don’t have to chase failures down the chain.",

For Protobuf, if you have a descriptor set (.desc), protoc --decode or grpcurl (with reflection or -protoset) gets you readable output; with Confluent’s Protobuf support, the same schema‑id header flow applies. Redpanda Console or Conduktor are nice when you want a UI that decodes messages against the registry. Confluent Schema Registry and Redpanda Console do the heavy lifting day‑to‑day; DreamFactory has been handy when I need a quick REST shim around decoded records plus schema lookup.\n\n\n\nIf you build a visual inspector, make it registry‑aware (Confluent/Karapace), handle Avro/Protobuf wire headers, accept .desc files, and show schema diffs; otherwise quick scripts will still win.",

If you have a meaningful data size, trying to run updates very frequently could get very expensive. If your data is small, you might be able to set everything up as views, but you'll still be limited by the frequency of your ingestion process.\n\nInstant updates are generally in the realm of transactional software, not analytical dashboards.

If they do, it tells you when it's useful to use MV (in terms of query performance). \n\nThere are two considerations for the cost - the cost of refreshing said MV and also the cost of the query. Unfortunately without more details, this can only be answered by testing it out. The use case you describe, barring any complexities, is actually one of the more common use cases for MV. \n\n[(The following use cases highlight the value of materialized views.

We are considering something in the sphere of Azure. From what i have read so far, everybody basically hates all pipeline/low-code solutions (except for pulling data).",

Yep, this is the case for every table and also this one, we can identify the PK and normally store the hash as well with it in a new column as we use it to build our data vault/silver layer on it. In case a PK exists, we compare the hash of the concat of all columns except the PK.\n\n2. For this specific table we would do a initial load from 2015 to today if we would build the table now and then starting from tomorrow we would load a full year back every day. When loading, we would then compare only records going one year back as otherwise the query would close all records between 2015 and the 28th of November 2024. \n\n3. Yeah, considering Iceberg here! Played with it and the \"timestamp\" function really makes it way easier to go back then playing with the valid from/ valid to date columns. \n\nThe only thing i can't get my head around is. When we would use snapshots instead of SCD2, then i  assume it would be something like:\n\n\\- Initial load - All rows ranging from 2015 - today with snapshot date today (\\~12 mln rows)\n\n\\- Every day after today - All rows for the last 365 days - snapshot date of that specific date (\\~1 mln rows)\n\nIt adds 365 mln. rows in a year and when i want to know the last version of a PK on a specific date i would need to partition by and order by the PK to get the latest version. Thereby, if a record gets deleted in the source system there's no way to mark it in my append only db without making a SCD2 kind of script that fills in a valid\\_to or is\\_deleted flag. i'm probably wrong but the snapshot system seems to be best fit in cases you know your source system will never delete anything.",

If records are deleted in source ( in the last 366 days) and you want to remove it form snapshot, it is also possible via Iceberg.

Fabric has a CDC/Copy job feature and you can also use Delta Change Data Feed in Lakehouse tables to capture row-level changes for reliable upserts.   \n(3) automate discovery of new tables by keeping a metadata table or using the Fabric REST/metadata APIs in a pipeline to list Lakehouse tables and loop over them to create/update copy jobs. Community threads show people scripting this when they need to scale. \n\nAbout schema drift: Fabric’s copy tools can do mapping but they are not perfect at automatically absorbing arbitrary schema changes for all workloads. If you expect frequent schema churn, consider an ELT pattern: keep canonical data in the Lakehouse and run periodic MERGE queries from Lakehouse into Warehouse tables (or materialized views) using the Delta CDF or SQL MERGE so you have deterministic upserts. \n\nIf you want a starting checklist: pick Copy job for initial load, enable incremental or CDC for high-change tables, build a pipeline that enumerates tables and triggers jobs for new ones, and use Delta CDF or MERGE for schema-safe upserts. If you want, I can sketch a simple pipeline loop (pseudo-SQL and pipeline steps) you could drop into Fabric.",

I was initially worried that the DE org wasnt under engineering which would’ve made any potential internal transition extremely difficult so glad to know I wasn’t just overthinking that \n\nI used to be in health tech on the business side and hated it for the same reasons you mentioned haha",

But imo there are 2 different types of data engineer. 1 more swe focused and 1 more sql focused. Swe focused ones pay the same and sql ones are usually a little less. An example is at my company I am under the swe name but work on and own some DE and my org is paid very well. But we also own the data for lots of high priority ML products. \n\nI also think saying data is a cost center is just not super true. I think a lot of companies are viewing data as a service. ML teams require lots and lots of data that is accurate and growing in complexity. This requires lots of work. Most companies are putting a lot of money towards data teams now and are viewed as essential.\n\nSo in terms of pay I think this is a non factor (there are more important factors like what company you work at and how fast you grow and promote). Unless you just straight prefer be work over de work (fair as it’s subjective but I’ve enjoyed it), then  you shouldn’t worry too much.",

Classic compute doesn’t maintain that persistent MV state or the orchestration hooks, so Databricks can’t safely do partial updates there.\n\nIf OP wants incremental: create the MV on a serverless SQL warehouse or Lakeflow serverless; keep base tables in Delta with change data feed enabled; avoid unsupported bits like non-deterministic UDFs, ORDER BY, or some complex windows. If stuck on classic, reframe it as a streaming table or a Structured Streaming job using CDF with MERGE into a target, or use dbt incremental on Databricks. If full recompute is unavoidable, partition on a time key, prune by recent horizon, and run refresh off-peak.\n\nWe’ve paired Fivetran for CDC and dbt for transforms, and when app teams needed quick REST endpoints to Snowflake or SQL Server, DreamFactory auto-generated APIs so we didn’t build custom gateways.\n\nBottom line: for true MV incremental behavior, move it to serverless or implement your own CDC-based incremental path.",

That is a logical concept, and a business glossary helps promote common language among business users.  But I find it generally redundant if you already have a data dictionary which should provide a robust definition of what is physically in the field.  \n\nBut there are cases when business terms/business glossary can be useful.  For example a CUSIP is a security identifier with its own logical definition, but the physical field \"cusip\\_id\" could have dummy identifiers in it, which would necessitate differentiating between the logical (CUSIP) and the physical (cusip\\_id).",

Set some benchmarks, maybe use another LLM-as-a-judge for testing your output, etc.\n\n\nEither way, seems like a fun side project to get more familiar with the tools. Good luck OP!",

Other things justify having a threshold. Other things don't matter. Forget any sense of engineering tidiness: this is about RoI. Your time is the I - what's the R? If you ignore this thing, what loss in revenue or reputation or whatever will occur?\n\nJust because a certain column never had nulls before doesn't make it a non-nullable column. Is there clear documentation / data contract saying it'll never be null? Otherwise, it might instead be a clue that the system is now being used in a novel way, and you (or your downstream data consumers) might need to react to that. Not DQ, just an evolution of how you need to interpret the data. \n\nE.g. Maybe the developers of the source application are now \"overloading\" the orders table, using it intentionally to store some entity that isn't strictly an order, but has very similar columns - except there's no such thing as a user for this new concept. There's probably a type_id or similar in this case, that has a new value distinguishing this novel use case from the old use case. \n\nAll this is just one example explanation, of many; the wider point is, there could be a good reason why the userid column is null. Rather than going to the data owner trying to raise it as an assumed problem, you might get a quicker answer if you assume the best and just ask \"can someone tell me what it means when there's a null userid?\". \n\nIf that is in fact a bug on their side, they'll probably (in my experience) deal with it quicker when you approach it this way.",

But I’ll try to keep this rooted in how things actually work in the industry.\n\nThe difference you’re seeing between infra-heavy Zoomcamp projects and more “software-engineered” Python repos isn’t a real contradiction. They represent different layers of the stack. Zoomcamp is trying to give you a broad picture of what you *might* see in a real team. Not every company uses Terraform or Docker, but many do, so the course touches those pieces early. Later, the focus shifts more toward dbt/Bruin-style asset based work, which is how a lot of modern data pipelines are actually built and maintained.\n\nIn practice, most companies mix both approaches. The orchestrator (Airflow, Dagster, Bruin, etc.) handles scheduling and execution. The actual transformation logic usually lives in asset definitions: SQL models or small Python transforms with clear dependencies. When that logic becomes more complex or gets reused, teams extract it into a proper Python package with a src/ layout, tests and versioning. So the “tool based” approach and the “modular Python project” approach are not alternatives; they stack on top of each other.\n\nThe industry is moving toward asset based workflows because they offer a clearer dependency graph, builtin testing, ownership, lineage and easier debugging. That’s why tools like dbt, Dagster and Bruin are becoming common.\n\nFor someone applying to an internship, the goal is not to master every tool. It’s enough to show that you can write clean Python, understand Docker at a basic level, have touched one orchestrator, and can describe your work as a data flow. A simple infra-driven project plus a small, well-structured Python module is already strong.\n\nIf you can show that mix, you’re in very good shape for junior roles.",

I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone else, it was just something I resonated with when exploring, and my interest in it is unique to me. What I would recommend is not being afraid to change direction if you realize the path you're on is making you miserable. If you really can't stand compsci, don't power through the degree, all that does is set you up to do something every day that you hate.

Now years later, my love for art has been reigniting.\nMy point is what you hate right now could be something you love in the near future, same goes for what you love right now could be something you end up hating. there's no such thing as a fixed future or a fixed self.\n\nWhile its important to follow your passion, earning enough money to survive and being able to afford your interests/passion is even more important. It's disappointing but usually the point of degrees is to get a good source of income, what the current state of degrees in your country's economy is matters too. \nEdit; but take my advice with a grain of salt. Because if you are ready to face any economic hardship, or living in shitty apartments or not having any stable career, if you have enough passion (not just interest eg '\" I really like this but I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it either but true burning passion & dedication)) you know what you want with it and if you're ready to face anything for it, who knows there is always a possibility it'll work out",

        "body": "My background:\nI graduated with a master's in CS about a year ago. I'm still looking for work, but part of this was my own doing for not doing a technical internship while I was in school and not doing more personal projects (I want to teach as a 2nd career, so I tutored/did teaching jobs for CS during my summers. At the time tech was still stable, so I did not think I had to do a technical internship. You live, make choices, and you learn). \n\nI'd think about first why you hate CS and why you have negative feelings about it. For people I've tutored, usually their hatred for CS was resentment for not pursuing their passions, feelings of frustration for not understanding the material (often trying to do the work alone), math phobias, not connecting with the material, or a mixture of those reasons. All extremely valid reasons and reasons often reliant on your environment (bad profs, depression, lack of community, etc). \n\nBefore you decide to jump ship from CS, be extremely honest with yourself. Did you give CS your full effort? This means if you had the time, did you attend Office hours, talk to your professors, try to talk to peers, go to tutoring (if you could afford/uni offered it), join CS clubs, etc? If the answer is no, then something was holding you back from giving it a full shot, so you need to figure out what that is and if it's within your control to get past it. Some people, even with the best tutors, need more time to learn STEM subjects than the 4 years expected out of uni- this is completely normal, but may not be a financial option for all students (which is an unfortunate position to be during later years of uni and will require some tough decisions).\n\nIf you have managed to stay in your CS program this far without acidemic probation, then you likely understand *some* aspects of code, but too many knowledge gaps are there to make you see the big picture (which in CS is important, its when everything begins to click). With enough hustle, I think you can salvage the rest of your degree and make it through- but this will require complete humility to get there. You making this reddit post in full honesty about your knowledge gaps makes me think you might be able to do it. Next steps would be scheduling meetings with your profs, get a tutor if possible, talk to your GTAs, joining study groups, etc. The key part of wanting anyone to support you in your success is to take the initiative (with humility) and be consistent (show up, do the work). I've had students reach out to me with failing grades halfway through the course with humility, and it was that act of bravery that lead to them passing the class (if they put the work in).\n\n\nMy best advice is to find a prof you like/trust in your CS department and have an honest convo with them. I'd also schedule an appointment with career services and talk to them too (you pay a ton of money to be in uni- use your resources!!!). Ask them if there is a realistic way for you to finish your degree with the knowledge gaps or if it's for the best you switch. I know plenty of people that made CS a minor and switched to business with a technical component- there could be options you aren't aware of, but you need to have those conversations with people who have that knowledge.\n\nEven if you do switch- get that internship! It's extremely important in this job market, and the easiest way to get and prove you have experience.\n\nGood Luck! Always happy to chat further. I have personally supported many CS students to find the acidemic path right for them (even if it meant a different major) and also helped many find the fun in CS to get through it (a lot actually went from hating to loving CS). I will say in learning anything, community is extremely important to help you get over hurdles and where you need to go, so don't take any resources you have for granted :)",

If I were you, I'd learn Python as part of my courses, and do projects with C++ in personal projects. Personal projects are amazing when you lack experience by the way, employers always asked me about the personal projects I have in my resume in interviews when I was a student. Also, being good at more languages is ALWAYS a plus, it increases opportunities you can apply for AND makes it so much easier to learn other languages cuz you'd see a pattern of common things between languages. It's true that Python is getting more and more popular, some of my projects would have been brutal without the Python libraries, but there's always jobs that require C++. Finally, remember, you're not cheating on C++ if you learn Python (no judgement, I felt like I was too).\n\nGood luck and enjoy programming!",

Tech is arguably one of the most community oriented STEM fields out there, especially evident in it's history. Lean into this strength!\n\nI guarentee you have at least 5 classmates who feel exactly like you. Next time you go to class, talk to a few classmates and ask them if they are doing any side projects, how they feel about leetcode, etc. Do not feel discouraged if you hear a few people talk about their side projects/ease with leetcode- find comfort in being aware of people more knowledgeable than you in your community- you can learn a lot from them! \n\nOnce you got enough feelers, start figuring out what you want to do with that info. Is someone working on a side project that sounds interesting? Then see if you can do something similar or ask if there is any way you can join in on it. Are a lot of students struggling too? Then form a study group together and collectively figure out what projects you can work on either together (get that github practice in) or independently. Even if you are surrounded by many people who \"have it together\", ask them what got them there and how you can be more involved. Whatever you do with the feelers, make sure it's rooted in community and doing work consistently. Personal projects have really frustrating hurdles, so you need that support system to get you to keep going.\n\nYour professors are also goldmines of knowledge too, so ask them what types of personal projects you can work on or some general guidance- literally email them to schedule a meeting.\n\nIf there is one thing college gives you, it's the opportunity to connect with people (your first network). One of the best lessons I took away from college is it only takes one person to get the momentum to build a community- so if you can't find community that will help you grow, then that is a sign you need to put in the work to build it. The other big lesson I learned in college is that people really admire someone who openly wears humility and accountability on their sleeve- it builds trust and leaves room for stronger connections to grow.\n\n\nWhenever I have feelings of imposter syndrome kicking in with thoughts like \"I could never achieve x\", I pause and ask myself \"But why not me?\". And I keep asking why until I have measurable steps I can take to improve.\n\nHope that helps! Even with the stuff we are passionate about, it's easy to feel lost or overwhelmed when we try to tackle it alone. Most of the time, a bunch of people feel the same as you and are waiting for *anyone* to say the frustrations/insecurities no one else is saying outloud.",

The real metric of general knowledge/skill is what projects you have made. Since you say you haven't made anything, the best time to start making a project is right now, whenever you have some free time to spare. Pick something you find interesting and just start making it. The hardest thing is looking at a blank editor, but once you write the first few lines (even if it's just a bunch of comments outlining the general program flow you are going to implement), you'll naturally fall into a pipe-line of problems you have to solve, allowing you to iteratively reach a solution over time. There's no shame in using google or any other forms of documentation, everyone does it, and if they don't then they're either lying or making something trivial. The only thing I'd avoid, or at least use with extreme caution, is any form of generative A.I. Ideally, you'd use it as a tool or a tutor, asking it to explain concepts or answer some questions you might have. However, in reality most people (especially beginners/learners!) fall into the trap of having the A.I. do everything for them, and essentially \"outsource\" their thinking to the machine. By that point, you may as well not waste your time, since you will learn nothing.\n\nYou should also avoid falling into the trap of \"collecting\" languages as if they are Pokemon. You should be focusing on language-agnostic concepts, which can be implemented in a variety of languages (some of which will be better suited than others to whatever you're making). Of course, it's ideal to have a basic grasp of the language you are going to use, but if you're firm in your language-agnostic concepts, it will be easy to just pick up the syntax along the way.\n\nAs an answer to your question, it's definitely not over. You just need to change your approach to education. And you need to ask yourself if you really enjoy Computer Science, because if you do, then everything you do will feel a lot less arduous.",

Then you keep building several until it looks a little less crappy. Then you build other objects and repeat the process. If you do that enough times, you'll naturally pick up other tools and methodologies that'll help you with your building. Over time, you'll be able to start building a house with your experience. \n\n\nYou won't know what many tools are called, names of all the screws, and the best way to use everything. You just pick them up and try them out, learning as you build things.\n\n\n.\n\n\nYou're a **beginner** trying to build a house (Minecraft mods) when you don't even know what a hammer does (Java). Of course that'll feel overwhelming. \n\n\nFirst, play around with Java. Follow a tutorial or two about it. Maybe do a course or make something cool. There's no \"am I ready?\" You're ready whenever you say you're ready, whether that's after a 1hr yotube playlist or a several week MOOC. You'll *never* know everything about Java. Never. You can get a PhD in CS with Java and not know how to build a single project. Fortunately, you don't need to know *everything* about Java or CS to accomplish your goals. \n\n\nDon't let that lack of knowledge make you afraid to start building with it. You can start building things even after a simple 1hr tutorial. It would be a far cry from MC mods (little chair vs a hige house), but it's definitely enough to start your journey. \n\n\nI'd probably go through a beginner course utilizing Java. Udemy? Coursera? mooc.fi? Pick your poison. Anything works.

Hyperskill is more expensive, but it'll probably be the easiest intro to Java. The mooc is probably going to be very in-depth, and very hard, but free. Probably overkill. Coursera might have some free courses. There are many. Just choose whatever beginner Java course you can find. \n\n\nWhatever your choice is, just go through it until you know a little bit about Java. Your goal is simple exposure and to be able to build small little things that output into a terminal. They likely won't teach you how to build things in MC and you may be exposed to a lot of concepts you won't find immediately useful. Just get comfortable seeing code, using code, and thinking like a programmer.\n\n\nDon't go down a rabbit hole of things (remember the PhD comment?). Java can build practically anything, so you'd be able to learn so much without achieving your goals. Just get the basics down until you're comfortable. \n\n\n.\n\n\nOnce you have a basic understanding of what Java is, go straight into learning how to mod.\n\n\n[Here's one resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1csh3yp/comment/l44waul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Here's another](https://www.mcjty.eu/docs/intro)\n\n\nThere are a lot.\n\n\nDon't freak out. You won't know anything really. The above Java stuff was just getting you used to the hammer, nails, properties of wood, etc (depending on the resource, you may have built a chair or two).\n\n\nThis, however, is the real deal. You're actually going to start building chairs, and it's going to suck and it will look like crap. You won't even know a lot of the things being talked about and you'll feel like you're at the very beginning again. That's okay and perfectly normal. You have to acquire a few more tools, but Java is the biggest learning curve and the one everything interacts with, so it's the one I recommended getting comfortable with first. \n\n\nGo through tutorial after tutorial about Minecraft mods, follow the beginner steps, and try to recreate things as they do it. Then try to do it again without the video, pausing each time. Then try to manipulate what you've created, or even break it. Then try to repeat the entire process from scratch until you recreate it (minus the setting up your tools part).\n\n\nThen move on to the next tutorial. Once you've acquired enough small skills, try to go about building a simple little thing yourself (you can even try after your first tutorial). This simple thing might be insanely hard. You might have to reference different documentation and videos to help you out. Once you finally finish it, try to improve it. Try to recreate it if you really want to reinforce the knowledge. \n\n\nThen move onto the next idea. \n\n\nOnce you do that enough, you should be able to see other people's source code for their projects and be able to pick out little bits and pieces that you might want to try yourself, or research about to see what it does. Try to contribute to an open source mod or pull from their projects and play around with the code. \n\n\nThat series of building is what will eventually get you to creating your own big ideas. \n\n\nPeople legit go through the Kaupenjoe videos (first link) without even knowing *any Java* and successfully learn how to build projects after a year. You can start that way too, but I thought maybe it'd feel better knowing a little bit about Java first (if you already don't know anything). If you're overwhelmed, skip everything I told you and go straight to that. It'll be very hard and scary, but learning to program is a marathon, not a single sprint.\n\n\n.\n\n\nI can't really help you beyond that. Things take time. Don't stress about memorizing everything, being perfect in everything you do, or finding the best paths. Just progress, 1hr a day, every single day. \n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nA painter doesn't get good after their first stick figure. They do tens of thousands of failed small attempts that build up to the occasionally solid large attempt. As they build up their skills from a ton of small, crappy projects, the eventually move onto more and more quality on each piece. \n\n\nTheir skills don't manifest from perfecting their pain brush, getting the best pigments they can, or knowing absolutely everything they can about color theory. \n\n\nDon't worry about getting the best tutorial, learning Java perfectly, and being overwhelmed by all these new ideas. Just go through the first thing you see related to MC mods, that makes sense to you, and work up your skills, little by little. ",

You will be overwhelmed, drained, annoyed and disappointed regardless. Learning is never a cake walk. You'll hit barriers and it will take effort to get over them. Programmers are just the people who stuck with it longer than others. Nothing special about them. \n\nA good way to retain what you learn is trying to apply it to your goal. Since you have one already that's excellent and a great motivator. Every time you learn something think of how you can apply it to that goal of making apps and modding Minecraft. No matter how small there is always a way to apply it. \n\nThe first language is always the toughest. You're not only learning the syntax of a language and how to order things, but you're also learning computer science concepts at the same time. Once you get the concepts though you can easily transfer that knowledge to another language or project. It's like you're building a house. You need to learn how to hammer nails and which screws go where. But you also need to learn how to make a foundation and how to support a roof. \n\nSo keep it up. You can't force things so take breaks and decompress and let things sink in. You won't become making apps tomorrow, but you can learn the building blocks a little bit every day or every other day or even once a week. Persistence is the name of the game.",

You learn *out* rather than you learn *up* if that makes any sense. And you advance in terms of your general maturity, rather than specific knowledge building on each other as theorems imply further theorems. \n\nThe other thing is that programming sits in this place between academia and a trade, where there’s a ton of “craft” and professional knowledge that exists in the form of essentially folk wisdom transmitted via forums and blogs, not books. \n\nAll that is to say, it’s harder to curate a list like you imagine, and there’s going to be way more disagreement about it when they do.\n\nHere is a list of articles about software which I think are all excellent, but decidedly mostly on the advanced side.

For instance, you can go to Google scholar and look up whatever you want and find tons of papers ranging from really niche sub disciplines to more generalized concepts.  Keep in mind if you have no gone to college or taken a lot of high level CS/math courses, there might be a language barrier between academic speak and how you are used to reading things, but it can be learned just like anything else.\n\nAlso, books are great and more comprehensive in my opinion.  You say you want to get into a website; I HIGHLY recommend checking out Jon Ducketts HTML/CSS, Javascript/JQuery,MySQL/PHP books if you ever have some extra money.  They are absolutely excellent, and while they use some outdated tech like JQuery and PHP, I think they really teach you the fundamentals of web development to allow you to harness the power of whatever is at your disposal rather than relying on cobbling together frameworks.  \n\nHope you find some other good stuff as well, good luck!",

You’re receiving formatted text that your host binds to a handing method which in turn returns formatted text. Taking the long view, Rest is simply a point of view that “the http verb in the formatted text header should dictate the operation” which replaced the previous opinion which more or less said “just use post or get for that mandatory verb header and name your operation in the relative path and the name should usually match the handling method so you can find things”. Neither is wrong. People just have strong opinions about formatted text. \n\nBonus: If you really want to annoy people, go take the position that soap with xsd-defined payloads is more precise, more extensible, and can be more secure than rest with json (it is) and that devs were simply too lazy to learn the spec. It’s a bit better now that swagger (open api) is more mainstream, but for a while rest was a real pain to consume.\n\nThe next thing to remember is that your reaction is valid and you’re often going to have more tailored controller services for web front ends. These aren’t enterprise APIs. They’re part of the same logical application and are only services because the halves run on two different computers. Otherwise they would just be helper or data layer methods. We do this because chattiness and sequential service call latency is the death of web pages. So if a commonly used page needs a getMyStuff composite method that returns a splittable json payload in one hit, that’s not crazy. \n\nIf you need that to be available generically, you can expose a graphql or composite endpoint that allows you to specify an object and specific children and fields. Try not to make something that creates security or sql injection problems.",

It’s the kind of book that starts with stuff where you’re like “Yeah, obviously” and then a couple chapters later you’re going “WHAT?!” People tend to have strong opinions about it one way or the other; I think it’s brilliant and should be on pretty much every programmer’s to-read list, but plenty of people think it’s overrated. Given that it’s free, it’s worth a try.\n* [*Concrete Mathematics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) is, as the title suggests, focused on the math side of CS, but since this is where most programmers are weakest, it’s worth mentioning. One of its authors, Donald Knuth, is more famous for his advanced work, but *CM* is suitable for pretty much anyone who is confident about the bare bones of programming but wants to understand it more deeply.",

He wrote a thing that when you reverse engineer it, it displays pictures from your own hard drive, as a deterrent to reveng further. He hacked into ring -2 on an x86 processor - you don’t know what ring -2 is? Neither did anyone else until he hacked it. He wrote Cantor Dust to suggest what the next gen of reveng tools should look like.

Don't worry much about structure, just make it work.\n2. find duplicated code and extract into reusable methods.\n3. single responsibility - methods should generally only be concerned with completing a single, simple task. Find methods that don't follow this and extract into simpler methods.\n4. Once you have a set of methods that appear to be focused on a particular variable(s) or piece of state, consider grouping these methods and variables into a class. Think about how these methods/properties might represent some entity. \n\nThat said, don't get bogged down by focusing too much on OOP. Learn programming first. As a beginner, you should be focused on getting your code to work and that's it. With smaller scale apps/beginner projects, OOP often introduces unnecessary complexity",

I would create a static instance of the class and try to do everything with that.\n\nI finally understood that a class is essentially a \"cookie cutter\". You use it to create an object which looks like the class. Then you call the methods on that object. The reason you would want to do this is because you have multiple objects which are essentially the same, or similar. \n\nFor example, take the ghosts in Pac-Man. You could write this by declaring X and Y co-ordinate variables for each ghost, but then you'd have a bunch of variables like ghost1x and ghost3y and ghost4x and so on. Think about how writing collision detection would work. You'd have to check if ghost1x==playerx && ghost1y==playery || ghost2x==playerx && ghost2y==playery.... nightmare.\n\nInstead, define a ghost class, and instantiate it four times, once for each ghost. The ghost class could include a collision detection function, to check if its *instantiation* hit the player. Now you can just write something like:\n    if greenGhost.hitPlayer()\n        player.gotCaught()\n\nYou don't have to worry about how the calculation of the collision detection works any more -- at least, that is the theory.\n\nHave you searched for beginner-friendly OOP tutorials outside of video sites?

The real way you learn OOP isn’t by studying diagrams, it’s by modeling small real systems, giving each class a clear responsibility, and avoiding the “giant class with 20 methods” trap. That shifts your thinking from: the procedural way: “What steps do I need to do?” to the OOP way: “What objects exist in this world, and what responsibilities do they have?”\n2. Tutorials don’t teach design, books do. If you want actual design and not just syntax, these beginner-friendly resources are gold: **\"Head First Design Patterns\"**: the best intro to OOP thinking, **\"Practical Object-Oriented Design\"**: very readable and extremely practical, and **\"Refactoring improving design of existing code\"**: not OOP-specific, but teaches you to *see* structure and smell bad design\n3. Another underrated tip: read good OOP code. Python libraries, open source github repositories, or even frameworks.\n4. On the language choice: Python can teach you OOP, but it’s a multi-paradigm language, so beginners often get mixed signals. If you want the concepts to crystallize faster, something more “pure OOP” like Java, C#, or Ruby tends to make the underlying principles way clearer. Once it clicks, you can apply it in any language.\n\nAnd honestly, everyone writes procedural code inside classes at first. Keep going. The moment it clicks, it really clicks.",

That being said I'm not sure if there are any FP units that do 64 bit faster than 32 bit.\n\nAs for your programs, you should always ask why you need more precision.   IEEE supports FP32, FP64 and FP128 as for what you are calling shorts I suspect that is language dependent and is not a floating point type.   Often we are talking about \"floats\" as 32 bits and \"doubles\" as 64 bits (C++).  There is also a potential for long doubles.   Again in the context of C++, shorts are integer types, so shorts would almost always be faster than the floating point unit.   The big but is that this can be execution unit dependent.    I can't help with C# as i know zip about it, but if shorts are integers there then you might want to look into your understanding of the language.   Integers and floats have two different use cases.    it is important to understand that floats are approximations.\n\nSo when you ask which is faster, you need to ask what hardware is it running on.   GPU's can really muck things up because of special types and optimizations.    One of those optimizations is what can be done in parallel.    For example if the GPU (for example) 128 16 bit integer operations per cycle as opposed to say 32 doubles per cycle which is faster?    What I'm trying to say here is that it depends on the specifics of language and hardware the code runs on.   In the made up numbers above the processor would complete 4x more operations per cycle.\n\nCaches are a wholly different discussion.   Generally shorter types means more data in cache but you also need to consider cache line length and other behaviors.   If you have truly time critical code you may need to optimize for cache behavior on a specific processor.    It is completely possible to arrange things (floating point operations) such that cache might not be a problem compared to integer.",

The FPU converts all floating point type to a large type with excess bits to help reduce errors, so those floats get a double (pun?!) conversion from their 32 bit value to a 80 or 120 or whatever it is now bit value, the computations are done, and it gets converted back again to the smaller value.  Integers don't suffer as much of this on some hardware, it just depends.  X86 type chips for example has overlapped registers for 1, 2, 4, and 8 byte integers all in the same physical circuits, so it does not have to promote a 32 bit int to a 64 bit and back to do the computations.   Also, integer circuitry \\*in general\\* is simpler than floating point, due to how it has to handle the exponent and base for floats while integers are pretty much simple math.  I mean a multiply in binary is either a copy of the value (multiplied by 1) or all zeros (by zero) so a multiply is just steps that shift and add.  A multiply in floating point is notably more complicated.\n\nI don't know the modern timings.  FPUs are VERY fast.  Integer math circuits are also VERY fast.  But all things being equal, the extra work for floating point makes me feel pretty confident that its probably at least microscopically slower than integer math if you can actually do the same work using both types.  It may take a billion plus repeated operations to show a meaningful difference when timing it, though.  And repeated operations MAY skip the double conversion stuff, if you are working with the same entity over and over that would be optimized to have far less impact, so the actual task being tested matters a lot too.\n\ncache and bus stuff outside the CPU has an impact, and THERE, bigger is not better.  Its a totally different conversation.\n\nLanguage does matter, at least somewhat.  Or the compiler, and how good it is.  Some less popular languages may not have the A team working on the compilers the way we have for big languages like c++ and so on, as one issue.

But the AI isn’t entirely wrong, it’s just answering a question that doesn’t matter for you.\n\n\nModern CPUs are optimized for 32/64-bit operations, and short arithmetic can require extra sign-extension instructions. Float SIMD (SSE/AVX) is also absurdly well-optimized compared to integer SIMD. So in a tight loop doing pure math on individual values, floats can genuinely be faster per-operation.\n\n\nBut that’s not what data-oriented design is about. The win from smaller types is memory bandwidth and cache — if you’re iterating over millions of values, smaller types mean more fit in a cache line, fewer misses, faster overall. The AI conflated ALU throughput with memory access patterns, which are completely different concerns.\n\n\nNone of this matters unless you’re in a game engine’s hot path or crunching massive datasets. In normal application code, you’ll burn way more time on the code smells: constant casts when APIs expect int, subtle bugs from implicit narrowing, maintaining mental overhead about which precise type lives where.\n\n\nConstrained types absolutely make sense for semantic clarity though — using sbyte for a deck index or ushort for a port number communicates intent and gives you some compile-time bounds enforcement. That’s a readability and correctness win, just not a performance one",

It sounds like you have an enthusiasm for games development, but enrolled in a generic Systems Engineering course - which won't teach games development very much, if at all.\n\nBut the concepts - including UML and much of the other stuff you are struggling with - are applicable to this subject area.\n\nre the no interest in \"soft skills\".\n\nIt could be that you are only interested in the \"colours, fonts and strategy\" stuff and not interested in the boring stuff such as creating and maintaining the administrative stuff such as a database containing user credentials, leader boards and other stuff that is \"administrative stuff\" that isn't really part of the game. Or not interested in Source Code Control. Or not interested in the design process (which may involve some UML and other diagramming techniques as well as boring old documentation). But these are all important things to understand and understand how to use them and when to use them.\n\nWhen I was at University, there were definitely subjects and topics that were part of the course that many of us though \"What is the point of this?\". As a result those people that thought that way often struggled with it. But the reality was that these, while maybe not mainstream in our ultimate careers, did include important \"background\" information and/or skills that were relevant to our ultimate careers.\n\nAnyway, that was my thought when reading your post.

It should also be relatively small, so that you don't feel frustrated about not being able to finish it.\n\nA couple of suggestions off the top of my head:\n\n1. Just a simple intro page about yourself. Later you can introduce your other hobby projects there\n2. Habit tracker. You can use it to track whether you work on hobby projects every day :)\n3. Language learning tool\n\nOver time, you will have a much better idea of what and how you want to build.\n\nThis simple habit accomplishes many things at the same time:\n\n1. Gives a lot of learning opportunity. You need to think what tools you need to use, how to use them, etc.\n2. Similar to 1, but it's more about some domain knowledge. e.g. if you decide to build a language learning tool, you'd probably research some established tools and will either copy their UI/UX or even improve them. You'd understand what challenges users have while using these kinds of apps, etc\n3. Builds confidence. Once you have a couple of very small projects under your belt, you can gradually move to more and more complex ones. Over time, you will feel more and more confident in your skills\n4. Builds your portfolio that you can show to your potential employer. Trust me, most employers(at least the ones I'd like to work for) would love to see you build stuff in your free time without anybody's direction.\n\nIMO AI is only scary for junior devs who can only follow simple directions of their employers and don't show any initiative. By building your own things, you will inevitably learn how to be more proactive which I don't think AI will be able to replicate in foreseeable future.",

Can also look at any good Algo course text book.    \n  \nSecond, I just wanted to encourage your self study by telling you, the vast majority of useful things I learned in college were things I studied on my own, so keep going!\n\nThe rigor of my cs courses was a complete joke. If you find your cs courses easy, it's probably because they are! Don't ever lower your standards. If you're not being challenged and pushing through large resistance when learning, then you're leaving a ton of knowledge and skill on the table. That knowledge and skill will make all the difference in your professional career.",

That isn't to say getting a certification would definitely be worthless, but in my mind, if your goal is to be able to show a potential employer \"Hey, I can do X thing,\" it's actually probably more effective to just focus on talking about interesting projects you've done (don't need to be external to school, can just be school assignments or final projects) at a level that shows that you have a good conceptual grasp of what you were doing, along with some experience with the tools that are common to the industry you're interested in. Tools that you might get asked about are ones related to version control (e.g., git), debugging (e.g., gdb), and unit testing (lots of options, and you may not use anything formal for this purpose, which is also OK). It is not necessary to fully master any one tool, you're just trying to signal \"Hey, I have used these tools as part of my process, and I can fairly quickly pick up different ones that do the same job.\"\n\nAs for questions 3 and 4 about what else you should be doing right now and how to stand out, I will first say that I admire your willingness to think ahead. On the other hand, I will also say that you should not feel compelled to do extra work beyond what is already being assigned to you at school. This is because, imo, the amount of hard work and effort it takes to stand out is not worth the payoff *if* your only goal with that effort is to stand out a little more. Your driving motivator should just be what you're interested in, especially because what you're interested in may change, which can lead to you going into a different field than the one you're currently considering, at which point any past hyper-specific work done for the purpose of standing out may not be very useful to you.\n\nThat being said, projects are a good place to start. A project can be anything you're interested in: a website, a game, a tool, an extension of a school project. The important thing is just that there's some overlap between your project and the field you're interested in. For example, if you think you might want to work in embedded systems, then building a web app won't help you very much (it may still help a little, though). However, you want to be willing to devote some proper time to it -- probably at least 50 hours in total, spread out over the course of a summer or school year.",

I am not sure what university you go to or how they teach it there, but in general I don't think they teach it very well and you certainly have not had enough classes to be this hard on yourself.\n\nOOP is not just a Java thing either. You can think of it as real life and that is why it is supposed to make sense once you understand that. Classes are just descriptions of things. Objects are instances of that description.\n\nUse animals as an example. Mammals are a class that describes things with hair. So,  hasHair == true. Some mammals are land animals and some are sea animals. So, where == \"land | sea\". A lion (subclass) \"Inherits\" the attributes of a mammal and adds a few more attributes like sharp teeth. So, hasTeeth == true && hasBigTeeth == true && isDangerous == true :). A pig is a mammal too and it \"inherits\" from mammal too. Some of the attributes it shares with a lion has different values. If we were to control a lion or a pig we call the \"run\" function, the lion will have a faster run implementation than the pig. \"Polymorphism\". We typically hide the implementation and field access to make code less brittle. We would not want someone binding directly to something we want to be able to change later. We make these attributes and internal functions private. \"Encapsulation\".  There should be a subclass of mammal that lion inherits from named \"LandAnimal\". Now this part gets tricky because Java does not support multiple inheritance so we want to use hasA vs isA implementation. When we access the base class LandAnimal which actually has the \"run\" method which is slower in pigs than in lions \"polymorphism\" again. LandAnimal is an \"abstraction\" (or base class) of Lion (isA LandAnimal). Or we can use interfaces for this \"abstraction\" (hasA LandAnimal) interface (composition).\n\nI just wrote this from the top of my head so I hope it makes sense and is correct.\n\nI hope this helps.

Just grinding won't get you further. Your brain will just get overloaded and shut down.\n\nA little story from my experience: when Java came out, I was already programming for over a decade and was proficient in multiple procedural languages. Then, I tried Java and OOP. This was a humbling experience. I could not make heads or tails at all. The *language* was easy enough to understand, but switching from procedural to OOP didn't click at all. I tried many times and failed many times until at one point, it suddenly started to make sense. Can't even say what really did it for me.\n\nNow, my advice is to program something with it and here, I deviate from the common examples: build a *library* for card games, like Blackjack, Poker, Uno, etc. Start with modeling a single `Card`. It has a suit, a rank, a numeric value, a face, a back, it can be face up or down - the fields. The card can report its data - provided it is face up, it can draw itself (in a loose sense), it can be flipped - toggle face up/down.\n\nThen, go further: make a `Deck` that can hold a full set of cards, that can be shuffled, that can deal cards, that can tell if it is empty or not, etc.\n\nNext, a `Hand` that takes cards.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBuild it in such a way that you can create different `Card` types, e.g. PokerCard, UnoCard, etc. All these can use the `Deck` without modification.\n\nWith such an exercise, you'll cover abstract classes, inheritance, composition, polymorphism. \n\nThe benefit is that you can draw a relation between a real world object and its digital representation.",

Sometimes when you’re overworking your brain on a problem, you’ll accidentally shoot over the solution and continue to complicate it in your mind. Taking a break lets you ‘repeat’ that process with a cooled off mind, and you often end up having a breakthrough in the first 5 minutes or you at least approach it differently and in an uncomplicated manner.\n\nAlso I’d worry more about the fact that you have algorithms after this 😭 I remember that stuff was so much harder than OOP.",

But always return to your own. \n\nDebate people. Be able to debate their side of an argument better than they can. \n\nWhen you come back to programming, you’ll be able to drill into problems better. You’ll be better able to take ownership of the concepts and will feel at more liberty to play with them. \n\nPhilosophy will teach you to not take your understanding for granted, and how to dig into the details. \n\nAlso if possible, dialogue with yourself as if you are two people. So like\n“What is a variable?”\n“Well, I don’t know, what do you think a variable is?”\n“A variable is some piece of data assigned to a name”\n“And what do you mean by assigned to a name?”\n“Well, I take a word and I set it equal to something, could be a number a string of characters”\n“When you say set it equal, do you mean like 1+1=2 “\n“Well no, the variable is a placeholder for whatever value ive assigned to it”\n“Oh, so you use it instead of the value “\n“Yes”\nEtc…\nMost programmers will say slow your thinking down, dialoging like this is a way of doing that. \n\nGood luck",

Backend work is a perfectly solid direction, and the fact that you enjoyed wiring APIs to databases is a good sign. You do not need to be great at front end to have a career. You also do not need to master data structures in one pass. Most people only internalize that stuff once they use it in real projects.

Most skills transfer very well from one project to the next: I will not just forget how closures work from one language to the next, or what the difference between arrays and linked lists is. And the implementation details of a language can be cross referenced very quickly: For every language I currently use I keep a link to their official docs in my hotbar, and have my search engine setup to search that page specifically. \n\nSame goes for frameworks or other concepts. Sure, it's not as fresh as it used to be, and recall is slow (because I haven't used it in a while), but I still have a fundamental understanding of backend frameworks, rendering pipelines and game engines for example. (and yes, they all (TM) basically work the same) It's not as much decayed knowledge, as just background knowledge. When I need it, I normally have some time to refresh it first. (It's very rare that someone wakes me up at 4am, holds a gun to my head and forces me to implement a raytracer from memory) Once you have learned something once, it's easy to re learn it; like visiting your home town after some years not being there. \n\nEverytime I needed something I used to know by heart again, it took at most a few hours to get back up and running. Be that algorithms and datastructures (I recently looked up maximum flow again for example), how to build a raytracer/pathtracer (currently looking at some papers that came out after I left university) or just a language I haven't touched in years (rust, even though it is still pretty new). \n\nI never saw any reason to \"keep up to date\".

If you let it hand you full solutions, you won’t build your own internal map of how things fit together. But if you treat it like a senior engineer who gives hints while you still write the code yourself, your skills level up fast.\n\nWhat helped me early on was giving myself stretches of time where I didn’t ask anything until I had at least tried to outline the solution. Even a rough plan is enough. Once you have that, AI becomes a tool that fills in gaps instead of a tool that replaces the entire thought process. You’ll be surprised how much you actually know once you force your brain to engage first.\n\nVue is a great choice to learn because the mental model is clean. If you keep building small projects where you write most of the logic yourself, you’ll break through that “wall” feeling. And once you’ve done a few builds where you genuinely understand the moving parts, AI becomes a speed boost instead of a crutch.\n\nYou’re in a good spot. You just need more reps without a safety net so your confidence catches up.",

It can actually take you all the way to experienced full stack cloud developer (if you want to take it that far).\n\nStart the TODO frontend and make it fully responsive. For persistence, use localStorage (easier) or IndexedDB (harder) and create a JS ORM for persistence so you exercise these muscles. This will make it a fully functional todo list that works for that browser. From there add a backend with database. Modify your ORM to connect to the backend via REST. That will make it work in any browser (locally).\n\nNext turn it into a SaaS app with OAuth2 signup/login, member management, Stripe subscription processing, calendar scheduling, email reminders, SMS, CI/CD with automated testing and deployment.\n\nYou will be able to build almost anything with the skills you learn through these TODO exercises.\n\nStart small and keep adding the next small thing to it. Add what you want to learn and let that be your guide. You will see progress as you go.\n\nAlso, looking things up and figuring out how to solve problems is the main part of programming. The typing (programming) part is only between 10-20%. The other 80-90% is looking things up and learning how to solve that next small problem This never stops.

The most expensive one is around 130 bucks but there is a full range between the 15 and 130 bucks ones so you'll probably be able to find one that accommodates your budget while doing what you need it to do, for example the pi400 has an integrated keyboard and sells for around 60 bucks, found one second hand for 35 a while back and that was pretty nice. You could definitely look into second hand ones into your area, or maybe ask for it as a Christmas present if that's an option, it won't run any games but for second hand stuff you can get that, a monitor and keyboard and mouse for under 100 bucks and have a fully functional setup for programming and browsing he internet and your parents could use it as a computer too if they need it (might be a good selling point for them idk).",

For example when a user is updating data, we might even need his ip address to validate things, whereas in the case of admin we don't have this requirement. Many other possibilities could arrive. What approach Will you suggest in those situations. We might end up preparing and passing a lot of data that is not needed for processing the request and this, data has to be passed a lot from parent to child functions, this reminds me about the prop drilling hell of react, I don't want this problem in my backend.

Are you asking if the win rate is too low to be fun, or are you asking if the program is behaving incorrectly?\n\nIt's straightforward to calculate the exact probability of each possible outcome of a spin, and thereby calculate the probability of a win. One way to do this is by brute force: there are 116^3 = 1560896 possible outcomes, all equally probable, and you can write a program to count them up *without* randomness.\n\nWith a little work, you can calculate the same win probability more efficiently, by avoiding repeatedly considering all the duplicate ways to get the same outcome.\n\nOf course, even if the probability of a win is 1/100, that doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly one win every 100 plays. The actual outcome is very likely to be higher or lower due to random variation. If you want to check your program for correct behavior, you can do a large number of runs (say, 10000) and then use an appropriate statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) to see where the observed number of wins falls, in comparison to the statistically likely range.\n\nI'm not a gambling expert, but I believe real slot machines don't *only* pay out if all of the symbols on a line match. They have additional lower-value payouts that are more frequent, designed to keep the player engaged and addicted in hopes of a jackpot.",

Every stats class I ever took at some point had the caveat, \"we're not trying to turn you all into degenerate gamblers, but...\"\n\nSo, here, you essentially have a math problem, then a programing problem implementing your math domain.\n\nFirst up, the probabilities of a result and ultimately the payouts for those results.  How many tiers do you have?\n\nThis write up is probably a good start: [Slot Machine Odds & Chances of Winning: Probability of Slot Machines](http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/extfiles/slotsprobability.htm).\n\nNot sure how your spread sheet maps to reels, but that would be a framework to start from.  That said, I suspect the computer based machines fake it.  At the end of the day, a commercial slot machine need only be consistent with the odds; how it gets there shouldn't matter.\n\n>My biggest concern is that for every 100 spins, I win 1-2 times.\n\nYou work the math to fit your criteria.  That's actually absurdly low.  Or, rather, wins tend to be ranked, the goal being constant little dopamine hits with the promise of something bigger.  Gotta keep the addicts addicted.\n\nFrom [N.J.

Just treat it as gobbledygook that *has* to be written for a program to work.\n\nHowever, it's great that you are curious. The `main` method is what the Java runtime invokes when you run a Java program. It has the specific signature you described, and here are the reasons for the questions you asked about the method signature:\n\n1. All methods are supposed to either return a value, or indicate that they do NOT return a value using the keyword `void`. Java does not expect the `main` method to return a value, which is why we use the keyword `void`.\n\n2. `main(String[] args)`: This is just the name of the method that takes a string array as an argument. This does not directly result in any user input. The Java runtime receives the user input arguments from the OS, and then passes them into `main` when it invokes the `main` method.\n\n3. The method is marked public because it has to be invoked by the Java runtime. It needs to be accessible to the outside world, it wouldn't make sense for it to be private.\n\nHonestly, I don't know if any of this explanation would make sense to a beginner. When I was learning Java, I just accepted that these are lines that have to be there. It made sense only after I had learned a lot more about data types, arguments, return values, classes, etc.",

Having a project idea can motivate you to learn what you need to make your project work.\n\nI find talking to an AI helpful, too. You can even ask an AI to give you a skeleton for your programming idea. It might give you more than you want, but if it does, trying to figure out the code it generated can also be a way to get into the learning process (provided the code isn't too complicated).",

You could crack it within a few weeks. And solving problems can be fun, especially when you begin to understand the mechanics.

You have to learn all of the basics, so you are able to specialize in any CS subfield later. This also enables you to understand, to have a common vocabulary and knowledge base with others, even if they have a different specialization. I spezialized in computer graphics at uni. One of my best friends in networking and distributed computing. Although we barely had any courses in common after the first 2 years, we could talk to each other and explain one another what we were doing and how it works, with barely any problems. \n\nThose skill are not immediately, obviously useful. But they are necessary for computer science. \n\nAnd as someone who was a tutor for a DSA course: Those courses are there to give you the toolkit to reason about algorithms, analyze them and even figure out new ones if you need to. They don't teach you how to program, and that's by design. It is a different skill. \n\nProgramming on the other hand is something completely different. It is a craft. The program doesn't care if you know Dijkstras Algorithm, can integrate in multiple dimensions or know the difference between average and median. If helps to know those things about as much as a knowledge of a structural engineer helps you building wooden cabins. Good to have? Sure. Can you learn it quicker and easier for this specific usecase? Also yes. \n\nIf you want to learn programming, you will either have to hope that your school has some courses in that direction that will be helpful, or you will have to take your foundational knowledge (like maths and DSA), get some tutorials and get programming. \n\n>Should I choose a specific field of software engineering\n\nNot 100% sure, but it sounds like you really should focus on the fundamentals first\n\n>I tried to read books on software design\n\nagain, fundamentals. You are trying to run before you can walk. \n\nIf you are still at uni/school at a level where you just had your first DSA courses, and maths, the size of project you are supposed to tackle is tic tac toe in the terminal. A calculator. An CLI that simulates how fast your money can grow with a 5% annual compound interest. \n\nOnce you have that, a good next set of problems is the size of small games. Rebuilt Tetris. Flappy Bird. The Akinator! \n\n>and we didn't actually code in class because we were told \"I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science.\"\n\nAnd I nearly missed this quote, but it fits too well with what I tried to convey before: This is not a problem, this is how it is supposed to be. You are in a course designed to make you a scientist, not a craftsman! Sure, most people in Cs degrees end up going into programming, and I would argue we are better at it because of out degree, but you really should listen to your teachers.",

From what I gather you want to learn how to program and you are learning concepts, theory, math, ...\n\nStop doing it that way.\n\nIf you want to learn how to program start programming and let that guide what you need to learn. For projects, if you are doing this to get a job then REST and CRUD are your friends. REST is mostly frontend to backend. CRUD is mostly backend to database. There is a lot to learn there and also around those two main things.\n\nFor the projects you build, incorporate those things into it. TODO app? Add  REST, backend, and database. If you really want to learn how to become a software engineer, turn this into a SaaS. Add signup/login, membership management, subscriptions and payments, calendar scheduling, email reminders. SMS. Learn how to deploy this to the cloud with automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.\n\nUse git/github throughout and create pull requests for each new feature. Start small and add new small things one at a time. Pull request in between.\n\nThis sets your roadmap for learning how to do this.\n\nOnce you can do that, pick an existing project you use or have seen. Think about how they built it using what you learned from the full stack TODO SaaS application. Start building it to learn how they did it.  \n  \nThat is how you build projects. This is how you learn how to become a software engineer.",

After intermediate programming, a 200+ class where if you didn't understand somehting the professor would just say \"I'm not helping you, try codecademy\" as if we didn't have other classes we have to manage, we can't invest all our time into guideless trial and error, especially since after a few small examples of a function  in class then we were assigned an entire project weekly without guidance. Despite that I stilled used codecademy, CS50x, etc, I just don't know how to move past the intermediate programming phase. A lot of it is self learning yes, but the structure has been confusing. Most bootcamp esque courses have not exactly helped me move past intermediate programming courses in a programming language such as java, being bombarded with custom libraries and highly abstract methods & library attributes didn't really help for the software design & implementation we had to do in class.",

For everything else, you need to go the the TAs, tutors or whatever structure you have. They normally have a lot more time alotted to helping students. And if that doesn't work, fellow students were a huge help when I was at university. \n\nAnother important note: You are not expected to become more than an intermediate programmer at this point. That takes experience, which you don't have yet. Being intermediate is totally fine until you get your degree. That is more or less everything you are expected to know as a junior developer anyways: You have the basics needed to produce code under guidance, and you have the background (CS degree) to learn fast, because concepts you will need are already somewhere in your brain. There is no expectation to be much better than that. \n\nIf you want to be better than that for yourself, there is no shortcut: You need to build real projects. No tutorial, bootcamp or lecture can really prepare you. We had two project seminars at my university, which were basically: \"Here is a team of 5/6 people, this is your task, we will check in with you in 6 weeks / after the semester\" and that is where I personally learned most about programming. If you don't have seminars like this and/or cannot find a group, you can also do this on your own. (Although a group helps, both with productivity, motivation and learning)",

I’d highly suggest you stay away from AI for anything and solve your issues the old school way with Google and StackOverflow.\n\nYou feel like you suck at less things when you become more confident in your ability to solve “unsolvable” problems or “really hard” problems handed down to you without any direction other than “please help me”",

Most learning in programming is done by working with things you don't know and need to research. You really need to get comfortable with working outside of your comfort zone in this field, as you will very rarely be interacting with things that you know already. You should instead choose something that you're interested in and motivated to learn more about. You'll probably struggle a lot first and write terrible code, but it will be insanely educational.",

Not bouncing between tutorials, not switching languages, not grinding random concepts.

That part is where your brain finally starts connecting things.\n\nAlso try not to avoid the discomfort.

Break down the corrected version with pen and paper. \n\nWrite out a manual for how to approach it and extra details around where you went wrong. \n\nExplain your corrections in another chat as if your teaching the AI how to do it (tell the AI you want to learn by explaining your understanding)\n\nAfter that you have 2 options:\n1) redo the exams if you still aren’t able to do them to a 80/90% rate\n\n2) as the AI to take the past exams and make a mock version. \n\n.\n\nWith the mock version they can make mistakes but it can help to phrase it differently or make you look at it slightly differently. \n\nHonestly actual coding requires doing your own work.

Most employers greatly prefer people who have a university degree over bootcamps and other \"more practical\" tracks. People who go that track have to work a lot harder to prove they know what they are talking about to even get their foot in the door.\n\nThat said, keep up with the programming. Even if it is just a half hour every other day, or a couple hours on the weekend, that's good experience. I did basically what you did, a lot of extra coding when I can, especially on breaks, and that served me well.

Look up the pareto principle and lean six sigma. You can find ways to adjust your life so that you can fit all the things you want to do into the time that you have. \n\nFrom your description,  it sounds like you're talking about a school like WGU that's self-paced. If you can't manage to stick with your personal coding projects now, you're going to have trouble following a self-paced study regimen. Academic tracks are slower, but they offer structure. Also, they offer far more opportunities to network, which is 50-70% of the importance of going to uni. So, choose whichever path seems best for you, but know that you have to get your schedule under control either way--especially with an accelerated,  self-paced program. \n\nThe Third option is getting a job first and either waiting a little bit or doing school simultaneously. This is tough, but also an excellent way to gain experience and get a feel for the job market and which degree program would suit you best. \n\nIf you do the job first, put as much of your paycheck as you can into a roth 401k and pretend it doesn't exist. If you do the schooling first, avoid loans or work concurrently so you can pay them off before the interest becomes overwhelming. Even a 10k loan at 5% means you're paying $500 bucks a year for the privilege of owing other people money. A 30k loan at 7% means you're paying $2,100 just to hold the debt, and that is on top of payments to principle and loan origination fees. And this compounds year over year. You might want to think about working for a company that will pay for your school so that you don't have to face this kind of debilitating debt. The armed forces also are a good option in this regard. And if you have a high IQ and decent technical knowledge, they'll be able to place you somewhere where you can learn on the job and get hands-on experience. Plus the GI bill, medical, and housing assistance when you've finished. Anyway, lots of stuff to think about. Good luck!",

Android also has a service discovery API for looking for services on the network, but I only played with it briefly IIRC.

If you want to control a music player, you'd need to see if the player has some API to allow that. If it doesn't, you may need to resort to something like PyGuiAuto to simulate clicks on a UI to pause/play/next song/whatever.\n\nSo, you'd need to be able to write code that can run on your phone (either a native app or a web app), and then some code to run on your computer to do the controlling. Both ends would likely require different languages as well unless you do everything in a broadly explicable language like JS.\n\nEdit: If the two devices will always be on the same network when you want to make use of this functionality, you could skip the broker and just run a typical web server on your computer. Then you could have the phone load up a web app that you write served from the computer, and the server could do the controlling actions directly.",

The approach you take depends on the kind of app you’re testing. Selenium is a decent tool for developing and running functional tests in browsers.\n\nThere’s regression testing. That’s generally a subset of functional testing, designed to test bugs you fixed last year to make sure they stayed fixed.\n\nThere’s load testing, in which you run automated tests on your app using hundreds of virtual users.  The point is to see what happens to your infrastructure when it falls over from overload. ApacheBench. JMeter.\n\nThere’s penetration testing, in which you use tools to white-hat-hack your app or your servers or both to look for vulnerabilities. Burp Suite. Nmap.\n\nThere’s static analysis, which automatically scans your source looking for security problems.\n\nOnce you decide on which type(s) of testing you wanna talk about, your search engine is your friend.\n\nBeware: lots of the web content on this topic comes from companies that want to sell your CTO some *really* expensive stuff.",

Finding slow memory leaks, building dev tools to address some inefficiencies, analyzing and addressing performance issues, optimizing our horrendously slow CI, devop stuff, etc. I still use ai for these harder problems but it involves a lot more human coding and intervention.

If you have a professional network / connections, they are your best resource for getting past all the noise created by AI resumes and all the tactics that HR / recruiting departments are using to thin them out.\n\nA friend at another company said they just fired an offshore guy who they later found out had 6 jobs at the same time.  That's what you're competing against, the noise of professional job applicants using every tool at their disposal.\n\n>Also, does anyone have experience applying for a TPM or manager position after being a software engineer? Thinking of pivoting.\n\nYou need to pivot in place at your next employer, rather than try to pivot between jobs.  It won't work, you have no experience in the role you're applying for.  My advice would be to try to be your next team's Scrum Master, if they don't have one.  Get the certs for that, get some experience, then look at pivoting again to Product Owner or TPM based on your preference.\n\nFYI these \\^\\^\\^ roles are getting even worse for cold applications because all the offshore that can't code (or get their cousin who can code to do the interview for them) get scrum / PM certs instead.  Every cert class I teach / attend has a disproportionate number of offshore attendees, most of whom couldn't create a dashboard in Jira to save their lives.\n\nNot to be irrationally negative about offshore but there's so much noise in the system right now that it's hard to match US workers to US jobs.  I can't even get callbacks on ITAR / DoD jobs that get relisted 2-3 times, and these people were throwing all the money at me 3 years ago.  The whole system is broken.  Rely on your network.\n\nEdit:  TPM, PO, Scrum Master, Agile Coach etc are all excellent places for former devs to go.  Moving to coaching was the best thing for my career, as most of your competition won't even be close to your technical skillset.  You need to like people more than the average dev does, and you'll need to learn how to navigate some of the politics.  I'm paid at a Sr Mgr / Director grade (Fortune 100 tech company you've heard of), have frequent access to organizational leaders, and am basically the wizard who has the data and the dev background to tell them where their orgs are running right and where they aren't.  Get a good leader or five who like you and know what you can do, and they'll take you everywhere they go.",

I will often then try and type it from memory again, but that's not super important. The great thing is you're essentially being paid to learn, and you are picking up the knowledge that will come in handy once you brush up against the limits (context windows, reasoning, product understanding).\n\nLLMs are an S-curve (where we've basically hit the diminishing return) and they aren't coming for your job in any meaningful sense.",

Asked AI and it came up with a few good suggestions including what I did with some more improvements which works even better. This is good and we'll put it to good use. (If this doesn't work as needed we probably will do it in the backend on Azure In C#)\n\nThe second one failed epically. It's a bit more complicated, it's tracking dynamic row dependencies via good ole parent and children rows. Also SQL. Classic case of hallucinations as it kept giving reasonably looking suggestions that didn't work. Oh well. That's too deep in the code to change. I ended up optimizing it by using precalculated dependencies rather than calculating them dynamically. \n\nThere's good potential but to paraphrase the TV person, \"know when to say when\".",

Turns out, my family was just super tech illiterate and im just a typical late millennial. And now that im in industry the imposter syndrome hasn't left me since day one. Which is both good and bad. I constantly feel like I should be seeking new knowledge while also feeling like I have no idea what im doing, because honestly sometimes I don't and that stress does get to me at times. Google is my friend. Everyone else seems to be doing side hustles, and side projects, blogging, reading tech news and getting caught up on the latest framework, and this and that, I just wanna go home or log off, have a few beers and play some dang Helldivers. I just don't see software dev as this romantic craft like a lot of people seem to. \n\nAt the end of the day. The pay check is good, the benefits are nice, we still kind of have remote work, the bills are paid, and I have disposable income at the end of the week for fun. I wouldn't say the work is incredibly taxing but it has its ups and downs.\n\nMost jobs suck, most people hate going to work, I am where I am and I'll try and make the best of it until whatever happens happens on the global stage or I get fired and cant get/don't want another tech job.",

There's also the distinct possibility that many tools/companies will fail/enshittify, and waiting to pick the winning/remaining tooling is generally a smart decision.\n\nAdditionally, many (probably most) senior devs have been an early adopter of some piece of tech and had it fail, often catastrophically.

If anything use LinkedIn and Indeed as a search engine and straight to the company’s website to ensure the job is there and apply there!\n\nI would also apply to recent listings as much as possible, favoring hours ago listings rather than days ago. ATS systems sort applicants in chronological order so once recruiters go through the first 50-100 applications they’ll probably have a good handful to push to the interview stage and that’s it they’re moving on. The back half never gets checked! So apply as soon as you see that job. Get creative, I even made my own alert system that alerts me when my scrapers sees a new job was posted to an ATS system and send me a notification on discord. Let me know if you’d like to try it out, completely free!\n\nAnyways, I wish you luck! It will be long and there’s no guarantee even all of this ends up working",

People hate people who make up a bunch of excuses.\n\nOther thing, you need work experience. All my troubleshooting knowledge came from real problems on the job. Nothing I read in a book. My coding speed grew by 3x to 5x in my first 3 years on the job, as did my ability to learn and comprehend repos with 2000 to 10,000 lines of code.\n\nI want to emphasize this. I was a super star in the classroom but when I hit the real job, I was a total beginner. The first day, my manager yelled at me to stop committing every 30 minutes since each commit took 40 minutes to build, run unit tests and deploy to DEV and blocked everyone's else changes from going through. I didn't know, there was no training. Better integration was to have the build run automatically once an hour that picks up all the changes.\n\nI had never seen so much shittily written and undocumented code and the project was already 6 months late. Sometimes I write code that could have been cleaner but you won't able to do everything you want if you don't marry your job. Some people do. I say don't.",

I can't wear headphone anymore because the interviewer will aske me to remove them to prove I'm not getting piped in answers.\n\nThe occasional coding I have to do for an interview is 100% practical and related to what I do on the job and had for homework projects. Not designed to be hard, just to confirm I know how to code at all.\n\nBut yeah, stop using those tools. You're entry level, you got free time. Learn the hard way like everyone else who knows their crap.\n\nYou could certainly switch fields although I'm not sure to what. Cybersecurity is very competitive thanks to CS being overcrowded and a Cybersecurity degree being worse to start a career in Cybersecurity with. If you can code, you can be useful immediately.

These are large companies, and if you look at startups in DIFC or Hub71, there are a handful of companies hiring interns as well, although the pay may be low or unpaid\n\nWhat projects did you work on during the last two years? This matters. Ask yourself whether you worked on interesting projects, did you learn some tech on your own and whether you can see yourself doing that kind of work full time. If not, maybe computer science is not the right fit\n\nDo not consider only swe roles, data analyst, data science, AI engineer, data engineer, tech consulting, and product manager positions are all paths you can explore\n\nLC does not matter as much in the UAE. Startups care more about your backend, frontend, systems skills than your lc grind (only companies ik who are crazy about lc are dytedanxe, noon, talabat). i could be wrong here\n\nThe market is tough for CS majors everywhere. If you are not interested in the work or feel you lack the necessary skills, switching fields could be an option (i only say this as you claim you didn’t learn much in uni, but it’s been 2 years since graduation and you could self learn more industry skills)",

I've talked to a bunch of recruiters out there and they all say the same thing - companies want people with 3-5 years minimum because they're competing globally for talent and can afford to be picky. It's not you, it's legitimately the market structure there.\n\nThe masters pivot might not be the worst idea but... business degrees after CS can be weird. You'll be competing with people who did business undergrad and have that foundation already. Plus you'd be starting over in a new field while still carrying student debt (assuming you're not getting it funded). Have you thought about maybe doing a technical masters instead? Something like data science or specialized AI programs? At least then you're building on what you already know instead of completely starting fresh.\n\nOne thing - that gap on your resume isn't as bad as you think. I see people come back from 2-3 year breaks all the time. The story matters more than the gap itself. \"I graduated into a terrible market and kept grinding while exploring options\" is way better than most explanations i hear. Also those unpaid internships you're applying to? Skip them. They know you're desperate and will treat you accordingly. Focus on contract work, freelance projects, or even contributing to open source stuff. At least then you're building real portfolio pieces instead of fetching coffee for free.",

A curated list like [Grind](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/) / Blind is good\n* Behavioural: Prepared some stories that cover most [LPs](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/amazon-leadership-principles.html)\n* System design: The [primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/README.md) is a quick read, heard good things about DDIA and Hello Interview too. Mainly focused on systems I've worked with\n* Technicals: Focused on CS concepts (paradigms, concurrency, databases, patterns, networking, etc.) and their applications\n\nFrom the hiring side (major US tech hubs), even with a small sample size, the majority of interviewees lack problem solving skills and/or have mediocre communication skills. Literal senior+ devs, some at FAANG or adjacent, struggling / cheating at basic coding. We don't ask LeetCode, and allow people to pick any language they are comfortable with",

It's pretty vague.\n\n\nIn general, I'd say mature companies that are profitable and where the majority of employees are over 30.\n\nGreenflag if on Linkedin, you find developers on the team/adjacent to the team with graduation dates before like 2008 who have been with the company for more than like 5 years.  People who are over halfway through their career usually aren't trying to prove anything, and they just want to live their life and coast in stability until retirement.   The lack of this doesn't mean it's not chill, but if you see people like this there, then it probably is.\n\nPeople work hard because the moment you truly relax is the moment you stagnate in your career.  So you'd want to look for people who are probably satisfied with where they're at in their career.   Which also kinda lines up with Google being chill.  If you're at Google, you're close to the peak of software engineering.  Of course, you do have to do occasional overtime for deadlines, but from what I've heard from people, it's not so bad.  Generally like only 40-50 hours per week.

Networking means you'll try to find jobs that aren't advertised; but I am not sure how much of a dent that can make. What does your current employer have to say about transitioning you to full time?

If anything at all, you should work on a process that makes you find all these jobs within the first 5 or 2 days.\n\nYou cannot change the market; you cannot change how hiring works. You can adjust your own processes to make the most of the given circumstances, and see that the work you put into it has the highest ROI that's possible for you to achieve.\n\n>What are the best resources for finding real job postings from companies that are genuinely looking to hire? Any advice would help.\n\nNot from the US, but when I am looking for work, I see which job boards have good results for what I have to offer, I scan those regularly ,and apply quickly. If that ends up in too few results, I'll have to start looking at places where the good matches are less dense. (Assuming that I am happy with my CV, my application process, etc. Those I can change, I cannot change who posts how many jobs where.)",

Every single one of them was very resistant to the idea that the project might need to be cancelled. One of them pitched to me \"let's just juke the stats and get a good project in, and figure this out in the next review period\". Another one, after the exec made the decision to re-allocate us, presented a plan to keep the project going. He just didn't get that \"move to keep the lights on in two weeks (ktlo)\" meant that we are moving on.\n\nI just see a massive amount of resistance to change, even at a big tech company where our execs tell us: \"we need you to be world class engineers\". I definitely get it, people want to keep things the way they are, but the moment you realize something isn't going to work, you need to pivot quickly.  That's very hard to do, even by otherwise good developers, who just want to ship new code and worry less about if things make sense for the business.",

        "body": "I’m just a SWE 1, but I like to think I have a healthy relationship with AI coding right now. I use it for work daily, but I originally learned and got to where I am without AI.\n\nI mentor for lots of college hackathons and I see so many students like you, who are completely reliant on AI to code, and fail spectacularly. It is an **insane power move** (HAHA) when I pull up to a mentee, immediately close ChatGPT or ask them “how do you close cursor?”, skip over all the Google AI overview when I google stuff, and debug their thing “raw” old school and fix it either in 1 glance or in half the time they’ve been stuck in an LLM prompting circle.\n\nMy advice? Learn without AI. AI is a force multiplier imo, it turns say a level 1 engineer into a level 2, and a level 10 into a level 20. The moment you let things go, you stop leveling up. There is a significant difference in quality and speed between “code me an api for an app” vs “implement an API with these exact 5 routes, implementation steps, pagination, specific auth middleware, database, other layers, and other architectural and security concerns/requirements.”\n\nTLDR: better you are, the more effective it will be.\n\n“Learning without ai??? That’s impossible.”\n\nYeah yeah, I hear you. You want to be spoon fed everything relevant now. You want it fast and customized. You’ll be better reading and learning without AI, but yeah yeah, it will take longer. Remember that programming is supposed to engage your brain. But if you really want to learn with AI, which I totally get the temptation, here’s what I’ve been advising my mentees at least.\n\nIt about aligns with how I learned without AI, but adapted to this new day and age:\n\n## Use AI as a guide, not as your driver.\n\n> in the past, I learned through documentation and stack overflow. I would try copy and pasting code, but it would rarely work without me understanding how it works and modifying it to work with my code.\n\n1. Let the AI guide you, not drive for you. Get off cursor or whatever. Do not auto approve changes. Review everything it proposes. Stop copy pasting ChatGPT code. Instead, read each line it proposes, understand what it does and why it does what it does. Never ever put the code in until you know what each line does. Research the documentation, the patterns, everything OUTSIDE of asking an LLM. Too many times, I’ve been burned by incredibly convincing hallucinations I blindly trust.\n\n**My company gives me Claude 4.5. I have coded with Gemini 3 in my spare time. Even then, a near top-of-the-line coding LLM isn’t perfect enough to fully vibe-trust for work and for mildly complex projects.**\n\n## Ask AI to cite its sources or give it the sources.\n\n> I learned everything by reading documentation\n\n2. If you ever let an LLM drive (rather, think) for you, ask it for QUOTED sources and links, OR plug in the relevant documentation yourself and then ask for direct quotes that inform its implementation. Then, go back and read that relevant section yourself. Only then, can you hit yes on the code. You’ll learn something, at least, while keeping some momentum and enhancing accuracy. Still—better to learn yourself and feed it what it needs rather than trust it.\n\n## Debug without an LLM\n\n> Debugging and making effective hypothesis and knowing how to test them is the best skill I’ve learned, and it’s helped me both with and without AI. Trial and error have helped build my intuition and propose ideas on why things aren’t working, and that’s built on a solid debugging strategy, tons of experience, and exploration. \n\n3. Learn effective debugging skills. I’ve had so many situations where students debug via LLM by saying “it doesn’t work, fix it” or “it’s not smooth, fix it”. Instead, when you tell it “I identify a race condition, I’d like to refactor the code by XYZ” the LLM works actually pretty well. But to figure this out, you gotta know how to debug outside of an LLM. Sometimes, it may involve a big or novel switch in approach that an AI in its little rabbit hole cannot suggest. Also, being a code detective is the best part of programming imo, why would you offload the best part to an AI?\n\nTLDR: don’t turn off your brain and don’t trust anything the LLM says. Pretend it’s a con artist or scammer and double check everything yourself OUTSIDE of the LLM “scammer ring” scheme.",

Or is it incredibly specific and seems like it is new functionallity for an existing app?\n\nIf the project they are asking for is very generic, IE: heres a user login and password, create a page to authenticate to our app services then build a page to accept a userID and submit it to retrieve user details and display it tto the screen and allow someone to edit. Thats fine with me. Its just shhowing I understand how auth / REST works and that I can build a web app that communicates with a backend.\n\nIf instead they ask me to create a hyper specific page that requires multiple rest calls and data analysis maybe with business logic, thats when the red line is crossed IMO. To get an idea if you can do the job shouldnt require you to understand their business logic when coding, that stuff should be taught on the job. In the interview rounds the project assigned needs to be generic and just demonstrating you have the skills you say you do.",

Of the many questions I ask, I like to ask engineering managers / directors: \"What was the hardest conversation you've ever had with a stakeholder\". \n\nWhat I'm listening for in the manager's/director's response is:\n\n1. Have they ever told a stakeholder \"no\" or \"[yes, and](https://galenemanuele.com/blog/power-of-yes-and)\" (which is really just fancy \"no\"). Unless they've been in leadership like ... 2-3 years ... an answer of \"huh, nothing comes to mind\" is a red flag for me. My read on that is they're very likely avoiding difficult conversations to the detriment of their team, because leadership is almost never sunshine and butterflies for everyone. Business is hard.\n2. What inputs lead to that difficult conversation? The team? A Jira board? An existential threat? Customer feedback? Data? Hopefully something more tangible than intuition alone.\n3. How did they tailor the conversation to this specific stakeholder's behaviors, values, and goals?\n\nAnd I often ask clarifying questions, or for them to elaborate, if I don't get 1, 2, and 3 covered in their initial response. Covering all 3 in the initial response is a big old green flag for me. I need to work with leaders who know how to \"go to bat\" for their people and advocate for what they believe is best for the business -- maybe that isn't as important to you. A big, big part of having a healthy engineering practice is telling important people \"no\" sometimes, even if they might fire you or advocate for your firing because you said \"no\". But they probably won't fire me, because I've already established through a different line of questioning that this leader values [psychological safety](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-72-personal-user-manuals/).",

There are people who don't take responsibility, try to blame others. \"Hey, I screwed this up, can you work extra to fix it all?\" It might be a weird thing to say, but having a mix of professional pride, caring about the work, and respecting the people doing the work. \n\nOh, and I always appreciated people who were honest. I've worked with people who intentionally hold information from you. In some cases, it might be a good thing. Shielding the team, maybe hiding that we have some ways to extend a deadline, but pushing the team. Those can suck, but I liked that manager. I worked for someone else who would intentionally withhold information from the team. I got the impression they did this to always feels smarter than everyone. It was a very irritating experience and extremely hard to work with someone like that.",

I have a good friend who has his masters and teaches regular and advanced history / social studies for highschool students, and he's had some uncomfortable insights about AI\n\n\nFor the first time since we've really been recording this information, my friend has been seeing an inverse bell curve; meaning the average score is no longer in the middle ~70%, there are two polar opposites: students that care and are trying, scoring 90%+ and those who just don't give a shit at all. So to give the younger generation some credit, there is a big group of students that see what tik tok and AI are doing to their attention span and are determined to succeed in spite of that. But there just as big of a cohort that are straight up turning off their critical thinking and letting AI take the wheel.\n\n\nBecause critical thinking, making decisions really is the skill AI threatens to take away the most. Most of these failing students just refuse to put in any effort that requires them to think beyond a surface level.\n\n\nSo to reiterate, this is genuinely new. This is different. Previous technologies like the Internet certainly changed education, but a huge emphasis was placed on digging beyond surface level Wikipedia details. Today AI can (appear to anyway) do that digging beyond for you in a few prompts, and the skill to research and analyze information just gets thrown away by a startling number of people ",

They have to be listening to what the other person is saying and understanding why they have said it. In a properly functioning disagreement you will be asking as many questions as you will be giving answers.\n\nEventually, you might get to a point where you both fully understand each other, but do just fundamentally disagree. At this point, you will typically involve a 3rd party (another colleague, a team lead) to give a fresh perspective, and to act as a tie-breaker. \n\nIf you still can't come to a consensus after that, then your only option is to disagree and commit. A senior decision maker (e.g. a team lead) will pick one of the options, and you will all agree that, even if it's not your preferred option, you will commit to getting it done on the basis that doing the wrong thing well is often better than not doing anything at all.\n\nKey rules when disagreeing:\n\n1. Authority is irrelevant. If you can't explain and justify your view, your job title of Fancypants Principal Senior Architect is meaningless.\n2. Listen. Listen and understand what the other person is saying. Ask clarifying questions or suggest concrete examples if you don't.\n3. Go for a beer afterwards. This is the importance of relationships. I can have (sometimes quite forceful) disagreements with colleagues, but it is fine because we are also friendly with each other. Grab a beer, or a coffee, or have a game of pool, or whatever, but just build that relationship so it can easily survive disagreements.\n\nFinally, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a common approach in software development, and it has it's place, but when it comes to security concerns you _are_ going to need it!",

You're only on your first year, and passing the threshold where you should have some familiarity with basic team dynamics and workflows, which it sounds like you have. Startups are very volatile and informal working environments that incentivize doing slap-dash work, so the stress and feeling drained is also very normal.\n\nThe most chill employers I've had were well-established companies that only grow by 1 or 2 hires per team *a year*. By comparison, startups and consultancies scale their team sizes very rapidly (both up and down). So, unless you thrive in that kind of fast-paced environment, startups can be really challenging workplaces.\n\nAnd because the organizational structure changes so rapidly, a lot of decisionmaking is informal and workplace politics are more nuanced/difficult. For people who struggle with soft-skills, startups are a *very* demanding environment trying to juggle all the subtle politicking and the unclear/changing requirements.\n\nObviously, there's great startups out there. But they aren't the ones hiring every quarter to compensate for rapid turnover or sudden changes in venture capital.",

However, it is going to remain in some form as a tool for handling large volume communications; it does acceptably at auto-responding to messages, though it still needs considerable supervision for anything. So it's good to have *some* familiarity with using it. But in my opinion you'll still do best learning the basics and doing most things manually, maybe querying the AI for quick summaries of a topic so you can find relevant search terms for further, non-AI study.\n\n\nThis field is pretty volatile while you're getting started, so make sure you have some full-time work to pay your bills when you first begin your jobseeking.",

There is an additional interview round for MLE jobs where they ask you ML trivia like \"what it is the difference between L1 and L2 normalization\" or \"Explain K-fold cross validation\". You may or may not get to do model development in an MLE job. But you will be involved in productionalizing an already developed model.\n\nFor applied scientists type of a role though. I have seen a few of my batch mates get those type of roles with just a master's degree. There are a few caveats though.\n\n1. These roles were in Amazon. In Amazon Applied scientist role is more of a SWE role than an AS role from what I observed. Most of the Amazon Applied Scientist roles are not the same as Microsoft research Applied Scientist role or Google Brain Research scientist or even Facebook AI research applied scientist roles. A lot of Amazon AS people get to churn out research papers every year. But I have seen even MLEs churn out research papers as well.\n2. You need to have at least 1 publication even for the Amazon AS role, when applying from outside. A thesis in the Master's program helps with that.\n3. The school I attended was a top 20 school for CS back when I was applying. And a few of my Batchmates are now working as Applied scientists in Facebook and Amazon without a Ph.D with just a master's degree. And these were people on H1b. Not even US citizens. Your experience might not be the same however.\n\nAlso applied scientist interviews are far more mathematical in nature than SWE/MLE interviews. You go into an interview and they might ask you to derive the expected value of a normal distribution or something on a whiteboard. A math heavy master's program from a top US university definitely helps with cracking that type of an interview.",

I call this the **”Carrier Pigeon model of Support” (tm)** and it’s terrible - customers are left thinking “why am i talking to this support person instead of the dev” and devs are left thinking “why is this person making my job harder”. It’s inefficient (latency due to relay) and ultimately makes everyone frustrated. \n\nNot falling into this antipattern is hard - customers will pester you (because they want cases solved faster), sales people will pester you (because they want their customer happy), and product/dev people will ignore you (because you’re bothering them and they have More Important Things (tm) to do). What a good Support Engineers does is equal parts social engineering (how do I get this person to help me when it’s not necessarily in their interest) and technical skill (troubleshooting whatever problem the customer has). \n\nGenerally, I see the following in good Support Engineers:\n\n- They learn how to ask good questions - good questions are asked to the right person, in the right way, with the right information in such a way that *makes it as easy as is possible for the answerer to give a response*. Good Support Engineers ask for help from devs in a way that makes it easy to help them.\n- They manage expectations effectively - sometimes the customer should not be expecting an “urgent fix” for something that is at best a P2 feature request. Good Support Engineers set proper expectations with customers and only let customer urgency bleed onto Devs when its’s warranted.\n- They are self sufficient and proactive - good Support Engineers leverage resources, the access they have, and their troubleshooting skills to get information. They don’t bother devs about every single question. Thats not to say they never bother devs, but they try to dig up information on their own. Ditto on the proactive - a resource doesnt exist for some issue? They create it. Some issue is happening x times with a common pattern and the org is getting y support cases? They start a thread and start investigating root cause.\n\nGreat Support Engineers are considerate, thoughtful, and aggressively helpful.",

Those started as software for evidence management, but it’s evolving into selling police [AI](https://www.govtech.com/biz/aclu-slams-ai-police-reports-and-axon-in-particular) tools. \n\nWhen I visited their office, there were stun gun parts just lying around. Someone actually got accidentally shocked by one while I there. It didn’t seem like they took workplace safety seriously. \n\nThat said, it seemed to be a very mission driven company. I mean, their motto is to “make the bullet obsolete” in that nobody should be shot to death again, but rather incapacitated. It’s certainly not your average software company motto like “Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History” (Amazon) or “to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more” (Microsoft). \n\nPeople I’ve worked with who came from there were very sharp and great to work with.",

You could also check out donnemartin/system-design-primer or binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability on GitHub for more patterns (but those can overwhelm you a bit - only do it if once you've got the basics down and i'd also recommend using GPT to identify the best ones based on your existing prep)\n\nAs for the E5 interview, I think you can totally ace it if you stay organized and consistent! Just set your constraints early, pick a clean baseline design, call out the obvious bottlenecks, and talk through how you'd scale or handle failures gracefully. If you've got time, running through a couple full mocks with that approach would definitely help (educative has those built in too).\n\nGood luck! You've got this!",

The opportunity is too good to all my other options available atm.

People are saying A.I is taking over jobs yes they are but very rarely are they taking developer jobs. They might take over some customer service job or some very few operations jobs, but over all A.I cannot fully yet take over most jobs. The true removal or decreasing of jobs come from that of purely offshoring, using 3rd party companies over seas, using Indian Consultancies, LATAM consultancies, European Consultancies, Filipino Consultancies to expedite job creation else where to then cut jobs on the shores of the USA. If you are reading this please do your own research as we all are sometimes off by a certain degree.

Most people who are competent rise to the occasion, senior-level (and beyond) work isn't necessarily harder, it's just different and you may have more expectations in terms of leadership, driving initiatives, writing end to end specs rather than implementing, etc.\n\nTitles also vary by company and promo rates vary a lot by manager. My first manager was pretty keen to help me speedrun promotions, but reality is, it was a sinking ship company and even if I did, titles translated to less pay. I took a mid-level offer at my current job, and by all accounts trajectory slowed, but also that job change earned me about 2x pay at the \"same\" level.\n\n\\> I am worried that others might see me as a bit of a fraud\n\npeople might get jealous, yes.

Freeze schema churn and add a thin adapter (views/functions or a tiny service) so the UI stops touching bad tables. Split the monster PR into small slices with contract tests; pair each with a Flyway/Liquibase migration and rollback.\n\nI’ve used Hasura for fast read models on Postgres, Kong to centralize auth/rate limits on legacy endpoints, and DreamFactory to auto‑generate REST on ugly SQL so the frontend stops hand‑rolled queries.\n\nIf leadership won’t allow flags, canary, and sign‑offs, start interviewing.\n\nBottom line: document and gate the risks, ship behind flags with observability, and make incremental fixes instead of another big hack.",

Since you have DS experience you can absolutely get a job in Cali, but it would not be because of your penn degree. \n\nAlso yeah it is true that a lot of the courses will probably have overlap with your undergrad, and look at [mymcit.org](http://mymcit.org) and look at the DS reviews - they aren't great. If I were to go back, I would have applied to a West Coast school as I want to move to Cali too. This would be the optimal choice, but hey completing the MSE-DS is still going to move you forward and is not a bad decision, but just that there may be a better decision for the 3 years that you would put into completing the degree.\n\nMy humble opinion: apply to an MSCS instead. Your DS undergrad combined with CS masters will make you unstoppable. It does not have to be brand name either. For example, SJSU is heavily recruited by big tech companies. So I would apply to all brand-name and non-brand name schools on west coast and see where you get in. After all, tech is not *as* elitist(unless you get into berkeley/stanford which will give you a massive advantage) as top finance/consulting. So, being on the west coast even at an average school will give you a higher chance of being hired in Cali than MSE-DS.",

Consistently the people I hire are able to confidently tackle a problem I put in front of them, whether they know how to or not. The last two people I hired immediately started collaborating with me on a simple real world coding challenge that they had zero exposure to before the interview. A good software engineer knows how to break tasks down into manageable pieces, ask questions, and systematically work through a problem I know that I'm relatively unusual in my interview approach because Leetcode is still out there, but all the best jobs I've had have had similar practical problem solving interviews.\n\nSo, my primary advice is to work on those problem solving and communication skills. When you're approached for an interview, you should be able to reflexively start diving into how you'll tackle the problem they put in front of you.\n\nI think Azure is an excellent choice for boosting your desirability in the market. Despite spending most of my career as an individual contributor programmer, DevOps knowledge has been the thing that has helped me the most. \n\nAlso, don't forget about Python's use as a back end language for building APIs. Back end developers might not be as cool as ML or AI engineers, but there's still a huge need for them. It will be far easier to find a job and demonstrate your competence as a dev. The fact that you've already worked on practical projects in school is a big boon here.",

Let's just say that I'm already busy, and everything to do with hiring someone has to get fit in somehow but i still need to do the business activities that need doing.\n\nLet's start with resume review. I posted a job a month ago. I got somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30 new applicants per day and that was after the initial deluge of resumes. If you do a lot of resume screening, you can start to see whether a candidate has or doesn't have what you're looking for, but it still takes time. I started with a block of 10 resumes that looked good enough to book for a screening call. I booked all 10 in the next week. Nothing too onerous, but that's ten 30-minute calls to add to my schedule. that's 5 additional hours plus prep time, plus arranging said calls and answering the occasional questions from candidates while still screening even more resumes.\n\nThen perhaps i find someone that i want to talk to in person. That means finding basically a whole morning or afternoon to block off to interview them.  Maybe i find a couple people.  Maybe i don't.  I fill up my hiring basket with about 10 hours of hiring activities our of my 40-hour week because again, i still have an actual job to do and there is only so much that can be done. The more in-person interviews i do, the less screening i can do. The more screening i can do, the less resume review i can do. Things get backed up to the point where some people you eventually get around to reviewing aren't available anymore.\n\nI'm not saying anything about a particular company or companies. You asked a general question, I'm giving you a general look behind likely many managers' calendars. It takes time and there are more applicants than there is time to process them.  It would be swell if that weren't the case, but for me at least, it is.\n\nIt's nice to think that it's simple: if someone doesn't get back to you within two weeks then to heck with them. That probably could be true for a lot of people for different reasons, but it doesn't mean it's out of malice. Someone like you could have been #78 on my list and I'm still in the 50's.  Sorry.",
