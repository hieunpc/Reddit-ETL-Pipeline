Also for later versions, 2012, I think, there was some TDS incompatibility and I had to throw pytds in the mix for it to work",

The \"silent schema change\" and \"currency confusion\" cases are exactly what drift detection can catch.\n\nI've been working on profiling/drift detection for similar reasons. The pipeline can be green, but if a source system changes how it sends data (format shifts, new status codes, distribution changes), you won't know until someone notices downstream.\n\nWhat I've found useful:\n\n* Track distributions over time, not just point-in-time checks. If average transaction amounts suddenly double, that's a red flag even if the values are technically valid.\n* Monitor schema changes proactively. When a new status code appears or a column's type shifts, alert on it instead of silently dropping data.\n* Compare against historical baselines. A 15% change in distinct customer counts might be normal growth, or it might be double-counting. Context matters.\n\nThe tricky part is reducing false positives—weekend vs weekday patterns, seasonality, etc. I've been using type-specific thresholds and adaptive baselines (moving averages for high-variance columns, prior period for seasonal ones).\n\nSchema and row counts are easy; catching that a source system changed from dollars to cents is harder. That's where statistical drift detection helps.",

How complex the data is and how forward you go towards the insights/analytics layer? If the data is not complex and you insights to be extracted, delegate this to a modelling tool like dbt and use your pipelines to pull data only and trigger dbt to keep it simple. \n\nIf data is complex requiring many normalisations or multiple sources that a simple sql cannot do, threat your pipelines like a library to process data in its context. \n\nBut remember early optimisation is the evil. \n\nSo its not a question of preference, is what you have to do at THIS time to keep it simple, readable and maintainable for your future self without over engineering. This rule is only yours (or maybe also for your team). \nSometimes it is ok to over-bloat one or two flows because you will touch that once in a year and nobody else will or if it fails nobody will get hurt. I personally consider this and also I don't mind to have duplicated code 3x into 3 flows, so the 4th one will justify a refactor.

It's more like a cook book than a manual so don't beat yourself up for struggling to get it.",

Because of this tendency, I think the book is important to read before entering DE *and* to revisit often in your career. Tools and techniques make it easy to lose sight of why you exist as a DE in the first place; as important as knowing the ins and outs of spark or airflow is, the business doesn't care about how you did it. They care about value and they care about cost. If you don't know that, you kind of don't know anything. This book teaches you to think on that level.\n\nAs an aside, knowing the fundamentals of DE is now more important than ever, because a lot of hyper-specific tool knowledge can now be delegated to AI (obviously you should educate yourself on tool fundamentals). Hope that helps!",

It's theoretical knowledge that pays off over the long term vs specific knowledge that pays off in the short term\n\nRead your other question about Kimball, I also read that one lol 😂 and reviewed it too\n\nFundamentals of DE is better first as it's a high level view of the field of DE **including** data modeling, of which Kimbal is the default methodology in many places \n\nEven folks who say they don't do Kimball throw around and implement Kimball concepts \n\nFundamentals of data engineering goes over Kimball versus Inmon and Data Vault, so you'll get a primer before you dive into the data warehouse toolkit later if you choose to go deeper \n\nHope this helps !",

Document costs and optimizations.\n\nLevel targets: strong SQL with window functions, Spark tuning (partitions, join strategies, AQE), Delta Lake features (Z-Order, CDF), Snowflake warehousing and micro-partitions, data modeling (star schema/Data Vault), and basic platform design interviews. For Azure, show Purview governance, ADF triggers, and monitoring.\n\nFor APIs, I’ve used Kong and Apigee for gateways, and DreamFactory to auto-generate secure REST endpoints over Snowflake/SQL Server when I needed to expose curated data fast.\n\nPoint is, deliver 1-2 solid, ops-ready projects over more certificates",

Focus on DataFrame API, partitioning, joins, window functions, and incremental processing. Practice reading from cloud storage and writing back to Snowflake via the connector. Watch for shuffles and skew; cache only when it actually saves time.\n\nThen Airflow: run it locally first. Create a simple DAG that fetches files, loads to Snowflake, kicks off a PySpark job, and runs data quality checks. Add retries, SLAs, and alerts; keep operators idempotent.\n\nCosts: you can do all this free or cheap with Snowflake’s trial + auto-suspend, local Spark, and local Airflow.

Split queues: platform/ingestion tickets separate from analytics asks, and require an impact brief with an accountable owner and an SLA before any net-new pipeline. Centralize definitions in a semantic layer (LookML, dbt metrics, or Cube) so “revenue” means one thing; DS shouldn’t redefine metrics in notebooks. Add cost/freshness SLOs and auto-archive unused tables after 30 days to keep the estate tidy.\n\nWe run Snowflake with dbt, and DreamFactory lets us expose curated tables as secure REST APIs so product and apps teams ship without custom glue.\n\nYou get closer to that 90% DS focus only when contracts, ownership, and pruning are non-negotiable.",

As part of the batch process, an environment variable representing the job number can be accessed via int(os.environ\\['AWS\\_BATCH\\_JOB\\_ARRAY\\_INDEX'\\]).

The key to really excelling in the space in my humble opinion is to learn the broader systems that exist in healthcare; official drug product datasets from Health Canada or FDA make for great end-to-end beginner projects, and if executed well, can be of relevance to combine with data across the entire healthcare system, from EMRs to health insurance claims.",

The docs describe the output in JSON or XML and I get the LLM to turn it into SQL for me.\n2. Basic coding when I forget the syntax. My Python-Fu is not strong and instead up looking up the syntax for filtering a data frame for the 100th time, I tell the LLM to do it. Here's a real example from a few days ago: from <table>, select the most recent <field I need> using the <date> field. You could argue if I didn't use the LLM I would learn the syntax and not have to look it up all the time. You would be correct.\n3. Generating regex expressions from sample data. It's surprisingly good at this.\n4. I had a circular reference in a model a few days go. I knew how to resolve it, but wanted to see how the LLM would approach it. I gave it a screenshot of the UML data model and it actually did a really good, and accurate, job of explaining what the reference was, what caused it and gave a few ways of resolving it.\n5. OCR, but check the results VERY closely. It'll get you about 90% of the way, but I picked up a lot of small errors that on first glance looked ok.\n6. Basic debugging. I use the Agent in Databricks quite a lot. It's good at fixing missing brackets, forgotten imports, and basic stuff like that. More complex stuff is hit and miss so I'll usually debug those myself, but it saves me time looking for a stupid ).\n7. Advanced find and replace. Stuff like, 'In the attached csv, find all instances of x that are postfixed with \":2\" and replace that with :3 if the date in the valid\\_to column is over two months from today.'\n\nIn all cases I check the output because I know they're just advanced statistical models, but I must say I've noticed the accuracy increase in the last year or so.\n\nI probably wouldn't consider this a 'next gen workflow', it's all stuff I can do without an LLM, but it really does save me a huge amount of time. Further, you still need someone who knows the work and what they're doing. There's no way my manager for instance would be able to use the same LLM to do my job without me.",

Enable AQE with skew handling, and set preferSortMergeJoin=false. If you truly need zero shuffle, write both sides as bucketed tables with identical buckets/keys (Delta/Iceberg works best) or drop to RDDs: partitionBy the same HashPartitioner, persist, join in mapPartitions.

Wrap execution in a Snowpark Python proc that auto-adds LIMIT and a time window, uses a tiny warehouse, times out fast, parameterizes inputs, and logs prompt/SQL/cost/bytes scanned. Precompute the top questions with Dynamic Tables/Tasks, cache results with TTL, and invalidate via lineage.   \n  \nAdd checks before returning: compare to last week/last month, cap variance, and if it trips, return a warning plus the vetted dashboard. Keep outputs structured JSON and validate; for long docs, RAG over a small, approved glossary so definitions stay consistent. CI matters: canary prompts with golden answers per dataset, block deploy on regressions. We run dbt and Airflow for orchestration, and DreamFactory to auto-generate locked-down REST endpoints so the agent only touches curated Snowflake views.\n\nDon’t chase perfect answers; ship a guarded assistant that’s easy to verify:)",

Statistical tests (KS, PSI) still work on samples. For categoricals, stratified sampling helps catch rare value changes. For partitioned tables, profile only the latest partition(s) instead of full history.\n\nIn terms of frequency, I run lightweight profiling (schema, basic stats) on every run, and save detailed stats for a few runs per day. Tier by importance—critical tables every run, others maybe 2–3x daily.\n\nI built a profiling tool that does adaptive sampling (random, stratified, top-k) and handles partitions. It stores results over time, so drift detection still works even with sampling and less frequent runs. \n\nTrino supports TABLESAMPLE directly in queries (SELECT \\* FROM table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (2)). For Spark, add .sample() before your profiling checks.",

Set one changelog per DB, small ordered changesets, and enforce a mainline flow (feature branches rebase to avoid merge conflicts). Always dry-run and generate SQL for review; treat rollbacks as forward fixes, not “undo,” especially on prod.\n\nBytebase shines when you want review workflows, SQL lint, environment pipelines, and permission guardrails without building your own. It also logs who approved what, which kept auditors off our backs. For near-zero downtime: MySQL via gh-ost/pt-osc; MSSQL with online index rebuilds, adding columns with defaults that are metadata-only, and pre/post scripts to backfill.\n\nUse a deploy service account per env with least privilege.

Stack that worked: Confluent Cloud Kafka, Debezium CDC from OLTP with outbox, Flink stateful joins with TTL and watermarking, Schema Registry, and a replayable S3/GCS sink plus dead-letter topics. Guardrails: a one-pager per stream (decision latency, owner on-call, rollback path, freshness SLO, cost/unit), event-time windows, idempotent sinks, and a backfill plan. Start with one source and one metric, ship a walking skeleton in a week, then A/B the impact. With Snowflake and dbt, DreamFactory exposes real-time aggregates as REST so app teams can plug in fast.

Airbyte and Pipelinewise are good, but as you noticed, they can be brittle with type mismatches. Debezium is great but only if you want to own the complexity.\n\nIf you end up syncing Postgres into a warehouse and need the targets to stay correct without juggling all the CDC edge cases, a real-time sync layer such as Stacksync can help keep those tables aligned so you don’t have to chase failures down the chain.",

Privacy is not 100 percent with remote LLMs though, because column names and types are sent to the model.\n\nBut we also cannot fully hide or obfuscate the schema.\n\nThe LLM relies on the semantic meaning of column names to understand queries.\n\nIf everything is renamed to c1, c2, c3, the model loses context and cannot decide which column should represent “product” or \"customer\" or \"date\".\n\nSo complete obfuscation improves privacy but breaks semantic understanding.\n\nThis creates a tradeoff:\n\n• real schema means better results but slight schema exposure\n\n• fully synthetic schema means privacy but no useful SQL\n\nA middle ground is partial or selective obfuscation for sensitive fields.\n\nAnd of course, with a local LLM (for example via Ollama) the schema never leaves the machine, so both processing and privacy become fully local.\n\nThanks for raising this - very helpful point.",

Keeps the dimensional model clean while giving BI tools what they expect.\n\n\n\nThe AI struggling makes sense - it can't infer business logic about how unrelated facts should be combined. You need to explicitly model that relationship.\n\n\n\nWhat's your reporting grain? Daily totals? Might help narrow down the best approach.",

If you share the grain you’re targeting, I can sketch the simplest version of that layer so all your facts play together without manual unions and if the model needs to sync back into another system later, Stacksync can keep those reporting tables aligned without extra pipeline work.",

One of the most useful ones for your scenario is the **Get Activity Events** API:\n\n[Admin - Get Activity Events - REST API (Power BI Power BI REST APIs) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/admin/get-activity-events)\n\nThis API gives you detailed activity logs, including actions like **ViewReport**, **EditReport**, **CreateReport**, and more. It covers most of the user interaction events you mentioned. A few key points:\n\n* **Permissions:** You need to be a Fabric (Power BI) Administrator to access activity data for the entire tenant.\n* **Retention:** The API provides data for the past **30 days**.\n* **Format:** The output is JSON, which you can easily process and load into Snowflake or any other data warehouse.\n\nIf you want to go deeper (e.g., dataset usage, queries, refresh history), there are other APIs like:\n\n* **Get Refresh History** for semantic models\n* **Get Reports / Get Datasets** for metadata\n\nYou don’t need Purview for this; the audit logs are part of the Power BI service itself. Purview is more for data governance and lineage.\n\nIf you’re planning to replicate what you did in your previous org (loading into Snowflake), you can schedule calls to these APIs and push the data into Snowflake via an ETL process or a simple script.",

Yep, this is the case for every table and also this one, we can identify the PK and normally store the hash as well with it in a new column as we use it to build our data vault/silver layer on it. In case a PK exists, we compare the hash of the concat of all columns except the PK.\n\n2. For this specific table we would do a initial load from 2015 to today if we would build the table now and then starting from tomorrow we would load a full year back every day. When loading, we would then compare only records going one year back as otherwise the query would close all records between 2015 and the 28th of November 2024. \n\n3. Yeah, considering Iceberg here! Played with it and the \"timestamp\" function really makes it way easier to go back then playing with the valid from/ valid to date columns. \n\nThe only thing i can't get my head around is. When we would use snapshots instead of SCD2, then i  assume it would be something like:\n\n\\- Initial load - All rows ranging from 2015 - today with snapshot date today (\\~12 mln rows)\n\n\\- Every day after today - All rows for the last 365 days - snapshot date of that specific date (\\~1 mln rows)\n\nIt adds 365 mln. rows in a year and when i want to know the last version of a PK on a specific date i would need to partition by and order by the PK to get the latest version. Thereby, if a record gets deleted in the source system there's no way to mark it in my append only db without making a SCD2 kind of script that fills in a valid\\_to or is\\_deleted flag. i'm probably wrong but the snapshot system seems to be best fit in cases you know your source system will never delete anything.",

If records are deleted in source ( in the last 366 days) and you want to remove it form snapshot, it is also possible via Iceberg.

Use Fabric’s data movement primitives plus an automated control loop, or avoid copying entirely and materialize only what you need.\n\nA practical pattern that works for me: (1) do an initial bulk load with a Copy job or Dataflow Gen2 that can target a Warehouse.  \n(2) switch to incremental/CDC for ongoing sync. Fabric has a CDC/Copy job feature and you can also use Delta Change Data Feed in Lakehouse tables to capture row-level changes for reliable upserts.   \n(3) automate discovery of new tables by keeping a metadata table or using the Fabric REST/metadata APIs in a pipeline to list Lakehouse tables and loop over them to create/update copy jobs. Community threads show people scripting this when they need to scale. \n\nAbout schema drift: Fabric’s copy tools can do mapping but they are not perfect at automatically absorbing arbitrary schema changes for all workloads. If you expect frequent schema churn, consider an ELT pattern: keep canonical data in the Lakehouse and run periodic MERGE queries from Lakehouse into Warehouse tables (or materialized views) using the Delta CDF or SQL MERGE so you have deterministic upserts. \n\nIf you want a starting checklist: pick Copy job for initial load, enable incremental or CDC for high-change tables, build a pipeline that enumerates tables and triggers jobs for new ones, and use Delta CDF or MERGE for schema-safe upserts. If you want, I can sketch a simple pipeline loop (pseudo-SQL and pipeline steps) you could drop into Fabric.",

The first thing I would suggest is heading over [to the documentation FAQ portion, there's two scenarios](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-use#faq) \\- see if they fit yours. If they do, it tells you when it's useful to use MV (in terms of query performance). \n\nThere are two considerations for the cost - the cost of refreshing said MV and also the cost of the query. Unfortunately without more details, this can only be answered by testing it out. The use case you describe, barring any complexities, is actually one of the more common use cases for MV. \n\n[(The following use cases highlight the value of materialized views. Materialized views can improve query performance if you frequently require the following:](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#use_cases)\n\n* **Pre-aggregate data**. Aggregation of streaming data.) \n\nHope that helps.",

Oftentimes if DE's are a part of an analytics group, you are treated as an analyst or at least not as a serious engineer.\n\nFor me another con of this offer is it's in the healthcare industry. I worked in healthcare before and I hated it. The kind of people you deal with are not technical, rooted in legacy ways, and rely a lot on Excel. You'll pick up domain knowledge in the healthcare field which can help you get other healthcare engineering jobs, which will suffer from the same things.

But imo there are 2 different types of data engineer. 1 more swe focused and 1 more sql focused. Swe focused ones pay the same and sql ones are usually a little less. An example is at my company I am under the swe name but work on and own some DE and my org is paid very well. But we also own the data for lots of high priority ML products. \n\nI also think saying data is a cost center is just not super true. I think a lot of companies are viewing data as a service. ML teams require lots and lots of data that is accurate and growing in complexity. This requires lots of work. Most companies are putting a lot of money towards data teams now and are viewed as essential.\n\nSo in terms of pay I think this is a non factor (there are more important factors like what company you work at and how fast you grow and promote). Unless you just straight prefer be work over de work (fair as it’s subjective but I’ve enjoyed it), then  you shouldn’t worry too much.",

Dbt at least is SQL with some jinja that you can pretty easily port to something  else.  Also I rarely  hear about this platform so likely you will have a hard time finding developers that know it and those numbers are declining as the industry has moved on from such platforms.  \n\nI saw coalesce in a demo once and it looked interesting, but didn't really get a feel for how it worked since the demo was about something else.

But here comes data governance expecting high resolution tracing on the data integration layer, just to check off our technologies as being able to take the blame if necessary.\n\nI want a DG partner saying we get this for that, we should store this like that, we need to keep track of this and we can/cannot store/process this in those conditions for these purposes. When an incident occurs I don't need you to convince me I need CICD, I need you to get budget for it.\n\nI can give you access, and I can explain how our pipelines work.

In a DG application like Collibra which I've used, you map the physical fields (say field \"customer\\_id\") to a Data Element, and that element can be Customer ID.\n\nA business term (used in a business glossary) should be agnostic to what is physically in the back-end.  That is a logical concept, and a business glossary helps promote common language among business users.  But I find it generally redundant if you already have a data dictionary which should provide a robust definition of what is physically in the field.  \n\nBut there are cases when business terms/business glossary can be useful.  For example a CUSIP is a security identifier with its own logical definition, but the physical field \"cusip\\_id\" could have dummy identifiers in it, which would necessitate differentiating between the logical (CUSIP) and the physical (cusip\\_id).",

Other things justify having a threshold. Other things don't matter. Forget any sense of engineering tidiness: this is about RoI. Your time is the I - what's the R? If you ignore this thing, what loss in revenue or reputation or whatever will occur?\n\nJust because a certain column never had nulls before doesn't make it a non-nullable column. Is there clear documentation / data contract saying it'll never be null? Otherwise, it might instead be a clue that the system is now being used in a novel way, and you (or your downstream data consumers) might need to react to that. Not DQ, just an evolution of how you need to interpret the data. \n\nE.g. Maybe the developers of the source application are now \"overloading\" the orders table, using it intentionally to store some entity that isn't strictly an order, but has very similar columns - except there's no such thing as a user for this new concept. There's probably a type_id or similar in this case, that has a new value distinguishing this novel use case from the old use case. \n\nAll this is just one example explanation, of many; the wider point is, there could be a good reason why the userid column is null. Rather than going to the data owner trying to raise it as an assumed problem, you might get a quicker answer if you assume the best and just ask \"can someone tell me what it means when there's a null userid?\". \n\nIf that is in fact a bug on their side, they'll probably (in my experience) deal with it quicker when you approach it this way.",

A few thoughts that might help:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*General pattern that works:\\*\\*\n\nProcess at the lowest granularity you need for reprocessing. In your case, that sounds like AP\\_Number level, since you want to reprocess specific APs without touching the whole EQP.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On avoiding reprocessing:\\*\\*\n\nTrack what you've already processed with metadata (timestamp, checksum, or version) stored somewhere lightweight - could be a simple metadata table in your warehouse, or even a manifest file per batch. When new data arrives, compare against this metadata to determine what's actually new vs. what you can skip.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On the Part\\_Number optionality:\\*\\*\n\nSince Parts are optional and variable per AP, I'd process at the AP level and handle Parts within that processing step rather than trying to partition by them.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Alternative approach:\\*\\*\n\nWhat if you partition by ingestion batch (timestamp when client sends data) rather than by the hierarchical data structure? Each batch could contain multiple EQPs/APs, but you'd process the whole batch as one unit. Downstream, you'd have the full data hierarchy in your warehouse with proper keys for querying.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Question for you:\\*\\*\n\nWhat drives the need to reprocess individual APs? Is it data corrections from the client, or something else? Understanding that might help determine the right partition strategy.\n\n\n\n(Side note: your client moving to database storage sounds like it'll simplify this significantly - might be worth investing effort there rather than over-engineering the S3 ingestion flow)\n\n\n\nCurious what you end up doing - hierarchical data ingestion is always interesting to solve!",

You need 3-5x speedup just to break even cost-wise. The real win is if you need results faster rather than cheaper processing.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Why not widespread?\\*\\*\n\n\\- Requires code changes and testing\n\n\\- GPU-enabled clusters cost more upfront\n\n\\- Many workloads are I/O bound, not compute bound\n\n\\- Operational complexity (different instance types, drivers, etc.)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*My suggestion:\\*\\*\n\nStart with profiling your current Spark jobs.

It will essentially go through line by line, and then look for similarities to the library. I can only think of how to apply it to essays and papers, but it could be:\n\n1. Step 1: Start with similar words. The checker will take the piece you're working on, and compare similar words to others. If the piece you're working on reveals a high number of shared words, then it gets \"flagged\" for further examination. \n2. Step 2: Take the piece you're comparing, and the other pieces of work that share some close similarities, and then reveal similar phrases/sentences. If the similar phrases ended up being long enough (multiple words/sentences), then the likelihood that it was plagiarized increases.

        "body": "Look at it from a different perspective:\n\n\nWhen you learn how to be a carpenter, do you go right to building a house to get better? \n\n\nNo, you build a crappy chair. Then you keep building several until it looks a little less crappy. Then you build other objects and repeat the process. If you do that enough times, you'll naturally pick up other tools and methodologies that'll help you with your building. Over time, you'll be able to start building a house with your experience. \n\n\nYou won't know what many tools are called, names of all the screws, and the best way to use everything. You just pick them up and try them out, learning as you build things.\n\n\n.\n\n\nYou're a **beginner** trying to build a house (Minecraft mods) when you don't even know what a hammer does (Java). Of course that'll feel overwhelming. \n\n\nFirst, play around with Java. Follow a tutorial or two about it. Maybe do a course or make something cool. There's no \"am I ready?\" You're ready whenever you say you're ready, whether that's after a 1hr yotube playlist or a several week MOOC. You'll *never* know everything about Java. Never. You can get a PhD in CS with Java and not know how to build a single project. Fortunately, you don't need to know *everything* about Java or CS to accomplish your goals. \n\n\nDon't let that lack of knowledge make you afraid to start building with it. You can start building things even after a simple 1hr tutorial. It would be a far cry from MC mods (little chair vs a hige house), but it's definitely enough to start your journey. \n\n\nI'd probably go through a beginner course utilizing Java. Udemy? Coursera? mooc.fi? Pick your poison. Anything works. [Pick one of the links at the beginning and get started](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/1kla4xc/comment/ms0p7yn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n\nI'd probably go for the Udemy one. Hyperskill is more expensive, but it'll probably be the easiest intro to Java. The mooc is probably going to be very in-depth, and very hard, but free. Probably overkill. Coursera might have some free courses. There are many. Just choose whatever beginner Java course you can find. \n\n\nWhatever your choice is, just go through it until you know a little bit about Java. Your goal is simple exposure and to be able to build small little things that output into a terminal. They likely won't teach you how to build things in MC and you may be exposed to a lot of concepts you won't find immediately useful. Just get comfortable seeing code, using code, and thinking like a programmer.\n\n\nDon't go down a rabbit hole of things (remember the PhD comment?). Java can build practically anything, so you'd be able to learn so much without achieving your goals. Just get the basics down until you're comfortable. \n\n\n.\n\n\nOnce you have a basic understanding of what Java is, go straight into learning how to mod.\n\n\n[Here's one resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1csh3yp/comment/l44waul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Here's another](https://www.mcjty.eu/docs/intro)\n\n\nThere are a lot.\n\n\nDon't freak out. You won't know anything really. The above Java stuff was just getting you used to the hammer, nails, properties of wood, etc (depending on the resource, you may have built a chair or two).\n\n\nThis, however, is the real deal. You're actually going to start building chairs, and it's going to suck and it will look like crap. You won't even know a lot of the things being talked about and you'll feel like you're at the very beginning again. That's okay and perfectly normal. You have to acquire a few more tools, but Java is the biggest learning curve and the one everything interacts with, so it's the one I recommended getting comfortable with first. \n\n\nGo through tutorial after tutorial about Minecraft mods, follow the beginner steps, and try to recreate things as they do it. Then try to do it again without the video, pausing each time. Then try to manipulate what you've created, or even break it. Then try to repeat the entire process from scratch until you recreate it (minus the setting up your tools part).\n\n\nThen move on to the next tutorial. Once you've acquired enough small skills, try to go about building a simple little thing yourself (you can even try after your first tutorial). This simple thing might be insanely hard. You might have to reference different documentation and videos to help you out. Once you finally finish it, try to improve it. Try to recreate it if you really want to reinforce the knowledge. \n\n\nThen move onto the next idea. \n\n\nOnce you do that enough, you should be able to see other people's source code for their projects and be able to pick out little bits and pieces that you might want to try yourself, or research about to see what it does. Try to contribute to an open source mod or pull from their projects and play around with the code. \n\n\nThat series of building is what will eventually get you to creating your own big ideas. \n\n\nPeople legit go through the Kaupenjoe videos (first link) without even knowing *any Java* and successfully learn how to build projects after a year. You can start that way too, but I thought maybe it'd feel better knowing a little bit about Java first (if you already don't know anything). If you're overwhelmed, skip everything I told you and go straight to that. It'll be very hard and scary, but learning to program is a marathon, not a single sprint.\n\n\n.\n\n\nI can't really help you beyond that. Things take time. Don't stress about memorizing everything, being perfect in everything you do, or finding the best paths. Just progress, 1hr a day, every single day. \n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nA painter doesn't get good after their first stick figure. They do tens of thousands of failed small attempts that build up to the occasionally solid large attempt. As they build up their skills from a ton of small, crappy projects, the eventually move onto more and more quality on each piece. \n\n\nTheir skills don't manifest from perfecting their pain brush, getting the best pigments they can, or knowing absolutely everything they can about color theory. \n\n\nDon't worry about getting the best tutorial, learning Java perfectly, and being overwhelmed by all these new ideas. Just go through the first thing you see related to MC mods, that makes sense to you, and work up your skills, little by little. ",

You will be overwhelmed, drained, annoyed and disappointed regardless. Learning is never a cake walk. You'll hit barriers and it will take effort to get over them. Programmers are just the people who stuck with it longer than others. Nothing special about them. \n\nA good way to retain what you learn is trying to apply it to your goal. Since you have one already that's excellent and a great motivator. Every time you learn something think of how you can apply it to that goal of making apps and modding Minecraft. No matter how small there is always a way to apply it. \n\nThe first language is always the toughest. You're not only learning the syntax of a language and how to order things, but you're also learning computer science concepts at the same time. Once you get the concepts though you can easily transfer that knowledge to another language or project. It's like you're building a house. You need to learn how to hammer nails and which screws go where. But you also need to learn how to make a foundation and how to support a roof. \n\nSo keep it up. You can't force things so take breaks and decompress and let things sink in. You won't become making apps tomorrow, but you can learn the building blocks a little bit every day or every other day or even once a week. Persistence is the name of the game.",

Your breakthrough is near. Stay focused, stay driven, and trust the process. You've got this! Keep pushing forward, and don't let doubts hold you back. Your time will come.",

Postgres migrations, RLS rules, serverless functions, auth flows, environment variables across local and production, production/preview deployments, recreating the wheel instead of using battle tested code, running 2/3 projects in parallel, trying to get plugins to work together that don't offer api, customizations the whole stack… I touched all of it way before I “should have,” but it forced me to actually understand how systems fit together instead of just syntax.\n\nThe wild part is I used to think feeling confused meant I wasn’t good enough. Now I realize even experienced devs get stuck. Half the job is debugging your own assumptions the other half is Googling or talking to an AI chatbot until the error finally makes sense.\n\nIf I could go back I’d tell myself this early on:  \n  \nYou don’t learn by memorizing you learn by building the thing that feels slightly too big for you and breaking it until you understand why it broke. Every time something failed in production or mis-configured itself or refused to link or deploy I came out understanding the system a little deeper.\n\nSo yeah my advice is this: don’t be afraid to jump into the deep end. Build real stuff. Ship broken stuff. Fix it. Iterate. That discomfort is literally the path.",

Kernel Stack - You don't want to share privileged kernel details with userspace accidentally, so the switches to supervisor mode swap stacks.\n\n2. Signal/Exception Handlers can be told to use a separate stack, because signals may come when your out of memory. You can sigaltstack() to set this up. Check out man sigaltstack.\n\n3.

It can and it can be good at it, but it can be a bit too easy to rely on. If you use copilot in your IDE, when it gives you a massive block of code as a suggestion, I would say it's fairly likely you don't know exactly what that section of code is doing.

Get it to write and explain sections so you can see what it's doing and how it's doing it, but try to write that code out again and understand the code you're working/copying. \n\n\nIt's early days and I'm confident that the education system is struggling to figure out how to let students use LLMs as learning resources, but not as cheating resources.

The problem with using LLM’s for programming ESPECIALLY when learning for a complete solution is that LLM’s are frequently ‘wrong’ meaning that even when they are right( much of the time) they’re rarely absolutely correct in more complex or iterative work (my experience).\n\nI just had this conversation with myself earlier today—i think the general trap with some types of llm use is what happens when you follow someone else up a location you’ve never been to.\n\nmy advice as student or learning programming? Use LLM all the time—but not to ‘make the whole system for me’ but rather tell me about design patterns or how do c++ pointers work, what’s the best practices for creating X?",

Find methods that don't follow this and extract into simpler methods.\n4. Once you have a set of methods that appear to be focused on a particular variable(s) or piece of state, consider grouping these methods and variables into a class. Think about how these methods/properties might represent some entity. \n\nThat said, don't get bogged down by focusing too much on OOP. Learn programming first. As a beginner, you should be focused on getting your code to work and that's it. With smaller scale apps/beginner projects, OOP often introduces unnecessary complexity",

I would create a static instance of the class and try to do everything with that.\n\nI finally understood that a class is essentially a \"cookie cutter\". You use it to create an object which looks like the class. Then you call the methods on that object. The reason you would want to do this is because you have multiple objects which are essentially the same, or similar. \n\nFor example, take the ghosts in Pac-Man. You could write this by declaring X and Y co-ordinate variables for each ghost, but then you'd have a bunch of variables like ghost1x and ghost3y and ghost4x and so on. Think about how writing collision detection would work. You'd have to check if ghost1x==playerx && ghost1y==playery || ghost2x==playerx && ghost2y==playery.... nightmare.\n\nInstead, define a ghost class, and instantiate it four times, once for each ghost. The ghost class could include a collision detection function, to check if its *instantiation* hit the player. Now you can just write something like:\n    if greenGhost.hitPlayer()\n        player.gotCaught()\n\nYou don't have to worry about how the calculation of the collision detection works any more -- at least, that is the theory.\n\nHave you searched for beginner-friendly OOP tutorials outside of video sites?

All of those string methods like .lower(), .upper(), etc. are just oop implementation for strings. Same with all the list methods. Once you realize you've been swimming in an ocean of OOP it starts to get easier. At least it did for me.\n\nEdit: architectural patterns with Python is also a stellar resource for learning how to use OOP to achieve a larger software goal.

        "body": "As someone who’s been doing backend dev for \\~11years, let me give you the advice I wish someone gave me early on:\n\n1. The real way you learn OOP isn’t by studying diagrams, it’s by modeling small real systems, giving each class a clear responsibility, and avoiding the “giant class with 20 methods” trap. That shifts your thinking from: the procedural way: “What steps do I need to do?” to the OOP way: “What objects exist in this world, and what responsibilities do they have?”\n2. Tutorials don’t teach design, books do. If you want actual design and not just syntax, these beginner-friendly resources are gold: **\"Head First Design Patterns\"**: the best intro to OOP thinking, **\"Practical Object-Oriented Design\"**: very readable and extremely practical, and **\"Refactoring improving design of existing code\"**: not OOP-specific, but teaches you to *see* structure and smell bad design\n3. Another underrated tip: read good OOP code. Python libraries, open source github repositories, or even frameworks.\n4. On the language choice: Python can teach you OOP, but it’s a multi-paradigm language, so beginners often get mixed signals. If you want the concepts to crystallize faster, something more “pure OOP” like Java, C#, or Ruby tends to make the underlying principles way clearer. Once it clicks, you can apply it in any language.\n\nAnd honestly, everyone writes procedural code inside classes at first. Keep going. The moment it clicks, it really clicks.",

Make of that what you will.\n\nThey claim to have had a major upgrade in May 2020 and that should make it bang up to date. Computer science hasn't changed significantly in the last 5 years.\n\nNote that this is teaching computer science, not programming and certainly not software development. They are different fields. You could finish this whole course without knowing how to write a single line of code, but you'd know a ton about how a CPU and RAM works. The course's programming module seems to lean heavily on a book called Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) which is known as a maths-heavy academic textbook with little practical application in the industry of writing code. \n\nOn the other hand you could take a software development course, learn how to build a full-stack web service and deploy it to the cloud, but still think a computer is a magic box where binary happens.\n\nYou could compare it to a racing driver vs a car mechanic. It would benefit both to know how a combustion engine works, but knowing about catalytic converters doesn't make you drive faster, and knowing about racing lines doesn't help you fix cars.\n\nThere's no \"wrong\" career path here, but software developers who know fuck all about CPUs are far more employable than computer scientists who can't code. If your goal is \"learning almost anything there is to learn about software and hardware development\" then your time is better spent on something other than teachyourselfcs.com.",

So like\n“What is a variable?”\n“Well, I don’t know, what do you think a variable is?”\n“A variable is some piece of data assigned to a name”\n“And what do you mean by assigned to a name?”\n“Well, I take a word and I set it equal to something, could be a number a string of characters”\n“When you say set it equal, do you mean like 1+1=2 “\n“Well no, the variable is a placeholder for whatever value ive assigned to it”\n“Oh, so you use it instead of the value “\n“Yes”\nEtc…\nMost programmers will say slow your thinking down, dialoging like this is a way of doing that. \n\nGood luck",

There are many (many, many) ways to accomplish this, so it's hard to give a good recommendation without it.\n\nI will recommend Python for the programming language, Flask for the web framework, and Waitress for the server. Python is about the simplest language to learn, Flask provides tools for building a web service in Python, and Waitress acts as a go-between to accept browser requests, turn them into calls to your program, and send the results back again. I would also recommend Flask-RESTful (I would structure the form submission as a REST API call). All of these have very good documentation.\n\nNote that as a security measure Waitress only responds to the 127.0.0.1 interface (your local-machine loopback) and cannot bind to ports under 1024, so you would usually bind to port 8000 or 8080. For local testing or demonstration this is quite sufficient; if you want to serve pages to other machines, you would usually install nginx as a reverse proxy.\n\nYour laptop very likely already has Python installed, but it is a good idea to make sure it is up to date. If you open a command-line window and run \"python -V\" it should respond with something like \"Python 3.12.3\". The current stable version is 3.14.0, and that is the one you should be running unless there is some specific reason you can't. (On Windows! On Mac or Linux, don't go monkeying with the system-provided version.)\n\nIt is recommended to start by setting up a virtual environment, to prevent something you're adding from interfering with things you've already installed. You can do this by running \"python -m venv my_app\" followed by \"my_app\\Scripts\\activate\". You can now install the modules by running \"pip install Flask flask-restful waitress\" and start work.\n\nCheck the Flask getting-started docs; it will walk you through writing a minimal web app. Use templates; you can probably drop most of your existing html code into template files and use it from there with minimal modification and without cluttering up your code. Check the Waitress docs; they will show you how to call your app and get it running. Try to keep everything as simple as possible until you get a minimal version up and running; you can always gild it later.\n\nGood luck! 🍀",

        "body": "For what you are asking to do, there isn't much special about a server.\n\nYour laptop is a PC and is perfectly capable of being both the server and the client for what you are proposing.\n\nThere are lots of things you can do to make it more ubiquitous- for example if you could get a static IP allocated and have it added to a DNS, you could look it up from any computer using the network name (e.g. https://www.myserver.com/).\n\nBut if you can't do that (the more likely scenario) you can just look up its dynamically allocated IP address and use that instead (e.g. https://1.2.3.4/ or whatever address you are assigned in place of 1.2.3.4).\n\nMore importantly if you want people to access your server running on your laptop from another computer you will almost certainly need to open the port that the server is listening on.\n\nFor example, let's say you setup a \"web site\" using apache tomcat on your laptop. Apache tomcat, by default listens on port 8080 (for unencrypted traffic and 8443 for https if memory serves). So, if you opened up your browser and entered http://localhost:8080/mystery, then assuming your web app is called \"mystery\" you should see the index.html (or index.jsp) of your site.\n\nNow if you determine that your IP is 1.2.3.4 (it won't be, but let's assume it is) you could go to another PC and enter http://1.2.3.4:8080/mystery then you will likely get a \"host refused connection\" error. This is because the firewall on your laptop isn't allowing anything from the outside to get through - unless you set up the firewall to allow external traffic using port 8080 (or 8443 if you want https) to get through...\n\nNote, if you do open any ports, only open the one or two that you allow and when you are done close them. In fact I would open them when I needed them to be open and close them once I've done the demo from the other computer.\n\nThere are plenty of other potential things you may need to take into account. For example, it will be much easier if both computers are in the same \"subnet\". If you don't know what that means, then just connect to the same wifi AP and hope that the configurations are such that they connect to the same subnet (e.g. try not to use a professors laptop and your student laptop - this is unlikely to be an issue as it is unlikely that there will be such configuration issues,  but you never know for sure unless you try it and know what to look for when it doesn't work on some computers ).",

So you know C, so what? Do you know the first fucking thing about fluid dynamics? Learning C won't teach you that. Once you know fluid dynamics, no one gives a shit what programming language you know.\n\nI can teach any idiot how to program in C in just a few days; I can't teach any C programmer fluid dynamics. You either have the chops or you don't, and you're going to get and prove most of those chops in college. You're going to need that head start just to get the kind of job you want, because no one is going to entertain a comp-sci who taught himself a little math; you would have to be an absolutely astounding unicorn to prove yourself on your own merits alone. And if you already had that, you wouldn't be here asking.\n\nThe hard part of the job is not the programming, not the comp-sci, it's the domain you're working in - in your case the rocket science. Learn that, and they'll teach you the programming when you get there.",

Go into the tutorial, and every time you think you can fix your code go back to it, till your code works. 5.

        "body": "Like any other programming problem: start by clearly saying *what* you're trying to do, then break that down into smaller subproblems or steps until it's approachable.\n\nIt sounds like you want to identify *all* of the possible poker hands. Start with just one type of hand, e.g. a flush.\n\nWhat's the definition of a flush? It's a hand where all the cards are the same suit.\n\nOne possible way of doing it is to say: \"a hand is a flush if: it's all hearts, OR all clubs, OR all diamonds, OR all spades\". And then write code to check each of those four conditions. This approach will work but it's a bit tedious.\n\nIf you think about it for a second, then it should be obvious that \"a hand where all cards are the same suit\" is equivalent to \"a hand where all cards have the same suit as the first card.\" So you don't need to write four separate checks for the four possible suits.\n\nAnd so on. You can repeat this kind of analysis for each type of hand. For some of the hand types, you will need to examine multiple possibilities, e.g. for two pair, you'll need to check the different possible cards that might make up a pair. For a straight, you'll need to check whether there's a straight with aces low (5-4-3-2-A) or aces high (A-K-Q-J-10).\n\nThere are many possible ways to implement this. If you're a beginner, I would suggest that you first focus on getting something that works *correctly*, even if it's ugly or verbose, and then look for ways to simplify and optimize it. And you should write lots of test cases to make sure that your code behaves as expected.",

So, how I would've done that is this - I'd create a Card class, so i don't have to store suit and value as a raw dictionary, instead i can assign those to a card's attributes through constructor, e.g.\n\n```\ncard1 = Card(❤️, \"Q\")\ncard2 = Card(❤️, \"7\")\ncard3 = Card(♣️, \"J\")\n```\n\nAlso, I'd override comparison dunder methods in Card class, so that i can compare two cards like this:\n\n```\ndef __eq__(self, other):\n    if self.suit != other.suit:\n        print(\"Can't compare cards with different suits\")\n    else:\n        return self.value == other.value\n```\n\nAnd \"less than\" dunder method, so i can tell if the card has higher or lower value:\n\n```\ndef __lt__(self, other):\n    if self.suit != other.suit:\n        print(\"Can't compare cards with different suits\")\n    else:\n        return self.value < other.value\n```\n\nI would also wright a method to compare suits, so i can understand how cards relate to each other.\n\nAnd also, think about how you, as a human, identify that you have a flush, for example? You will take a look at you two cards, check their suits, ignoring their value, then you'll take a look at the table to compare those card's suits to the ones that you have on hand, and IF total amount of cards with the same suit is 5 - you have a flush! So all these hands definitions can be converted in to the functions where if all requirements are met - you've got straight, full house etc.",

That wastes a ton of space. \n\nThe solution is dynamic library files (these are \".so\", or \".dll\" files).

        "body": "To add a little more detail, linking relates to calling methods. It’s something you barely think about while coding. You just call one, but how does that actually work? Code is also stored in memory at runtime and instructions have memory addresses (line number offsets from the start of the executable file). To call a method, you create a new stack frame for it on top of the stack, set a return pointer to hold the line you are currently on, then jump to the first line of the function you called. At the end of the function, you set a return variable in the caller’s stack frame and jump back using the return pointer. \n\nSo, how do you know where to jump? If it’s a method in the same assembly, that’s easy. If it’s in another assembly, you have to determine the jump address. That’s linking. Assemblies have a table of jump addresses at their start so it’s possible to read and set these addresses. Static linkers set this at compile time and if the actual assembly used differs at runtime, interesting things can happen. Dynamic linkers use a runtime to load assemblies and will resolve these jump addresses at that point. Note that virtual methods that support polymorphism have an expanded table of jump addresses by concrete type since they can overload methods. The runtime selects the jump address based on the actual type at runtime. See v-tables for more information.\n\n\nTyping. All memory storage ultimately has a type. It has to since types are literally encoded differently and processed by different cpu components. You can choose to set that type yourself at compile time (statically) or let the runtime take its best guess (dynamic). The later is rarely necessary with objects in languages that support ad-hoc tuples (like js grab bag objects). With primitives or collections of primitives, it’s not a good practice. With types, you want strongly typed code that lets the compiler do as much validation for you as possible. Anything it doesn’t check can still break as an exception at runtime.",

        "body": "at a high level, there are 2 types of embedded systems.  I used to work on large unmanned systems, and we used stuff like PC104 computers with serial ports.  The line of code you reference in your question would be an invocation of a library function, and that library function would talk to a driver, and that driver would send voltages out the USB port that produce the required signals to tell a motor to run or an actuator to move or the like, or it might read a camera video stream or a lidar or gps output.   This is not much different from coding up a laptop or something, these computers had a full operating system and mouse/keyboard/monitor support for diagnostic efforts and so on.   Its 'barely' embedded, in the big picture of that world, but we made many a 'robot' (mostly, unmanned aircraft and later, watercraft) with those tools.  \n\nThe other level is where you do more of that hands on, sometimes actually wiring devices together yourself and sending voltages to them with some agreed upon way, often directly setting an address to a value using a C or assembly like language.   I did a lot less of that, as it is slower to produce the product and a lot more weeds to get into for each individual component.   For example we had one 'smart' actuator that ran code, but you had to wire it up a certain way to accept a program and then wire it up a different way to run the program installed on it automatically when it got powered on.   There was extensive documentation for making that work.  \n\nI would start with a simulation.  keep the stuff that would be hardware isolated so you can replace it, and build a sim where you drive your robot around and have it do the things you want it to do all in just pure desktop code.  Then if you want to build it, you can pick out the hardware and change out the isolated code to interface with the motors and sensors and all.   We had full simulation for all our vehicles, crude but it got the job done, to test our control systems and such safely in a virtual world.   Eg if your robot is going to navigate a maze, get the logic for that done in a sim, if its going to avoid obstacles, do that in the sim... get it all working best you can before a live test.",

Sure, it's not as fresh as it used to be, and recall is slow (because I haven't used it in a while), but I still have a fundamental understanding of backend frameworks, rendering pipelines and game engines for example. (and yes, they all (TM) basically work the same) It's not as much decayed knowledge, as just background knowledge. When I need it, I normally have some time to refresh it first. (It's very rare that someone wakes me up at 4am, holds a gun to my head and forces me to implement a raytracer from memory) Once you have learned something once, it's easy to re learn it; like visiting your home town after some years not being there. \n\nEverytime I needed something I used to know by heart again, it took at most a few hours to get back up and running.

If you let it hand you full solutions, you won’t build your own internal map of how things fit together. But if you treat it like a senior engineer who gives hints while you still write the code yourself, your skills level up fast.\n\nWhat helped me early on was giving myself stretches of time where I didn’t ask anything until I had at least tried to outline the solution. Even a rough plan is enough. Once you have that, AI becomes a tool that fills in gaps instead of a tool that replaces the entire thought process. You’ll be surprised how much you actually know once you force your brain to engage first.\n\nVue is a great choice to learn because the mental model is clean. If you keep building small projects where you write most of the logic yourself, you’ll break through that “wall” feeling. And once you’ve done a few builds where you genuinely understand the moving parts, AI becomes a speed boost instead of a crutch.\n\nYou’re in a good spot.

Most people don’t know their lane until they’ve actually built a few things and noticed what keeps them curious.\n\nThe trick is simple: stop trying to pick the perfect direction from the outside. Just start doing small projects in different areas and see what doesn’t feel like a chore. Your interests show up while you’re working, not while you’re thinking about working.\n\nAs for learning, there’s no magic source. Videos, books, courses, docs, all of them work. What matters is whichever one actually gets you to sit down and build something. Once you’re building, the fundamentals start making sense because you’ve got a real reason to learn them.\n\nSo don’t wait for clarity. Make a few small things, follow what pulls you in, and your “path” organizes itself pretty quickly.",

Do Something: On my course, there are a lot of people who do nothing outside of University. As long as you're taking up a part time job or working on side projects, you're already beating a lot of the competition. In my interview at my internship, they prioritized my soft skills and what I learned in my prior role as a Restaurant Supervisor, and it's why they took me on.\n\nMake the most of your free time at University too.

I told her that they could contact me directly. \n\nThey were in Canada and had this website... [https://www.minorityassist.com/](https://www.minorityassist.com/) They told me that they had paid $5,000 in Canadian money to have the website developed and it was doing nothing to bring in donations and they needed a better website in a hurry and they would pay me to create a better website. They said they needed it in 5 days. \n\nI said I could recreate that website and make it better in 4 hours. I was given the go signal. Less than 4 hours I had something up and running with a light box and scrollable images on the front page and menus at the top. \n\nI was told \"No\" on the attempt to recreate the same website. I said, \"Okay... point to me a website that you really like and would prefer to be like\". \n\nThey had a website that was done by a student in 2013 that took 9 months to complete. They said we now need something like that website in 4 days... Here is the link to the Wix website the student created in 2013... and was up and running until 2016, almost for 4 years. \n\n[https://mrothchild.wixsite.com/minorityassist](https://mrothchild.wixsite.com/minorityassist)\n\nThey said that they wanted it to look like that. The only problem is that another company owned the [minorityassist.com](http://minorityassist.com) url and they would have to use another one. What I found for them was the .net url. They purchased it from GoDaddy. \n\nSo, I recreated that website in 2 days... Yes, 2 days... \n\nIt is here... [https://www.minorityassist.net/](https://www.minorityassist.net/)\n\nThey paid me $1850 in Canadian money. \n\nThey didn't want the \"Corporate Sponsors\" page anymore and said to delete, the one on my created website, not the one on Wix... This page...\n\n[https://mrothchild.wixsite.com/minorityassist/corporate-sponsors](https://mrothchild.wixsite.com/minorityassist/corporate-sponsors)\n\nSo I replaced it with one of my own and include the link in my resume to prove that I developed the website and host it on the same computer that my son plays Roblox and Fortnight on...\n\n[https://www.minorityassist.net/Home/corporate\\_sponsors](https://www.minorityassist.net/Home/corporate_sponsors)\n\nSo, start with attempting to recreate Facebook on your own...

That also answers to your \"And what parts did you actually have to code? Frontend? Backend?\" part. If it would be just backend then it would be just an API. Unuable for regular everyday users. If it would be just frontend then it would be stateless and there would be no way to interact with other users. A fully functional CRUD application needed both backend and frontend even in early 2000s. Just then you had more likely no frameworks and you were using the regular language itself.\n\nThe comment in that thread says it took couple months for Zuckerberk to make it. Which is realistic time for a single person team. Because you won't be just writing the backend and frontend but also deploying it, setting up a database, figuring out its hosting, do some elementary security testing, etc. \n\nA random beginner could not do it. A person had to have a knowledge in creating CRUD web application. Which would be doable for a person who had spent months in learning it (do keep in mind, writing that early Facebook took couple of months already by itself), trying out smaller projects, and then going for that bigger project. Doable for a CS Bachelor student (2nd-3rd year or such). \n\nThe current Facebook for sure is not duable for beginners nor for students. It has whole separate teams working on different parts of the system.",

This is great advice , I am seeing that it's going to solve a bunch of readability and maintainability issues for me. I will be going to follow this for all kinds of updates going forward. But now suppose there are more factors involved instead of just these three things. Which might not make sense in all the cases. For example when a user is updating data, we might even need his ip address to validate things, whereas in the case of admin we don't have this requirement. Many other possibilities could arrive. What approach Will you suggest in those situations. We might end up preparing and passing a lot of data that is not needed for processing the request and this, data has to be passed a lot from parent to child functions, this reminds me about the prop drilling hell of react, I don't want this problem in my backend. At least backend dev shouldn't be made to suffer these frontend things, there are already a lot of things to deal with. How do you suggest to handle these situations?",

There are some uses of LLMs that can be okay, but it seems like they very frequently introduce more problems than they solve, and in the worst cases lead people into trying to run a sub-4-hour marathon by riding a moped.\n\nTheory is generally good, but it's possible to be productive without knowing a lot about it. Trying to learn every theory seems like you'd never get around to producing anything, but just get stuck in academia forever.\n\nYou need to learn to prioritise. Possibly you also need to talk to a therapist or doctor if you're having issues with feeling like something \"messes up your mind\".",

Not relating to interviews, but to getting deeper and deeper until you loop around and feel that you got nowhere.\n\nFirst of all, wanting to know the fundamentals of everything to the core is not bad, but it is dangerous.\n\nYou have to realize this is an impossible task, and that should be the most important basis before any action. Nobody knows everything, but many pretend they do, even beginners, beware of gurus and savants, do not compare yourself to them, because you would be comparing yourself to an illusion.\n\nNow how to choose, when to dive deep, when to stop, when to not dive at all. I cannot answer that for you. But I can tell you my solution. Focus on projects.\n\nI always had this problem, but it never shows up when I have time pressure from a client. When there is time pressure and the main goal is not to learn, it is to get the project done, then I magically start to prioritize things properly.\n\nI have side projects with no time pressure, usually they get nowhere, but I do not expect them to.\n\nIf I am working by myself for myself, I have to create time pressure and reinforce it all the time, or else I get into study loops or refactoring loops or planning loops.\n\nMy suggestion to you is to not direct your learning toward interviews, at least not as the main focus. Interviews are abstractions, they are meant to assess knowledge, but they are very flawed.\n\nIf you focus on knowledge that helps you build actual software projects, that is useful, and nothing in the world can ever make that not useful.\n\nIf you optimize for interviews and the interview landscape changes, then you have wasted your time.",

Set a timer for that period of time, like 30min. When it stops, you stop. Add to that initial list of things you planned to research later.\n\nYou won't memorize everything (and don't need to), and often times simply going through the main material, only learning enough to continue on with said material, will help you build a foundation to reinforce the rabbit holes you'd be digging through later. If you start with the rabbit hole first, then you may wind up with collapsed tunnels as you have nothing to tether that knowledge to. That'll result in digging those same tunnels later, wasting your time.\n\nDo just enough to build a basic mental model of the theory and your material. Only focus deeper when you need to.\n\n**If you need a different perspective:**\n\nBeginners in art require a lot of quantity to produce quality, and as they get more reps, the more quality becomes important. Starting with only one painting that they focus all their quality on often stunts their progress compared to those who've done a healthy mix of both. You're focusing way too much on quality. Lean more towards quantity for now.\n\nProgramming is solving problems by building solutions, like a trade. You need to build a lot of projects to get better at programming so you have something to tether theory to. Learn what you need to build those projects and occasionally a step beyond, and that experience will reinforce the times you dig deeper.\n\nYou *can* focus a lot on theory to make *learning how to build projects* a smoother process, but theory isn't the thing that makes you a programmer. Just like how knowing the properties of a hammer, how to make sandpaper, and different types of trees doesn't make a carpenter learn how to build a house, memorizing every definition, theory, syntax, etc, isn't going to be the thing that makes you learn how to build a program.\n\nYou actually only need very basic theory to start building programs, just like a carpenter can start building incredible things with a hammer, nails, wood, and a saw. Keep to your priorities, as you'll likely be hired as a programmer, not a computer scientist. \n\nWith that said, **chase the fun**.\n\nI actually enjoy digging into things and learning theory/CS concepts, so I like to mainly do that with little bits of project-building sprinkled in. That's severely limiting the speed of my growth as a programmer, but it's what keeps me interested in programming in the first place. It sounds like you're the opposite of me as you're getting overwhelmed, so chase what's fun for you.",

You could definitely look into second hand ones into your area, or maybe ask for it as a Christmas present if that's an option, it won't run any games but for second hand stuff you can get that, a monitor and keyboard and mouse for under 100 bucks and have a fully functional setup for programming and browsing he internet and your parents could use it as a computer too if they need it (might be a good selling point for them idk).",

It sounds like you are going for a Computer Science degree, and wondering, why they don't teach you to be a programmer, but a scientist. \n\nMaths (and DSA and all theoreetical CS courses) are very much required to become a computer scientist. You have to learn all of the basics, so you are able to specialize in any CS subfield later. This also enables you to understand, to have a common vocabulary and knowledge base with others, even if they have a different specialization. I spezialized in computer graphics at uni. One of my best friends in networking and distributed computing. Although we barely had any courses in common after the first 2 years, we could talk to each other and explain one another what we were doing and how it works, with barely any problems. \n\nThose skill are not immediately, obviously useful. But they are necessary for computer science. \n\nAnd as someone who was a tutor for a DSA course: Those courses are there to give you the toolkit to reason about algorithms, analyze them and even figure out new ones if you need to. They don't teach you how to program, and that's by design. It is a different skill. \n\nProgramming on the other hand is something completely different. It is a craft. The program doesn't care if you know Dijkstras Algorithm, can integrate in multiple dimensions or know the difference between average and median. If helps to know those things about as much as a knowledge of a structural engineer helps you building wooden cabins. Good to have? Sure. Can you learn it quicker and easier for this specific usecase? Also yes. \n\nIf you want to learn programming, you will either have to hope that your school has some courses in that direction that will be helpful, or you will have to take your foundational knowledge (like maths and DSA), get some tutorials and get programming. \n\n>Should I choose a specific field of software engineering\n\nNot 100% sure, but it sounds like you really should focus on the fundamentals first\n\n>I tried to read books on software design\n\nagain, fundamentals. You are trying to run before you can walk. \n\nIf you are still at uni/school at a level where you just had your first DSA courses, and maths, the size of project you are supposed to tackle is tic tac toe in the terminal. A calculator. An CLI that simulates how fast your money can grow with a 5% annual compound interest. \n\nOnce you have that, a good next set of problems is the size of small games. Rebuilt Tetris. Flappy Bird. The Akinator! \n\n>and we didn't actually code in class because we were told \"I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science.\"\n\nAnd I nearly missed this quote, but it fits too well with what I tried to convey before: This is not a problem, this is how it is supposed to be. You are in a course designed to make you a scientist, not a craftsman! Sure, most people in Cs degrees end up going into programming, and I would argue we are better at it because of out degree, but you really should listen to your teachers.",

Start small and add new small things one at a time. Pull request in between.\n\nThis sets your roadmap for learning how to do this.\n\nOnce you can do that, pick an existing project you use or have seen.

And if that doesn't work, fellow students were a huge help when I was at university. \n\nAnother important note: You are not expected to become more than an intermediate programmer at this point. That takes experience, which you don't have yet. Being intermediate is totally fine until you get your degree. That is more or less everything you are expected to know as a junior developer anyways: You have the basics needed to produce code under guidance, and you have the background (CS degree) to learn fast, because concepts you will need are already somewhere in your brain. There is no expectation to be much better than that. \n\nIf you want to be better than that for yourself, there is no shortcut: You need to build real projects. No tutorial, bootcamp or lecture can really prepare you. We had two project seminars at my university, which were basically: \"Here is a team of 5/6 people, this is your task, we will check in with you in 6 weeks / after the semester\" and that is where I personally learned most about programming. If you don't have seminars like this and/or cannot find a group, you can also do this on your own. (Although a group helps, both with productivity, motivation and learning)",

In either case, you're going to have to have threads wait on each other to catch up before continuing.\n\nAs for what \"synchronizing threads\" means, it means what it does on the tin. Threads don't run at consistent speeds, and they run independently of eachother. This means when you run two threads, the order they finish in can vary at run time, which can be bad if one relies on the result of the other to do its job. This can also result in two threads using the same resource at the same time, even when they shouldn't - imagine two people being able to book the same seat at a movie theatre because they both clicked \"book\" at the same time.\n\nTo synchronize threads, you give them a way to communicate, and that's where Mutexes & Semephores come in.\n\nMutexes are a shared resource that can either be \"locked\" or \"unlocked\" at any given time. If you wanna use it, you have to lock it so no one else can use it. You also have to unlock it before moving on lest you fuck everyone up.\n\nSemephores meanwhile are kind of like hall passes, where mutliple threads can use the semephore at the same time, up to a threshhold; useful less for strict ordering, and more making sure multiple types of thread (ones that involve heavy processing for example) aren't running at the same time, gumming everything up to a standstill.",

Android also has a service discovery API for looking for services on the network, but I only played with it briefly IIRC. There is also Bluetooth etc.\n\nShouldn't be too hard to figure out if you want to control the functionality of your PC (or something the system exposes to programs, e.g. media play/pause/volume). If you want to control program-specific functionality that's going to depend on the program and how far you want to take it.\n\nEdit: If you have an iPhone I have no idea, never had one.",

From there, you'd need a program running on your computer that you want to control that subscribes to the broker, and then does whatever \"control\" activities you need it to do whenever it receives a command. If you want to control a music player, you'd need to see if the player has some API to allow that. If it doesn't, you may need to resort to something like PyGuiAuto to simulate clicks on a UI to pause/play/next song/whatever.\n\nSo, you'd need to be able to write code that can run on your phone (either a native app or a web app), and then some code to run on your computer to do the controlling. Both ends would likely require different languages as well unless you do everything in a broadly explicable language like JS.\n\nEdit: If the two devices will always be on the same network when you want to make use of this functionality, you could skip the broker and just run a typical web server on your computer. Then you could have the phone load up a web app that you write served from the computer, and the server could do the controlling actions directly.",

For API pull of signer details from completed e-sign docs, Adobe Acrobat Sign and DocuSign provide it, and SignWell also exposes simple endpoints for names and timestamps.\n\nBottom line: pyHanko or pdfsig are your quickest wins; pikepdf + asn1crypto if you want full control.",

        "body": "Stick with Unity. Don't switch mid-project - that's just going to reset your learning curve back to zero and you'll lose all the time you've already invested.\n\nHere's the thing - what you're experiencing is completely normal. Unity has a steep learning curve at first, but once things click, they really click. I've made probably over 100 games throughout my career and I'm currently working on publishing my first Android game (using Capacitor, but I've done plenty in Unity too), so I've been exactly where you are.\n\nThe good news is your plan is already solid - PC version first, VR later if time permits. That's the right approach. VR adds a whole extra layer of complexity, so definitely leave that for last or skip it entirely if you're running short on time.\n\nFor the room generation part - break it down into smaller pieces. Start with just getting basic cubes or planes to represent walls and floor. Don't worry about materials and fancy stuff yet. Get the geometry working first, then add visual polish later. Unity's hierarchy system seems confusing at first but it's actually pretty straightforward once you realize it's just parent-child relationships.\n\nThree.js/Babylon.js might seem easier, but you're going to hit learning curves there too, and you'll have less community support, fewer tutorials, and way fewer assets available. Unity's ecosystem is massive, which means when you get stuck, someone has probably solved your exact problem already.\n\nMy advice: keep pushing through with Unity. Focus on getting one piece working at a time. Room generation first, furniture placement second, VR dead last. You've already invested time learning Unity - switching now would be starting from scratch with a different set of problems.\n\nAlso, fair warning - you'll probably hit another wall when you're around 80-90% done. That's when all the edge cases, polish, and \"last 10%\" stuff becomes way harder than you expect. When you get stuck (and you will), the Unity community is really helpful. Unity Forums and Stack Overflow are great for specific technical problems. The Unity subreddit (r/Unity3D) is good for broader \"how should I approach this\" questions.\n\nOne more thing - if you haven't already, check out Unity's official video tutorials, especially the ones relevant to 3D environments and UI. They're really well done and will help a lot with the stuff you're struggling with right now.\n\nYou got this.",

The `highest` is always compared to the current value which uses index `x` to get the element in the array. Whenever `highest` is updated, its value is remembered by `second_highest`. The same thing happens to `second_highest`. If it gets updated, its previous value will be kept by `third_highest`. You can use an IDE and put a `cout` to print the values of variables for each iteration to understand better. This code won't check if the grade is invalid like 158 or -4.",

The most basic study technique that's proven to be effective is as follows. \n\n\nSit down and devote an hour to learning everything you can about a specific topic. This is your input time.\n\n\nAfter that hour of input, spend the next 15 minutes doing output. Spit everything back out onto paper (or even better, into commented code) in as structured and organized a manner as is possible.

Instead, learn DSA as you go through the process of learning how to develop software.  \n  \nLearn how to develop software by creating projects filled out completely. Not some little learning exercise. Fill it out completely as something that someone else can actually use. Let that be the guide for what you need to learn and when.\n\nFor example, take the TODO learning exercise and fill it out completely by adding REST, a backend and connecting that to a database. Add membership management (sign up/sign on), add payments and subscriptions, add SMS and email reminders, add calendar scheduling. Unit test this and deploy it using CI/CD pipelines.\n\nThe idea is to take any project you are working on and add the works to it so you learn and it guides you through your learning like a roadmap. Start small and the next small thing, then the next small thing. Use git/github and create pull requests in between.\n\nIf you do this, you will run into the DSA things you need to learn. You will be able to discuss deeply the things you built which is the main thing I am looking for during technical interviews.\n\nIf you are not doing this to get a job as a software developer disregard the above learning technique.",

Many interviews basically consists of some engineer jerking off to his insanely niche knowledge on a specific piece of tech which he then throws random trivia question at to prove his superior intelligence. \n\nI'm on the hiring side and I've shut this stuff done so fast you wouldn't believe it when I've spotted senior engineers at my company pulling it off. \n\nYeah Greg, it's amazing that you're incredibly skilled at Erlang and OTP, but we're hiring a frontend engineer here.. get the fuck off the high horse lol",

My advice is to discover it all for yourself if you have any interest.\n\nAlso my tech skills have come in handy. Informatics is a field that seems to have a lot of happy people in it. I’ve been offered paid research opportunities already and I’ve helped worked through IT issues on the floor.\n\nYou can earn your CNA (certified nursing assistant) in a month for like $2K max which involves working for nurses doing a lot of dirty work, but I got a job directly after which pays me to go to school. I’m also earning other certs and building clinical skills. There’s even CNAs who work remotely. \n\nThe healthcare system will break your heart as well as warm your heart because it’s the intersection of the best and worst of humanity. There are people who put an insane amount of effort in to help people. There are folks who sit on their ass. MBAs are a problem in that field too.\n\nEven with the OBBBA it seems like hospitals still need folks (granted I’m in a major US city) and every nurse I’ve spoken to has said “you’ll never want for a job.” \n\nI don’t think I’ll get near my old salary by any means, but I feel it’s more consistent. My interviews have been only a phone interview and unit interview which hasn’t been the hazing sessions you experience in tech. \n\nVery broad field with the ability to make way more than you ever will in tech should you pursue certain qualifications.\n\nAlso easily one of the least automatable jobs ever. If we automate that job we’re automating every job (i think ai is way overhyped).",

So learn the basis of Azure, AWS, or GCP to the standard that a dev is expected to. You don’t need to go super into the weeds, but get an understanding of CICD Pipelines, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.\n\nThis is pretty much the bare minimum knowledge for devs with a few years experience nowadays at least for web devs.\n\nDo that then study some system design methods (neetcode has videos for it as well as leetcode) and a few DSA questions. Don’t go too overboard on it though like many here will, if you aren’t trying to crack Big Tech, a good chunk of companies don’t even ask leetcode.\n\nFrom there just apply and hope for the best, the market is as good as it was 3-4 years ago.\n\nEdit:\n\nBiggest thing is probably to not ask this sub for advice, it’s full of unemployed people, students, and sky is falling doomers that can’t see what their weaknesses are",

Asked AI and it came up with a few good suggestions including what I did with some more improvements which works even better. This is good and we'll put it to good use.

It's a bit more complicated, it's tracking dynamic row dependencies via good ole parent and children rows. Also SQL. Classic case of hallucinations as it kept giving reasonably looking suggestions that didn't work. Oh well. That's too deep in the code to change.

Turns out, my family was just super tech illiterate and im just a typical late millennial. And now that im in industry the imposter syndrome hasn't left me since day one. Which is both good and bad. I constantly feel like I should be seeking new knowledge while also feeling like I have no idea what im doing, because honestly sometimes I don't and that stress does get to me at times. Google is my friend. Everyone else seems to be doing side hustles, and side projects, blogging, reading tech news and getting caught up on the latest framework, and this and that, I just wanna go home or log off, have a few beers and play some dang Helldivers. I just don't see software dev as this romantic craft like a lot of people seem to. \n\nAt the end of the day. The pay check is good, the benefits are nice, we still kind of have remote work, the bills are paid, and I have disposable income at the end of the week for fun. I wouldn't say the work is incredibly taxing but it has its ups and downs.\n\nMost jobs suck, most people hate going to work, I am where I am and I'll try and make the best of it until whatever happens happens on the global stage or I get fired and cant get/don't want another tech job.",

As far as I can tell, the improvements in LLMs have really started to slow down, and I see no reason why they shouldn't continue slowing down even more given that:\n\n* There are limits to how much energy can be allocated to LLMs; this ultimately puts a limit on how much training can be done.\n* We are running out of additional data to train LLMs on; this is another thing which puts a limit on how much training can be done.\n* Low-hanging fruit of algorithmic/architectural improvements have largely been solved (from models like DeepSeek) so there are now fewer and fewer stones to turn in this regard.\n* Moore's Law is dying and the low-hanging fruit of hardware architecture improvements seem to be picked by and large, meaning that hardware efficiency improvements will likely plateau. (see [https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance](https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance) for what I'm talking about)\n* Neural scaling laws which model performance are inherently increasing BUT concave down when more parameters/data are added, meaning that improvements should continue to get smaller over time; and this is not just the case for LLMs, but for any AI that could exist.\n\nOn top of that, there's reason to believe that the models may get worse. Much of the data now on the internet is AI-generated and it is inevitable that a great deal of it will be used to train new LLM models, thereby causing them to overfit and degrade somewhat. Let's also not forget that the CEOs and researchers have a lot to gain by hyping up AI, so if that is what is causing to feel concerned, try to not to let it get to you; there's a long history of this kind of stuff happening when relatively new technologies emerge, but the end result has always been exaggerations.",

But there are some reality to your concerns.\n\nThe goal isn’t to produce value anymore, it’s to maintain trust. This means a few things:\n\n1) you’ll find a good amount of people that have little to no desire in growing themselves or improving the environment they are in. People can be close minded and would rather maintain existing process. You’ll need to track down like minded individuals\n\n2) everything is a risk assessment. The approval process to get new tech is a pain. Bureaucracy slows down initiatives, you’ll figure out “work arounds” that’ll help you continue to work when waiting for permits or approvals. For example, maybe using localstack to build a POC because your new AWS feature isn’t approved yet\n\n3) tech debt… classic right? Except it’s a little different in that it’s harder to introduce new technologies that could alleviate tech debt. These people have also been in a bubble, so they don’t know about all the new stuff\n\n\nIf you’re worried about the title, honestly don’t be. You’ll find that there’s a good amount of people that have title based on tenure over skill. Sure, they may know the domain better, but they’ve been out of the game for a long time. \n\nKeep your head up and maintain a growth mindset, you’ll be just fine and maybe you’ll guarantee your retirement. Plus, the slower pace translates to you getting more free time",

I do have some listed on my linkedin/github profile page but these are the ones from when I was applying for my first role and for my resume I removed all but the one that was most fleshed out.\n\n> What should a senior dev actually focus on when entering the market for the first time?\n\nThis might depend on your specialization/target role. For a senior level role, I would expect a lot of interviews to focus on strong system design (differs a bit between backend and frontend though). If you're targeting big tech, you're likely going to encounter some form of algorithm interview rounds. And of course, prepare for your standard behavioral questions as needed. A lot of times, these boil down how you resolve inter-personal issues of deadlines, disagreements, prioritization, etc.\n\nOutside of technical skills though, linkedin premium is probably a good place to start, though you might want to only use it for 2-3 months and decide from there if you still need it. I also think the primary thing to focus on is applying to listings early. Another side note for linkedin is to reply to recruiters if they do reach out, even if you are declining them. I believe doing so increases your profile's score/visibility to recruiters as someone that replies so you'll likely receive more recruiter outreach in the future. I don't have a concrete source on that though 😅",

Unless you demand a fully remote position, you should have no problem finding something even if you have no network.

Many tech companies (especially big ones) will have an experience interview, and you’ll be generally expected to dig into a large project that you led. Questions could include what sort of architecture issues it had and how you solved them, working across team/org and what your approach was, what could have gone better, what you learned, all that sort of thing. \n\nThey will also be checking to see that you had sufficient senior level scope - eg you led the design and leadership of the project. I’ve seen people get downleveled from senior at multiple companies because they made their role sound like a contributor instead of a leader, or due to lack of project complexity.",

When you can though, you should endeavor to learn from first principals. I could jump into a Go project and fix some bugs and probably learn a bit, but I'd be much better served by augmenting that with doing some quickstarts and writing my own programs and tests that encapsulate the problems I'm trying to learn how to solve. There's a lot of learning that comes from there and that stuff tends to \"stick\" better than copy & pasting and error and looking up how to solve it.\n\nSometimes I even see devs _refuse_ to read the error message. Just copy and paste and if the answer isn't online then they don't know what to do. We had an internal script that required 2 args. Someone tried to use it with 1 arg.

They've been through so much that I can't fake by reading books or doing the latest certification.\n\nMy company defines the role as an engineer capable of working independently that can contribute to architecture and mentor juniors. * I know I'm not going to be as good as the 20 year guy, but I am starting to handle those responsibilities now as a mid.

If anything use LinkedIn and Indeed as a search engine and straight to the company’s website to ensure the job is there and apply there!\n\nI would also apply to recent listings as much as possible, favoring hours ago listings rather than days ago. ATS systems sort applicants in chronological order so once recruiters go through the first 50-100 applications they’ll probably have a good handful to push to the interview stage and that’s it they’re moving on. The back half never gets checked! So apply as soon as you see that job. Get creative, I even made my own alert system that alerts me when my scrapers sees a new job was posted to an ATS system and send me a notification on discord. Let me know if you’d like to try it out, completely free!\n\nAnyways, I wish you luck! It will be long and there’s no guarantee even all of this ends up working",

A few hours every day on:\n\n* LC: Did around 50 questions, skipped DP.

Mainly focused on systems I've worked with\n* Technicals: Focused on CS concepts (paradigms, concurrency, databases, patterns, networking, etc.) and their applications\n\nFrom the hiring side (major US tech hubs), even with a small sample size, the majority of interviewees lack problem solving skills and/or have mediocre communication skills. Literal senior+ devs, some at FAANG or adjacent, struggling / cheating at basic coding. We don't ask LeetCode, and allow people to pick any language they are comfortable with",

That being said, people that have skills are looking for a job for a handful of months.  If it takes longer than 6 months to find something, then generally that person has an issue with their resume, is too picky, or just doesn't have the skills necessary to land the job.\n\nThere are a lot of people that think that just having a degree will get them a silicon Valley salary right out the gate, but that is the exception rather than the norm.  Get work experience while in school.  I worked in tech support, then as a QA while I was still in school.  I then proceeded into QA automation until I finished school and started my first full time software engineering job. Now is a great time to pick up a job in an adjacent field until you have more experience to get into a team as a software engineer.\n\nAs far as AI is concerned, I love it as a tool and am looking for ways that our team can effectively adopt it into our coding practices, but it's not the magic wand some people love to say it is. It can help speed up development of \"boilerplate code\" that is tailored to a specific purpose or to help get answers to a new codebase. The demos where someone creates a web app or phone app just by prompting is great for creating a prototype to get feedback from the market on whether its worth spending engineering time to actually develop that feature.  The code generated may be useful enough to build off of, but as a codebase grows in complexity, the likelihood of using any large amount of AI-generated code becomes increasingly difficult.",

It's pretty vague.\n\n\nIn general, I'd say mature companies that are profitable and where the majority of employees are over 30.\n\nGreenflag if on Linkedin, you find developers on the team/adjacent to the team with graduation dates before like 2008 who have been with the company for more than like 5 years.  People who are over halfway through their career usually aren't trying to prove anything, and they just want to live their life and coast in stability until retirement.   The lack of this doesn't mean it's not chill, but if you see people like this there, then it probably is.\n\nPeople work hard because the moment you truly relax is the moment you stagnate in your career.  So you'd want to look for people who are probably satisfied with where they're at in their career.   Which also kinda lines up with Google being chill.  If you're at Google, you're close to the peak of software engineering.  Of course, you do have to do occasional overtime for deadlines, but from what I've heard from people, it's not so bad.  Generally like only 40-50 hours per week.

The value of a \"Masters\" is to have deep knowledge and research experience in a particular field (for example Computer Vision, or NLP or...). That's what companies are looking for when hiring for ML roles and requiring Masters/PhDs.  (Source: I work in the industry).",

The exception is if you do your thesis in something niche that helps you get a job in that niche.\n\nYour masters will help you meet the basic qualifications to get a job and you’ll be in practically the same boat as anyone who only has a bachelor’s.

They have to be listening to what the other person is saying and understanding why they have said it. In a properly functioning disagreement you will be asking as many questions as you will be giving answers.\n\nEventually, you might get to a point where you both fully understand each other, but do just fundamentally disagree. At this point, you will typically involve a 3rd party (another colleague, a team lead) to give a fresh perspective, and to act as a tie-breaker. \n\nIf you still can't come to a consensus after that, then your only option is to disagree and commit. A senior decision maker (e.g. a team lead) will pick one of the options, and you will all agree that, even if it's not your preferred option, you will commit to getting it done on the basis that doing the wrong thing well is often better than not doing anything at all.\n\nKey rules when disagreeing:\n\n1. Authority is irrelevant. If you can't explain and justify your view, your job title of Fancypants Principal Senior Architect is meaningless.\n2. Listen. Listen and understand what the other person is saying. Ask clarifying questions or suggest concrete examples if you don't.\n3. Go for a beer afterwards. This is the importance of relationships. I can have (sometimes quite forceful) disagreements with colleagues, but it is fine because we are also friendly with each other. Grab a beer, or a coffee, or have a game of pool, or whatever, but just build that relationship so it can easily survive disagreements.\n\nFinally, YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a common approach in software development, and it has it's place, but when it comes to security concerns you _are_ going to need it!",

So, unless you thrive in that kind of fast-paced environment, startups can be really challenging workplaces.\n\nAnd because the organizational structure changes so rapidly, a lot of decisionmaking is informal and workplace politics are more nuanced/difficult.

On a second thought considering it is online and I am not going to an office or getting any actual face to face mentorship I am not sure if I am interested besides like I said I will only be doing this for a month. It is not even a big or actual company, it is a start up and I have been advised by an older student in uni that start ups just wanna use people. So this left me uninterested, I would rather do individual projects and work on my resume. Thanks for your input and I hope everything works out for you and you are able to land an actual full time and  full salary job 🤩",

From my opinion, it’s only really worth it if you can make significantly high salary, such that you can buy your way out of American problems. This is significantly harder for someone with a family, as your expenses will be higher and you will be impacted by more specific issues than someone who is single (Schools, Health care costs, etc). Even in a lower cost region like Baltimore, I wouldn’t move for anything less than 100-300% salary increase over your Canadian salary. \n\nIf you’re really committed to this \n\n- Don’t focus on the L1-B visa, Consider TN. Apply externally to jobs in cities with tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle). With your YOE you should be able to get some decent high paying jobs (200k-400k). These should pay enough for you to support your family with 1 income; so even if your spouse can’t secure a visa, it’s still manageable. \n- Plan for potential private school expenses. Public education varies based on where you live, so either plan on paying more rent in a high income area or paying for private. \n- Plan for a short stay. Both L1B and TN are employer tied. So you WILL (not maybe) eventually find yourself having to come back to canada quickly if your employment ends. \n- The tech market is tough right now, but from what I’ve seen it’s still pretty competitive for senior level roles. \n\n\nTbh, \n\nConsider moving within Canada. There are definitely senior level jobs in Canada that pay way more than 100k, you may just have to move to Toronto or Vancouver. Also, 100k CAD seems low for senior even for Canada.",

There is an additional interview round for MLE jobs where they ask you ML trivia like \"what it is the difference between L1 and L2 normalization\" or \"Explain K-fold cross validation\". You may or may not get to do model development in an MLE job. But you will be involved in productionalizing an already developed model.\n\nFor applied scientists type of a role though. I have seen a few of my batch mates get those type of roles with just a master's degree. There are a few caveats though.\n\n1. These roles were in Amazon. In Amazon Applied scientist role is more of a SWE role than an AS role from what I observed. Most of the Amazon Applied Scientist roles are not the same as Microsoft research Applied Scientist role or Google Brain Research scientist or even Facebook AI research applied scientist roles. A lot of Amazon AS people get to churn out research papers every year. But I have seen even MLEs churn out research papers as well.\n2. You need to have at least 1 publication even for the Amazon AS role, when applying from outside. A thesis in the Master's program helps with that.\n3. The school I attended was a top 20 school for CS back when I was applying. And a few of my Batchmates are now working as Applied scientists in Facebook and Amazon without a Ph.D with just a master's degree. And these were people on H1b. Not even US citizens. Your experience might not be the same however.\n\nAlso applied scientist interviews are far more mathematical in nature than SWE/MLE interviews. You go into an interview and they might ask you to derive the expected value of a normal distribution or something on a whiteboard. A math heavy master's program from a top US university definitely helps with cracking that type of an interview.",

Far better than my worst team at Google, a moderate bit worse than the best. The departments are insulated enough that I don't have a company wide pulse, but I have some old peers in other departments who seem to have similar experiences to mine. It's a bit slower and more frustrating than other big tech but the people here are fantastic and they treat us great. Upward mobility is good here too.\n\n\nThe stock is down a lot. I don't feel comfortable making any meaningful comments there (employee, conflict of interest) but if that bothers you I'd strongly suggest pulling the thread behind the market sentiment and valuation (advice I'd give for any tech company in this market!).\n\n\nThe San Jose office is pretty great, and it's located right next to San Pedro square, which has a lot of fun restaurants and bars, usually live music.\n\n\nAmazon makes great resume fodder but that's the only positive thing I can say about them - but I'm also on the receiving end of complaints from peers, people tend to be more vocal with complaints than praise.",

I use LLMs at work—they’re great for kicking things off, but not for finishing. Too often it’s a cycle of compile errors and fixes that drags on for an hour. Once, it even removed a test case unrelated to my feature. Still, they’re incredible for understanding a codebase—like a supercharged Stack Overflow. But I’m still the driver.\n\nLLMs will stick around once they can run cheaply. Right now, companies are subsidizing usage to grow, but eventually the economics will shift. They’re not the be‑all for AGI, and the hype will cool.\n\nThe growth phase for OS‑level apps is over. The iPhone in 2007 was a hardware revolution—suddenly everyone had a computer in their pocket, spawning entire industries. AI is different: it’s a software paradigm layered onto what we already have.\n\nThe job market won’t “recover” to old norms. This is the new normal: pruning human labor. Five years from now, I expect AI‑related engineering jobs to be plentiful. If new hardware takes off, maybe we’ll see another growth wave like mobile.",

You know beforehand and you call them out when you see them coming. Giving stakeholders a heads up is good. No heads up when people are counting on you is really bad.\n\nIn general though it sounds like you just need to spend some time so be sure to get AI to summarize docs for you and help you with coding as well. This will limit the number of surprises but surprises always happen. If you never hit surprises then the scope of your work isn’t big enough for you and you’re ready for more challenging work. Not communicating changes in assumptions and no requirements that were found would be a problem but people will give some leeway to new developments that were discovered. \n\nProd issues? Everyone makes these mistakes. I caused one a few months back and even the most senior members of my team have done this too. Again if you haven’t done this then you haven’t worked enough or the scope of your work is too little. It happens to everyone. For these take charge and learn from them. Everyone makes these mistakes and can learn from them. \n\nI’m a manager turned IC again and I can say this: you want a good relationship with your manager too so play the political game. The manager is generally on your side because if you do well so does the manager. A lot of these issues can be communicated with the manager to help unblock you. \n\nCan’t give estimates right away? Yeah no one really can unless they’re super familiar with the subject matter. When your work becomes more ambiguous as your level goes up these can be more difficult. What I do is I give a large estimate (adding to my current estimate) or tell the people involved when I can provide an estimate and why I can’t I do it now.",

This sort of thing leads to security issues on the internet on a daily basis.\n\n\nI've been doing a personal project with [boost::spirit::x3](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/libs/spirit/doc/x3/html/index.html) to automate generation of cereal serialization functions, python and emscripten APIs for C++ code and once you get over the gratuitous operator overloading abuse common in many boost libraries, it's really nice to use. So at least on C/C++ projects, there really is no excuse to reach for a regex when you could rattle off a small and well-tested parser instead.\n\n\nemscripten is pretty nifty too. Someone compiled imgui to webasm with emscripten so you can just run your gui [in your browser.](https://www.dearimgui.com/webdemo/master/example_emscripten.html)",

You could also check out donnemartin/system-design-primer or binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability on GitHub for more patterns (but those can overwhelm you a bit - only do it if once you've got the basics down and i'd also recommend using GPT to identify the best ones based on your existing prep)\n\nAs for the E5 interview, I think you can totally ace it if you stay organized and consistent! Just set your constraints early, pick a clean baseline design, call out the obvious bottlenecks, and talk through how you'd scale or handle failures gracefully. If you've got time, running through a couple full mocks with that approach would definitely help (educative has those built in too).\n\nGood luck! You've got this!",

Split the monster PR into small slices with contract tests; pair each with a Flyway/Liquibase migration and rollback.\n\nI’ve used Hasura for fast read models on Postgres, Kong to centralize auth/rate limits on legacy endpoints, and DreamFactory to auto‑generate REST on ugly SQL so the frontend stops hand‑rolled queries.\n\nIf leadership won’t allow flags, canary, and sign‑offs, start interviewing.\n\nBottom line: document and gate the risks, ship behind flags with observability, and make incremental fixes instead of another big hack.",

Then I had kids, and had to immediately switch to a strict 9-5 schedule, no cheating on nights or weekends.\n\nMy career growth, in the sense of the pace of changing roles and levels, has slowed. And if that's what you mean, then yeah, it's harder -- but not impossible -- to be ambitious in that way.\n\nBut I still feel like I'm able to set ambitious goals within the constraints I have. It's just that the constraints are narrower, so what's \"ambitious\" is smaller.",

I started very similarly to you, doing QA automation at a large bank even though my role was officially Software Engineer. I built out the QA testing framework for cloud infra in my spare time, and the cloud infrastructure team liked it enough to take me in after a few months. I did that for a few years before hopping now to a backend role at a fintech. As long as you're building code and interview prepping, you just need a bit of luck and some years of experience under your belt, and enough code work to talk about in interviews.",

You are still in school hopefully so max out with all AP classes if you can so you can get all your math and general cs courses out the way.\n\nIf you want to build something build something through action and consistency, do not stop until you have actually made something.
