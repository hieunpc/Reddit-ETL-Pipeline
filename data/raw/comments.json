Often I would concede to a different design, and after some time the team would arrive at what dimensional modelling advises. E.g they wanted to mix detailed data with aggregated snapshots in one table. I did not wantnto argue. I said \"well Kimball advises against this because its trouble\" and let them build it. After some time they split the fact tables into transaction and aggregate.\n\nIt is not Kimball's ideas in the book, but experience of a wide industry practicioners over years of working with data. Now we have the cloud and storage is less limited. Our mental capacity still is limited, so it is easier to reason about facts and dimensions in separation, rather than a 100-column big table.\n\n...and what about many to many?",

Learn the Python fundamentals, and then build. Don’t beat yourself up about googling syntax, it’ll stick eventually. \n\nThere’s no substitute for building, and the only way to learn new ways is to read code.

Jupyter is a notebook that allows you to create cells that can be markdown, python code, or even R code. You can execute each cell individually or in order and create a whole program where the documentation, code, and results exist. Databricks uses these notebooks as scheduled tasks where you can code out an entire data pipeline and put the execution of the notebook on a schedule. Otherwise called an Orchestrator\n\nFrom here we can then introduce other resources we might need, like spark, which introduces spark data frames (a table) which then you can do transformations on the data using the spark infrastructure. It offers a way to process large amounts of data on multiple nodes with a ton of confidence that your job won't die. \n\nBut then what if your data is a bunch of little jobs that come in from multiple sources, then you might want to adopt a streaming service like Kafka or redis. Each one of your data sources can publish data to the stream, then you can set up spark to consume those messages to process it. Then you can set up a notebook that will check the stream for new data and fire off a new spark job to process the data, or just quit if there's no data available to process. The notebook could also take the results and handle uploading it to the database, or make a nice graph, or whatever you need it to do\n\nI could go on, but each one of those resources has a specific use that you should get familiar with. The first time you use them it will be difficult. The 50th time will not be so hard. If you have trouble try to make a flow chart where you will use each technology and keep the details high level.",

Only now they have to adhere to the product owners whims as to how they do things in the product, and how the product owner wants them to do ingestion etc. \n\nOf course this all happens in IT, and the business users who hold all of the business knowledge (how the data is used) are still outside of IT, and the datawarehouse people who could previously work with them directly are now no longer allowed to do so and have to prepare data that is WAY worse to work with for the analysts than what they had in the datawarehouse.",

We haven't implemented a data mesh, though we have talked about it. \n\nA lot of the teams organically adopted systems and contractors and do own their own data. But they aren't generally technical users and there was no governance or standards. And all the data became siloed. \n\nThe central DE team is working to unsilo the data. Our goal is to eventually create data standards and enforce them so the data is actually a good quality. This is a slow process, but I'm optimistic. \n\nThe central BI team does seem to have a problem with scale. At my company, most of the functional users don't have BI experts and can't use PBI - at least nowhere near the quality that the BI team does. However, the BI team moves quite slowly to produce the reporting. The result is that functional teams build their own custom, low governance, reporting off the centralized data out of necessity. By the time BI develops the right tools, the business doesn't need it anymore and doesn't want to switch. \n\nMy untested idea is to give the business access to easy to use cloud based dashboarding tools (like Sigma for example). Then BI provides support, underlying data models, and connectivity to non enterprise grade sources like SharePoint. \n\n\nIn short, decentralizing everything without governance cannot work. Centralizing everything without a plan to scale cannot work. A data mesh is the tightrope that attempts to balance this. It is probably the right answer, but the degree of decentralization depends on the company.",

There are plenty of tools, processing patterns, architectures, etc that are excellent if you have the ability, resources, and will to implement them. In reality, the vast majority of companies do not. \n\n\nThe key is to not throw out the baby with the bath water. For every “failed” implementation of Mesh, Agile, Hadoop, etc we’ve had through the years there has been incremental progress, evidenced by the plethora of options we have today to build data engineering stacks and teams to fit the different needs of companies. \n\n\nFor me, data mesh was indicative of a paradigm shift from the old school prescriptive warehouse to a modern democratization enabled and fueled by the cycle of real-world problem solving. Data warehouse, data mart, self serve bi, data lake, data mesh, lakehouse. It’s just an evolution of trying to solve the same(ish) problem. \n\n\nIn conclusion, use what serves you, throw away what doesn’t, take the labels and buzzwords with a grain of salt, and remember that ultimately you are always solving business problems, not data problems.",

We didn’t say we were implementing Data Mesh because few outside IT knew about it or understood it. Instead, our aim was to modernize the data platform, speed up delivery of technical solutions, and empower the business with self-service capabilities and less reliance on the IT organization.\n\nWe were successful in many areas while other elements remained a challenge. For example, we migrated the two largest data platforms from on-premises, self-hosted and managed servers, to native services in the public cloud. Later, we built “lakehouse” capabilities on top of the public cloud platform. These included data governance features, automated data security, and data domains built for key areas of the business such as human resources, marketing, supply chain, etc. The benefits were quite profound. Within the first 2 years we had empowered 50+ business teams. Between year 1 and year 2 we saw 500% growth in teams able to use their data and the platform to create things that matter. Business teams recognized improved decision-making across the enterprise, increased efficiency and cost savings, accelerated speed-to-value for data product creation, and secure data sharing between teams.\n\nWhile we experienced success, the challenges were many. Some teams thought the changes were just another fad IT came up with. Given their prior experiences they were honestly justified in thinking that. Other teams were interested but couldn’t get their leadership to buy in or they didn’t have enough technical chops to harness their domain data on their own. They continued to rely on central IT. Other business teams were so focused on their own projects and demands they simply couldn’t make the initial shift. They asked us to come back later. A thru line that helped in most situations was having clear executive leadership support (CIO, CEO, CDO, and others). They would knock down roadblocks where needed and help provide resources when we got stuck.\n\nAfter 3 years in the journey one thing was abundantly clear. Technology was not the largest challenge. People and culture were. It took tremendous energy to cast the vision and bring people and teams along with us. This required persistent communication with all business teams and clear demonstration of the value of public cloud through demos, pilots, and “soft releases” of products, apps, and services. The technical teams (platforms, cloud, data, security) all became storytellers if they weren’t already. \n\nTo this day I don’t call the transformation a “data mesh implementation.” But we certainly knew of and studied Data Mesh and sought to implement core principles it espoused: self-service, decentralized data domains/ownership, data governance, and a focus on data product creation within business teams.",

You need very clean, very well tagged, very well modelled data. The example I always give is that if you go to the table marked “sales” and count the number of sales…. That is not even remotely correct. Years of schema evolution, changes to products, and poor engineering mean the actual number is much harder to derive. \n\nFor conversational analytics, the prompts must be very carefully tuned and the AI will straight up invent things if you aren’t careful. I would not trust it in the least.\n\nFor the CoSQL model, I haven’t tried to use it, but I notice that solution architects are suggesting I use it rather than curating dbt so I can use that to control our transformation logic. In that regard, it’s a complete distraction and a massive net-negative.\n\n“We don’t have working data products” is the same problem we have had for years and it’s the same problem that will make AI tools harder to implement even if they are viable, but it’s far too unsexy an issue to attract attention.\n\nI am hoping that if I can make clear the dependency that AI has on working data products it might get me the resources and tooling I have needed all along.",

Since a lot of human knowledge is embedded in text, this gives us quite a good basis to create large langauge models that can mirror quite a bit of that knowledge. However, large language models are not very good at doing abstract reasoning on anything other than text, which includes a lot of the work you do as an analyst by traslating some fuzzy business logics to maths, at least for anything nontrivial beyond textbook problems. You may attempt to alleviate this somewhat by providing good metadata for context, but my experience is that this doesn't really solve the problem and i very much doubt this will improve untill we get a different class of models all together as the \"more data+larger models\" approach yields diminishing returns due to sublinear scaling of LLMs wrt. data and size.\n\nNote: you should take everything i say with a grain of salt, as i am a practitioner using LLMs and my formal training is in physics, not NLP.",

Metrics, joins, definitions, and edge cases have to be defined in dbt models, semantic views, or a metadata layer\n\nIf you don't, you run the inevitable risk of fluent nonsense from the LLM. (Variance will get you eventually)\n\n**2) A constrained query surface** (Especially important if you're giving the agent to end users)\n\nDon't let the model generate raw SQL and hope for the best.  \nRestrict it to: A verified query library / A constrained DSL / Parameterised patterns.  \nThis removes a huge amount of hallucination and makes failures actually diagnosable.\n\n**3) Feedback loop/flywheel**\n\n**This is** ***critical.***\n\nYou need traces of every input, generated query, and failure mode so you can see:\n\n* Where the semantic layer is missing context\n* Which inputs result in varied rather than consistent outputs (not reliable + potentially incorrect)\n* Where the agent is making the same wrong assumptions repeatedly\n\nWithout that loop, you cannot really improve the agent, but with it, you can patch gaps, clarify metrics, and improve the agent's ability over time.\n\nThat’s the main stuff people underestimate when they say “just add an agent”.\n\nFor full disclosure, I've ended up building this approach into a full product called Inconvo that helps teams develop their semantic layer and includes built-in query guardrails and feedback loop tracing.\n\nAlso, for those data engineering teams being asked to build this for customer-facing use cases (pretty common these days and a huge ask!) Inconvo has an API and integrations so data engineers can focus on data correctness instead of auth, UI, and other historically full-stack work.\n\n**Main take:**\n\nNone of this works without good old data engineering and well-modelled data; the agent just amplifies whatever assumptions you bake in.\n\nInterested to hear where others have hit the limits of this approach.",

We would not accept anything into our pipeline that failed the tests.\n\nThe vendor knew of any issues immediately without one of our team members having to be online to qa.\n\nTo implement, we basically kept track of what we expected the schema and checked the file against those expectations. If that passed, we loaded the data into Duckdb, ran our dbt source layer testing, then parsed the dbt results into something they could work with.

Then we use DB\\_SendMail function to the appropriate biz unit of the invalid data.\n\nHonestly, the code quality of SaaS and input forms have taken a serious nose dive since 2020's.

The key is to give the peers a heads up that you have a change that needs to be fast tracked before you start development so everybody in the chain of responsibilities are aware and ready to engage when development is complete.\n\nThe challenge you describe with merge conflicts should only happen if multiple people are working on the exact same file. If this is a common occurrence, you should understand why multiple people need to change the same file. Your code structure may need to be improved to separate a monolithic file into smaller individual files and rebuilt in runtime.\n\nAdditionally, having good branch hygiene is important. Don't keep reusing the same branch for all changes. Open a new branch for each change and prune orphaned branches. Every new change should be based on the current state of Prod so the resulting PR should only be the specific change you are trying to make. Once the PR is merged, you should delete the branch. If a new change is needed, create a new branch. This also lets you more easily abandon a bad change during dev (delete the branch) and start over if necessary.",

I had a F500 client recently with ballooning storage costs and we were able to save *millions* of dollars annually from this alone. \n   * You should basically always be saving files as Delta+Parquet, and never CSV, CSV.GZIP, etc. \n   * Try to avoid tiny files. If you need to, regularly compact your data.\n* A few pipeline design tips:\n   * You always want to be minimizing shuffles. A few ways to achieve this:\n      * Join on partitioned keys when possible If one dataset in your join is very small, use a broadcast join (`df.join(F.broadcast(df2)...)`) \n   * Avoid unnecessary distinct or sorting actions  \n   * Perform your filtering as upstream as possible If you have inefficient partitions (e.g. way to much data within a certain key), you may have data skew causing some of your longer running jobs) \n   * By the way, you should be using partitions, especially if you have jobs that only query data for a specific time frame (e.g. partitioning by day or month\\_year) \n   * Try to incrementally process your data as much as possible, rather than doing full re-writes Generally, try to search for redundancies\n\nSpark is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot. In fact it happened often enough on my teams that I ended up making an open source tutorial site to help my teammates ramp up on this stuff. It's accessible at [sparkmadeeasy.com](http://sparkmadeeasy.com), maybe it could be a helpful reference!",

Snowflake is like that modern car, where under the hood you can only fill up washer fluid and maybe add oil. \n\nThe marketing tells you don't worry, you don't need to care, it will never break down... But it does. Silently. No proper warnings and no way to fix.\n\nWith Redshift we had collection of system queries, some custom tools and that allowed to notice, fix all of the common problems. With Snowflake we have stupid cases like OpenCatalog reaching rate limit, not giving any proper error and crashing whole Iceberg ingestion pipeline. Way to monitor? Raise support ticket and wait. \n\nWe have somewhere around 400 iceberg tables, Snowflake has integration to it, but it needs to constantly run metadata refresh, otherwise users will query old data. And if there's ANY kind of hickup during refresh, it just stores json with error on system query, stops all of the auto refreshes on that table. No alerts, no way to see it apart from tracking timestamps of every table yourself and alerting on delays. Or running special system query which shows that error, but with two caveats:\n- you cannot automate and run it on service account. Need to manually query with actual user\n- there's no way for bulk check. You need to run table by table\n\nTL; DR; from marketing perspective they are doing good job and are successful. From engineering standpoint - there's pile of hidden issues and you as a user cannot do much about them",

Microsoft has the free SQL Server Express for OLTP - perfect for staging area - 10 gig limit per database - so have a DB per source and ingest, you'll have 2 cpu peformance and decent ram usage (16g I think, check Microsoft's web page).\n\nSo what's nice with SQL Server Express is it plays nice with your AD and talks easily to other MSSQL systems, so you can avoid flat files when flat files don't make sense.\n\nIf you want history of all changes, without the hassle of CDC, flat files on a massive file share dedicated for this, you basically emulate a datalake. If this file share system is Linux, there's probably Datalake compatible open-source you can use so you can do SELECT directly on the CSV/Json/XML flat files, just like a real cloud datalake. But I haven't done it - I'm sure someone here has.\n\nIn any case, Google Big Query and even Azure Datalake are not expensive. Probably on-par with dedicated hardware costs internally adding a 4TB mirrored fileshare system, when costed and budgeted over 36 months.\n\nIt depends on CAPEX versus OPEX, your boss should know this.

The article explains these well. Key concept here is loading only what you need to, making it useful in situations where the amount of data is very large and/or compute is a concern.\n\nA key thing to understand would be is\\_icremental(), which is a function which will return True if the model it is being applied in *already exists* in the warehouse (and is also an incremental model which is not running in full-refresh)\n\nThat means anything wrapped within is\\_incremental() won’t be applied the first time you run a model, or when you fully refresh it.\n\nThis is what you use to compare existing records in your target with your source so you only load the new and/or updated records, depending on your strategy.\n\nYou can also flip that and use NOT is\\_incremental(), meaning that what you wrap it around will only run the first time the model is built (or on full refreshes). That could for example be if you have some old stale data that you need to union with on the first run, but then never need to look at again, except for the case of a full refresh.\n\nEDIT: For some clarity, heres an example of an incremental model from dbt docs.\n\nIf this model has never been run before, or needs to be fully refreshed (reloaded) then `{% if is_incremental() %}` will evaluate to false, meaning that the SQL it wraps wont be sent to the warehouse. That makes sense, since `{{ this }}` will be rendered as the incremental models name. Hard to do a select from something that doesnt exist yet right? We need to compare event\\_time in source with what we have loaded before, which we cant do if we've never loaded it.\n\nOnce we've loaded data for the first time, the if statement will evaluate to true, meaning the WHERE clause gets put into effect. Then the models SQL will return results using that filtering, and that's what ends up getting inserted into the target table in your DWH.\n\n    {{\n        config(\n            materialized='incremental'\n        )\n    }}\n    \n    select\n        *,\n        my_slow_function(my_column)\n    \n    from {{ ref('app_data_events') }}\n    \n    {% if is_incremental() %}\n    \n      -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run\n      -- (uses >= to include records whose timestamp occurred since the last run of this model)\n      -- (If event_time is NULL or the table is truncated, the condition will always be true and load all records)\n    where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} )\n    \n    {% endif %}",

        "body": "There’s actually a few things to be concerned with. One issue is making sure you are dealing with the proper timestamp. A lot of the examples in this space gloss over this aspect. For high water mark incremental processing you want to drive off of the timestamp representing the moment the record was written in your data warehouse/lakehouse/dbt. You do not want to rely on the application timestamp or the timestamp generated by your source system for incremental processing. For the purposes of this conversation, let’s assume `table_a` and `table_b` both represent this in a column named `dbt_updated_ts`.\n\nAnother concern is persisting these timestamps in your target model. You will need to decide on `table_a.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_a_dbt_updated_ts` and `table_b.dbt_updated_ts` as `table_b_dbt_updated_ts` or doing something like `least(table_a.dbt_updated_ts, table_b.dbt_updated_ts) as source_dbt_updated_ts`. Regardless of the decision, you should *also* re-state a `dbt_updated_ts` for downstream consumers of your model. They should *not* look at your various source timestamps for incremental processing, only your new `dbt_updated_ts`\n\nAnd this is where the rub comes in. Now you have 2 sources with 2 different timestamps and you need to process them incrementally. A comprehensive way of doing this would be to take all the keys above the high water mark in source a and union with the keys above the high water mark in source b, union the keys together, then use that to scan both tables again to make sure you catch all the changes. Generally this is computationally expensive, although it should give the correct answer.\n\nIf you are doing this to create something like a SCD type-2 dimension it gets more complicated on top of this, as you will now need to deal with the temporal aspects of your source system as well.\n\nI would warn you of this: if someone says add a lookback window, that is usually to cover some architectural sin. This should be questioned.\n\nIt’s complicated and often computationally expensive to process multiple upstreams in an incremental fashion. Do not forget the maintenance cost: next month you will have an engineer who thinks they are clever and will mess with this logic and it may be ok for most cases but not certain edge cases. KISS. If you can, just materialize any model with multiple upstreams as `table` and save yourself the headache. Again, single-model HWM incremental is perfectly fine, it’s when you attempt to incremental more than one model at once where you will find pain.",

We still keep the same fields and everything.\n\nIn this example, the first time we run the model, the first incremental macro will return false, because the model deosnt exist in our target dwh yet. The second macro will return true, since the target table doesnt exist yet. So then we will run the main query, and then union in the old data.\n\nOn every subsequent run, the first macro will return true, and the second one false. So on all future runs, we will be filtering data from the new system, and disregarding the old one entirely, since no new data is being generated there.\n\nSo we wrap SQL we want to compile and send to the warehouse depending on the context in which the model is running. In practice I've only used this to wrap a WHERE (most common), CTE's or UNIONs. You can also include multiple wrapped statements as below, for example we might apply an incremental macro inside our CTE's in order to make the model more performant. I find it hard to imagine a scenario where you would wrap it around a join.\n\n    {{\n        config(\n            materialized='incremental'\n        )\n    }}\n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from {{ ref('app_data_events_from_new_system') }}\n    \n    \n    {% if is_incremental() %}\n    \n        where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from {{ this }} )\n    \n    \n    {% endif %}\n    \n    \n    {% if not is_incremental() %}\n    \n        union \n    \n        select\n            customer_id,\n            period,\n            total_sales\n        from  {{ ref('app_data_events_from_old_system') }}\n    \n    \n    {% endif %}\n\nThis means that the compiled SQL will look like one of these 2 (excluding all of the DML that dbt builds in order to actually insert the data into the target table):\n\n    -- FIRST RUN RESULTS IN \n    \n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system\n    \n    \n    \n        union \n    \n    \n        select\n            customer_id,\n            period,\n            total_sales\n        from  old_db.old_schema.app_data_events_from_old_system\n    \n    \n    -- SUBSEQUENT RUNS RESULT IN\n    \n    \n    select\n        customer_id,\n        period,\n        total_sales\n    from new_db.new_schema.app_data_events_from_new_system\n    \n    \n    where event_time >= (select coalesce(max(event_time),'1900-01-01') from target_db.target_schema.target_table_with_app_data_from_both_source_systems)",

        "body": "Last paragraph imo is the big one. I have hardly met any coworkers that understand the problems that come with incrementals involving multiple tables. This means all of the incrementals they've built involving multiple tables are impossible to reproduce from scratch because those incremental tables are not being updated correctly. Had an entire database in a previous company where they would have to regularly refresh all of the datasets because of this and it would sometimes crash in the process. Absolute mess.\n\nFor me, because I have the skillsets to do so, I pretty much prefer to stay away from any sort of incremental involving multiple tables and use table materializations like you mention unless I 1) really need it and 2) can implement it in a more generic way rather than a custom incremental model. More generic being something like a custom materialization or macro. For example, we have an incremental materialization that checks counts of the source query vs the incremental table by the incremental timestamp to load deltas. This makes the actual SQL in the DBT model involve no incremental logic and makes the DBT model robust to source data that sometimes updates some historical data instead of only inserting new data. If this scenario had been implemented as a basic DBT append-only incremental model (which it was before it got refactored), then the data would not match reporting from the source system.\n\nThe example I gave speaks to another problem that goes beyond what you bring up (engineer that thinks they're being smart). There's also the problem that often times engineers will develop something with some assumption for how it's going to work in their mind. \"Oh, well we should only get new data for this process every day.\" This is only sometimes true. I've worked at multiple companies and every company has had at least a couple of processes you might expect to work that way but don't for business or engineering reasons. For example, if you have a DBT model that involves updates from multiple tables, what happens if table A is updated later than table B? Then on the next run, you may have to update your incremental on late-arriving data from table A + historical data from table B, which leads to historical updates in your table. Of course, there's other ways to implement these things, but by no means trivial in my experience.",

This can provide a significant edge to performance.\n   * Configuring your database to support query parallelism is also critical at volume.\n   * Database constraints are just as important in OLAP as they are in OLTP - and postgres can provide a ton of value here!

I *have* had occasions where it wasn't a big deal for me to simply recreate a table with whatever corrections were required.  Unless you're dealing with something huge, and your problem is truly that much of a problem, you could do that.  Where I've felt the need to do this, I'm aided a bit by us using external tables, generally.",

When a migration messes up something as basic as column order, it *sounds* trivial but it actually creates a ton of friction for anyone who has to explore or visually scan the data. Views are a workaround, but maintaining a separate view for every table is definitely unnecessary tech debt, especially if you're the only one owning this now.\n\nIf you can safely re-migrate and recreate the tables with the correct column order, ideally in a temporary schema first so you can compare row counts, types, and dependencies, it's a reasonable thing to fix. The biggest risk isn't Databricks itself, it's any downstream job that might break if it's doing something like `SELECT *` and assuming positions. As long as you map those out, the operational risk is pretty low.\n\nSo no, you're not crazy. You're just trying to clean up someone else's shortcuts.\n\n(Also, one of my ex colleagues ran into similar issues at work, their team uses Rakuten SixthSense for data observability, which helped catch this kind of schema drift early.)",

If you have bespoke code, maybe look at a load framework like DLT. Is the framework any better, or do you like having more control over the process?\n\nSave your raw data to a more modern file format with proper data types (e.g. Parquet, AVRO) - do you need to do any transformation on the source data to make it fit? Are there any unexpected issues with the data that you have to handle?\n\nLoad your data into a local database, either directly from source or from your raw files. Then you can start running proper SQL queries against your data and get some practice with querying databases in general. DuckDB comes to mind, it's powerful and lightweight with good support across many languages.\n\nDo some transformations on the data - consider cleansing data quality issues, perhaps normalising the structure, or transforming it into a better shape for Data Science modelling. You could do this with some bespoke code, or look into transformation tools like dbt or SQLMesh.\n\nBuild some visualisations of the data to build more of a story around the data than just raw values.\n\nIn each case, try out multiple tools. If you're using Pandas, consider trying Polars or Ibis, or leveraging DuckDB's APIs. What do you like about each one? What do you dislike? Even if you're achieving the same goals with each, its good to get a feel for the differences in each tool and form your own opinion.",

Another fun angle is building a small dashboard that shows constellation level trends, like altitude decay or clustering by inclination.

It’s not meant to solve every problem, but if a company constantly brings in new data sources or its existing schemas change several times a year, and it still needs clean, consistent data to work with, Data Vault fits that situation very well.\n\nRecently I was Data Architecting in a project, where Data Vault was the solution to the client’s issues. A mid-sized company running an HR platform had thousands of clients but a small internal team, so they relied on many external tools: onboarding, contracts, bookkeeping, payments, their main app, and several new systems planned for the next year. Each tool had its own user table (some even had several users tables), and none of them matched. If you ran count(*) on each system’s user table, you got different numbers every time. Each system stored different pieces of information. Analysts didn’t know which database had the data they needed. Even when they found the right one, joining across systems caused rows to disappear, so they couldn’t trust anything.\n\nData Vault solved this cleanly. We created a single Hub_User table that lists every user across all systems. For each subsystem, we added a satellite tables that hold the columns coming from each system. Everything is connected using the same hash key, so joins always work the same way. Analysts now start from Hub_User, and they know exactly where each system’s data lives. Nothing gets lost during joins. When the company adds another tool next year, the team will only need to add one more satellite, and none of the existing reports will break.\n\nThis kind of constant change is normal in real data environments, and DV is a design pattern for that. \n\nI would say that it’s definitely not for newbies and requires discipline. But it’s true for all design patterns :)",

        "body": "This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully you find this useful. There's actually a lot to your question.\n\nWhen it comes to designing a mart, I keep the \"analyst\" persona in mind as much as possible. This is my north star, even if I don't have analysts. Querying a star should be simple, not something full of odd case logic, analytic queries, coalesces, and the deep SQL knowledge. Save that for your transformations leading up to the star if needed.\n\nRegarding keys specifically, there are several goals I have when designing a mart. From the perspective of the \"analyst\" persona querynig the star:\n\n1. Joins (dims to facts) should be done with `INNER JOIN` not `OUTER JOIN` - this is for performance and for usability\n2. No records should be dropped via join - this is a quality issue, you should not be dropping revenue on the floor because your users dimension is incomplete or late for example\n3. Join conditions should be singular (e.g. no `AND` in join clause) in nature - this is again for performance and usability\n\nThe ideal query would look something like this:\n\n    SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name\n    FROM fct_sales AS f\n    INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d\n    ON f.customer_sk = d.customer_sk\n    GROUP BY d.customer_name\n\nThese goals need to be addressed in concert. To do so, you really need a lookup process instead of a hashing strategy.\n\nIn order to address 1 and 2, you really need to have placeholder records in your dimension for \"unknown\", \"missing\" or \"not applicable\" customers, and your fact table creation needs to use these values as appropriate. You cannot hash your way out of this problem; you need to process your dimension (or at least your dimension lookup) first, and then process your facts. Generally this is done with a lookup table. \n\nFor item 3 in isolation of 1 and 2, if your dimension is SCD type-1 from a single system then using the source system natural key seems reasonable. Once you have multiple source systems (say, customers from 2 systems) then the natural progression is to either add a `source_system` column and make sure everyone remembers to join on that as well (hint: they won't) or to concatenate your source system with the natural key. This concatenation leaves you with a string key instead of an integer key which now negatively impacts query performance.\n\nIf your dimension is SCD type-2, it's worse. You are left with something looking like this, which is not obvious to analysts, performs poorly, and is error prone:\n\n    SELECT SUM(f.revenue) AS revenue, d.customer_name  \n    FROM fct_sales AS f  \n    INNER JOIN dim_customer AS d  \n    ON f.customer_nk = d.customer_nk\n    AND f.transaction_ts BETWEEN d.begin_effective_ts AND d.end_effective_ts\n    GROUP BY d.customer_name  \n\nUsability note: Is it `BETWEEN` or did you do the right thing and make your `end_effective_ts` the same moment as the next `begin_effective_ts`? I can almost guarantee your analysts will either use `BETWEEN` or worse they won't consider the effective dates at all and `DISTINCT` the result set to get what they want. Honestly, it's doubtful that future engineers will remember which way you went with effective dates either. All the more reason to address this in your transformation while building the mart instead of leaving it to the mart consumers to remember.\n\nTo achieve goal 3 with SCD type-2, you want to put a SK on the fact that represents the state of the dimension at a point in time (probably the moment of transaction). To do this you will also need a lookup, as you cannot hash your way out of this either.\n\nAt this point it should be clear that lookups are the way to go. So the real question is why would you want a hash instead of an integer? To me, the answer is now obvious: integers take next to zero compute to calculate, will join more efficiently, have half a chance at clustering in a meaningful way, and are immune to collision.\n\nTL;DR integer lookups",

That is how I got started with understanding how to work with Docker. :) \n\nThere is an example here that adds a minio + postgres container (and the Airflow connections to those are in the .env\\_example file): [https://github.com/astronomer/ebook-etl-elt/blob/main/docker-compose.override.yml](https://github.com/astronomer/ebook-etl-elt/blob/main/docker-compose.override.yml) \n\nThe Astro CLI will spin up these extra containers too when you run \\`astro dev restart\\`. \n\nDisclaimer: I work at Astronomer who created the Astro CLI and wrote the repo I linked.",

You can do this today by validating instances against v1 and v2 schemas at the same time. If ypou work with Python, there are two simple command line tools for validation that are part of the \"json-structure\" package: \n\n    # Validate a schema file\n    json-structure-check schema.json\n    \n    # Validate an instance against a schema\n    json-structure-validate instance.json schema.json\n\nFrom a lifecycle perspective, you use schemas either where you produce data to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules AND/OR at the consumer end to ensure that it conforms to a set of rules. In code and databases, that structure manifests in column declarations or typed fields, and having a neutral data definition language that comes with \"polyglot\" tooling and know many languages and database table schema dialects is therefore helpful for data structures and data to not get lost in translation.\n\nI have very successfully used the specs as instruction files with LLMs (e.g. Copilot) so when you want to infer a schema from existing data structures with the spec in the context, you often get very good results, and from there you are on a type safe path. I wrote teh spec such that teh LLMs would be doing good with it, for instance, by having examples for all constructs.",

Our approach builds context, aware extraction that adapts to diverse formats, so your adapters don’t have to be reinvented for every vendor. It also supports traceability by capturing how data is extracted, which can complement your audit logs and validation steps.\n\nIf you’re exploring faster ways to scale across formats while preserving accuracy, I’d love to share how a highlight, and, label workflow could reduce rework and keep your pipeline maintainable.

We’re not trying to recreate a human analyst doing open-ended exploration (yet). We’re aiming for safe, repeatable workflows first..  the stuff that’s painful today because it’s frequent + operational (support, RevOps, CSM, finance ops), not really deep research or exploration. \n2. Dashboards are great when questions are known and stable. Agents get interesting when the question is variable but still bounded, e.g. “why did churn risk spike for these 20 accounts?”, “summarize anomalies by segment”, “draft an escalation note with the relevant context,” etc. The way we're thinking is that these sandboxed, curated views/tools are guardrails - the agent still does the synthesis + narrative + next-step suggestions.\n3. We’re also treating schema exploration as a separate (higher risk) capability. I agree that to do real analyst work, you probably need: semantic layer + table relationships + multi-turn exploration. But letting an LLM roam your warehouse is also where we foresee getting: cost blowups, accidental joins into sensitive tables, hallucination and more. One more reason we’re starting constrained: **repeatability.** For some of the agent tasks we're aiming for, it’s almost mandatory for teams to yield the same answer for the same/similar questions (or at least the same underlying definition/query) every time. So our plan for now is: **start constrained → earn trust → expand surface area (curated views + sandboxing allows us to do that)** ideally with a semantic layer + policy checks as the expansion path. \n\nIf you tried doing this in prod: how are you handling this tradeoff? Do you allow wide read access and rely on RLS/RBAC + logging, or do you gate it behind a semantic model / query planner / allowlists?",

Those are the level of questions i was thinking of when I mentioned needing schema exploration and multi turn deep research.\n\nThe only approach I'm using in 'prod' is stuff that heavily depends on a human in the loop. What I've experimented more with is snowflake's 'cortex' ecosystem which allows you to do RBAC on curated views with semantic layers. It's still in the data warehouse environment but the agents can only access those curated views. What I found with this though was that I couldn't answer questions on the level of what you are describing very well, which is why I think if it's ever gonna work a much more flexible approach is needed.",

Maintaining data integrity and reliability at scale across platforms can be a very tough challenge, especially with any reasonable volume. All that to say: you're right that it's a real and difficult problem to solve.\n\nI'm biased (I'm one of the founders of Prequel, where we do something similar to what you're talking about), but hopefully I can also be pretty helpful on the topic -- let me know if there are any questions I can help with.\n\nAlso, the Pontoon team put together a helpful feature comparison matrix among the players in the market (though they recently discontinued work on the project): [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon?tab=readme-ov-file#pontoon-vs-other-etl--reverse-etl-platforms)",

For pipelines like this that have been stable for decades, the biggest risk is changing logic that no one fully remembers the edge cases for.\n\nWhat I’ve seen work better in similar situations is a phased approach. Keep the Pro C transformations intact initially by containerizing or running them in a controlled environment, then focus on validating inputs and outputs aggressively. Once you have parity and confidence in the data, you can start peeling off pieces of the transformation logic incrementally instead of all at once.\n\nModernizing is valuable, but preserving correctness first usually buys you time and reduces risk, especially when the business depends on this pipeline behaving exactly the same way it has for years.",

        "body": "All excellent questions.\n\n1. Cost and speed - I’m in the process of running benchmarks against progressively larger databases. So far, I’m seeing a maximum 10% overhead in storage for the VCS on the database. Cost is dependent on your architecture, but if we’re going with Aurora RDS, it’s dependent on IOPS. This solution uses Copy-on-Write, so there is an increase in IOPS over just running against production, but less than simply copying all the data. Since it’s also delta-based, the IOPS are only upserts, but those are ran twice (once on the branch, once on the merge into main).\n\n2. Difference with Git - generally, you don’t store data in Git outside of small test sets. This is a branch that essentially allows you to run your code in production without ever actually touching production. You connect to the same database, so you don’t need to modify your connection (beyond minor branch variables with can be set via environment). Subsetting your data can result in edge case failures since a subset by definition doesn’t include every case. \n\n3. Blame - you can track blame for every record, every column and row, every constraint just by querying rather than digging into the CDC or building a proper SCD pipeline. \n\n4. Silver bullet solution - that right there is the reason behind this post. I want genuine feedback from the community. I have worked at several jobs where this would be incredibly useful, but that’s only my limited experience. I know there are other, more targeted solutions for the various problems. I wanted to get a sense of others’ experiences to see if this addresses a genuine broad need, or if it’s overkill for the majority of problems. \n\nOne issue I’ve faced constantly is the introduction of bad data into the production database via improperly structured code which might look fine in git but fails in weird ways when applied to the entire database. This allows you to not just review a PR of the code, but also a PR of the data changes at the same time.",

We even help write test cases for them in some cases. We also have dev data flow into our data lake so we can validate and iterate dev data before production so it doesn’t break or mess anything up.\n\nThis has taken a while to get into strong place for a lot of teams such as buy in from stakeholders, value output and context around what the code does so we can advise on the change, especially around the logger and implementation.\n\nFor the case of having it tied to git sounds interesting, but we are large org, hundreds of repos and already well defined process for releasing code changes (not necessarily tied to data) so to add have the data change linked to PR would be difficult I think for us to introduce as the there’s a lot of teams, infrastructure and processing for us to validate. \n\nWays we have gone to improve the feedback loop is to get the data show back to people as possible. So getting dev data back, tools to view logs as interactions happen and pushing to be advisors/partners on the logging side. Also running QA checks and validation on dev data to catch drift early has been a massive help to catch things. This is generally through strict types like struct types in spark or pydantic etc\n\nThis generally means data engineers try to partner with teams for a log change and setting guidelines and docs on best practices to follow for teams to be self serve. Once a change is implemented, DEs integrate and transform data for other downstream teams and analysts to consume.\n\nDefinitely not a perfect solution, but has worked well for us. \n\nStarting over tomorrow, would I consider a data vcs? Maybe as a trial to experiment but probably not. Data is generally later phase concern when building a product/service unless the data is your product, but usually not the case.\n\nHaving had to built a service for users and already a key stakeholder of the logging implementation, time spent on data logging was tough to prioritize as needed something built and out the door and made more sense to do after release as a follow up.\n\nHaving typed structure really has been the biggest help. Working with developers, have a well defined data type not only helps data products but also helps developers to work with. This means everyone is all largely speaking the same “language” and centralizes the source of truth like what a data vcs brings",

They help to simplify the design of asynchronous systems where you send a lot of time waiting on network traffic, disk reads, or user input.  Async does not run anything in parallel, and you will not see any performance improvements from in; in fact, overuse of async methods in tight loops can significantly harm performance due to the added overhead of the event queue.\n\nPart of why async design is popular in Python and JavaScript is because threads really suck in those languages.  The existence of the global interpreter lock in Python <3.14 severely limits how well threads can perform, and worker threads are a huge pain to manage in JavaScript.  There's much less incentive to use async in languages where threads are efficient and the language has good thread management mechanisms.",

        "body": "So, let me tell ye about the old timey times.\n\nWhat we used to do is load pages in serial. Request came in, and as we processed the page, we'd make database requests, wait for the response, build more page, do more requests, etc. Not great. If you had a long loading page, it might takes 20 seconds or more to load.\n\nSo we got async. Async was cool because now when a request comes in, I serve you a template and give you some URLs in my API to query. Each makes its own specific action and on completion does something else. Page loads in 0.5s, most of your data is there in <1s, and that one long 15-second query stalling out the old page eventually loads in when ready. Great!\n\nHowever, we ended up with edge cases. Your page loads a complex tab that needs data from 5 dynamic drop-downs that it also has to load data for. That's 5 requests that all get triggering in serial using async or .thens (aka callback hell), or you could hope for the best and occasionally end up with a race condition and a failed load.\n\nSo we got promises. Honestly, for >90% of use cases, it just improved handling with then, catch, finally, etc. But it also enabled us to use Promise.all where we could cleanly write code, where we could call some nonsense like:\n\n    function foo() {\n      Promise.all([\n        getUserDropdownData(),\n        getCityDropdownData(),\n        getStateDropdownData(),\n        getDepartmentDropdownData(),\n        getSomeOtherData()\n      ])\n      .then(values => { //doesn't execute until all of the above data is loaded\n        const [userData, cityData, statedata, deptData, otherData] = values;\n        buildUserDataDropdown(userData);\n        buildCityDataDropdown(cityData);\n        buildStateDataDropdown(stateData);\n        buildDeptDataDropdown(deptData);\n        buildOtherDataDropdown(otherData);\n      })\n      .then(() => { //doesn't execute until we're done building all the dropdowns\n        refreshTableData(); //...might have to add a 1ms timeout to grab default values accurately\n      })\n    }\n    /* disclaimer, I half tested this real quick with timeouts, may or may not work, example only */\n\nYou would literally be tearing your eyes out to do that without promises; I'm talking 3-4x that many lines of code to sync all of it up. Also, with overhead, you might be waiting \\~200ms for each request, so your drop-downs load in \\~220ms instead of \\~1000ms. Now we can cleanly make those requests in parallel without fear of race conditions, and request our table data even faster.\n\nWe also got web workers; because Javascript is single-threaded it just executes whatever is at the top of the stack. If I have to do something that counts to...1 billion, that'll block the top of the stack while it counts, locking the rest of the page. If I assign it to a worker, the worker gets a separate thread from my main JS thread to do its task.\n\nAnd that's all I'm gonna say because I took way too long typing this.",

Multithreading can.\n\n> Are async/event-driven models actually better for most scalable backends?\n\nAsync is just a way to have a suspendable function. For backend, the theory is that we spend a lot of time waiting for slow IO. OS-provided threads tend to be heavyweight (e.g. every thread reserves memory for its call stack, and that tends to be O(MB) for each thread). So using them just to wait for slow IO is wasteful. If we instead move all that into userspace, we can avoid a lot of that overhead.\n\n> Or is this more about developer experience than performance?\n\nIt's both, although async/await also has some downsides (mainly [the function coloring problem](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)). Some languages / runtimes (like Erlang, Go, and Java) manage to avoid the function coloring problem.\n\n> A lot of blogs and talks make it sound like classic multithreading (threads, locks, shared state) is something people are actively trying to avoid\n\nI maintain that async is susceptible to many of the same issues that multithreaded code is susceptible to, but at a more coarse-grained level. If you have shared data that is being operated on by two in-flight `async` calls, then they will interleave with each other in unpredictable ways. You still want tools to e.g. block one async function from resuming while a different async function is busy updating some shared data.\n\nBecause async/await has well-defined preemption points, you're not going to have a single memory location that is being read from and written to at the same time. But you _could_ be in the middle of updating a complex structure. Perhaps it's in an inconsistent state, but you need to call an async function before you can put it back in a consistent state. That's basically the same problem that exists in classical threading, with the same solution - you want something like a mutex.\n\nThere's a reason that Go and Java (with virtual threads) both have mutex types, despite both supporting colorless async. Even then, you are encouraged to use higher-level tools if you can. But sometimes, you just need a mutex.",

Take the following as an example loophole. The common SQL injection came from login pages, meaning the application would accept a username and password from the end user, then will check the database for matching records.\n\nAn example of a poor and vulnerable way to handle the input / login process would be something like\n\n`Select TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = '{input.username}' AND Password = '{input.password}';`\n\nthen accepting the record returned as the 'authenticated' user. Now, lets look at how the resulting query would work for a normal input as well as a malicious input. Lets say I put in \"John@Doe.com\" as the username and \"RubberDucky\" as the password. The application would pass the following to the database\n\n`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'John@Doe.com' AND Password = 'RubberDucky'`\n\nfair enough, now what happens if i put in a username of \"Admin';--\"? The application would pass the following \n\n`SELECT TOP(1) * FROM Users WHERE UserName = 'Admin';-- ' AND Password = 'RubberDucky';`\n\nThe database will return the first user that has the username of \"Admin\" and consider it to be authenticated because ' will finish my string input, \";\" would terminate the SQL command, and \"--\" comments out the rest to prevent any kind of syntax errors.  \n  \nthat is just a very basic example. Another example i found in production (i work for this company and had permission) was they created an API that would allow you to pass in a SQL query to generate custom reports and such (HORRIBLE IDEA btw). To make it \"secure\" they used pattern matching and prevented commands like \"UPDATE\", \"DELETE\", \"\\*\", etc. So as a proof of concept, i encoded my query in b64 and passed in a query that would decode and execute it to create tables, dump SQL user names, dump stored CC info, etc. I have also seen  people do it in HEX\n\n  \nOnce you start spotting potential holes like this, the possibilities are endless as to what you can do. Here is how you might be able to get the server credentials from a SQL injection \n\n[https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478](https://medium.com/@markmotig/how-to-capture-mssql-credentials-with-xp-dirtree-smbserver-py-5c29d852f478)",

The front end then sends the name to the back end to retrieve the stats.\n\nLet's say the backend does an SQL query on the database like \"SELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = '$name'\".\n\nNormally this works great.  But what if I type the following:\n\nRobert'; DROP TABLE Students;\n\nNow the SQL query on the backend looks like this:\n\nSELECT \\* FROM Students WHERE Name = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE Students;\n\nWhen that is executed, it will search for Robert in the database, and then it will wipe all the data out.\n\nOf course you can do more advanced things other than deleting stuff in the database.  You can add other queries to try to extract more information than the website would otherwise allow.  You can probe the database for other tables, like maybe asking if there is a list of credit card numbers.  You can get really fancy like querying to see if any columns start with the letter \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" and so on, and if you do enough of those queries you can reconstruct the schema for the database and discover all sorts of interesting things.\n\nI wrote a simple website one that had a shell injection vulnerability.  It was a great way to learn, and I felt really dumb when someone pointed it out to me, but I'm super glad they did!  Using a similar attack against my website, someone could have executed arbitrary shell script code on the backend as the www user.  I learned the value of always aggressively sanitizing my inputs.",

If the backend also only uses interfaces to other system, then it's no an sql based attack. However, if the other system is vulnerable then maybe the injection happens there. And that's where the application has access to the database. It uses a pool of connections that will just execute any command you give it. You can make it so that certain commands are not allowed, like dropping tables, but modifying data and reading data your are not supposed to might still be possible. \n\n>how are they able to get data returned from a database with their query if they are not an authenticated user to the database\n\nThe application is authenticated. \n\n>and how would they even know what to inject into the SQL database to get what they want\n\nThey often don't. But they can guess. Often there's a table called \"users\" or \"user\" and it has columns, such as \"name\", \"email\", \"password\" etc. That's why it's hacking. They just \"hack\" until it works. \n\n> this is purely educational because I honestly don't understand it?\n\nThere are many books about this. You really have to see how 90ies PHP websites were made to understand how insecure it all was.   \n  \nNote that it's only possible in very old libraries that let you just create strings containing sql queries that you then execute. Wo now use templates and make sure that user input is checked and always passed as a certain type (string, number, date etc). You can't just pass \"1' AND 1;  --\" and have it be inserted into \"select \\* from users where username = '%s' password = '%s'\". And we salt and has the passwords, if there even are any. But some people are idiots and think it's ok to use 20 year old libraries and not do anything for security. Then it's easy. Others use modern frameworks and even they can have vulnerabilities. But it's not as easy as it was back then.",

However, if you have to stop at certain points to look up how to do a certain API call, or to look up how a certain algorithm works, etc. then to me this is just like stopping to look up a good word to use in a dictionary or thesaurus, something which I regularly do when writing prose in my own mother tongue (e.g. in order to find a better word or to avoid repeating certain words too often, in order to expand my own vocabulary in my mother tongue, etc.).",

I think it's difficult for a true beginner to have met those criteria, though certainly not impossible.\n\nSo maybe just consider starting small. Find a project you're interested in, build it, mess with it, read the docs, etc. After you've done that you can decide if you want to try to contribute.

You’re also gonna have to go through code review, which can be both good (for learning) and bad (for actually getting your work accepted).\n- Your PRs are more likely to get shot down because your code doesn’t meet the project’s standards.\n- Established communities can be harder to break into. Gaining people’s appreciation and respect will take lots of time and work.\n\nI can’t say what’s best for you, but I gained a lot out of contributing to larger projects as a beginner. The key is to make small contributions and not rock the boat. Godot Engine was a great project for me because I am also a user of it, and it’s super modular so you can change parts of an individual subsystem without breaking anything else. When in doubt, give it a shot. The worst thing that can happen is you get chewed out by a maintainer for writing bad code.",

I do 15 minutes of focused work, then 3 minutes of literally whatever my brain wants (scroll Reddit, watch a YouTube short, whatever). The key is setting a timer for BOTH. Your brain learns it can have the dopamine hit soon, so it's easier to focus. Gradually increase the work interval as you build the habit.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Treat debugging like a video game:\\*\\* ADHD brains love puzzles and immediate feedback. When you hit a bug, frame it as \"I'm going to figure this out\" rather than \"ugh this is broken.\" Keep a running log of what you've tried - it helps when you inevitably get distracted and come back.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Use the hyperfocus strategically:\\*\\* When you feel yourself getting pulled into something, lean into it if it's productive. I've had some of my best learning sessions at 2 AM because my brain decided \"today we're learning async/await.\" Just make sure you're not hyperfocusing on tutorial hell.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Accountability buddies:\\*\\* Find a study Discord or a friend who's also learning. Just having someone to check in with like \"hey I'm going to work on this for the next hour\" makes a huge difference.\n\n\n\nAlso about the medication - might be worth trying different options if Adderall isn't working?

So make sure whatever language you're learning have some real world application in your daily life and activities.\n\nLets say i'm trying to learn vba, i can apply what I learned in excel at work as it's heavily utilized. Or if i'm learning c, I have a custom keyboard that utilizes c to program it. Or if I'm learning LUA, i like video games, there are games that uses lua to extend the games functionality. Or if i'm learning javascript, I could use javascript to customize how my normally visited pages look to show only the things I'm interested in. Or if you're learning css/html. I could customize how firefox works and looks. Or if you're learning batch or powershell, you can program automation into your computer usage workflow to make normal routines more convenient.\n\nIt's all about seeing the payoff of what you're learning, when you are able to apply it, and see your work in action, it keeps you interested. Interested enough to explore it even further. Then eventually it starts to get boring again and you switch to another language to learn. FML",

Things move quickly and change all the time. CS fundamentals apply to most coding frameworks, you can do the same thing in most coding languages.\n\nIn a nutshell, get the CS fundamentals locked down, and you are able to adapt to different things, which is great for ADHD as we get bored easily and want to move on to different things or multitask.\n\nUse AI to help motivate you (when stuck) and to start and finish tasks. My best use case for AI is really summarising my work to pick up next time, and stick to a plan. \n\nADHD is a superpower for development! hyperfocus is real. If struggling with distraction or ‘tutorial hell’, build something basic from scratch that you want and you’ll be more interested. \nDiscipline is hard with ADHD, i’d advise while getting started to work on ‘fun’ projects that you enjoy doing.\n\nMost importantly, please don’t be hard on yourself.\nLet yourself have a break if you want, treat yourself after something hard. You have got this! Keep being you and following your passions.\n\nNo one is perfect and if it helps I still struggle with distractions too. Stay curious and enjoy the process of learning, as the truth is you always will be learning your whole life, due to how vast CS is and how often things change. \n\nSorry it’s a lot, but I hope this helps in any way. ",

You could him some nice books PLUS something 'fun', like new clothes, a PS5/Switch 2/Xbox game he wanted, a new game controller, or cash.\n\n2. A Rasberry Pi!\n\nIf he is into hardware programming, [https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), maybe he would want a Rasberry Pi. It's a small micro-computer he can use for personal projects. May take a bit to deliver.. It could cost a 'bit' depending on which micro-computer you get.\n\n3. Games & Software\n\nRealistically, there aren't many that could serve as a Christmas gift... Most of those types of resources are already available for free online! If there is a Coursera or Udemy course that's paid, or if he would like a subscription to a learning platform like [https://www.boot.dev/dashboard](https://www.boot.dev/dashboard), that could fit your question, but maybe that wouldn't work as a Christmas gift. These types of softwares are often subscription-based, so it might run up your bill...\n\nYou could get him one of these softwares if he asks, but maybe that's something for another time!\n\n\\---\n\nMe, personally, I would get him a nice book. You could use one of my suggestions, or something else. A raspberry pi is also a nice option. \n\nMake a nice gift basket, get him some nice books, put in some plushies if you want. Place in some gift cards to his favorite mobile / console games. Maybe some new clothes. Books + fun stuff, it would make a perfect gift. :) Merry Christmas, thanks for helping your son's learning.",

A queue behaves in a circular way because that’s what we need to do, on the machine level there is no circular behaviour, like i sais, data is just stacked like books on a table.\n\nTo understand how do we create such behaviours out of memory slots and most importantly why, you need a low enough language to see what’s going under the hood, otherwise it will look like magic. \n\nSo i recommend trying to implement them in C going from integers to graphs and trees. Moving to a high level language like python will be a piece of cake and you will be better than most who started there. \n\nI recommend the book Algorithmes in C, it is quite extensive, so don’t read in bulk and if you really need to know how the machine works, start with Introduction to computing systems, it is written by the creator of the LC-3, for educational purposes. \n\nGood luck to you.",

        "body": "## Exposition\nI'm a lot like you in the sense that I want to understand the \"full stack\" of every system I run across. For years it has got me glued to books on computer science and on general programming topics, chatting with AI about the subject, googling, watching YT videos, etc. It has helped me gain a good basis for how things work but it has also been a way for me to avoid the really hard job of coding itself.\n\n## The Problem\nWithout getting too much into meditation and casual research I've done on psychology, the basic problem is this: It's not the subject matter - programming or computer science - *it's the response to that internal state while learning the subject matter*. \n\nYou need ways to switch off that self-referential egotalk. It won't go away before you start treating it and other internal feelings and thoughts as \"information\" rather than realities that are playing out or describing \"who you are\". They are chemical events, some helpful, some unhelpful. The system that spawns them is full of messy, contradictory responses to these internal events that don't always make sense. Your brain has neuroplasticity, and whether you like it or not even your identity is a construction. Yes, we all have some properties like IQ and EQ that determine some speed or efficiency of function but again those don't determine binary outcomes. The real hindrance is the ego butting in when the analytical parts are trying to do their job or those parts tiring out.\n\nI've wired my brain to be lazy, inattentive and identify myself as stupid. The identity itself and the thoughts surrounding it is a learned set of patterns. That wiring can change, the feelings it produces while under stress can change and my image of myself can change but they won't unless I keep allowing my brain to default to those pathways and don't offer it new experiences and responses to certain difficult stimuli.\n\n## The Realities of the Field\nThe feeling of not knowing something or being confused will never change in this field. Your conscious response to that can and that will ultimately lead to your brain interpreting those signals differently. You'll even start to love the challenge of not knowing, if you can get out of your own way.\n\n## What to focus on - the narrow approach\n\n**Your real goal is learning to understand systems, syntax and data.** There are easier and harder approaches to this but generally I'd say **try to learn how memory works**. And learn it robustly. Study the virtual memory system, study file systems, study how different information - audio, text, graphics, device state - get modeled in memory. While there are millions of libraries, protocols and file formats, they have to all converge on the simple core truth of writing bytes to or reading bytes from memory. If you can nail this layer, write a few parsers that interpret file formats or networking protocols, you'll get a solid grasp of the simple fact that **software is just agreed upon patterns of bytes**. This won't trivialize learning libraries but it will trivialize a certain notion of \"newness\" from them - they aren't anything new. They may sit at several levels lower or higher on the software stack but they are all still just memory.  \n\n## On AI  \nResources are sometimes hard to come by but AI is actually pretty good for this. As long as you aren't copying code but rather asking questions on subjects that are stable and unlikely to change - how things in computer science, and the technologies that express it, work - you can get very good, very detailed answers. Plus you can go back and forth with it, trying to nail and refine your understanding. It's like taking notes with a tutor.\n\n## Conclusion\nSo don't be like me. Don't rush. Accept discomfort. Accept being stupid and having to ask. Think of the skill acquisition portion like laying bricks on a giant wall. You wish for a fast and glorious end result, you'll even settle for \"100 more bricks laid out today, look at that progress!\" but what you need and what you get by showing up and working every day is that one brick. This is a craft and the only way to learn it is by doing it. Every day.",

Auditing is a great way to review or to learn new concepts without the pressure of assignments and exams with deadlines.\n\nI'm surprised you took a course on web programming: it's a landscape that changes so fast that by the time you've started the course, what you're learning is probably already obsolete. the others sound pretty standard for a CS curriculum, but not learning advanced algorithms or the theory of computability (unless you covered that in discrete math, which seems unlikely) seems like glaring omissions.\n\nAnother option would be to pick up a book on DSA and work through it at your own pace... that undirected learning style doesn't work for everyone, though, so pick what works best for you, but yes, a solid foundation in DSA is very important to have: knowing what data structures and algorithms to pick and why is something that I would consider essential.",

Remember that most programming languages do only one thing at a time, and even fairly simple tasks like asking the user to enter a number, and printing it back, requires a lot of individual steps.\n\nThe program you have written performs these steps:\n\n1.

It takes more time to write *and* to read while adding no useful information.\n* It introduces a maintenance burden, as changes to functionality must be mirrored in comments.\n* It tends to introduce confusion and even bugs, because sooner or later someone *will* update code without remembering to mirror the changes in comments, and then someone *will* wrongly assume that the comment is correct.\n\nTherefore, you should never say anything in a comment if it is adequately clear from a symbol’s *name* (e.g. function or variable name), or from its type. (Of course, when generating documentation or tool hints, it may make sense to include a brief summary even if it’s strictly redundant, e.g. the description of the `dirname` parameter above is fine; but I’d remove the bit about being a `char**`). If you can rename a variable and thereby make a comment redundant, you should rename the variable and delete the comment—self-documenting code is best!\n\nWhat’s most important to include in comments is whatever is *least* obvious from reading the code. If you’re doing something counterintuitive because arcane conditions make it an important performance consideration, then mention that.

        "body": "Best way to learn, have it sink in, and know where it applies is to build projects. Since you like web development and you know basic Java you have all the makings of a full stack developer.\n\nBy building projects to learn how to develop software the concepts you learn in school will make more sense how it applies. School does not really teach you how to develop software directly so you are going to have to learn this on your own in addition to what they teach in school.\n\nStart small and keep simple and add one small thing at a time. Work from frontend to backend to database for every feature you add. Let the projects you pick guide what you need to learn when you need to learn it.\n\nThis might sound crazy to some, but the often dismissed TODO application is very well suited for teaching comprehensive full stack development. You just have to take it that far.\n\nHere is an example roadmap that could keep you busy for a while.\n\nStart small, create an index.html page that has the word \"hello\" on it. This is where I always start after 30+ years of doing this :) Next, add the next small thing, probably the proper html scaffolding. Build out the TODO app you probably have built before taking it one small step at a time. Once you get that part done, this is where it gets fun.\n\nMake TODO full stack. Add a backend and send a POST request to add a TODO task (REST). In the backend, just print that post body out to the console. Next, add a database and save the task into it (CRUD). Now this is full stack. Fill in the rest of the REST/CRUD stuff.\n\nNow for the best part, turn TODO into a full SaaS application with authentication, member management, payment subscriptions, email and SMS reminders, scheduling and calendar, sharing, unit testing CI/CD auto deployments, and whatever else you can think of. Do this a few times and you can build almost anything and you will be more ready for interviews.\n\nDo this with every small project you work on. A calculator, an address book, a small online store, an invoice payment processing system, inventory management system. The skills you learn from taking TODO the whole nine yards will give you the skills you need to build any of these.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Honestly, I felt lost at first because I didn’t have projects or clients for these skills.

It walked me through building project ideas from scratch and even gave templates so I could show off skills I was learning.

Sometimes they even make more objects.\n\nThen there are four \"pillars\": encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n1. Encapsulation is when an object's properties are hidden to the public, and optionally only exposed through some kind of filter. These are most commonly seen as `get` and `set` methods.\n2. Inheritance is when one type of object is a \"subclass\" of another (\"superclass\"), so every property and method of the latter also belongs to the former. \n3. Abstraction is when you hide the internals of how something works, and just expose the inputs and outputs. This is far from exclusive to OOP; chances are you're already used to this. \n4. Polymorphism is when you refer to the same object using different types to get different information from it. In the same \"subclass\" relationship used for inheritance, every object of type subclass is also of type superclass.\n\nThat's it, that's OOP! Now practice those ideas with C++ since you know the basics of it already. It's very conducive to object-oriented programming - in fact, in college, my advanced OOP class was all C++. If you want examples, just ask, I can help.",

Some people have learned the \"single return\" style and stick with that.\n\nOthers prefer the \"return early to handle error conditions\" style, which has its advantages.\n\nMost people seem to miss that the two styles are not mutually exclusive. It's certainly possible to handle errors early without an early return. Though, it usually means that we need to do one of two \"not nice\" things stylistically: (a) we need to increase indentation for the non-error case, or (b) we need to use a goto at the error point (or throw an exception), which many people find not nice, but rarely say the explicit reason for their aversion to it.\n\nIn your particular example that you cited, the early return is not really an \"error case\", though, so in this particular example, placing both the returns at the same indentation level (i.e. one within in the \"if\" branch and the other within the \"else\" branch) would make the \\*intent\\* slightly clearer.\n\nNow, suppose you wanted to amend the function and include some kind of \"error condition\" like for the value 0 (which is mathematically neither even nor odd). In such a case like that, then in my opinion it would be clearer to use an early return for that, since doing so \"idiomatically\" expresses the idea that this kind of situation is an unexpected or unusual case. I.e., maybe the caller made some kind of mistake by asking whether 0 is even or odd, because logically that may make no sense, so maybe it's a mistake that it was asked.\n\nOnce the \"error returns\" are taken care of, the rest of the code can basically assume (correctly) that the value in question is \"correct\" in terms of logicality. I.e. for this function it means the rest of the code can assume we are dealing with non-zero quantities, which almost always helps analyzing the correctness of the algorithm.",

What happens if an email address doesn't match the \"`isValidEmailAddress`\" check?\n\nIt's a bit easier to read, both in terms of lowering mental strain and indenting depth, if you take simple cases and pull them out like this:\n\n    // Try to guess the user's first name, return a generic name if it can't be inferred\n    String guessFirstNameFromEmail(String emailAddress) {\n      if (!isValidEmailAddress(emailAddress)) {\n        return \"Alex\";\n      }\n      if (username == \"\") {\n        return \"Sam\";\n      }\n      if (username.contains(\".\")) {\n        return username.split(\".\")[0];\n      }\n      if (hasUpperAndLowerLetterMix(username)) {\n        return username.splitBy(SplitMethod.CapitalLetters)[0];\n      }\n      return username;\n    }\n\nIn the lower case, it's more of a series of deductions - you're considering your assumptions first, and it reads more like getting \"weird\" cases out of the way first (bad input, empty string, etc...).",

E.g.\n\n    int do_something(int p1, int p2)\n    {\n      if (p1 < 1) return ERR_FOO;\n      if (p2 > MAX_P2) return ERR_BAR;\n    \n      // Do something useful.\n      \n      return 0;\n    }\n\nIn general, less code isn't better just because there's less. It's better when that also means it's easier to digest quickly, reason about, make changes to, etc. I would argue that code written as above is generally all of those things, compared to code that flips the condition and/or uses (nested) else blocks.",

So debugging is about finding the point in your code where it first DOES NOT do what you intended it to do. “It should be exiting the loop here - why isn’t it? Oh it should be >= instead of >” etc.   To find that point you can start from the beginning and check values: “b should be 10 here. Is it?”  Trace the execution flow through your code examining values as you go. At some point you will find a value that you weren’t expecting and you can figure out why it got the value it got and fix it. \nAn alternate approach is to work backwards. Start from where you notice the error and see what your code did just before that. This typically means re-running each time you take a step back. In some cases you can also try the binary search method. Examine values in the middle of your code. If they look good the error hasn’t happened yet so split the second half into two sections and look in the middle again keep looking and splitting until you see your problem. In practice I kind of do a mix based on logical thinking…  I see where the error first manifests, I think what could cause that error, I use the debugger or add print statements the check my hypothesis and either look forward or further back depending. But you can almost always find your problem by starting at the beginning and tracing through examining values.  You likely won’t run into it for a while in your programming, but where this breaks down is when you are dealing with multi-threaded, concurrent, asynchronous tasks or threads where adding breakpoints or even printing values changes the order of processing and masks the error.",

Otherwise I'm using it for boilerplate code which rarely needs comments, or just having it spit out a few examples of something I haven't used before, which I rarely use in production without significant modification, if at all, so again, no comments, just a good prompt. \n\nWith AI, I find it much easier to look at 10-50 lines at a time and make sure it doing ok rather than having to stare at a ton of lines all at once and try to redirect it after it's gotten way ahead of itself.\n\nIf you're using an in-ide agent I can see where the comments could help it continue on to fill out the function/file, but I just personally prefer to keep my AI on a short leash.\n\n\nPlus, I tend to work with a lot of aging code that needs to be refactored and it gets touchy.

This is bad because it means the story can't be worked if Geoff is on vacation, but it can be good in a way because if Geoff writes too much detail, he might cross over into dictating design and implementation details and you don't want that, either.\n\n\nMy middle ground is this: the lead (or a designate) takes such a story while it's still on the backlog and attaches all the subtasks that dev can recognize, including the design step that includes getting details from the people who have them. The lead can do this accurately; a junior dev probably can't, but repeating this process is part of the way they learn about the system and the organization.\n\n\nBy the time the story gets to the top of the backlog, if there isn't enough information to actually start the work, there should at least be enough breadcrumbs in it that a junior knows what to do to get that information.",

Just item names tied to customer IDs?  Item names and quantities?  Prices?\n* What mechanism is needed for the AI agent to access the information it needs to blackmail our customers?\n* Do we have a system in place for assembling such a mechanism?

(j/k, nobody ever asks this question)\n\nWhich we can imagine introduces these acceptance criteria:\n\n* An endpoint in the fulfillment API that can be queried by customer ID and returns a list of all that customer's order IDs and item IDs, names, and quantities\n* Access is restricted to members of the BLACKMAILBOT9000 user group, which already exists\n* Automatic tests demonstrate blackmail emails sent to a dummy address (TBD:  replace the hard-coded address of `dipshitjr@hhs.gov`)\n* Don't bother documenting it; no human will ever need to know about this endpoint\n* Allocate another data center to the agentic AI project\n* Stop asking questions about where these stories are coming from\n\nUnfortunately, it is typical for people to use terms that have real value to describe just making-shit-up-as-they-go, and to think that they can replace teaching people with giving them a coding ass-istant.

Ditch the game-dev courses.\n\nBack in the day, there were two schools that offered a game-dev degree; they were DigiPen, and Full Sail. Both these schools are accredited, both these schools are collaborations WITH THE GAME INDUSTRY. The CEOs of both EA-US and Sony-US sat on the direction board of Full Sail.\n\nAround 2006, we were at the height of Sallie Mae robbing the American public blind, and ALL the universities got in on it. They fed peoples delusions of grandeur back to them, and offered game-dev degrees of their own. I sat on a couple review boards myself, and I'd name and shame if I wasn't going to get sued to oblivion if I did... They're robbing people blind. These programs are designed without any industry input or representation whatsoever.\n\nAnd by 2010, the game studios had fully reacted. These days, they don't want to HEAR \"game dev\" degree, because they know you won't know comp-sci to save your life, and you won't know game dev, either. There's still a certain respect for the two schools mentioned, but for the most part, they want a traditional comp-sci degree.\n\nIn the mid 20-teens, the Department of Education started cracking down - tying federal grant money and subsidies to both graduation rates and placement success. Ineffective programs became dangerous to schools and they had to start putting up or shutting up.\n\nWell, I can promise you MOST of the schools slip through the cracks, and this current administration has declared war on education and dissolved the DoE. So I don't know WHAT you're learning over there...\n\nAnd if you're outside the US, I'd trust your game-dev education even less. If the program isn't perfectly cohesive, that's a really, really bad sign.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but at the very least, it's not too late to turn your future prospects around. Get in on math classes, as much as you can from here on out.\n\nAs for how your interview is going to go when you present yourself to a game studio - it's going to be almost exclusively math oriented. They're going to drill you on linear algebra, calculus, and physics at the very least. Some of it will be comp-sci oriented about algorithms, some of it will be physics, some of it will be rendering, some of it is used in game dev but you'll have never seen before because they just want to see how well you adapt to new maths - that you haven't just memorized everything. They're going to grill you over this. As for any programming part of the interview, mostly they just want to know that you know enough syntax to be dangerous: reverse a string, write a linked list.\n\nHell, you don't need C++ specifically in your education. Java is almost indiscernible from C#, which itself is used heavily in game dev, and they all share common syntax and idioms. You can pick up enough C++ on your own to get by.\n\nThe studio can teach you good programming on the job, they can't teach you math and how to think.",

Once that loads, your text editor will be in WSL and the VSCode terminal will work as if you were using Linux",

This comes with tradeoffs, for example: Not having to directly manage memory when using python means the programmer is *not able* to directly manage memory even if they wanted to. This makes Python more suitable to use cases like Data Analytics, where readability and development speed matter more than minute performance optimisations, whereas a language like C is more suited to applications which require a level of control over hardware resources, like Operating System or Embedded Systems applications where you need to use resources as efficiently as possible.",

Theory helps you understand why algorithms work, but it doesn't automatically make you good at problem solving. That comes from grinding problems and recognizing \"oh, this is similar to that other problem I solved.\" For twosum specifically, the key insight is using a hashmap to store complements as you iterate through the array. But you wouldn't necessarily figure that out from theory alone - you learn it by seeing similar problems repeatedly. Keep grinding easy problems. Don't move to medium until you can consistently solve easy problems without hints. Eventually you'll start to see the patterns. Question for you - when you're job hunting later and companies ask about your problem-solving skills, how do you actually prove you can solve algorithm problems? Like do you just say \"I did X problems on LeetCode\" or point to your LeetCode profile stats, or is there a better way to demonstrate you actually understand algorithms and data structures?",

Planning it, packaging it, deploying it so others can use it, are just as important.\n\nSimple games are a good choice, because they're inherently useful: people play them for fun.  \n\nSure, you can learn another language. But, if you do a couple of projects first, you'll get more out of your effort to learn that new language.\n\nAlso, it has to be said, in your programming career you will probably need to learn new languages or othe major tech at least a dozen times. And that's a big effort. So, now, early on, your task is to learn the WHY and HOW of the effort of learning a new language. Doing projects helps with the WHY.\n\nWelcome to our great trade.",

If you are going to DIY this find a program online that starts out with C/C++ and learn how software actually works.  You need to stay with one of those C languages until you have successfully built and UNDERSTAND, at least a couple of data structures.   A good program at this point exposes you to other languages.\n\nFor now stay away from AI and Python.   They will both become extremely important in your future but first you have a lot to learn.",

Do a short “warm up season” instead. Spend a week or two skimming your old notes and redoing one or two small projects you finished before. Do not aim to understand every lecture again, just get your fingers used to typing code and shipping something that runs.\n\nThen go back to where you fell off in TOP, but lower the bar. It is fine if you do not feel smart with data structures on the first pass. Write tiny examples, look up the same concept from two or three sources, and move on once you can explain it out loud in simple language.\n\nThe real unlock is consistency.

Dont let \"web based\" fool you, you can run everything locally too, but it'll do wonders for compatibility and simplicity \n\nYou can use JS and a browser for the entire gui, and JS again in the back end using NODE. You can use something like Electron for cross platform compatibility, and you can save your offline data as cookies or in the cache. Once you get back to data service, the data can sync, and then it'll be available on a server for all your devices. \n\nFor the quiz you can use something like socket.io for bidirectional communication between the server and the device\n\nYou have a lot of requirements here, and it would be prudent to be able to code everything in the same language (JS) I would start by learning basic browser JS since you have a foundation in html and css, then move on to your first server using express and node, and then learn how to utilize external packages like socket.io, then finally how to package them into standalone apps using electron. You may find that you need other things along the way like a database, but thats just another external package and another set of docs. \n\nYou can do all of this in python too it'll just be 50% more difficult than js, but python has better support for complex data and more and different external packages. I dont see any reason to recommend it for someone starting out, and you can always learn another language later \n\nYou're much better off getting good at a single thing than trying to code a bunch of things in different languages",

Programming isn't a career based on age or degrees; it's a skill that's built step by step, like learning a new language.\n\nYou don't need to \"know advanced math\" or have finished high school to start. The basics that do help at the beginning are:\n\nKnowing how to use a computer calmly (files, folders, writing text).\n\nBeing patient with yourself.\n\nUnderstanding that getting confused is part of the process, not a failure.\n\nYou've already done something great: you installed edX. If you're there, an excellent option is Harvard's CS50. It's designed specifically for people starting from scratch and teaches you to think like a programmer, not just how to write code.\nMy recommendation would be:\n\n1. Start with just one course, not ten.\n\n\n\n2. Accept that you won't understand everything at the beginning, and that's okay.\n\n\n\n3. Practice a little, but often. Even if it's just 20–30 minutes.\n\n\n\n4. Don't compare yourself to anyone. Everyone learns at their own pace.\n\n\n\n\nAnd something important: programming isn't about memorizing, it's about solving problems. If you know how to think, ask questions, and not give up, you already have the most important thing.\n\n\nKeep your spirits up. Nobody is born knowing this. We all start exactly where you are now.",

Run it on GitHub Pages so now it is on the Internet too. Good stuff to learn to get that far. Then add the next small thing by adding a backend server and modify your TODO application to POST tasks there instead. POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE are REST verbs you can learn about. Just print the tasks to the console for now. Once you have that working add a database and save a POSTed task to the database using SQL. INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE are SQL statements that map directly to the REST verbs and they are often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Fill in the GET (SELECT) request to retrieve your tasks, the UPDATE, then DELETE. Now your application is full stack.\n\nLet the projects you pick guide what you need to learn, when you need to learn it. MDN is a great resource for the frontend and there are many great resources for whatever backend and database you choose.\n\nAs you build this, you are doing all of this locally, frontend, backend, database, and committing changes to git and pushing those changes to your GitHub repo as you go. To get your GitHub Pages frontend to talk to your backend running on your local machine you can learn about CORS (allows your frontend to talk to your backend) to add that to your backend then use \\`ngrok\\` to  temporarily expose your server and port to the internet (only works while \\`ngrok\\` and your computer are running).\n\nNow that you have a full stack application running on the Internet, time to learn about authentication to make it so only registered users can access your server. You will add login/logout to your frontend and backend as well as user management. More REST and CRUD stuff to add for that too.\n\nCloud stuff is next to get all of it running on the internet. That is a later topic.\n\nWhatever projects you pick, build projects as completely as you can. Make them full stack if that is your thing. Take TODO and add subscriptions/payments, member management, calendar schedules, email/sms reminders, single-sign on, SaaS deployment (cloud), whatever else you can think of. If you just do frontend, touch every angle of it in your projects.\n\nThis is a possible roadmap for you that will keep you busy and hopefully motivated for a while. Once you can do this, you can pretty much build anything.\n\nStart small and keep adding small things to it.\n\nI hope this helps.",

        "body": "Picture yourself in the early 1980s. There is no internet. There barely are any knowledgeable people in your area. Formal programming education is basically non existent before University.\n\nAll you have is the *documentation manual* for the programming language.\n\nHow do you learn?\n\nThrough experimentation. You have no resources, so the only thing you can do is play around, try things. Fail. Try more. Fail again. Try  more and eventually succeed.\n\nYou won't learn by copying tutorial or stackoverflow, etc. code. You will only learn by creating your own code, even if that means that your solutions are maybe complicated, convoluted, and sub-optimal. Yet, they are *your* solutions. They stem from *your thought process*. This way, you *learn*.\n\nOnce you have a working solution, there is no harm in looking up how others have solved the problems. This way, you can learn better, more optimized approaches. Yet, first *you* need to figure out a solution.\n\nThe notion of directly looking for solutions via the internet is detrimental to learning, even more so in the current age of permanent availability of the internet, and worse, with the advent of AI. It makes us lazy. It makes us stopping to think analytically. It makes us stop investing effort, because \"why should we when everything is readily available?\". In return, it makes us stop actually *learning*. Learning means struggling. Learning means failing. Learning means debugging. Learning does not mean getting a solution from effectively a third party (no matter if Google, Stackoverflow, AI, etc.)\n\nDiscipline yourself to not looking for direct solutions and even less *in code*, but to look for *approaches* to solutions. Maybe, download the documentation for your programming language and then cut yourself off the internet. Seems like a radical step, but can be extremely helpful for learning.\n\nThe thought process from problem to solution is what really counts in programming, not the *implementation* in a programming language (that's the more trivial part and just a necessary evil).\n\nOnce you understand how to \"think like a programmer\" things change considerably. Programming languages become less important and you learn to work on a more abstract, conceptional level.\n\nMaybe, try some programming competitions, like [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (with the accompanying subreddit /r/adventofcode) - current year is over, but the challenges are all accessible back to the very first season in 2015. Another recommendable site is [Exercism](https://exercism.org). Here, you get challenges and have \"hints\" and guidance.\n\nAs usual with such posts (of which there are more than plenty), some Literature (aka *books*):\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nTo address your \"all coders do is just copy-paste\" statement: yes, we do copy paste, but not because we *could not do the job*, it's because of time constraints, trusted and tested solutions. Contrary to a beginner/learner, we can assess what a solution copied from the internet does, how it fits into our codebase, what side effects it has, etc. We could come up with our own solutions, but that would be less efficient in a professional setting than to resort to tested and trusted solutions.",

Once you have a larger functioning thing that you made in front of you the whole feeling like a fraud thing kind of starts to be less heavy. Just don't use AI when you do it. Document your ADRs or at least journal in obsidian/md as you make design decisions. By the end you'll probably have like 7k+ lines backend, id how many frontend, and you'll be way more comfortable with whatever db you wanted to put in the stack. Most importantly though you'll have made a bunch of design decisions, so next time you have a problem you can start breaking it down from the big picture in the end.",

This almost inevitably means the list isn't used that often, since you can't even search for values without reads quickly becoming the major operation, and so even worrying about it isn't worth it.\n\nOne example would be monitoring the lifetime of objects. Here you mostly care about the oldest and newest object, and whenever an object dies, you have a mutation. Any new object simply gets added to the end.\n\nBut even here, just a few necessary searches will kill any performance advantage you got, so you'd need to be very sure that your performance optimization holds, and will hold for a long time. And if you ever need to change something, you'll quickly have to swap out the linked list with a more powerful data structure anyway.\n\nSo even if you ever find a place where a linked list fits, you most likely will instead choose a tree, skip list or the like instead.",

So to truly understand the underlying theory, building your own is a good idea.\n\nBut, noone is going to buy your homebuilt project, or hire you to build another - then want you to be able to use the tools they have already paid good money for, and they want you do do it well and do it fast!\n\nSo don't go building your own as an excuse not to learn the tricks of the tools - but also, don't just be a tool-user, but make sure you understand enough to be able to learn any tool.\n\nMy recommendation *(as someone who doesn't know anything about the business)* is to go on with building your own, but remember that it is a hobby-project, something you only do for the learning experience. And then as your \"professional project\" build something with the modern tools, to show off how well you know them!",

There are also cost estimation tools that help novices avoid the most common pitfalls around capex. You also absolutely can implement hard capex limits in AWS, there’s just no automatic switch/SPOG for it.\n\nThere are similar horror stories about every public infra platform, from hyperscalers down to Heroku and DigitalOcean. The AWS ones tend to get more attention because AWS is the biggest kid on the block, that’s all.\n\nThat said, take a look at Oracle Cloud. Anyone can sign up for two free-forever instances. Every seven or eight years you’ll have to migrate when your original compute config isn’t available anymore, but they really are free and on ARM instances you get a pretty generous allocation of vCPU and RAM.

Do you want to work on a very niche part of robotics in a large robotics firm (maybe focus on C or other low level languages), or can you see yourself building your own projects and maybe even launching a startup (in which case the TypeScript/React ecosystem might be a good focus)? \n\nWhilst having a broad understanding of all of the above is certainly useful (basically what a CS degree is for) having an end goal in mind will help you stay motivated and focus your learning towards something",

A lot of websites use loading icons to display \"placeholder\" icons to indicate that something is loading.

        "body": "I could be wrong, I've never worked with gmpy2, but I believe this is what's happening:\n\n`x` and `y` are never covered to gmpy2 types here, you are relying on the library to either handle the regular Python `int` and `float` types or create temporary gmpy2 type objects from them in order to do the math. The results of those functions will be gmpy2 types, but nowhere does any of this replace `x` and `y` with an equivalent gmpy2 type. This matters.\n\nThe source code for gmpy2 might help understand why.\n\n`qdiv` source is [here](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_mpq_misc.c#L162).\n\nYou can skip to line 210 since the first part is if you use it with only 1 argument.\n\nThe check for whether your arguments are valid is this:\n\n    if (!IS_RATIONAL(x) || !IS_RATIONAL(y)) {\n        goto arg_error;\n    }\n\n`IS_RATIONAL` is a macro defined in [gmpy2_convert.h](https://github.com/gmpy2/gmpy2/blob/master/src/gmpy2_convert.h#L54)\n\nThe function works for `mpq`, `mpz`, `xmpz`, Python's `Fraction`, `int` types, and types with the `__mpq__` or `__mpz__` conversion functions (these are for writing your own custom classes, they do not get added to existing types like `float`, so they aren't relevant here).\n\n`int` is in the list, so the argument `x` is ok, but `float` is not in that list, and `y` is a `float`, so that check fails.\n\nI believe if you write `print(test(4, gmpy2.mpq(2.0)))` this should work. The reason `qdiv` does not work on regular floating point numbers. `mpq` numbers are similar to `Decimal` or `Fraction` types in Python, storing a numerator and denominator, and as far as I'm aware they're always stored fully simplified, so `2.0` = 2/1, so as long as both arguments are integers in any of the supported types, the division operation should be simple integer division for which they have a highly optimized algorithm. Dividing by a float however is not that simple, and converting a standard `float` into `mpq` is additional work. `qdiv` is an optimized function that's trying to avoid doing unnecessary work, so it simply says \"no, you can't do this\".\n\nBecause it doesn't do any unnecessary work, `qdiv` is faster, but the price is that it's more restrictive about when it can be used. If you are trying to learn this library, you should be explicitly creating variables using the gmpy2 types rather than relying on the functions to work with regular Python types and do the conversions for you when necessary.",

On the page for Multiple Precision Reals: is\\_integer() → bool: Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise. Does gmpy2.is\\_integer() say that it only checks value as opposed to type somewhere in the docs and I just missed it?\n\nI'm not a professional programmer by any means, but maybe the description for gmpy2.is\\_integer() should include that it checks only if the value is equivalent to an integer, not type? Or maybe there should be a method in gmpy2 to check type, like the normal python isinstance?

Your** `getComputerChoice()` **returns strings like** `\"Computer chose rock\"` **but your** `playRound()` **is comparing against just** `\"rock\"`**.** They'll never match! Change your returns to just `\"rock\"`, `\"paper\"`, `\"scissors\"`.  \n  \nCheck whether this fixes things, cheers!",

I would advise you read up a bit more about it but here's the quick notes:\n\n`return \"Example text\";` would mean that the function **returns** the string \"Example text\"\n\n`console.log(\"Exampled text\")` would mean that \"Example text\" would be logged to the console as a **side effect** of that function. \n\nThe return value of the function is basically what that function becomes equal to when you call it.",

Macs reign supreme in dev here though. \n\nThe one thing I will say is I don’t recommend a Microsoft anything when it comes to reliability support and such. They mostly just work, but when things go wrong it’s always annoying, longer and harder to fix than the other brand laptops we get in enterprise. Other OEM’s fair much better, especially the big enterprise players like HP, Lenovo, Dell (though dell do make some junk these days for enterprise laptops to hit that low lease cost). \n\nReally though at that price point my recommendation with no other info is a MacBook Air. Best support, they last ages, are pretty standard in dev and cs circles, etc. only downside is the hardware is limited to when Apple stop supporting it so after 8/9 years they stop getting security updates… but I’ve yet to daily a windows computer that lives half that time, Macs often do. They also have by far the best resale.\n\nMy advice is really save some coins on another brand windows laptop or spend those coins on a MacBook Air tbh.",

You should be performing code reviews on the result and providing the feedback directly to the LLM to make revisions. If you hate performing code reviews, then I can understand why you don't like working with LLMs.\n\nI suppose you can technically use it the opposite way, where you have the LLM perform a code review on your own code changes. You might find that you like doing it that way better, although it doesn't really help much with efficiency beyond tightening up the revision cycle. \n\nYou can also use it to write your tests if you're the type of person who hates doing that. But then you actually need to review the tests, so if you hate code reviews it's still not a great idea. \n\nThe main thing is to use LLMs for anything that you find tedious. If you do that, you'll find much more enjoyment working with them.",

If you look at the statistics by program group tab and you filter for 2024 in one box and 2025 in the other, you can see that there has been a noticeable drop off equal to approximately a 25% reduction not just in applications, but also in acceptances/confirmations for CS programs. Although these are only statistics for Ontario, I have no reason to believe that the same would not be happening elsewhere; I doubt there's anything special about these statistics compared to any others.

There's no one breathing down your neck while you problem-solve. The time pressure, high stakes, and interviewers disrupting your thought process aren't simulated. This is often why people brain freeze in interviews.\n\nDo mock interviews alongside your self-study to identify your weaknesses, and ideally start them early so you have more time to fix issues.   \n  \n  \nHere are two relevant resources: one on [getting truly interview ready](https://www.coditioning.com/blog/11/complete-tech-interview-prep-roadmap), another on [key interviewing skills](https://youtu.be/V2czxOT_hwU).

Bad engineers write bad software because fundamentally they can't diagnose the problems users are having that they are hired to fix as a software developer.\n\nHow do you get there?

Even as a jr, document everything you do. Just finished a big project? Most jobs use a documentation system where you can just look up how to do things. Even a simple \"how to run this test\" can go a long way and is proof of what you did. \n\n\\- When you finsih something, give yourself credit and post it somewehre or mention it in standup. This is somethign many of us struggle with, giving ourselves credit. To get promoted you want the higher ups to know what you did and how you participated in that. \n\n\\- Take 10 minutes after standup to present anything or even show a doc. Again, you want to be recognizable. You want your boss to say \"OP had a good presentation post-standup that was really interesting\". \n\n\\- It's better to do 5 tasks and shwo your work than it is to do 10 tasks and keep quiet. This was my biggest issue. Id do tasks but never really wanted the praise or to present it so i kept quiet. My coworkers thought i wasnt doing much and in review seasons i didnt have much coworkers to sing my praises. \n\n\\- Dont be a passive engineer. A lot of engineers are good but are very passive. In stand up they dont really say they are stuck, they only say \"i continued working on X and investgiaging a small issue\". Nothing else. Nobody is going to help if you dont say \"im stuck\" and trust me engineers get more mad if you spend a week stuck on the same issue then if on day 1 you say \"im stuck\". Time is money. Reach out to coworkers and talk to them about issues. That conversation could lead you to getting close with a higher up engineer. If you as a junior can get a principal engineer to back you up, that goes a far way.",

From working there so far, I have worked with two really good engineers. Both of them have had two totally different experiences, but surprisingly, both have ended up in the same place doing the exact same thing. \n\nOne of them was a self taught developer who tinkered with programming at a young age and learned many languages. Unfortunately, he didn’t pursue a CS degree because he grew up very poor but is in the works of getting one right now. This dude had many personal projects under his belt and worked extensively outside of work getting tasks at work completed. He had around 15 years of experience working with software and loved programming. He knew embedded programming really well too including how PLCs work and loved learning new things about programming. \n\nThe other had a CE degree from Michigan Tech and has around 15 years of experience. He worked with embedded programming for the bulk of his career at GE Aviation. He really enjoys learning about new technologies and currently is helping us bring into the modern era an older application. This dude is my current mentor and has taught me so much in terms of how to program and ultimately, how to go about architecting and designing programs. He is a monster, he designed a completely new product from an older application at my company and reverse engineered the way it works so that it translated properly to a new language and environment. My coworkers had told him that the old project was a mess since it was written with a very old version of C++ (to most of us it was a mess lol). But he straight up in the interview said “nothing scared him”. My bosses laughed at him but he proved US ALL wrong. \n\nThe thing about both of them that made them really good engineers was that both of them explicitly stated to me that all they did was “breathe and live” code. They programmed on all their free time and worked many hours outside of the usual 40 hour work week perfecting their craft. They read books, watched videos, they absorbed so much information on their free time that it clearly showed when they came into work ready to start their day. Like I feel helpless sometimes just seeing that they can take on so many tasks (especially tough ones) and my tasks I complete are mediocre at best. But the thing is, I am absorbing the knowledge they give to me. I’ve learned so much from starting my position that I don’t think I would be anywhere near where I am in knowledge and experience without either of them.",

Always had backlogs of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn, even though I never posted/updated/said I was looking for work. \n\nI think there’s a few factors at play that make the job market seem extra shitty right now.\n\n1. Layoffs/hiring freezes across big tech, and government jobs. Basically a large pool of people who would have been considered ‘Top Talent’ a few years ago are now all looking for work at once. The longer they are unemployed, the lower the standards get, so even if you are just applying for ‘Regular’ jobs, a few of the 100+ resumes in that inbox probably has ‘Google’ or ‘Meta’ or whatever on it. \n\n2. With AI, it’s become trivial to spam out resumes, and tailor/frame your work experience to the exact job requirements. If you just earnestly apply to jobs, you are unlikely to get an interview even if you are a relatively good fit. You said ‘SQL’ on your resume. Someone else mentioned the exact distribution they use at the company. You said ‘AWS’ they said the exact AWS features and tech stack being used. Often times your resume won’t even make it past the screening stage.\n\n3. Just general hiring trends. Hiring tends to be forward looking, so I think a lot of senior leadership is really leaning into the idea that they should be able to accomplish more with the same amount of people. Instead of increasing headcount by 10% for some new project, they’ll try to push AI tools and re-org the ‘freed up’ employees to whatever new project they are working on.\n\n\nIt’s definitely pretty rough. Even with 8+ years of backend dev and Data Science experience, I’ve applied to ~100+ jobs. One final round of interviews, no job offers, and I only got there because I had a referral. I’ve started just not bothering with jobs that list even one specific technology I don’t have experience with.\n\nI’m not saying I’m a super talented top dev. I’ve always worked at middle of the road non tech F500 companies. But I’ve never been fired or even had a bad performance review. I’d be so excited to just get the feedback ‘Yo, you didn’t do a good job solving this LC problem. Or your architecture skills and thought process isn’t what we are looking for’. But it’s just like… no one even gives you a chance to interview if you don’t BS your resume with AI. Then those are the pool of people you can hire, and the quality of the hiring goes down.",

Location is a major factor.\n\nIn markets like New York or Silicon Valley, you have people who have sacrificed years of their lives to prep for demanding positions, so every role that gets posted has a ton of competition. When candidates get dumped onto the market from layoffs, companies have to ratchet up the difficulty in interviews just to have a manageable pipeline.\n\nI've been involved in the recruiting for a team that is not in a tech hub. In-person work is a hard requirement, for about \\~150k base salary, no stocks, no bonus. It's probably average for that area, but not particularly attractive for someone to move just for the job. We even offer relocation assistance for that role.\n\nWe get maybe 20 candidates per job posting, half of which are not qualified because they need sponsorship. If we interview 10 people, about 1/2 can actually write a basic loop. We hire whoever has the best systems design interview since most people can not clear even a LeetCode easy. (clear rate for a fully passing solution is probably about 5% of all candidates that reach that stage).\n\nI really think unemployed engineers who are having trouble securing an offer for months have the wrong strategy. They should be taking up these 'easy' low paying jobs, moving temporarily, and then continuing to interview for their hotshot Big Tech and Silicon Valley roles. A six figure salary in a medium cost of living area is better than sitting around all day waiting for the next OA.",

Then you had boot camps generating devs that could do one thing okay quickly. Many devs don’t have cs degrees and a lot of those guys are actually pretty solid. \n\nThe tech has gotten increasingly complex. The output expectations have increased. The quality of peers has declined. Interview intensity has gone way up. There is the expectation now that ai just makes it all happen magically and that we will be eliminated soon anyways. Dollar is worth less. \n\nThere was a time you could be good at one part of the stack and be paid well. Now the expectation is your good at fe, be, observability, continuous integration, testing, deployment, wireframes, reqs & documentation, etc. It used to be if the codebase was a mess or you weren’t familiar with some framework they would cut you slack of train you but less so now. It used to be a few devs in a room working through stuff. Now everyone’s remote on different continents crammed into tiny noisy apartments. You’re still supposed to manage to mentor them.  Usually most of the team has already been outsourced so they really don’t have the same skin in the game and your heads on the chopping block. The interview used to focus on your degree, likability, location, and experience.  It went from white boarding to take home test and live coding exams to leet code with ai graders kidding your voice and eye movements. Not to mention how everything’s flooded now so getting noticed / not getting duped leading up to the interview view is harder. The expectation of 2x ai productivity doesn’t account for the quality of the ai, existing code, or clarity of instructions. Then there is pay. It’s held strong in a way and even grown faster than other industries but the dollar is worth under 1/3 as much as ten years ago in terms of shelter, transportation, healthcare, and food. Then there’s the increase in domestic cs degrees coming online and the over hiring in the covid market rally which went to layoffs then to ai hiring. \n\nI’ve had 6 jobs in ten years and everyone has laid us off or been bought out. Some were productive, some kept the companies software alive, others had no idea what they wanted. Can definitely make you tired. But that’s why it’s a job, right? Made some money. Am I a fool for thinking I would still be hustling 25 years from now or not gambling my cash into the stonks? Probably… \n\nOut of work and just been studying for a few months. Sometimes it feels slow and fruitless. Just comes with the territory I suppose. Some stuff on my inbox so we’ll see. ",

Well, it's partly luck. Be very aware of little problems you have or others have and constantly ask, is there a digital solution for this problem?\n\nConstantly being aware and asking that question is part of it. The other part is throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks. You can be surprised what winds up working versus what you thought would work and was a great idea. What you are trying to do is find the outlier event in a large distribution - and that requires many, many trials until you hit it.\n\nYou'll never know if you don't test many innumerable ideas out in reality. The trick is to run these tests (as many as possible) without bankrupting your self and keeping the overhead low. One good principle to hold to is: \"what I think will work is irrelevant, what works is the only relevant thing\" - in other words, be REACTIVE and not PRO-ACTIVE. See if something might work - test it like a scientist with a hypothesis and then act based on objective observation. Good luck (you and the rest of us are going to need it...).\n\nAnd just accept that if you want a shot at success - you will have to endure many, many, endless trials that result in failure - until you hit the one that does not (hopefully).",

Works okay but you still need the raw material of what you actually did.\n\n  2. Extracting achievements from git history - Some tools now analyze your commits and PRs to surface what you shipped. Helpful for people who forget to track their work throughout the year.\n\n  3. Manager-side summarization - Some companies are experimenting with AI to help managers synthesize feedback from multiple sources.\n\nThe biggest shift I've noticed isn't AI doing the reviews—it's AI making it harder to hide behind vague statements. When you can generate specific examples easily, \"improved system performance\" without details looks lazier than it used to.",

Then the pay is roughly equivalent to what I was getting at my previous position. And finally, the company 's culture suits me well. But it is 100% a tech company. That's their core business.

        "body": "Just for a different perspective:\nI remember that first year out of uni as also very stressful and draining.  I felt that I knew very little, the culture was kinda weird,  there were some big egos and seasoned jaded ultra senior devs that kinda left a trail of bitterness in the air. Competition, devs being passive aggresive, putting down each other, one upping each other. I didnt know it for the first year, but that company was very unprofessional and amateurish even though quite successful and big. It was a software company developing b2b solutions. \n\nAfter a while I noticed I was sitting with the same stack, same flows, almost the same user stories all the time. I felt like I was living groundhog day and definitely thought I made a huge mistake choosing this career. \nI realised I cant be working on the same product for 20 years. And I thought all dev jobs were gonna be like this and I had no ther skills.\n\nAfter almost 2 years I couldnt take it anymore, I needed to get out. I also, much like you, wanted to pivot immediately. \n \nThe easiest transition and most obvious solution for me was consultancy. \n\nI first joined a tech consultancy firm and the atmosphere change was night and day. Suddenly it was in their best interest to get me official certifications (they can sell you better to clients if you have a shiny cv), so it felt like being back at uni a bit, with studying for exams etc.\nAfter that, I got to work with a lot of different projects for different clients in different industries. The projects would be anything from delivering an MVP within 6 months internally for a client/company A to being placed as a dev on site and joining the team at client/company B - contracts could range from 6 months to a year and could always be extended or if things didnt work out my manager would pull me out earlier. It was the BEST experience because I got to work wkth very many different people that taught me loads.\nUnfortunately, change  in management + politics and the economy suddenly dried up the assignment pipeline and I was left on the bench for way too long. I decided to jump ship. \n\nI now work at a non-tech financial firm as part of their internal tech team. My team develops solutions for our non tech employees around the globe. This means many projects, some small, some big with many different focuses and tech stacks. I work primarily with people that studied computer science as a minor and kinda fell into development by chance. My role is to help professionalise their solutions. And I love it. I am not surrounded by tech mentality at all... its just finance and law. A nightmare for any brogrammer that yearns for silly valley and definitely not without its pain points. But for me its the best of both worlds, cos im still in tech, actively coding and architecting but the expectations are way lower, theres competition between finance bro and finance bro, but that doesnt affect me. Finance bros have to work Christmas but we do not, in fact we shouldn't really develop or ship anything during that time cos getting new update before year close makes finance bros very nervous haha. And now with AI in the air, our teams budget got increased, and we are encouraged to find novel ways to help make the firms employees more efficient/productive. That means a lot of autonomy to explore new tech stacks and solutions. It is genuinely fun again. A bit chaotic, but without the stress and expectation of greatness. \n\nAnyway... Just wanted to say theres better things out there. And that tech doesnt have to be too techy. Theres a light on the other side.",

        "body": "If another developer’s actions create obstacles that make your work more difficult, it is reasonable to raise those obstacles with your manager or whoever can address them. The focus should stay on the obstacle that is blocking you, not on the developer as a person.\n\nThis framing positions you as someone trying to improve results for the company by identifying obstacles, rather than as someone “reporting” on a coworker. It avoids unnecessary interpersonal conflict and reduces the risk of backlash if your manager interprets it as a personal complaint.\n\nIf the other developer’s behavior does not produce obstacles that actually impede your work, it is usually best to ignore it. Spending time and energy evaluating another person’s work habits is a distraction from producing strong results yourself.\n\n**Responding to your edit:** you’re saying that when your coworkers don’t do their work, you end up working overtime and feeling pressure to meet deadlines. That overtime and deadline pressure is the real obstacle being created by their lack of follow-through.\n\nThat’s understandably frustrating. The right response is to communicate clearly with your manager about project status and work allocation. When work is assigned but not completed, you should state that the project is off track, explain that tasks are being reallocated, and explicitly note either that you are working overtime to meet deadlines or that deadlines will slip as a result of the reallocation.\n\nThis gives your manager the opportunity to recognize and credit your extra effort, or to see that deadlines are being missed because work isn’t getting done and needs to be reassigned. Ideally, this leads them to independently notice that a particular coworker is consistently not completing their work.\n\nIf your manager does not acknowledge your overtime and instead simply pressures you to work harder, then the issue is poor management. That’s unfortunate, but it is a separate problem from how you should handle the situation with your coworker.",

Stanford probably has better instruction and network but much more expensive.

It helps to understand the difference between hard and soft interrupts, how registers work and why for example \"boolean\" data won't likely save any actual memory vs an int...or if it does why it's now slower than an int.\n\nIt's *always* beneficial to understand what is going on under the hood of the higher level constructs you're using.  Maybe not frequently down to the assembly level, but the deeper your knowledge and understanding the better decisions and code you write no matter what level you're working at.\n\nMy recommendation is to learn a little assembly, but do so on small, easy processors.

You're under new management, so there's no point being a nail that sticks out while they're looking to get things settled in.\n\n\nBut it's also a pretty strong warning to freshen up your CV or resume and start applying to other places. Early January is usually an awesome time to be jobseeking, so see if you get any bites. It's also still early enough that you can continue seeking with your current title -- you already have history and experience working at that level, and performed well enough that you were hired or promoted into it. So your resume will still largely reflect your assigned duties and experience for 3-6 months.\n\n\nSomething else to consider is that your manager is giving you an option here, which is *super* unusual. That sounds like they want to keep you, but budgets may be too squeezed right now for your current paygrade. As far as I'm aware, it's unusual for a manager to give this option instead of just issuing a termination. It might be that the department's budget can fit you, at least for the upcoming few quarters, if they demote and reduce your salary. Obviously your call on whether you want to voluntarily earn less to stay with them, but you do say you're not being set up for success here.\n\n\nWhere I live, unless it's an especially toxic workplace or you get a reasonable severance package, it's better to jobseek and make them lay you off (rather than quitting). If you quit, you lose access to some unemployment benefits.",

It sounds like a couple smaller businesses and proprietorships I've seen around here. But you're saying it's a *median software* company. The only ones I'm aware of that meet that kind of description (near me) would be Revature and other WITCH companies. They keep devs benched on small projects, and try to get you placed with a client so they earn a cut of your salary and you get experience. Sometimes they'll exaggerate your skills to get a bigger salary cut.\n\n\nAre you working on a greenfield project that the company doesn't really need, but feels is a worthwhile gamble? Are you an intern or in training right now? Those are the contexts where I could understand assigning a solo dev at a company. Where the risks are very low and you might not be working on the company's main revenue streams.",

Either tech is a secondary focus, or you're isolated from the tech center of your company. I worked at a tech consulting company/digital agency, and they had someone on staff who helped the accounting team. After that person resigned, the company would ask random people for help on things. He didn't use version control.\n\nThis isn't normal, but I don't think it's completely unique, as you hear stories about people who have this experience. In the old days, teams were responsible for their own IT and work, and you'd have teams spring up like this all across departments, until they brought in someone to organize everything. I should probably say \"if\" rather than \"until.\" Large organizations also go through something like this, so don't feel too self-conscious. \n\nIs there are larger tech community/team in your company? A part of me wants to say you should ask about joining them, but the new manager might be a pain. You should consider looking for other opportunities, as you're probably not learning good software practices. To counter that, perhaps you can allocate time for process improvement. You can sell it as ways to allow others to do your work. So, things like version control (I hope you're already using this, right?), CI/CD, some type of wiki for documentation, a ticketing/tracking system are some good starts. Maybe some next things to consider is how do you monitor things in Production? Just look at log files? \n\nI also want to clarify something. Just because a company has this stuff in place doesn't mean they do a good job with it. During the interview process, it's on you to try to figure out if places do a good job or not. Good luck, as some places will flat out lie to you. My last job is an example. The tech leads did everything, and the people on the management side didn't do much work outside of call names during daily standups. They certainly didn't understand any of the work from a business perspective. There are all levels of bad companies out there.",

First thought, the directors that are still there in the program are generally really good as far as being kind/good humans go. Second though, its a great program for starting your career. You'll grow a really large network of other early stage engineers really quickly and when everyone inevitably scatters within 3-5 years you'll have that network at a lot of other tech companies as a result.\n\nI will say, the work is a mixed bag. For one of my rotations I was a data analyst and it was the most boring thing on earth (old school SAP WEBI work). For the other I was building ML models in Azure which was a lot better (I stuck with that rotation post tdp). I think the biggest downside is that the pay stagnates super hard post TDP if you dont end up in a good title. Some of my friends came out as senior software engineers around 140k, others (like me) came out with much less glamorous titles doing roughly the same work at 110k. Pay disparity was just a function of what business unit you ended up in and what titles that business unit would allow. I left after 4 years for a sizeable pay increase, but ATT TDP definitely allowed me to grow some good leadership skills while I was there and the friends I made in that program are still in my social circles today",

I don’t know what your projects are but simple capstone and full stack node projects probably just aren’t going to cut it, as literally every new grads has those and they pale in comparison to real dev experience. I think my best advice would be to A) start contributing to open source or start a serious side project to get something eye popping on your resume or B) look for a adjacent job like IT, get your foot in with the company and try to transfer to being a dev eventually.  Obviously you could continue cold applying (it’s pretty much what I did lol) but it feels a lot like finding a needle in a haystack and ur new grad status is probably running out.",

Real interview is the 2nd or 3rd interview where they actually grill you on technical stuff. So if you aren't even getting that far...\n\nYour capstone from school should not be a listed project unless it was high quality. That's kind of a joke and if you're listing that on your resume I could see employers tossing your resume then and there.\n\nYour projects need to be professional level. What exactly are your projects built in? How are they deployed? Do they integrate testing, CI/CD, and more advanced cloud microservices than just something like vercel, github pages, or ec2/s3? Do they use cloud orchestration in any way or IAC?\n\nI'd recommend getting your AWS Developer Associate cert. I went from zero interviews to weekly interviews once I got that.\n\nIf you aren't getting interviews though, it's because your resume is weak. How do you list your skills? What skills are listed? Are you tailoring each resume to each application? Stop applying and build up your resume.\n\nReaching out to alumni is a waste imo. You should network locally, which will take at least 6 months imo to build up. But once you start seeing familiar faces, people start recommending you, you recommend people to those hiring (ie if you're a full stack guy, work with a UI/UX guy and help them get a job, they help you).\n\nSounds like your projects and resume are weak, so you aren't even getting interviews. Once you start landing interviews, that's a whole other thing you gotta hone in, being able to explain things, understand things conceptually, know when to use what vs another... So you know, I'd expect another 3-6 months minimum of study on top of that once you start getting interview experience.\n\nTry to find an unpaid internship is also my advice.",

I'd personally find it hard to justify using k8s / preferring availability just for this. Also, a core principle of SRE is having an error budget that you want to actually spend (i.e. having services that are \\*too\\* reliable is \\*bad\\*). I'd be a bit apprehensive to hire a senior whose recommendation is \"reliability at the cost of everything else\".\n\n## Too much human reliance\n\n\"A justification in the PR, and/or\"\n\nPersonally, not a big fan of answers that boils down to \"let humans do this X process\". Humans are faulty, and manual processes tend to get ignored over time (e.g. people just rubber-stamping the justification).\n\n\"At each stage, monitor:\"\n\nThis also seems like an extra toil that can be done automatically.\n\nIn general, adding more bureucracy / slowing down development for the sake of needless reliability is also bad, similar to above.\n\n## Seems pretty textbook\n\nOverall, your answers give me the vibe of \"recommend the commonly recommended thing, just because that's best practice, without further thought\", like immediately jumping to k8s, specific DB, and so on.\n\nIn the system design interview, I think I'd personally like to see how you think from the fundamentals and the first principle more, rather than just giving me a list of technologies immediately:\n\n- For a simple webapp, do we \\*really\\* need to use k8s? You're signing up your team to eat a lot of dev / knowledge cost before even hearing the full constraint of the problem.\n\n- Before jumping into the details, why not verify more fundamental things? e.g. do we need redundancy across different regions?\n\n- NoSQL theoretically scales horizontally better, but is that true in reality? In a lot of cases, there is a mismatch between theory and reality. Similar to how linked list are faster than arrays on paper for some use case, but they tend to be slower in reality due to caching performance.\n\n## Random nit\n\n'“What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.' \n\nIncorrect? I'd expect the answer to be 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS. I'd personally shrug it as nervousness / misunderstanding, but maaaaybe there's a small chance of interviewers really disliking it (e.g. \"this person has only ever deployed things on localhost\") since that's a pretty fundamental thing to get wrong.\n\nDon't beat yourself up too much though, interview fails sometimes do just happen randomly (e.g. there just happen to be unicorn candidate right after you). From the post, it seems like you're a pretty strong candidate and the interview itself went pretty well.\n\nI think the core of the issue is that a senior SRE should be someone who knows why we need to follow mainstream recommendations, and when we should not follow them. I'm not saying you don't have that quality, but I think the way you answer the interview questions did not necessarily demonstrate that due to the textbook answer and overemphasis on reliability above all.",

One enhancement: frame your debugging narrative around measurable outcomes. Instead of just \"add alerts,\" try \"implement alerts on CrashLoopBackOff with a threshold of X failures in Y minutes, reducing MTTR by Z%.\" Concrete metrics make your experience more verifiable and demonstrate production impact.\n\n\n\nFor system design—your answers were directionally correct. The feedback about being more concrete is key. When discussing rate limiting or scaling strategies, reference specific implementations you've actually built or studied. \"In a previous project, I implemented X pattern which handled Y req/s\" is stronger than theoretical answers. Even side projects count if they're deployed and measurable.\n\n\n\nThe rejection stings, but use this experience to build a portfolio of implemented systems you can reference. Deploy a small web app with the observability/scaling patterns you discussed. Document it thoroughly. Next interview, you'll have concrete proof of these concepts in action rather than just theoretical knowledge.\n\n\n\nWhat specific areas do you want to strengthen with hands-on projects?",

The only reason it was tolerable for so long is that the job was far easier than what you are describing. I was able to make up for the shitty starting salary (btw this was over a decade ago so you're much more severely underpaid) with one good career move down the line, but the lack of mentorship during that early stage of my career stagnated my growth in a way that it is much harder to make up for. I learned more in my first year working on a proper dev team than I did at that entire job. For that reason primarily, I would recommend you get out of this job ASAP. The risk of stagnation in an environment like that is very very high.",

But I encourage you to apply for a relevant diploma or degree if you'd like better job security. Many government employers, companies with long-term contracts, and tech companies can afford to be selective. A related degree gives you more options, more offers, and helps keep you off the chopping block when a company needs easy staff to lay off. Since you've got a degree and some CS courses, you can potentially ladder that into a major and/or get transfer credits.\n\n\nAll that said, what's your non-STEM degree? A handful of them can be leveraged for specific positions in the industry, and any bachelors' does allow you to apply for more international working visas.",

The thinking goes: if I can’t get a job as a SWE, I’ll just *drop down* a rung or two and get one of those jobs. \n\nWhile there is very significant skill overlap between various positions in software engineering and IT, it’s not really a hierarchy.

The market for new grads has just been brutal, especially if you didn’t get a return offer lined up before graduating.\n\nGoing into IT is a totally reasonable move if you treat it as a bridge, not a dead end. GeekSquad + Network+ + cloud certs can absolutely move you toward DevOps or SRE if you keep one foot in software. Plenty of people have gone IT → sysadmin → DevOps once they could show scripting, automation, and cloud work.\n\nThe key is to not stop building or talking like an engineer. Keep shipping small projects, automate stuff at work if you can, write scripts, mess with CI/CD, cloud deployments, monitoring. That’s what makes the transition believable later. If you fully pivot away from coding for a few years, it’s harder to come back.\n\nAlso, you’re doing a lot right already. Hackathons, freelance, startup, networking, referrals, interviews. The lack of offers isn’t because you’re weak, it’s just timing and competition. IT can give you income, experience, and momentum while the market recovers.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned is that interviews reward people who can clearly explain what they’ve built and why. During interviews I’ve used StealthCoder to keep my thoughts structured on screen so I don’t undersell myself or blank, especially when my path isn’t “traditional.” That helps when you’re coming from IT or mixed backgrounds.\n\nShort answer: yes, IT can be a smart move if you’re intentional about it.

IT is another field just like CS within the tech umbrella and that is why I decided to give it a try, not because I think its easy, but because I find it very interesting. \n\nAnother reason I wanted to try it is because the barrier of entry is significantly lower for roles like IT Helpdesk and so on, as opposed to a New Grad Software Developer role; and the fact that certifications actually do have some weight in this field make it even better since I am finishing school right now and cant take any electives anymore.\n\nI have heard of people who started in IT and then transitioned to a mode code heavy role or things like DevOps and stuff like that and that was basically what I was asking, if someone has had a similar experience, since I personally am not going to sit around waiting for a CS role when I can start now in an adjacent field.\n\nAgain thanks a lot!!!!",

For me if yo have to get loans or pay most of it out of pocket. It is not worth to get it. Because at a certain point experience trumps the degree and the pay bump you might get from the degree wont be enough to justify the cost. Like my first job after college i only had my bachelor's degree. I came in as a SWE1, that job automatically made master's degrees SWE2. But the pay bump was only by like 7k or so. Not enough to justfiy getting 30k+ in loans in my opinion. \n\nI got my master's degree through my job that paid for it. What i will say is master's degree will get you in the door more. But it wont get you the job. You may hjear back more about interviews but again you wont get the job. Tbh i forget i have a master's degree sometimes. \n\nUnless you can get it for free or pay minimal cost and have someone else pay for most of it. It's not worth getting a master's degree in this field. Most big tech jobs care more about the experience than the master's degree.",

My opinion.\n\nAt the beginning of your career, you're pretty much like every other CS grad, a big lump of clay that they have to teach and mold.  You might get a few more $$$ due to the higher education, but not enough to offset the extra 2 years and expense of getting the MS over the Bachelor's.\n\nAt the middle of your career, for dev jobs they're mainly interested in your tech experience and what you can do.  They don't want the lump of clay anymore, they want the refined tool for their tech stack or subject matter / industry.  So for basic dev jobs most would rather hire a person with the right experience than somebody who's never done the work they're doing but who has a Masters.  Which is when you try to get promoted.\n\nFor companies / leaders that are credential-focused, you'll be more of a promotion target.  With the MS-CS, that's team lead or architect.  With an MBA, that's management.  Whether or not you're deserving of those roles is another question, but for companies or leaders who focus on credentials, you'll move ahead of peers who lack them.  At the end of your career, that mid-career trajectory bears fruit.\n\nSo the question is, what path do you want?  If you don't know -- and it's OK that you don't know, job experience will help you figure this out -- then I'd skip the Masters for now.  Because you can always get it (or an MBA) later.\n\nIn \\~26 years in this industry, I've never seen a person with a Masters stand out so much that I wondered why and then discovered that they had a Masters.  That has happened for me with PhD's, that we give super interesting technical problems to and they come up with innovative solutions.  But I haven't seen that with just a MS-CS.",

Another person instead recommended me to write a cover letter, as it is a way to stand out, especially for relatively junior roles with many applicants.\n\nIf you're submitting an application, you are selling yourself. No salesperson in the history of ever has tried to get their counterpart to just read the product description. They want face time, to tell the story of their product, to make an emotional appeal.\n\nDo you think they send out empty e-mails, with just the technical specs attached and the words \"for your kind consideration\"? Or do you think they will use every sentence, every square inch of screen real-estate that they can get to make the other side interested in a conversation?\n\nWhy on earth would anyone believe that the proven process would work differently when the opportunity you want them to grasp is yourself?\n\nFor what it's worth, I currently going through my first hiring process on the employer side - I am sitting past an HR filter, so I don't even know if there were any cover letters; I wasn't giving any. But I can tell you this: The majority (of a very, very small pool) of CVs I have seen would not get a pass from me; there's too many slightly reddish flags, and as desperate as I am to work with a larger team, I simply don't have the time to allow someone to correct the misconceptions that their CV has created in the first place.\n\nBut I would have read a cover letter; I would have read a slightly more detailed CV, and some of the things that tripped me up could have potentially been explained away. Who we invite is not entirely my choice, but I do get a say.\n\nAnd your problem is: I don't aim to be fair, I don't give a damn about giving you a chance. I care about filling a vacancy with someone who primarily has the right skills, enough experience and who I can stand having to talk to a few times a week.\n\nAnd if I know one thing it is this: Once we do hire someone, I lose my voice. I can't get them fired if I think they're a dud, or hard to get along with, so - for my own sake - I have to be very careful and weigh working in a team that's too small vs. working with someone I don't want to work with.\n\nAnd then, neither a CV or a cover letter take eons to write, or to customize for a specific position. Make your documents modular; have blocks that you can shift around if needed, and templates that you can remove or include.\n\nBelieve me, I write cover letters when I apply for jobs. I have zero proof and no data to show that they work - but I really don't see a world where it's not worth the bit of extra effort.",

        "body": "Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. In the same vein, every company will have a different interview process. And some people are just assholes. The process doesn't need to be fair, it just can't (legally) be discriminating against people. \n\nSome companies have recruiters do the initial resume screen. Some companies ask devs or hiring managers to take a look at resumes before deciding to proceed with a candidate (maybe more so for borderline candidates). At my last company, they hired a contract recruiter who knew nothing about the company, and asked him to do all initial screening and the first \"interview,\" even though he knew nothing about the company or the culture. \n\nSome people who review resumes try to be thoughtful. And some are just busy with their work, so they do a really sloppy job or are extra harsh on people. I was late to an interview once because I got stuck on an emergency Teams call. The recruiter pretty much treated me like I was garbage, because how dare I not respect their time? I've seen their company have several rounds of layoffs since then. \n\nThere may be strong disagreements about the interview process a company has decided to implement, but you might be stuck with just following orders. Some companies don't even give any guidance or training, and just assume their devs will know how to interview people. A smarter place would probably have people shadow and have some type of consistency. But plenty of places don't do that. \n\nI myself personally like to read over a resume, see if there's actual interesting things done. I try to see if there's relevant experience. Then, if I interview the person, I ask a mix of real technical questions and deep dive into their resume. I try to get an idea if they really did the work. Can they go into detail? Talk about issues, etc. Or are they elusive and shallow? I also like a lot of back and forth, like you might be working together. I don't like trick questions, but if someone is extremely argumentative or opinionated and not willing to budge on subjective topics, I am likely to pass on them. For me, the gold standard question is, \"would I want to work with this person?\" \n\nThat's part of why you can't put too much weight on interviews. There might be trends and patterns, but there's also a lot of randomness. I interviewed with a CEO and CTO on different days. And they had different visions of the company. I asked my recruiter if I could speak to someone to get clarification on the inconsistencies. I just got ghosted. We give too much authority to interviewers and companies. They are just people, and some of them are actually really bad at their jobs. \n\nTo your point about cover letters, maybe the contract recruiter we hired liked them. But if I wanted to see the cover letter, I had to dig around a clunky recruiting software UI to look for it. The tool didn't have an easy way to look at feedback from other people. And should we even be looking at feedback from other interviewers? Some places allow an interviewer to indicate areas for future interviewers to ask a candidate. Other companies don't want you to see feedback from other interviewers, so it doesn't bias you. It really is a mess. I do believe there are companies who do make a good interview experience for their candidates. But there are tons of places that are just awful. I worked at a company that froze hiring, and I had to stress to the team we should notify candidates, partially just out of human decency and partially in case the process picked up again. \n\nThere are times I've gotten an interview put on my calendar, and when I look at the resume, it looks like complete garbage. I meet the person, and they can barely speak. Like, you're honestly wondering if they have some type of medical issue. How did they get past an initial HR screening? Just like how some people want to be more collaborative, others don't really care and are just focused on metrics. \"I need to write more lines of code, because that's how I'm evaluated. I need to make sure we interview X candidates a week, because that's how I'm evaluated.\"",

Don't be like me in high school. I had ideas that I didn't turn into actual things because I thought it \"was a waste of time\" and that it wouldn't impress recuriters and blah blah blah. Prob my biggest regret is not making the Minecraft mod I've thought of or that funny website.\n\nThe fact you already have some internship in high school will put you ahead of 99% of CS majors, let alone programming since u were a kid. I barely touched code outside of Scratch until I was 15 for god sake. You'll be fine. My recommendation is to reach out to people in different sectors of CS and ask them for a coffee chat, or go on something like Discord and talk with fellow people in the industry. Not only will you maybe learn more about different fields, but you'll be building your network, and I'ma be honest, the people you know will be the reason why you get the job most the time. It's how I got my internship and potentially my first full time position as an app dev.",

If everyone hates it, do something else. Or adapt the process so it works for you.\n\n\nIf you have people in your daily standup who aren't interested in what you're doing, your standup is too large. If most of the attendees are checking their phone or laptop instead of paying attention to who's speaking, your standup is too large. If you find that happening, bring it up with the team and make smaller groups.\n\n\nI honestly feel like a sprint longer than a week is generally too long, although this varies depending on what you're trying to do. I also find this to be a general indication that your stories are too large and need to be broken down more. Agile is all about fast feedback and two weeks to a month (or longer) is too long to go without feedback. If you do shorter sprints, you do need to have much shorter ceremonies as well.\n\n\nIf you have on-call during your sprint, you should reduce the number of stories you plan to handle that sprint. Agile is all about prioritizing things and empowering developers. So if the on-call is the highest priority thing, you as a developer should take that into account when planning out the sprint. Based on past results, if on-call consumes your entire time during the sprint, accept no stories that sprint.\n\n\nYou guys aren't really an agile shop, but very few places are.",

Cultural change is slow, costly, and perilous, and many will resist it with quiet persistence or open force, for the familiar order offers comfort and shelter.\n\nFor a season, one may even learn to navigate - and perhaps benefit from - such dysfunction.

[neetcode: 8 design patterns every developer should know](https://youtu.be/tAuRQs_d9F8?si=My6PZMe7diw444c9) this is a decent intro, I'd recommend finding a modern book in java to continue this. \n\nNext recommendation depends on what versions of Java your company leverages. Java has a robust collection interface that makes it very easy to do many operations on a collection of data though method changing. The stream API. (Java 9)  Java 21 added virtual threads, a huge improvement for concurrency when using I/O heavy processes. \n\nGood luck.",

Java especially I find to be sometimes hard to just understand because so much of it is annotation driven and makes heavy use of dependency injection you don't really know what is going on and I find just live debugging helps me a ton to understand it at that level.  Odds are you'll get tickets about enhancing or creating APIs so knowing the entire flow from endpoint front door down to the business logic can be helpful.",

And getting a good faculty position is even harder.\n\nSo the idea that you're going to get a PhD and land a \"decent\" associate professor position as a backup to just getting a normal corporate job is... misguided. \n\nYou're better off just getting a MS degree to strengthen your resume and trying to land a regular job again. \n\nBecause - unless you are brilliant - what's actually going to happen is you're going to get a PhD, then you're going to be a postdoc for a couple of years making mid money, then you might get a faculty positon at like West Texas A&M University and you get to decide if you want to move to the outskirts of Amarillo, TX for your career. And if that goes well, then maybe after 5 or so years you might have a shot at a faculty position at a school in a metropolitan area with a sushi restaurant.",

Hell no. But it’s also not going to turn you into an OP job candidate. Most jobs don’t require a PhD, therefore having a PhD doesn’t benefit you",

Fake check scam: https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_fake_check\n\n> The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.\n> \n> Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.\n> \n> When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html\n> \n> If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.",

It's a field where some MechEng will be super helpful, and you may also find computer vision and university-level mathematics (perhaps a minor) very useful. Math topics like linear algebra, statistics, and especially machine learning are highly relevant.\n\n\nBasically, robotics is a field where a relevant masters' or PhD are beneficial because it needs such a good foundation of math, programming, and engineering. You can enter the discipline without a masters' or PhD (probably a science or engineering program), but it will be a lot harder and you'll need to develop your skills without those structured courses.",

I get a front row seat to listen for our customer's requirements while in meetings with our sales rep and the common question floats \"Do you sell AI in your product?\".\n\nPeople are hyped for AI, that includes our business customers, and its taking great effort for us to bake AI into our product and compete on time. We're being charged more than what a big company would be charged for using AI services because our projected volume of consuming AI tokens are much smaller than big companies. Big companies are winning the competition in many markets right now as they have more resources and investments to spend with getting their AI services into the market much sooner with more precision.\n\nWith that being said, we've buckled down and locked in the team with more hats to wear, haven't had a new hire in our department since the layoffs.\n\nwhen the AI hype is over, people and businesses will realize the valuable relationship and products that come from these small/medium businesses and come back. Once once they see gains in revenue, I believe they'll open up positions as they're confident they can support a bigger workforce once again.\n\nAnother opportunity for more positions to open up with small/medium businesses is tax breaks and or more affordable AI services these businesses can use for selling AI features in their products to compete in the competitive market.",

The only thing you'd have to worry about is a potentially smaller selection of hot startups.

Any time off you want to take should be planned and taken prior to giving any kind of notice to your current company.",

Some background to my internship, I have worked on a couple apps in React Native and Angular mostly on the frontend, but am going to pick up C# and start doing backend work as well. For my projects, I changed the names for anonymity. The philo app is basically completed I am very proud of it, but hasn't been used for the event yet, so I am not sure how exactly to quantify the impact of it. The second project is a group project for one of my classes I have essentially lead, that is still in progress but we have a good prototype ready. The numbers I kind of made up because I am not sure how exactly to quantify that. For technical skills, what am I missing to be competitive in this market? I don't have much AWS or cloud experience so maybe a project there can help is what I am thinking.\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1\\_A490aJK2lG5O7Xll9cUY39v78HzF9Im/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_A490aJK2lG5O7Xll9cUY39v78HzF9Im/view?usp=sharing)",
