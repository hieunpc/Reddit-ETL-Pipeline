A common loading pattern we have been using is:\n\n\n- for streaming: source --> Kafka --> snowflake (snowpipe streaming to tables)\n\n\n- for batches: source --> AWS s3 (~lake) --> snowflake (external tables)\n\n\n- in both cases once in Snowflake: raw staged tables (bronze) --> structured, type-cast, deidentified views (silver) --> Kimball/star/mart views with metadata (gold)\n\n\nI've been liking this system so far. The key difference with streaming and batch in the above cases are that the batch method keeps the raw/bronze data in s3 via external tables, so I guess that's a \"lake\", while the streaming method loads the CDC events into a table resting in the snowflake data warehouse. We use dagster to orchestrate and dbt to run the jobs. The technologies are good - the challenges are behavioural in nature.\n\n\nThere's probably a more consistent way to do the above, but it does work. I guess the lake/s3 component just exists because it is simple and cheap to read from some provided s3 dump than to add a \"copy into\" step. We would probably would have done the same for streaming, but snowpipe streaming is a good enough solution at the moment so we can skip a redundant intermediate load to s3.",

Model the infrastructure (make it modular and scalable), create some processes, and give power to the people within some defined boundaries. It’s more work, but I feel it’s easier — after inital cost I can go do streaming, swap out tools, optimize DB tables, create alert systems and stuff.\n\nPlus the experience managing your own files, metadata, debugging fucking notebooks is atrocious.

Or you end in a company on a budget where you have large amounts of data. Here you learn to be good, while the first is where you learn to be a consultant 😂\n\nBut my experience, the business starts by hiring data science / “ML” experts and then they find out they need data. At this moment the salary of the experts is ticking, so when the data engineer comes in, he/she is already behind schedule. Therefore you will never be successful.\n\nI think a lot of newcomers experience this. While the data science people will always be against you, because it is easy to blame the data engineer.",

        "body": "I've been in 3 different roles as a Data Engineer, and they've all been so wildly different to me and without knowing more specifics without your role, I can't give too specific advice. But here are some general pointers from when I first started that might help.\n\n\\- Learn general data engineering practices / lingo. You're going to hear things like: Data Governance, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage, Data Warehouse, ETL, ELT, Data Lake, OLAP, OLTP, Data Mesh, etc. You don't have to learn everything all at once, or even fully understand everything the first time. Start with who / what you'll work with, expand from there.\n\n\\- Learn SQL VERY well. Two sides to this: learn a dialect VERY well and learn a database implementation well.  \nThe former will help you with your day to day job as a junior. Learning how to solve common patterns, use common functions, solve common SQL problems, etc will help you for your whole career. For the latter, you would want to really be able to explain things like indexes (which ones to use, why), data storage internals, how to read execution plans and optimize, etc. This is something you should be picking up gradually throughout your career, and I would only expect more mid level / senior engineers to know more and more about these things. For a junior, just begin learning it slowly, but don't stress out too much. \n\n\\- Lots of companies are now on the cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP). If your company is one of them, you should learn the stack. Learn the services that your company is using, what role / problem it solves, and how to configure/work with it. Whatever your company uses, be it Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift for data warehousing, ADLS / AWS S3 for object storage, learn that tech deeply, learn how authorization/authentication works on your cloud platform, and those two alone will carry forth across cloud providers. Once you learn what you work with, you can slowly expand outwards if you so desire. \n\n\\- Additional point to the above, lots of companies also use Databricks / Snowflake. If applicable, learn what each of those companies provide in terms of offerings or services. IMHO learning either of these opens the door for more data engineering roles in the future.\n\n\\- Maybe a controversial tip, but as a software engineer turned data engineer, I personally still apply software engineering principals just through a data engineering lens. That means following best practices when writing clean code, working with things like CI/CD, git, code review, etc. This may seem like a no brainer, but not every shop hires data engineers from the software engineer / CS grad pipeline. Lots of DEs I knew came from data analyst or scientist positions, and had no clue of the SWE fundamentals. I think treating this job as a specialized SWE position will help you a LOT with the menial stuff, and it'll allow you to pivot if you ever want to.\n\nI omitted a lot, but I think this is good to start, and I think these are general enough to help you no matter what kind of DE position you're put into.

I am not sure about your proficiency in either, but try to solve some difficult problems in both without using AI (or may be ask AI to generate questions for you to solve).   \n  \nIn SQL, try to build common patterns in data engineering with some sample data - MERGE INTO, SCD Type 2, some small star schema design.  \n  \nIn python, know common patterns used with data structures - list, dict, set and iterators. \n\nThese will help you in first few months. You can slowly move towards understanding the bigger data engineering architecture - SQL Optimization techniques, ETL, Data Vault modelling. I recommend you get 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering' book and read it once in a while. Re-read the concepts again once every few months as it will add new perspectives as you gain experience.  \n\nOnce you master SQL and python, tools are not going to be difficult for you. You will get to see that irrespective of tool - Spark or Snowflake, Airflow or ADF (or any GUI based orchestration) - the build patterns and outcomes are almost exactly same. \n\nWhile you master technical things, also try to be curious about the business problem you are solving. It doesn't matter if you know 4 different tools, if you cannot answer what business problem you solved. For this, AI would be immensely helpful. Let's say someone wants to build a CRM dashboard for which you are building data model - You might hear terms like Sales Funnel or Conversion rate - Try to ask AI and get an overall perspective of the problem you are trying to solve. You will work with lot of business analysts who will be more than happy if you talk their language. \n\nThese should be enough for now. ",

We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.\n\nBut rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one. If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.\n\nThe return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.\n\nThe real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.\n\nWorth having a direct conversation about it. Ask what specific concern drives the no dependencies stance. Sometimes it's a bad experience with a package breaking, which is valid but solvable with pinned versions and testing.",

A few years from now you'll be that much more versed in things I guess?  \n\nLike, I had nobody to review my code.  If anyone had to go back and look at it, it was me.

The S3 permission thing is a pretty big red flag though, especially if you ever want to expose access to other tools or less trusted users.\n\nOne possible improvement: add a “paranoid mode” section in the repo that documents workarounds for the S3 perms (eg. proxy service, per‑project buckets, or using a separate object store if someone really needs granular ACLs). Also some rough cost sizing examples for different instance sizes would be gold.",

So you're still in that window. \n\nYou can't make up for the tech debt and disorganisation of some places.\n\nDocumentation is a mess absolutely everywhere and those consolidation projects take years and fail every time, in that there will be N+1 repositories. And then they will do it again. It's the biggest boondoggle in the business. \n\nFunnily, they always go hard on permissions on that latest repository and will require multiple panel reviews and checkins for literally anything you want to put in, to the point it's impossible to use. \n\nSo don't think about that anymore. Focus on building your own documentation silo wherever it is and however you want to. The goal is a foundation for your own work, not a general thing for other people. \n\nAnd you've got other responsibilities? That's also common. Try to see it as a good thing in that you get some extra job stability. \n\nThat aside, are people complaining? Have you looked around and realised there are others who have been there for years or decades and not pulling their own weight? lol. They probably created most of these problems too!\n\nThis is all extremely common. If you move on now you will likely experience the same thing and worse, so my advice: seeing as you are not fully invested in this job, try to see it as your personal playground to try some other working and thinking styles, until you find something that lets you function there without the anxiety.\n\nIf anyone ever asks something you don't know, you're not the expert on that, but will try to find someone (and often, people will just forget it entirely!) If anyone calls you out on not knowing every atom in the universe, just repeat the same thing. Some people are aggressive like that but it's not you, they just have it in for easy prey.

The official Docker docs are solid, and TechWorld with Nana has good intro videos if you prefer something visual.For Terraform, Terraform: Up and Running by Brikman is the standard recommendation for good reason. Work through the first few chapters and deploy something real, even if it is just a storage bucket with IAM policies attached. The plan/apply/destroy muscle memory is what makes it click.For CI/CD, GitHub Actions is the lowest-friction starting point for most DE projects. Build a pipeline that runs your dbt tests and deploys on merge to main. Once you have done that once, the concepts generalize to Jenkins, GitLab CI, or whatever else you run into.Raw Kubernetes knowledge is rarely needed for DE work specifically. Most orchestration on GKE or EKS you interact with through Helm charts or managed Airflow, and the k8s internals stay hidden. Docker and Terraform solid first.",

The other is to think about distinctions between: abstraction, generalization, opacity, and other similar \"operating at high level\".\n\nUsually abstraction in engineers context means finding a simplifying solution over otherwise individuated problems.  Example, any math theorem you learned in school, or theory in engineering.  So the abstractions applicability is limited to the details covered.\n\nThus how abstract is your problem space and what are the details, in rough terms it's variety.  Then do the solving & problem abstractions vary in requisite ways?\n\nSo to answer, if you are truly lost in core syntax and implements like debugging, you don't fully know the abstraction.  But does not mean anyone cannot use the abstractions, just being general to a problem or solution.  With all the abstractions these days, you won't know everything and a general knowledge is often where one starts.\n\nLastly your final questions around AI model roles, my feel this is opacity not (your) competence.  The core vector and matrix abstractions in AI and context models are not that deep, nor new.  But given they're \"cutting edge\"-ness often these models are purposefully opaque.  So if you simply cannot see detail, don't blame your abstraction skills lol",

You can setup a data flow task that you can first do a lookup on your incoming source data against the target data.  Then decide what to do when it matches vs what to do when it doesn't match.  \n\nBut honestly this feels clunky to me.  While idk for sure what's happening behind the scenes, I assume its just a simple merge statement.   But throwing in these tasks make some things more confusing when trying to debug.  I would rather just write the merge statement myself.",

The \"interface\" changes with model updates. Your DBT model doesn't randomly decide to restructure itself, but your AI-generated pipeline might.\n\nThe debugging question is real. When traditional abstractions fail, you trace through layers until you find the bug. When AI abstractions fail, you're often just... prompting again and hoping. That's a fundamentally different failure mode.\n\nI don't think abstractions are traps.

That is all irrespective of AI.\n\nI do agree with your idea of treating metrics like APIs, that’s a really key thing to get right for AI, and you’ve got some other really good practices in there too. I just think what successful teams are doing now is evolving data governance, rather than rejecting it. It’s still governance.",

The hard part of your job is not writing SQL, it's knowing which parameter to look at based on domain knowledge. That's exactly where AI struggles.Where AI actually helps me is the tedious stuff. Debugging weird errors, generating boilerplate tests, converting between formats. I'd say 6/10 useful is about right for debugging help. Where it falls apart is anything requiring judgment about your specific business [context. My](http://context.My) honest take after a year of heavy Claude usage for data work is that the people who are no longer doing anything technical are probably working on much simpler problems than yours. When you're eyeballing raw files to figure out which field is correct because documentation doesn't exist, there's no prompt that replaces that institutional knowledge.Try Claude for the parts of your job you already know how to do but find tedious. That's where it shines. Skip the hype about agents replacing analytics engineers, that's not happening anytime soon for anyone doing real domain-specific work.",

A 2-year gap is not the resume killer it feels like from the inside. Hiring managers who actually read applications (not all do) will see someone with hands-on experience who went through something rough, not someone who cannot do the work.\n\nI'd push back on applying for data entry or data reporting roles though. Those won't get you back toward DE, they'll push you sideways into a different track. Junior DE or data analyst roles at smaller companies are a better target. Smaller companies care less about the gap and more about whether you can do the job. A GitHub project with an end-to-end pipeline you built recently will do more than any resume line.\n\nOne framing that might help in interviews: you have the foundational skills, you took time off for a medical reason, and you spent it recovering and figuring out what you actually want.

The math is nontrivial. Linear algebra, especially rotation matrices and quaternions for coordinate transforms, and the Newtonian equations you'd learn in a 1st year calculus based physics class, and also a bunch of other stuff that I had to learn/relearn to work here. (I have an undergrad degree in math.) I don't have to *implement* everything, but I do need to understand what's going on conceptually and use appropriate mathematical libraries correctly.\n2. The folks I work with are PhDs, so a lot of building a pipeline is listening, very carefully to what the (let's say) rocket scientist wants and building exactly that. No creative metrics here. The physics is the physics. I ask a lot of questions about what is supposed to happen through a series of calculations. What does a good result and a bad result look like? Where are the best places along the way to spot-check things like an intermediate matrix becoming ill-conditioned?\n3. The PhD's are not hired for coding ability. I need to detangle messy MATLAB code to turn into data pipelines that I actually want to own and maintain over time.\n\nI work on the \"easy\" stuff that still fits in a Postgres database. So, I use python and other fairly standard tools. I want to upskill into rust/pyO3 which I'd hope would make some of the calculations complete faster than numpy/scipy. I suspect I do a lot more software engineering than my retail data engineer peers: There is a lot of custom code written specifically for our particular uses/devices that just isn't available in open source libraries or even as a commercial product (besides the stuff sold by my employer and our direct competitors).",

It's not a pure management role, nor a pure technical role either.\n* Only you can decide whether going to the office for one additional day per week changes your mind.\n* I think if \"AI Proofing\" is on your mind - you should pick the startup. In a big company it's very easy for some Muppet in a board room to decide that AI can do your job. On the other hand a growing startup usually knows exactly why they hired you and will retain you irrespective of AI.",

Our dbx admin was clueless having never worked in Postgres before\n\nAnd why are there like 7 different identifiers instead of 3 to talk about the database, schema table? (The dbx compute, the dbx catalog, dbx schema, Postgres database, and the Postgres schema too maybe?) the only thing in common is table names and schema. Everything else is different\n\nThere is no way in SQL editor to safely know what actual Postgres instance you’re in besides the compute name at the top which may not line up with the database name and also if it’s too long will be abbreviated spelling trouble whether you’re in dev or stage or potentially even prod. Open a new tab you better triple check which compute instance you’re in otherwise you’re going to have a bad day.\n\nThis seems like a rushed implementation on the paid for version",

When Pandas infers types from Postgres it sometimes gets more specific than PySpark did, especially with numeric precision and timestamps. You end up with timestamp with tz vs without, or int32 vs int64, and the UNION fails.\n\nWhat worked for us was adding a casting layer in the raw zone specifically for the new ingestion path. Basically land the data as-is into a staging table, then have a simple transform that casts everything to match the old schema before it hits the raw layer the VIEW references. Keeps the VIEW logic clean.\n\nOn question 2, if you are switching to the new ingestion permanently anyway you might consider letting the new types be canonical and backfilling the old data with a one-time cast migration instead of maintaining two type systems forever. Depends on how much historical data and how painful the backfill would be.",

For example, if the old is a varchar and the new is an int, use varchar - you can implicitly convert any int into varchar but there's no way of getting non-numeric varchars into ints. The downside of this is that you're losing the benefit of having an appropriate data type, so you're probably going to use more storage and invite unoptimised behaviour by downstream tooling.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the old data will actually change at all. Using our example, if the historic data was stored as varchar but you can query to confirm all the values can be converted to int, simply do that in the view. You would only want to do this if you're sure that the historic data is static though, because if not you're inviting a failure condition if anyone puts non-numeric data in the varchar.",

Define the types of the temp table to match your data from python then cast to the desired types in the query that copies from temp to target. Another benefit of that is that the copy query can join or anti-join with the target table to implement upsert or insert-ignore logic.\n\nInstead of the join view I would recommend copying the old data to the new table and then just appending it with new data.",

So far, nobody really has. We all see at this point that it’s a huge bubble similar to the .com bubble, and we’ll probably see similar result - AI is likely here to stay, but it probably won’t be used very differently than how it’s being used today and the demand to put AI into every app or service will die down. \n\nIn the programming world, that means that we’ll probably get used to tools like Claude Code or Copilot and adopt patterns where we let it write the boring parts for us, but skilled programmers will still be valuable when building complex software while using these tools. We’ll likely see a knock-on effect of even cheaper compute as all these data centers are built to meet a demand for AI will inevitably to drop off.\n\nIn the short- to medium-term, there’s probably a pretty penny to be made by contractors who can untangle the mess of code written by companies who went overboard on writing their software with AI.\n\nSo I guess TL;DR is that if you’re a total AI Luddite you should probably at least experiment with AI to get used to where it’s helpful and where it isn’t. If you’re an AI hype beast, you should probably make sure not to let your actual technical skills atrophy because the future where AI writes 100% of the code is just not coming.

You should be able to run your code, and see that a chrome browser opens up, navigates to the site you specified in code, does the things you expected, and then shuts down. Suggestion: Have it perform this 10 times, and you calculate the average times between each action.

Write a for-loop or an equivalent that prints every X amount of money spent on lottery tickets until you hit the jackpot. It'll teach you basics about for-loops, ToString(), classes and to avoid lotteries.\n* Create an API that you can test using Postman/Insomnia (real world valuable experience).\n* Create a windows service (if you are learning .net that is), that you can install, start, stop, restart in windows gui (also valuable experience).\n* Install Docker Desktop or the equivalent on your computer.

I can just add a template file to a directory and it'll use it. That builds the texts I can bulk or individually send out. As I work, it dynamically keeps track of my availability across the day and updates the scripts for me on the fly as my schedule fills up.\n\nAlthough it has some required fields in the single SQLite table it uses, like first name, last name, phone, status, but other than that, it can import any csv file with at least those field names into it and it'll just slurp up whatever and show the fields from the csv in the GUI.  It also has a customized note taking page where I can put the customer's data into a UI and it'll save is as a json document in a directory and attach the name of that file to the client record.  That document is also a json document, so I can modify it without coding anything and those fields in the notes are not on the client record directly and they don't need to be. I could of course add them later to any data structure I want if I want to.\n\nAlso, now I can parse PDF files for data, match them to a record and update the database and attach the now renamed pdf file to that client and open it in a window from the gui.  I can also create a new record if one doesn't exist, or just fail and spit out a not found. Whatever I need it to do at the time.\n\nThat pdf view window dynamically changes to the corresponding file if I change customers in the gui by selecting, hitting the next or previous client or page buttons, and doesn't break if it's not there, it just happily displays there's no pdf file found for that one.\n\nIt also has color themes, a dark, light, slate, blue and pink themes. These are CSS files and if you want to add one you just drop it in by the name light.css, dark.css into a config directory and it'll pick it up and let you select that from the menu and save it so it always uses that theme until you change it again, with all the other config options that you set as well. They all stay active until changed across runs.\n\nIt can build lists I can use for bulk texts or anything else I can dream up for it. I can just code that in.\n\nAs I built it and made changes, I just kept adding the ability to customize it from the way it used to work, to the new capability. So, it basically just gets more and more powerful over time. Everything it could ever do, it can still do perfectly fine.\n\nIt's awesome and it's 100% mine, 100% free, and 100% not on the cloud, it doesn't even use a web browser either, although it easily could, but I like that it doesn't for now.\n\nWould it pass corporate IT coding standards. NOPE! I wrote them so I know, NOPE! and I like it that way.\n\nIs it easy to use - Yep.\n\nIs it user friendly - Nope.\n\nIs it well documented - other than the code is clearly written - NOPE. lol\n\nThat's (Hell\\^Nope)\n\nDid I vide code it? Kinda. I've got plenty of experience writing software. Big software. No direct experience writing anything quite like this before. It's got the simplest data model I've ever used in any DB lol. There's a lot of room for more things it could do here in the future if I get around to needing it. For now, I just don't.\n\nI started with free AI because I didn't know a some of the available API's and I wanted to try them out. I went through a few of these before I found one I liked and wanted to work with.  AI got me off the ground with them,\n\nI got amazingly far down the line of a prototype and before I knew it, I had something basically working.  As I kept adding more capability however, it quickly ran out of context area and now gets lost and makes so may errors and just poor coding choices I rarely use it anymore. The cool thing is I don't really need it now. I learned the API I landed on and I'm comfortable taking it from here. I also got a very good idea of what AI can and can't do these days as well.\n\nReplace coders and people with technical skills? Maybe some junior slog roles. It can be used to write slog job automation that would have otherwise been way out of scope and not cost effective.\n\nWhat are you going to replace them with? Don't even tell me business analysts. Don't even think about telling me corporate executives or nepo babies. They don't know their ass from a hole in the ground and AI isn't going to help for that. They can't bully a robot caddie into ignoring that extra swing and a miss. I wonder how they make it through the day without dying.",

These are all high level tasks that previously entered at mid level stage and grew in importance as you moved towards principal/staff engineer position. Coding agents cut out the lower rungs of the ladder and now you need those skills from the get go. Your knowledge of software design, system design, understanding of product development and life cycle, the thinking and the vision and where your value now lies as an ai assisted software engineer. I am investing my time into getting comfortable with agentic engineering, ramping up my system design knowledge, software patterns, technology and system solutions to common problems - everything that I need to know when AI is bullshitting me, when it is heading in the wrong direction, what are viable options etc. The profession is changing, and being able to wrangle syntax alone is no longer enough.\n\nSo, I would say it is not about being ai resistant, it is more about being ai effective.

Learn how to apply abstractions with protocols and ABCs, and injecting with FastAPI depends(). Start with just a REPL app if you must while you get the core structure, then evolve into fastAPI. (You can just write to a json file until you get a DB connected) \n\nBut I’d look into fastAPI, sqlalchemy for ORM, Alembic for migrations, pydantic for serialization and DTOs. Etc. \n\nYou have a lot to learn with Python alone. Could also throw in unit testing with pytest, also start thinking about docker, see if you can get a dockerfile + compose to spin up your app in one container and Postgres in another (I’d recommend focus on Postgres). It’s a lot if you want to go full stack with Python. It’s also not like C# where repo and unit if work patterns are implemented for you.

In many segments you focus on one solutions such as git.   However you should make a point to highlight a number of similar systems.   The idea is to make students aware that there are many options.   Covering the common solution is find after highlighting that students have lots of options.   I actually like that GIT and VIM coverage as good introductions.\n\n2.   I'm still of the opinion that everyone needs to learn VIM, as a command line tool, to some extent.   It is the VIM is everywhere base reality.     However in the modern world using the command line environment with a GUI editor of choice might lead to more productive students.   I'm not even sure students grasp that command line control can be mixed with GUI apps.   This may be personal thing but I find GUI based editors far more productive.   So in the same regards a paragraph that list out a few alternative command line an and GUI editors to inform students makes sense.\n\n3.   A port for compiled languages or an additional segment within this package, would be useful for programs that don't use Python.   A focus on C++ would be advisable as the use of GCC is similar for many languages.  The idea is not to teach the language, but to teach how programs are built with compilers.\n\n  \nLike I said only a very brief view of this site, but guys it looks like it covers much of which sidelines students at the start.   In fact this sort of stuff should be covered in a high school prep course.",

I do not mean that one should start lying and exaggerating things but I mean, be confident in what you know and in what you do not know. \"Yeah, I do not know frontend development but I'm considering learning it.\" or \"I'm a backend developer but having to do frontend tasks seems to be a good challenge.\" I have told these. Not during interviews but during 1:1s when I was moved to a fullstack position. And my boss was fine. Because she saw that I actually show an interest in improving myself. If I would be \"I'm worried about frontend tasks. I really hope I will not get any of these. Backend tasks are much safer bet.\" then that would be bad. Lack of confidence, no wish to grow, perhaps even stagnation.\n\nThen lack of confidence when being on probation period. Cool, you got hired! You passed all these interviews. But the next 2-5 (however long time period) months are also critical. Either you pass the probation period or the company has to tell that \"Sorry. We considered it but we do not see how things will progress from here.\" Perhaps different countries have different laws and such, but where I live, a person is put on a \"test period\" of a couple of months before his contract is finalized (meanwhile the contract is temporary). So, some juniors, they are not confident. They do not ask questions. They do not share their thoughts. They do not participate in discussions over new tasks and such. They get stuck and do not voice it out. They start comparing themselves with younger colleagues who have been in the field for longer time, then get some irrational fears, and let it affect themselves even more negatively.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say: this field indeed is difficult. But one should be confident in himself. Have a growth mindset. When you see you are lacking in something do not see it as a weakness but see it as an opportunity to learn new things. When you see that people are more experienced and more skilled than you then do not see this as a threat but as an opportunity to learn from them.",

        "body": "Professional software developer here, and I agree with everything you've said. Building on your post, here's an analogy from my own experience that I think supports your point:\n\nI learned to write code before I learned to cook. I was equally interested/enamored by each of these skills when I first started to learn them.\n\nOne of the first things I learned to cook was [stir fried chicken with rice noodles][stir-fry]. For at least a month, I made this dish several times per week. This repetition afforded me space to observe and learn - I noticed when the color of some ingredients started to change in the cooking utensil (an observation I wasn't previously able to make). I started adding other ingredients to the dish because I had learned some intuition (which gave me confidence that even if my didn't turn out great, it wouldn't be terrible) over repeated exposure. Slowly, I was able to rely on visual cues without needing to set a timer (\"hey! the broccoli is starting to look like it's cooked\" instead of \"it's coming up on 3min, time turn down the heat\"). This is how I learned how to cook and how to understand what I was seeing on the stove. Prior to this, I had watched many cooking shows/videos and family and friends had even tried to show/teach me - all of this was \"tutorial hell\" and I never felt like I knew what I was doing. One lesson from this experience is that \"know what you're doing\" doesn't come before you build something for the first time. It's actually the other way around - you learn by doing stuff.\n\n<aside>  \nWhen I say that, I am reminded of providing tech support for my grandma. She'd always be afraid that she was going to accidentally break something. This is a real concern with programming languages - you could potentially delete files or crash your OS through some bug. But starter/learning projects rarely expose you to that functionality. If you're still afraid, consider using a virtual machine.  \n</aside>\n\nIt wasn't until I read this post, OP, that I made the connection between this cooking practice and something else I did when I was learning to write code (back in 2007 - I'm old, I guess). After I first learned python, I would often (and for no real reason other than \"I like to write code\") write a decimal to binary function in python. Sometimes it would take me a long time to write (30min was not uncommon), sometimes I'd write it in a few minutes. The point was never to write it quickly to \"beat my personal record\". The point was always to practice this new skill. Sometimes I'd write it recursively, sometimes I'd try something different.\n\nBut this repeated practice did for me, the same thing that repeatedly cooking the stir fry did. I was able to study different ways of solving the same problem and hone my understanding of how python works. Now, I didn't write my decimal to binary converter every day - I think the most frequently I did this was \"once a week\" for a few weeks (then, about once a month, and I eventually started to use it to test whether I liked a new keyboard). At the time for me, it was like re-reading my favorite passage out of my favorite fiction book (the was before Netflix, so that might translate today as \"rewatching my favorite episode of a TV show\").\n\nThat's really the secret sauce - practice for familiarity. When I use LLMs today, the value for me is that the LLM writes the code. The time savings for me comes from not having to physically type out the code. The thinking that goes into it beforehand (what architecture to use, what algorithm to use, what data structures to use, how to model the data flow and problem solving, etc; If I haven't yet made these decisions, I have a conversation with the LLM to help me decide) - I communicate all of that to the LLM and let it do very little beyond writing the code I described.\n\nIt does feel counterintuitive that learning to write code requires as much time and practice, because this learning time is often compared to learning other skills that require more time and practice to acquire and gain proficiency in. The key realization is that while learning to write code is faster than (say) learning to become a neurosurgeon, it still takes a lot (nowhere near zero) of time and effort. And while the proficiency threshold to make a meaningful contribution is lower than in many other professions, that threshold is not a plateau - the proficiency curve does go a lot higher and I think this might be one reason why beginners often get a wide range of feedback (from experienced developers with a wide range of proficiency levels)\n\nOk I took a couple of rambling tangents (sorry, it's Sunday afternoon), but the takeaways are:\n\n1. repeated exposure and practice are the key to escaping tutorial hell\n1. the proficiency threshold to \"build something\" is much lower to escape tutorial hell than it is to (for example) contribute to an existing project in a professional or opensource capacity\n1. the probability of accidentally making a catastrophic error is very low\n1. the notion that repeated exposure improves proficiency is not new (my cooking story), thought that's maybe more of a \"hard truth\" than a \"comforting fact\" as I had originally intended it to be\n\n[stir-fry]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8f752SdeAI",

In my opinion the idea of “build something” makes you consider how *you* might build a thing, not follow someone else’s methodology.  It’s possible the thing you want to build has never been built before or at least hasn’t been built before the way you want to.  So you need to go out and find info about how to build the pieces and parts that you can, and extrapolate and experiment with the rest until it works the way you want.  Along the way you have to make a myriad of decisions that will all teach you about architecture or storage or performance or what have you.  For me, this is the actual work of learning programming.\n\nedit: spelling.",

I like to learn a lot allround about the new stack at first, and then only when something strikes me as interesting or different, I might take a deep dive into that, but I don't want to learn every single detail one step at a time - as most documentations otherwise seem to suggest.\n\nI have a few \"basic\" projects that I always implement, like a \"guess which number I'm thinking of\" game, a small shoot'em up game, a simple text-adventure, and a CRUD frontend as well as backend, and pick whichever looks most like what I want to build in this new language.\n\nOnce I've reimplemented the old project, I begin my new, actual project, what I intended to use the new stack for - first by planning the features required, and which ones I already know how to implement based on my reimplementation, and which ones I have to learn more about - and then I learn about those things in depth if needed!  \n",

A proper internship gives you mentorship, code reviews, reasonable deadlines, and the space to actually understand what you're building instead of just shipping it.Practical advice: document every single thing you're building and deploying right now. Screenshots, architecture decisions, problems you solved — all of it goes in your portfolio. This experience, framed correctly on a resume, is genuinely valuable.

Imagine us telling \"Yeah, learn that Go.\" You'll learn it. Nobody in your area is developing his stuff in Go. Countries differ, job markets differ. What is in use in one place can be not in demand in another place.\n\nNow, to your questions:\n\n1)Backend is backend. If you are targeting web application development you won't be using any other math than some simple primary school math. And sometimes even not that. There won't be any difference between picking Python or Java or PHP or something else. If you have to add up your end-user's monthly bills you will use a simple primary school math.\n\nThe only thing you do have to look into is Boolean algebra. AND, OR, NOT and the combinations of these in IF/ELSE blocks. To decide how the process flow will switch based on one or another criteria. But you should have studied it during your degree studies. In Discrete Mathematics course or such.\n\nYou'll need more math in data science.\n\n2)Pick the backend language based on job offers in your area. Sure, you can pick some language that less juniors are using... but you won't be using it at all if there is no demand after it.\n\n3)If you are going to work in web application development you'll need SQL and git for sure. Linux can come useful when having to do some devops. But also useful in general. Stuff more often than not just work when working in a Linux or a Mac. In Windows you have to figure out how to get it working in your WSL and stuff.\n\nNo idea about boot.dev. But as you already have a degree then whichever bootcamp you are picking, should just remind you what you were studying 7 years ago.\n\nYou do need OOP and DSA but that should also be covered by your degree studies, already. It won't be anything new. Just a refreshment course for you.\n\nNow, when it comes to remote jobs then there you should be less optimistic. Better target local office jobs. At least where I live (a country in Europe) they are more often expecting the new junior to show up in the office. For onboarding, for mentoring, etc. It is a bit risky to let a new junior to work remotely on his own. Not saying that there won't be any remote jobs, for you, but expect to find an office job before finding a remote job.\n\nAnd when it comes to a saturation then a web application development in general is a saturated field. Does not matter if you are picking Python, Java, Go, PHP or something else. Because everybody is \"speedrunning\" and trying to get a job fast. And a web application development has its entry barrier lower than in data science and such, where one might need more theoretical knowledge in things.",

Is Python backend math, heavy? Would Java be safer?\n\nBackend Python isnt heavy on math at all. Most of the work is around APIs, databases, authentication, and business logic. The intense math in Python comes in AI and data science, which you can totally stay away from. Java isnt having less math than Python; theyre pretty much the same in this aspect.\n\n2. Should you pivot to Java to avoid Python saturation?\n\nJava is definitely a good choice in enterprises, but changing to it now would stop you from moving forward fast. What is more important is if you can build backend systems and talk about them. After your gaining understanding of backend fundamentals, it will be very easy for you to learn Java.\n\n3. Should you stick with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) and learn OOP, DSA, Linux, SQL, and Git?\n\nYup... Those are good to have backend skills. SQL, Git, Linux, and backend architecture are the things used all the time in real jobs and will make you employable no matter the language.\n\nThe most significant factor is practical experience. I usually give a junior candidate, who has built and deployed projects and can talk about them in detail, a clear advantage in comparison with one who hasn't.",

The efficiency, the cost, when to use it vs another option, etc. To work on social skills and networking. The rest of the learning comes with experience. You'll have to make a choice for the coding language you learn, and none of them are bullet proof for you to have a great job and job stability. Getting in there and getting your hands dirty is all you can do.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the main positions that use heavy math are the AI, data analyst, and machine learning. Backend dev doesn't need as much math, just the ability to understand efficiency for data calls. Good luck man!",

For me that was low-level graphics. I sincerely believe the exact technologies are not vital for internships, rather it's about showing your appetite for learning. Knowing OS fundamentals, and having practical projects with memory management, and cache-awareness in mind already knocks the majority of competitors out, especially for internships if you are targeting low-level domain (most go for latest and greatest shiny deployable frameworks).\n\nIf backend is referring to servers, databases, and interfacing with web, I have no idea.  \nFor more closer to metal, I assume getting an Arduino starter kit and do some of the guided projects could be a good idea.\n\nIt sounds like you simply need to do the reps with any type of project. I believe you don't really \"study\" programming. Rather, you start with something you want to create. Unless you are following a tutorial step-by-step (which I highly do not recommend), you have to be inquisitive and work your way backwards from the goal, to figuring out what's needed, and then figuring how to build those blocks.\n\nNaturally, based on problems you want to solve, you find that you want to express some computation, where you then realize that you need some language constructs to do so (just like normal language).\n\nAs a personal aside, it wasn't until after Year 3 (of 5) in uni where I started doing any fully self-directed projects. I understand the \"feeling lost\" emotion well. My gateway was a 3D graphics course using Direct3D and reading various old and new blogs of seasoned graphics programmers, even when I  barely understood most and half understood some. A million instances of trial and error from \"I don't understand this, let me try myself\" later and today I work with GPU drivers.  \n  \nYou do not have to have it all click and figured out with bombastic portfolio by the end of Year 2.",

For me, I just worked as a mid level developer, then one day I applied for a job as a senior at a company, got the job and now I'm a senior. I'd keep an eye out for senior roles you can apply for. If you get the role you can either take it or use the offer to negotiate your promotion at your current company.

Don't identify problems that aren't really problems. For instance, if the code base is full of cruft and you say \"the code is bad and I'd like to clean it up, let me lead a team for 6 months to rewrite it\" then you're just stepping on toes.\n\n\nInstead, be ready to show the ROI and to show you've thought through the hard parts of what you propose and already have a feasible solution.\n\n\nOne of the first things I did when transitioning to lead was identify a problem with our database. Every day we got an automated data feed, which triggered a program that dropped a large table, did a bulk data import, reindexed it, and ran a bunch of queries. Almost like clockwork, the DBMS would fall to its knees and one or more senior people would do a little fire drill, 45 minutes wasted every day. They were just used to it and couldn't think outside the box. I did a proof of concept that did everything totally differently and placed almost no load on the DBMS, studiously avoiding any hint that the people who came up with the original system were idiots, and my project was adopted with me as the implementer. My star at that company rose significantly because they could see I could be entrusted with more than run-of-the-mill tasks.",

        "body": "Everyone has answered things really well, but I want to touch on the question about whether folder structure is essential and does it depend on the framework.\n\nWhile others are correct that folder structure is not bound, required, or essential; it is often very important to the build tools you may, or may not, be using.  Different build tools whether they are used in JavaScript, Java, C/C++, all follow some standard folder structure.  Most Java projects are built with Gradle, Maven, or Ant and the Java folder structure is pretty rigid among these.  Cmake for C/C++ is less picky about folder structure as your program's include statements control much of that.  React, Svelte, and many JavaScript frameworks also use their own folder structure.  Even Rebar3 for Erlang has a fairly fixed structure it uses.\n\nBuild tools automate building of final product code so they expect certain files to be in certain places.  These can be changed in the build configuration, but then working with a team used to standard structure can be chaotic. Also, many build tools will create the folder structure when you request a new project to be built.\n\nSo, if you are building projects within a team or for a business, the folder structure will likely be mandated and essential.  Even if you are planning to share a project, using a standard folder structure is still highly recommended.  If you are writing custom code only for you, whatever works for you is just fine.",

That really set the foundation for me so I can't *completely* relate to learning exclusively from tutorials, *however,* I did learn the main tools on my own.\n\nThere is no one answer for this, everyone learns differently -- The only single truth for everyone is to just get the reps in.  I would advise to first seek a mentor and some kind of social circle to share projects and ideas with.\n\nFocus on foundations not trends.  There are tons of resources out there for you that weren't available for me in 2000 when I started... but there are just... so many frauds and people who give bad advice so don't hold their ideas too closely.  Those who can't; teach.... etc.\n\nDon't let AI code for you if you're really a week in.  Ask it to explain code or what syntax means and leave it at that.  Use it like a mentor but know that there is no replacing a truly dedicated expert to guide you and teach you what you don't know how to even ask.\n\nGood luck!",

Later I picked up an MS in Information Systems. You might be asked to automate a Conference room for video teleconferencing. They could have Crestron panels that use their own proprietary programming language based on C# and .NET called Crestron SIMPL. Maybe you get a 2 day class in the language to design the room.

Outside of getting a degree in CS, that has always been the most helpful, since it both keeps me busy and gives me something to gauge my learning by.\n\nIf it helps, here was my road. I didn’t have a map for my programming career initially, but I’ve learnt that adapting is the best strategy for my own path. I wasn’t familiar with computer science at all growing up, despite having a father who was a programmer. I tried to go to college but dropped out to protect my grades. Then I worked at Lowe’s for a time. While there, I bought a game on steam that taught Python. Overnight, I fell in love with coding. I took a year and taught myself how to code in Python through learnpython.org. I also gave myself the framework of making a fully-Python-based game engine (which I still haven’t finished), so that I could learn how the language worked. Now I’m back at the university learning coding. I took the required course on C++ and also researched ahead on some C++ concepts before they were taught, such as C++ classes and templating. Now I have practiced with C++ for over a year and am working on my own language. So all that to say we each have different roads and different ways of navigating through life.\n\nIf you think you’re an imposter, you don’t have as much of a right to feel that way as I do, since I’m so late to the game and my life has more twists and turns than yours has. And I don’t feel that, because I’d rather give myself purpose and structure than to feel like I’m useless. If it helps you, a programmer should be able to find their own purpose when they seemingly have none. That is what is required in order for a programmer to come up with the software they make.",

The key idea is that tasks overlap in time from the system’s perspective.\n\nParallelism is about execution. It means multiple tasks are literally running at the same time on different hardware resources.\n\nSo yes, parallelism is usually considered a subset of concurrency. A concurrent program may or may not run in parallel depending on the hardware and runtime. But a parallel program is inherently concurrent because multiple flows of control exist at once.\n\nYou’re also right that race conditions and deadlocks show up in both cases. They are properties of shared state and coordination, not of whether the CPU is single core or multi core. Even with context switching on one core, the interleaving can expose the same hazards.\n\nOne mental model that helps is: concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.",

        "body": "I'm working on a Kotlin math library for higher math. I was going to post my Cayley-Dickson construction to show how I generate the complex numbers from the field of real (double) numbers and then apply CD once again to get one of the six unital quaternionic (not commutative but still associative) involution division rings by doubling the complex numbers and mapping i to one of ±i, ±j, or ±k, but I would have to post too much code (a few dozen interfaces) to make it make sense, so instead, I'll post something more self-contained that will probably be more interesting to people here, i.e. the factoradic representation of a number.\n\nStill, it's a really cool algorithm and way to generate the \"Cayley-Dickson tower\" which creates an infinite sequence of algebras starting with the reals to create the complex numbers, the quaternions, the octonions, the sedenions, etc. without needing to explicitly code any of them.\n\nThe thing about Cayley-Dickson is that you lose \"nice properties\" every time you recurse:\n\nWhen you go from the Reals to the Complex, you lose ordering, but you do get an algebraically closed field, which is always nice. (Every polynomial has a root in the field, and thus splits.)\n\nWhen you go from the Complex to the Quaternions, you lose commutativity (so xy ≠ yx for all x, y).\n\nWhen you go from the Quaternions to the Octonions, you lose associativity (so x(yz) ≠ (xy)z for all x, y, z, but you still have alternativity, which is a weaker form where (xx)y = x(xy) and y(xx) = (yx)x for all x, y.)\n\nThe Sedenions are where the shit really hits the fan: you only have power associativity and you get nonzero divisors, i.e. ab = 0 where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson\\_construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4)\n\n**Instead: Factoradics**\n\nSo you know how normally, we write numbers in base 10, e.g. 1234?\n\nAnd then we can write them in hexadecimal and binary?\n\n1234 in hex is 0x4d2 and in binary it's 0b10011010010?\n\nWell, another representation of numbers is called factoradic and is based on factorials. The rightmost digit is always 0, and the number is written:\n\n    a_n * n! + a_{n-1} * (n-1)! + ... + a_1 * 1! + 0 * 0!\n\nwhere `0 ≤ a_i ≤ i` .\n\nThen 1234 in factoradic is:\n\n    1411200_!\n    = 1 * 6! + 4 * 5! + 1 * 4! + 1 * 3! + 2 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0!\n    = 720 + 480 + 24 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0\n    = 1234 (as expected in base-10)\n\nHere's my factoradic encoder / decoder and the explanation. Note that I prefer to use functional programming constructs when possible: hence why there are no loops here (tail call optimized recursion is my looping: in Kotlin, when you use the keyword val, you cannot reassign to a variable): hence why you see the `aux` function in encode. I (distastefully) use a MutableList all the same to avoid unnecessary list copies.\n\nI can't seem to paste it here (too long?) so I made a link to it:\n\n[https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS](https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS)\n\nReleased under the 3-Clause BSD License, but not of much use to you unless you implement your own Factorial implementation (and there's a reasonable bit of machinery there as I represent a few dozen integer sequences and arrays).\n\nRight now I just finished polynomial rings / semirings and am working on quotient rings / semirings / fields so I can get the full gamut of finite fields for combinatorial constructions, elliptic curve cryptography (and other forms), coding theory, linear feedback shift registers, etc, as well as implementing geometric lattices nicely and naturally using rings like ℤ\\[x\\]/(x\\^2 + x + 1) for the Eisenstein integers instead of jumping through hoops to replace ω\\^2 = -ω - 1.\n\n(Not a beginner: I started programming when I was five and I'm 48 now and work in space astronomy. I have a BSc and MSc in comp sci and a PhD in math, but I have lots of holes in my math background, so this has been a great way to fill them in and learn more and program challenging, fun algorithms.)",

This will likely not work running it directly from Android, but a suggestion:\n\nIf you're genuinely worried about songs disappearing off of YouTube (and I would be - it's happened to me so many times), I would cache the songs locally to my machine: check to see if the song exists locally, in which case, play it, and if not, download it using yt-dlp (a fork of the - I believe now dead - youtube-dl, which runs in Python):\n\n[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)\n\nI have the following alias set up on my MacBook Pro (should work on any machine). Substitute your browser in.\n\n    alias yt='yt-dlp -f '\\''bv+ba'\\'' --cookies-from-browser chrome --no-check-certificate'\n\nThen if you want, say, video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w) (you don't), you just exec:\n\n    yt \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w\"\n\nand it should download locally. Save it as \"XqZsoesa55w\" and search for that locally and play it if you have it, and if you don't, download it. (That actually downloads the video and the audio: you can also modify the alias to just download the audio if that's all you want.)\n\nYou can also download entire playlists by putting in a playlist. (Quotes are probably necessary in that case, and optional in the case of single songs / videos.)\n\nYou don't need a YouTube subscription or anything like that, but I recommend you be logged in (so the cookies will work).\n\nI have had way too many videos that I loved throughout the years get yoinked either by their creators or by YouTube, and I no longer risk that happening. Every time I find something I like or something educational that I want to check out at some point, I download the entire thing locally.\n\nThe other option would be to just keep going the way you are, still cache songs locally, and keep a log of any files that are no longer accessible. Just copy those to your Android device and if a song doesn't show up on YouTube, check your \"saved files\" to get whatever has been deleted.\n\nJust a suggestion so you don't get burned like me and my \"significant other\" have multiple times over the years.",

The industry is hard for juniors. You need your degree as an absolute basis and must. You cannot just go into the field self taught and think you will get far, you will not. It will be grueling and chances at getting any position will be low, the competition is very fierce. So first, get your degree. Start there.\n\nThen light the fire under your ass to do well in your classes. Work towards it, work hard, getter dun. You got this. If you are passionate about it, you will do well. If you are passionate about furthering yourself in this world, getting paid more, getting more, you will do well.\n\nThink about the job you have now stocking shelves, use that as motivation. Use getting a job and furthering yourself in this life as the fire under your ass. It can and will light a very big fire especially when you end up getting your first coop position, get your first pay, and get a taste at making some real money.\n\nIts hard work, its going to be hard, having classes all day, managing a part time job, and then doing assignments and studying in your free time is hard. Its not easy, its tiring. Many times have I fallen asleep with a laptop and heavy text book in my lap. Slap yourself awake, meet those deadlines.\n\nAgain, you got this. You know what to do.",

And `for( int i = N-1; i >=0; i--)` will always iterate the same number in the opposite direction. The problem arises when you don't know exactly what N is supposed to be. \n\nBut honestly, having to mutate an array while iterating through it, should NEVER be an excuse for using a traditional for-loop. Always use the foreach-version if you intend to iterate through an entire list, no matter the language. The only reason to use the traditional for-loop would be when you don't want to iterate exactly N times, but some other arbitrary number.\n\nAnd also you rarely want to mutate an existing array, most of the time you would want a new array with a different set of elements, created by filtering the existing array or something like that.\n\nAnd if not, most languages also have methods specifically for removing elements from arrays depending on certain criteria.

        "body": "This is why I often say programming is easy, at least at this level.   The real challenge is taking a specification (word problem) and turning it into code.\n\nOne thing I can suggest is to take everyday tasks, that a person knows well, and turn them into a word problem and then turn that into code.    It might be as something as simple as checking the mail.  That might sound simple at first but you generally have to open a door or two, walk to the mail box, open the mail box, grab the mail and return.   The more one thinks seriously about what appears to be a simple task, the faster one realizes how detailed one needs to be to get software to do the job.   Creating the pseudo code becomes a challenge of iteratively walking through the code until you can actually get the mail.   The interesting thing about checking the mail word problem, is that you can check your work by physically walking through your pseudo code.\n\nIn any event there are lots of things in real life that can help you understand the conversion of tasks into code.   The more \"everyday\" the task the more impressive the complexity of what a person does everyday not thinking about it.   Brush your teeth in the morning and start to think about how all those actions would be expressed in code.   Would the stroking back and forth, be a function to simplify your code.\n\nAs for the OP I have to point out that this is an extremely common issue.   That is turning written requirements into code and frankly it often has nothing to do with programming.   However it is absolutely critical to becoming a good programmer.   In the real world many times your specification might not be well defined causing one to do some research.    That might mean reading a manual to get a device into a mode that you wan work with.  The point is your word problems become outlines leaving out critical information you need to fill in.   In other words in school you are lucky in that the word problems are generally complete, sometimes you need to figure out what a department really wants.",

        "body": "I'll list some things that might make you consider using message brokers, not in order of importance and not in a mumbo jumbo scientific way.\n\n1. A message broker is a separate, usually unchanging service\n\nThis means that redeploying your service has no effect on receiving data and storing event data.  \nYou could argue that writing events to a database is the same - and you'd be right, however we're not done yet!\n\n  \n2. Let's take a topic exchange as an example, you've created your topic exchange and have many routing keys for it. One of these routing keys is lets say for messages indicating that a payment has been completed.\n\nOne day, you'd like to send these payments to a fraud detection company (totally random example, I'm still having coffee), you could make the most barebones service that simply registers a new queue/binding to this exchange listening to the same routing key your main service already listens - and you'll receive a copy of all the payment events.\n\nThis plug and play style once your messaging system is set up is really comfortable and doesn't require extra work apart from occasionally adding a new field to your message.\n\n3. Manual acknowledgement + outbox/inbox patterns for your messages/events is intuitive and safe to work with  . Retries are handled with minimal work from your side with the correct configuration for your queue - connectivity issues and the like can be glossed over and you can define a threshold for dead letters where you'll actually have to think if messages reach there - but little connectivity issues or temporary outages don't really hurt you.\n\n  \n4. It's super easy to scale! Apart from being able to plug different consumers into the same routing key to get copies of messages to do different things with them you can also plug multiple (usually identical) instances of a consumer to a single queue so they can fairly share the work. It's really simply to dynamically scale this by adding or removing consumers to a queue that isn't doing the work fast enough.\n\n4.5-ish. Like you already mentioned and as it might be a bit obvious it really helps keep your system tidy(er) where each instance can just do its own thing and if you need something *else* you just make something fresh and connect it without bogging down your existing services with more responsibilities.\n\n  \nObviously it's not all sunshine and rainbows and you can easily make a sprawling mess of events flying all over the place and eventual consistency does have its own considerations.\n\n",

Like imagine there are multiple instances of your application each with their own local in memory queue, a message might be sent to both and the work is duplicated or some consistency criteria might even break. You can have this sync without queues but if you need queues anyways, just using a service for queues that can observe all the events is massively helpful.\n\n4) the queue can scale independently \n\n5) observability, you have once central logical place where the queues report to even if internally they are all running in different physical/virtual systems. So you can then do 2nd level of adaptations based on the state of your queues. A queue suddenly having way too many events in it from normal might be signalling an issue somewhere else.",

Just because you don't have a specific motivator to finish a \"how does this work?\" project, it doesn't mean anything other than you had no motivation to complete it.\n\nYes, for cyber security you will need to code. You will need to write scripts, read other people's code looking for vulnerabilities, and also read code others wrote for malicious (or ignorant) activity.\n\nThat you go back to code you previously wrote is likely just a convenience for you, in that you have context and a foothold and it lowers the cognitive load to try the next thing.\n\nEmbrace your curiosity. Learn at your own rate, and when you need to learn it. Forcing learning often leads to forgetting because you don't ever apply it.",

For example, take a sales or e commerce dataset, write SQL queries for KPIs, load the results into pandas, do some feature engineering, and produce a short narrative with visuals. Treat it like you’re presenting to a stakeholder.\n\nIf you want something more exploratory, try analyzing your own habits. Track expenses, workouts, or study time in a simple database. Query it with SQL, then use pandas to find trends and seaborn to visualize patterns. Personal data makes it easier to stay motivated.\n\nThe key is not just plotting charts, but practicing the full workflow: question, query, clean, analyze, explain.

It's a different path than data analysis, more ML/engineering focused. Cool, but not what most analyst roles ask for.\n\nHow to structure it:\n\n1.

        "body": "Dont get me wrong, i am in no position at all judging the code. But i am absolutely sure this code structure would be overkill for our project. All i need is a button the on excelpage, which opens a window with some drop-downs and preselected inputs which can be generated as new row in the page. Plus another button to delete the inputs if their are wrong and i'd like to make them dependent on the previous input. So basically you put your name first, then the dropdown for the station becomes visible, you select the station and depending on the station, the next dropdown only shows the robots which are located in that station. You choose the robot and the next dropdown only shows part which are build onto your selected robot. So there is no chance to pick something which wouldn't make sense (we have lot of entries on our current list, which are false because the part isnt used on that robot). The other department has much more variations on stations, robots and parts so the cross-checking does make sense for them, but not for us and also with my idea of preselecting the inputs it would be obsolet aswell. \n\nMaybe i put that incorrectly and the code itself isnt confusing for an expert on that matter, but for me (and my skilllevel) it is. And again the whole cross-checking thingy isnt necessary for my/our project.\n\nThanks for you insight and for the hit about VB net. I'll keep that in mind.",

C++ gives you primitives, you are expected to build up and composite layers of more robust and expressive types in terms of them, and then deliver a solution in terms of that. Ultimately you make your solution more expressive:\n\n    if(name n; std::cin >> name) {\n      use(n);\n    } else {\n      handle_error_on(std::cin);\n    }\n\nAn `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. All names are strings, but not all strings are names. Streams are themselves a whole system and style to work within.\n\nUnfortunately, there really isn't any good source material that teaches you use. Most code across the industry looks like people put their academic materials, picked up a compiler, and have written exactly as they had learned ever since. You have to figure it out. Try to find people who see the bigger picture.",

Less magic, but fewer surprises when delivery logic gets complex.\n\n",

Mindset - thats the big thing, so screw CV checking AI, we read all the CVs we get and always answer back!\n\n\\#2 - Being of the older end of your age scale at a guess, the biggest thing I see / know is the older people are, the more set in their ways they are. They have a set way to code, how to set out apps etc. Completely and utterly different to the younger generation. So where you say you have a better coding sense, may just be you understand something in a different way to others. Again, in the company I am in, we hoover up the younger generation to try to stop or at least dilute the \"set in your ways\" coding us old buggers have and its brilliant. They young uns are teaching me things I would not have thought about (and they still confuse me at times!)\n\n\\#3 - those showing dominance may actually be worried about you and your skills, possible jealousy. I am going to guess its the older types again. Everyone thinks the new hires are pushing them out, completely the wrong thing to think but there you go. Just screams insecurity and bad managers to me.\n\n\\#4 - Patience is important, however, here comes the age thing again. When you have been in the game for years, you do get slightly tainted by people asking or doing stupid things, so much so you turn into an old man who sits out back at lunchbreak shaking his fist at a cloud. Possibly more on the IT support side of things to coding maybe. You are also right, don't always go with the next big thing but be aware of it, see what it does. AI to me is just glorified python scripts that run with certain triggers BUT there are areas where it excels at. Knowing when and how to use it is  lot better than either ignoring it completely or using it to do every single thing.\n\nthere ya go - old man ramblings for you to laugh at!",

While it feels natural to do that sometimes, it's more important to focus on what you do and don't know. Everyone is on their own journey. Have compassion for others that you believe know less than you. Remember that there are way more people that know way more than you, and you'd like them to have compassion for you too.\n\nCondescending coworkers is definitely not unique to this field. I do find most of the software engineers I've worked with tend to be less socialized than people in other, more \npeople-centric roles (honestly, myself included sometimes lol), and there tends to be more value placed in personal knowledge of a subject. But again, not unique to this field, so you'd likely encounter that anywhere. Stand up for yourself when someone makes you uncomfortable (only you can know you limit), but don't take it too personally or feed into it. We're all at least a little anxious about becoming unemployed to some degree, and I think that sort of condescension is a defense mechanism. Unless your work is literally life or death, It's Not That Serious, so no need to internalize minor slights. It says more about them than you. \n\nThis assumes also that you aren't a total fuck up who sucks at their job, but based on what you've written here, I don't think that applies to you lol.\n\nAnd you're right, patience is key. You aren't really learning until things get a little frustrating. I'm sure you're doing fine, just keep going and keep learning. 🙂",

        "body": "Loop centric can be genuinely interesting, but you probably want to be really explicit about what kind of “loops” you mean, because that choice basically defines the language’s power and what it is good for.\n\nIf your loops are bounded and the bound is always known from existing values (classic “for i in 0..n” style), you end up in the territory of total programming where everything terminates. That is awesome for reasoning, resource bounds, and making performance predictable, but it also means you do not get general recursion or unbounded while loops without adding extra machinery. From a formal methods angle, that is a feature, not a bug, if you lean into it.\n\nIf you allow unbounded loops or something like “loop until condition,” you are basically back to general purpose computation, and then the “loop centric” part is more about ergonomics and how you restrict or structure control flow.\n\nTwo framing ideas that might help your design doc land with people: what is the smallest set of constructs you need besides loops (variables, arithmetic, conditionals), and what property do you want to guarantee (termination, time/space bounds, ease of verification). If you can say “Gamma Loop is intentionally total” or “intentionally resource bounded,” that becomes a clear conceptual advantage rather than just a vibe.\n\nAlso, if you have even a tiny spec for the loop form and what is forbidden, folks can give much sharper feedback. Right now “loops are central” can mean a lot of different things.",

Or do you just wnat to learn programming, as is the case more often when this questions is asked and the name of the sub.\n\nIf you really want Computer Science, there is no quick fix for \"mathematical thinking, specifically just treating numbers and such for their own sake\". You will have to get through that. If books are to dry for you, I would instead suggest getting a university lecture for maths for computer science specifically. [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) I think I skimmed this one for an answer here already, and it looked okay. (I mean it's MIT, it's probably not bad) From my experience, University level maths courses can be done without any prerequisite, except the willingness to spent a lot of time. Everything will be explained once, any everything is built up from the foundations (axioms). (at least that was the case at my university, I didn't actually watch this course in full)\n\nIf you really only want to program and are worried that you need maths for that: don't. Just start, and if you happen upon a concept that requires maths, go and learn that, and only that.\n\nEDIT: Since you probably never had mathematics at university: It's hard work, but you don't actually need to be especially bright for the basics. It requires a lot of practice, as it basically teaches you a different way of thinking, which is required for computer science. Learning CS really is just learning a different way of thinking, and the only way to do that is to repeatedly bash your head into a wall until you break through. The wall is made of bricks. You don't have a helmet.\n\nEDIT2: Another advantage of lectures over books is that you get exercises / assignments to go with them. Even if they will not be graded for you",

Assuming you knew they existed and were they were hidden. It was not a good idea and didn’t last long.\n\nThere’ a few HCI problems with the idea. Hidden non-noob features have no perceivable affordances, so users can’t discover them. When they are hidden behind the noob shield users can’t just gradually start to use more and more features. They have to remove the shield and then the UI looks entirely different than what they are used to.\n\nI don’t think the quantity of features even really creates issues. A powerful app will by necessity have a lot of features when it’s a tool for professional’s inherently complex work. That userbase can deal with having to learn the app’s basic functions while being exposed to the existence of other more advanced functions.\n\nThe subscriptions maximizing UX focus of trying to make e.g. Figma accessible for every stakeholder is plain damaging to the core user base. Only designers need to be able to use it, just the same as only developers need to be able to use IDEs & git, and only engineering and architects need to be able to use CAD. Stakeholders with other expertise areas can make their contributions with whatever tools they are comfortable with.",

Then they can only use prototypes, look at designs, and stick comments on the specific places they have change demands.\n\nThis works way better than them changing a single world or pixel by themselves. Designers get to do their work of making changes in ways that maintain the integrity of the whole project (e.g. one page doesn’t suddenly use different words for things than the rest). They also get to make the change in a way that doesn’t f*** up their figma workflow. \n\nI mean, when you are using Figma as a power user, you have your component libraries and larger components build from components. Then the right place to make changes is nearly always way somewhere else in a component library rather than on the screen that the stakeholder is looking at. When stakeholders do their own edits, even just changing texts, thats a shitload work for the designer to clean up in a way that doesn’t cause confusion later on.\n\nAs an odd mix of dev and design, I probably care about this last part way more than designers in general.",

Then it sends the signal to make the change.\n\nThis is the simplest way to do something, and it doesn't have a lot of protections that come with more sophisticated means.  Basically, to fix many of the issues in the basic approach above, you start implementing more sophisticated algorithms.

        "body": "I like to put all logic always in a 'services' layer/folder. So every mutation being done is there, never a save/update from a serializer or view itself. \n\nMy reasoning in general is that business logic should be callable easily from the django shell or a management command as well as a REST view. It makes unit testing easier as well.\n\n**Services**\n\nI put them in a folder like this as separate functions that can include other services:\n\n[https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/tree/main/backend/wdb\\_wallpaper/services](https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/tree/main/backend/wdb_wallpaper/services)\n\nYou can add additional sub folders there when a specific part is more complex\n\nThen i call them using the full path: `wdb_wallpaper.services.wallpaper.set_ai_generated_description(wallpaper=wallpaper)`\n\nYou can also use classes, but i would keep them stateless.\n\n**Services in views**\n\nI dont have the best example because this project doesnt have create/update calls from the API:\n\n[https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/blob/main/backend/wdb\\_wallpaper/api/views.py](https://github.com/ndokter/walldb2/blob/main/backend/wdb_wallpaper/api/views.py)\n\nInstead of letting serializers save, i would use the arguments/object from the serializer and put them manually in the service. Here i did that with a search argument, but you can also do that for create and update.\n\nIm not sure if i would put all 'get' / queries in the service layer like i did here, but maybe in a 'selectors' folder like this style guide describes: [https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide?tab=readme-ov-file#selectors](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide?tab=readme-ov-file#selectors)",

Examining someone on whether they can solve a leetcode style question tells you nothing about a candidate's ability to write and ship software. I have met people who work at FAANG that have been able to get there purely by memorizing leetcode questions but not all of them are actually good engineers and a good amount of them have never shipped anything.\n\nThe people who are using these cheating tools are just shining the light on the bigger problem here which is that our interviews are fundamentally broken and should be redesigned to actually examine someone's engineering skills and foundations. If I am hiring an engineer to work on web apps, I would want them to know skills related to that not whether they can invert a binary search tree.\n\nI expect this trend of cheating to continue growing until companies begin to realize how stupid the current interview structure is",

        "body": "One thing worth remembering is *why* Ruby and Rails were huge. It goes something like:\n\nAt the time, backends were *huge* clunky things built out of Java, maybe .NET, and sometimes mainframes and COBOL. That means tons of Java-isms -- better bake a serial number into all of your classes in case you use native Java serialization to save sessions, but also you need an ORM with fifteen XML config files just so the ORM knows to set the `email` property to the `email` column, and that the `users` table goes to the `User` class. Except wait, you don't set the `email` property, you call `setEmail()` on the `User` class. And you don't create a `new User()`, you call a method on a `UserFactory`, which you need to get from the AbstarctDefaultFactoryImpl or whatever. And this isn't even Java 8, even a *simple* Java list looks like:\n\n    List<String> emails = new ArrayList<String>();\n\nYep, repeat `String` twice and `List` twice and generally be the most verbose, repetitive thing anyone had ever seen until Go gave us `if err != nil { return err; }` after every goddamned line.\n\nOr, at the other extreme, there was the LAMP stack -- stupidly-sloppy messes hacked together with Perl and PHP, the kind of thing people were building blogs out of. Wordpress was maybe the state of the art. PHP is a whole programming language that grew out of a glorified template language, so any notion of separating the view from the model was not really happening -- this is a world where you're taking some static HTML thing you built in DreamWeaver, renaming `.html` to `.php`, and adding a mysql query right to the middle of it with `<?php ... ?>` tags. IMO this explains a lot of why Facebook is the way it is -- it grew out of a tool that was built for adding a guestbook and a hit counter to your Geocities homepage.\n\nSo Rails did a couple things: It cut out a ton of the boilerplate with \"convention over configuration\" -- if you have a `Users` model class and a `users` DB table, Rails can figure out that those are supposed to go together, and you only need to add configuration when you have something that doesn't fit the very obvious pattern. Ruby cut out more of the boilerplate by not making you repeat your type names five million times. It gave you a CLI tool that generates a working Rails project for you instantly, makes it super easy to get started filling in the blanks. It gives you enough structure that you're probably not building your whole app inside the HTML view like you would in PHP. On top of that, Ruby was a nicer language than most of the competition -- PHP and Perl are both pretty ugly, and Java doesn't even have lambdas.\n\nOther replies have pointed out things that made Rails less relevant -- more microservices and fewer monoliths, more web APIs and React and such instead of pure CRUD at the HTML level. But I think it's also because a lot of the basic ideas Rails had either ended up going way too far -- to do that `User`<->`users` mapping, every Rails server needed a complex set of rules on how to pluralize English words! -- or ended up not being necessary for what they were trying to do. Like, turns out with decent type inference (Typescript, Golang), you can do strong, static typing and not constantly have to repeat yourself. Java and even C++ got lambdas, `var` and `auto`, and other basic quality of life code-level stuff.",

And here's the truth: people don't have even have the slightest clue of what they're talking about.\n\nOriginally I studied Finance and Accounting. My first job was at a Big 4 public accounting firm in 2016, they demoed an AI agent that could do our job to show they were \"cutting edge.\" Did we use it? No. We used excel workbooks that have been around longer than your grandma's fridge. Did we leverage Python, VBA, and so on to work better and faster like I knew how to do? No. Some of these people could barely move around a single sheet in Excel.\n\nThen I worked at a F500 company. In addition to regular accounting and finance work, tried as much as possible to automate. I tried to do things better, faster, more efficiently. I wrote \"shadow apps\" (not managed by the dev teams) for other financial analysts and accountants as the massive dev teams we had didn't have \"capacity\".  Eventually I hit a wall and essentially there was so much I wanted to incorporate and change but was denied the tools needed to deploy and maintain them. Basically \"sorry you're not an SWE so we can't give you access.\" So I left and now I'm building financial systems and doing meaningful work as a SWE and getting my masters in CS. And making more than I did before and happier.\n\nHere's my takeaway: you will be stunned to see how SLOW companies adopt tech outside of big tech companies. Even if you TRY you'll hit resistance.\n\nIf you have a desire to build a solution, you will have a job. If people on this sub or the vibe coding subs think an accountant at a F500 company will use Claude Code to vibe up a solution, I'm sorry but it will not happen about 90% of the time. If they didn't write basic Python scripts before, they are not vibe coding now. Anyone that believes that will happen are either delusional or have never actually worked outside of tech roles.\n\nAnd a final note: I could have automated 80% of my work as an accountant and financial analyst pre-AI. The only people to look at that career path as bulletproof are tech people who never worked in that field or tried to get a job in it.",

They do not position off-shore resources in such a way that makes them plug-and-play for any arbitrary development team.\n\nYour argument more or less rests on the notion that productivity and labor costs are the only considerations when developing a successful product — rest assured theres a lot more to it.\n\nBut sure, if all you bring to a development team is the ability to take tickets, and work for cheap, you may need to re-evaluate exactly what you’re bringing to the table labor-wise in the long term. Advice on how specifically you can/should upskill requires more context than fits in a Reddit post. Pick any arbitrary pile of podcasts or blogs related to product development, and when you read something which relates to a skill you haven’t mastered, learn that thing. Pay attention to what’s happening in your organization, and make sure your skillset is well aligned with the “big rocks” coming up.\n\nFrankly, not every software product demands “FAANG-level” engineers to be successful. But pretend you’re a company trying to be competitive in a market. The hypothetical skill-curve of labor isn’t flat among your competition. If literally every competitor sourced from the same off-shoring agencies, and all of those agencies were equally skilled at product development, what a fantastic opportunity for you to disrupt that market by having significantly higher performing teams right?",

That's a workflow an LLM could do before breakfast.\n\n\n\nBut the reason AI won't replace CEOs anytime soon has nothing to do with their actual decision-making ability. It's about who controls the purchasing decisions. CEOs buy AI tools. AI tools don't buy CEOs. The incentive structure means AI companies will always market their products as \"making leadership more effective\" and never as \"replacing leadership entirely.\" The tools will always be positioned to eliminate the people who DON'T sign the checks.\n\n\n\nThe real irony is that middle management is probably more vulnerable than either engineers or C-suite. The \"translate strategy into tasks and make sure they get done\" layer is genuinely something project management AI is getting decent at. But nobody makes LinkedIn posts about that because middle managers don't have Twitter followings.",

I'm too young to remember the dotcom and financial crash but as i've grown older my parents have started telling me of the financial/career decisions and personal decisions they had to make to support me and my brother growing up ie. dealing with horrible bosses to earn a paycheck to support the family, picking areas not related to the degree they studied and working their way towards the path they have now, how they made budget decisions etc. I was part of the new grad cohort in 2022 who lost their new grad career opportunities in 2022 when the beginning of the layoffs started with the zuck/elon movement. It was about time tbh because new grads according to my parents were becoming entitled twerps trying to command 150k+ TOC, expecting MAAANGA perks were the norm for new grads with only internships and between 0-2 years experience. back when my dad started in this industry there was not a huge salary gap between the CEO and the engineers and the rest of the staff and now there is millions of dollars difference and entitlement, people studying computer science only for the money. i think somewhere in the zirp era the engineering meaning of computer science and computing got lost through the bootcamps and the allure of salary. this correction was bound to happen as companies are now going back to actual engineering fundamentals.\n\nI think most people including myself forget that tech careers are cyclical and there will be a correction and change when the technology changes. unfortunately for us there are many  more toxic factors like social media, reddit, which encourage personal comparison, competition and breed mental health problems that didn't exist for the millenial people. imagine if zuck, adam mosseri(instagram), elon, sundar pichai, satya nadella, eva chen(instagram) and all these ceos had to live in our world as kids. there's so much denial from zuck, mosseri and co about how they are ruining our daily lives and the irony they are shielding their own children and families from these issues with no accountability. I doubt they'd be able to survive the world that we live in right now.\n\nI've been talking to a lot of people who graduated in the financial crisis of 2008 for life advice and the main thing they emphasized was that careers are non-linear and the truth is that it takes many years to reach however you define success - it varies from person to person ie. eliminating debt, buying a car, buying a house, getting a job you really wanted etc. social media warps this unfortunately. the best thing we can do right now is become really good and passionate about the things we work on.",

IT strongly focuses on Networks, servers, traffic, databases (which is a bit businessy), etc. The programming tends to focus on more automation type stuff similar to CIS. \n\nSome colleges have different curriculums for these courses, others don’t really and you can take any classes. It’s just a big toss up. That’s why almost all job posts have CS, CIS, CIT, IT, or other tech related field. Even if they don’t, it’s usually just implied. Someone with a CS degree that has an oracle box virtual home lab setup, has maybe messed with their home network, and builds computers would obviously be strong contender for Helpdesk. Vise Versa, someone with an IT degree built their own small OS in Rust, maybe has another project developing their own language from C++, and maybe does science and math simulations in OpenGL then they’d obviously be a strong candidate for a true entry level (0-3 years experience, unlike the 3-5 we see now) low level software engineering position.\n\nSo, all of this to say, it just really depends. They 100% have their differences and should be recognized for that. In the world of experience trumping everything, it doesn’t even matter which is why I can see these roles asking for any tech bachelors.",

Being familiar with the system architecture is also very important\n- Being able to lead a team and mentor/motivate teammates that work under them. When the scope of a project increases, there will be a point where one person isn't enough to deliver. Since coding is the easiest part there is a point where work is figuring things out and delegating and making sure things are getting done. \n\nIn the end it's all about solving problems with code that is scalable.

This job is too good for me and all my income goes straight into my chipmunk cheeks.  The company itself is ancient, stable, all about technology/computers (it's neither Nvidia nor AMD).  Given that it's a GPU job, I used C++ both on the role and to persuade my interviewers (I **hate** higher\\* level languages).\n\nIt's fine if you don't consider it a solid career (because I'd agree).\n\nMy current compensation as a junior is $200k\n\nI'm posting this in hopes that it will make an unemployed soul out there feel a little better today.\n\nOh, and they also take us out to eat for free every once in a while and have around \\~5 company holidays (in addition to the normal holidays).

        "body": "I think some variation of this is what often gets overlooked. Let's just say that AI, across the board, makes all software dev take 25% the human time that it used to. On the surface that means 75% of devs get laid off. But in reality, this ignores the factor of human ambition and greed. The ultimate goal of a company isn't to punch off its current TODO list. It's to maximize profits. So at least some of those 75% should end up building new features and launching new products to generate more profits through efforts that wouldn't have been justifiable at the previous cost of development.\n\nAnd some of them will go off and start their own companies doing things with a person or two that previously would have taken a team, startup capital, etc.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI think the same thing applies to the idea of people sitting idle overall. If you look at all of the laid off people coldly as a resource pool sitting idle waiting to be exploited to generate profits, it starts to look as silly to not find a way to put them to work as it would be to not tap into an oil well sitting idle in your backyard. Not because you're trying to do a good deed by giving them a job, but because you're trying to make more money. Which is really the only reason anyone has a job today.\n\nThe truly difficult part could be the relative pace of all of this - if millions of people get laid off at an unprecedented rate, it will take time to figure out how to leverage this new human resource - what happens in that time? But in the long run, I suspect that the ultimate answer to how we keep ourselves busy in the face of these new tools will be the same answer that has accompanied every productivity increasing technological development in human history: we'll just do more. That drive is pretty central to what it means to be human, IMO.",

But it’s not there yet and won’t be anytime soon even though our entire economy is propped up by that idea.\n\nThe point of Ai currently is to cut down on entry level and mid level roles. Theres a two fold approach to why companies do this, both of them have to do with money.\n\n1. Just hire less people and cut down on time to train them as that’s lost revenue, and also lay off employees who are not absolutely essential or senior level people because they obviously just do nothing right? Makes their labor cost go down, shareholders see better numbers in the immediate, everything is smooth sailing until it’s not.\n\n2. The senior level people that stay on assume the work of their peers that got laid off, get a slight pay bump (or none sometimes) to do their work being “augmented” by ai, this basically allows the company to get more labor for paying the same price effectively.\n\nDollar now > dollar tomorrow\n\nEveryone loses, they win, economy gets wrecked we lose jobs, they get record profits and re invest into other business ventures or just pay themselves with the “returns” 😃",

The strike price - this you know, and it's whatever strike price they are listing\n\n2. An exit event - this you don't know. In order for you to be able to exercise the stock options, there needs to be an exit event for the company, i.e., the company needs to be sold or it needs to go public. Most companies never get here, and if your company doesn't get here, then the stock options are worth nothing.\n\n3. The stock price at the exit event - if your lucky enough that the company hits an exit event, then you'd need the stock price in that exit even to be higher (ideally substantially higher) than the strike price. If the strike price was $2 per share and the company is sold to a megaconglomerate for $3 per share and you have 15,000 shares worth of options, then you just make $15K. On the other hand, if the stock price goes to $32 per share, you would make $450K.\n\nThis is why most people will tell you that stock options and RSUs and SARs from early stage startups are not worth anything - because the odds that there will be an exit event while you're still employed AND that the exit event will be profitable enough for your options to be worth substantial money are very, very low.",

If you're asking the latter, the answer is obviously yes, the majority of senior+ ICs currently working learned most of their marketable skills on the job. What is broken now is the opportunities for learning those marketable skills on the job are shrinking, and furthermore formal education arguably never squared the circle of teaching those skills in the first place.\n\nThe signals and heuristics for high skills and experience are generally broken at the moment, or at least, there isn't agreement on what should replace them. This is a big reason why junior hiring is down, because pre-AI work history is sort of a grandfathered in reliable signal.",

They still need engineers for their hospitals, banks and other local businesses. An on-site role at a hospital system in West Oklahoma is going to have barely any applicants compared to some name brand in SF/NYC/Miami/Atlanta/Seattle. \n\nA problem a lot of new grads have is they aren’t applying across the entire country. In this job market, you have to apply across the entire country and be willing to relocate anywhere. This is what people use to do several generations ago btw, move to random no-name towns for cheap housing and opportunity because life in the big cities was too competitive and expensive. Eventually, these towns became the powerhouses you see today. \n\n\nMilitary is also a terrific option. I came from the military. Joining the military was the single best decision I ever made in my life, getting out was the second best. I got out with $50k to my name at 23 and more character development than college could have ever provided for me. \n\nA lot of hiring managers are also former military and they will almost always prefer other vets that apply, for good reason too.",

Dream up ANYTHING and then start building it, this is not about the product topic, it is all about making software systems. Keep doing this project after project and you will learn a ton about systems, design, logging, communication, etc.\n\nI used to be a big book person myself, and they are good to get some ideas to get started, but it's better to go start building constantly, and then come back to the books when you need to reference, get unblocked, or learn how to do a specific thing. I think another aspect of this is that the building of systems/services/projects gives you more things to connect mentally when going through books on \"advanced topics\". For example, after building a bunch of projects, when you go through your next system design book, you will make mental connections to what you've already built and think up use cases and improvements with the topics they are talking about. If you just read books / take courses from the start and aren't building, nothing will stick as easily.",

I think there were several things that happened in succession like legislation and business tax law updates, the covid and recession years, and then AI becoming more of a focus, and then offshoring becoming easier. It will take a lot to overcome so much global change. \n\nI enjoy programming and solving complex logic problems so that's the reason I am in the field still. At work we are encouraged to use AI more so I do it because it's being tracked. So less manual workflow and more of an agentic or llm type of workflow at the moment. \n\nBut overall just to say that even if I had the free time I still enjoy the craft and learning opportunities it provides. That is to say try and find a job that is at least tolerable and ride the wave. Try to keep the skills sharp in case the layoff hammer comes around. That's been my philosophy for the past several years been through a couple recessions so always be ready to shift if needed.",

So if you ask on experienced devs, you'll probably get a lot of people who are saying language doesn't matter and what not, but the good ones will say the opportunity is only good if you are willing to make the leap to learn the other language.\n\nJava is one of those languages that can feel \"old fashioned\" by todays standards because of the fact so many other languages figured out shortcuts or answers to common problems that still exist in java.  So my conclusion has been it always is universally painful when anyone is trying to traverse going from something like dotnet or python to a java system.  I'm living that pain right now and I'm primarily a dotnet dev that got hired into a java shop that needed a dotnet dev for a side project.  \n\nAnd you are right Java Spring is full on magic box because people have built answers to so many problems.  It's less programming and more like fitting together pieces of a puzzle, which is why I kind of dislike it.  However, it got that way because raw java is the literal boards and nails of high end compiled languages because it was open source and the first one.  Had this experience when going between android, iOS, and windows.  It was like the windows stuff was somehow between two extremes in approach.",

I'd really suggest formatting your bullet points like this: (1) what you did, (2) in layman's terms what impact it had (business metrics here a plus), and (3) optionally mention the tech used. \n\nSecond, unless those non-work projects you did are very meaningful or impactful, then I'd suggest getting rid of them and use the space to add more bullet points to your work experience. Anyone off the street can create a school-level project with AI. Business impact is key. \n\nLast, keep applying and practicing. Take whatever you can get. Don't be picky. Target smaller companies.",

They will hire based on what they need for the role. If the role leaning to front end they will ask more about frontend. The cv won’t change that. So just keep your cv truthful. There’s a lot of backend leaning full stack positions and you fit that, don’t apply to front end leaning positions.\n\nBlazor is definitely used and I do see some positions for it.

Your 8 years of keeping a production app running is honestly more valuable than most people realize bc that shows you understand the full lifecycle, can handle real user problems, and know how to maintain code over time. The fact that you've dealt with race conditions, auth systems, and layered architecture tells me you're not just copying tutorials.\n\nFor the interview prep, I'd brush up on basic SQL optimization, maybe review some common C# patterns, and be ready to walk through your architecture decisions on your main project. They'll probably ask you to solve a simple coding problem, but it's more likely to be \"write a method that does X\" rather than dynamic programming puzzles. As for the full stack vs backend question, honestly your Blazor experience might be more of an asset than you think as lots of .NET shops are curious about it but don't have anyone who actually knows it well. I wouldn't pivot away from mentioning it, especially since it shows you can handle the whole stack when needed. Small companies love that versatility because they don't have huge teams. The 2.5k salary is solid for a first industry role, especially remote from LATAM, and once you have that professional experience on your resume everything gets easier.",

So unless the AI obsessed CFO decides to fire my entire team (kind of hoping for it), I'm just reminding myself that if a product flops, our small ass team has done our best and the Csuits have a bigger problem than I do ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ I don't have stocks in this company, I'm not a founder or cofounder, I won't get a raise if something does super well either. So I do the bare minimum of what I find to be acceptable quality and push things out before the deadline. ",

Try to get any tech job during your break between school.\n\n\nSomething you can try is look for full time jobs in your area.  When you see the posting, try to contact through the careers area of the website, email, or if you have to, through the application itself.\n\n\nHowever you are able to try to contact someone, let them know you are an older student who will be graduating in two years, you are checking out different careers, this one caught your eye, and you are wondering what the career is like, what courses might help, and any advice anyone who will talk to you has.\n\n\nAsk for a phone call, email, or buy them a cup of coffee or lunch.  Get the advice and just listen, don't \"but what about, or I heard, or people say\", just listen and ask actually meaningful questions.   Right after, and I mean right after, write everything down, whatever you can remember.\n\n\nThis is both local advice, networking, and a sort of introduction to an interview.\n\n\nKeep doing this as you can.  Keep your eye out for and ask about any local events where IT people meet to talk IT stuff, if you can, try to attend.  The goal is to be seen.\n\n\nGetting the degree and being a good fit for the company and the team are what is important.  Regardless of what you take, you are not going to really know what you are doing for the first five years, so when people give you free advice, listen.\n\n\nIdeally, you will graduate having had a few tech summer jobs, and have networked with several people.  When you are close to graduating, reach out to any of them that gave you their contact info and ask them if they know if any job opportunities.  Do this slowly, not all at once, you don't want to burn any bridges.\n\n\nGood luck",

Now depending on how much you are learning or if you have stagnated, the 2 year mark could be a good indicator to look at how far you have come since starting and analyze how much you have learned. I specifically plan on getting to around the 3 year mark before I start applying to much higher paying position. Be it, I am only a few minutes from my house currently and don't have a house, car, or kids to worry about in terms of big monthly payments. \n\nWhatever you do end up doing, do not just quit your job and hope to get picked up elsewhere fast!

Everytime I say this I get someone pointing out the rigor, which I don't find to be a working argument because any decent engineering program is going to be fairly rigorous in its own right. \n\nWhat recruiters actually care about is name brand and the selectivity signal that comes with prestige. Example in point: a majority of interns are completely useless and are a complete net loss for the company. Having a nice internship from a good big tech is still going to move the needle very favorably resume-wise because of the bar of what it took to be accepted, and the signal to recruiters that you were able to get in a prestigious company, even if you didn't really do anything productive.\n\n>I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume.\n\nNo one is specifically blacklisting WGU, this seems very unlikely. The simpler and more likely reason at hand is that your resume is probably not competitive enough for the current landscape. Adding OMSCS to your resume is not going to change that either.\n\nThe reality is that it's going to be very difficult for average CS grads to find work within this environment and landscape. The easier times when many people could reasonably make their way into a decent SWE job have passed, and is most likely not going to come back. SWE payroll has always been one of the biggest costs that companies look to reduce within their financials, and rampant outsourcing and AI have done a lot to cut down on available jobs. ",

If I know I didn't have a good explanation of a detail on my resume, I can brainstorm a few and practice them until they sound natural.  Or if I flubbed a coding section, practice it.  Look up the questions I didn't know.\n\nI guess you can try to read between the lines of the little feedback you did get too.  Like if your profile was impressive, they might have thought your performance didn't match their expectations (for that experience or title before).\n\nOr ask for very broad suggestions on places to improve.  It could be near the end of the interview itself, before the decisions.  Maybe even offering ideas yourself to make it easy for them to parrot it back if you're worried about bothering them.  And to show where you think you could best improve.\n\nMaybe I've just gotten enough experience finally, but \"culture fit\" (and confidence) has felt really important for a lot of my previous interviews.  Do you fit in.  Are you like us.  Can I work with you, and do I want to.  Information can be learned.  New tools often are like other tools (new dialect).  Is your first instinct like mine (different means unique solutions, same means they'd agree with it).\n\nOr they need a Kung Fu master to come in and be the expert/owner.

I don’t know if HR sends generic rejections or just ghosts you if we reject.\n\nPhone round - I stopped doing this because i felt it’s pretty useless, it was useful screening tool when we didn’t do virtual interviews and instead had in person interviews. Generally I go over work experience, poke around some technical areas, see if you know what you’re talking about or if the resume was exaggerated. Also good opportunity for both parties to calibrate expectations, so we aren’t wasting eachother’s time. Then wrap up with LC easy question, my go to is a graph search algorithm.\n\nOnsite/Virtual final round - now this highly depends on the role. For IC I usually do system design round, for other EMs, I’ve done system design and roadmap planning and strategic vision. Main reason I’ve failed people who solved the system design was due to lack of depth in understanding. It’s very clear when they’re regurgitating from a video they’ve seen rather than make live trade off decisions and ask clarifying questions. Did I really say speed was necessary? Or do we care about accuracy and freshness of data? Why are you adding a cache? Did you clarify the DAU and types of requests to be confident in your cache hit rate? You get the picture. For EM side, it’s usually their examples from their previous job lacks the scope we were looking for. “How did you drive alignment across the organization? How many teams were involved? Did you come up with a proposal for leadership? How much coordination tax would this take? What is the risk if we don’t complete?”\n\nTL;DR - we’re human, your interviewer needs to like you and you need to fit their similarity bias. Most rejections are because someone better applied, more knowledgeable, better work experience, and just had a good day.",

It's all dependent on who's in the room when. \n\nSomeone can be at a place where they don't have anything more than Senior because, well, they don't, and cap out at Senior even though they've been doing the same shit for 25 years. This exists... more than I want to admit. Remember: There are more than just 1000 companies in the world that are powered by applications—custom or out-of-the-box.\n\nI'm not saying titles don't matter—they do, they gate a lot of things including but not limited to your dating life—but if you want to level up your skill, that's a lot more of a different thing than just saying \"I want to move up to Senior Backend.\" ",

I lived in a studio that was in a \"bad area\" in the bronx but it was nearly 40% cheaper than my friends studio in midtown and his place didn't even have a washer and dryer. Managed to save enough to put a solid down payment on a mortage after I left the city.\n\nAnyway, I think the NYC offer is way better than the Toronto offer. + NYC is probably more fun to live in as a young adult, though I never lived in Toronto just going off vibes.",

You’re inventing stuff daily to solve problems you didn’t think was possible to exist. And yeah perks and benefits are obviously not comparable to big tech. \n\nUltimately it’s a matter of preference.

Historically I went for startups with business plans I couldn't drive a truck through and generally early enough to get a significant fraction of the company with a transition to SaaS in 2010.  Since 2017 I've been more worried about accumulating assets for retirement and worked for public companies with liquid stock.\n\nSo I don't bookmark specific companies.\n\nI hadn't heard of half the public companies I've joined since 2017 and one of those two was the best I've worked for in over thirty years.\n\n2.  I don't know how often timing was an issue in my Q4 2025 job search because I don't have visibility into whether I failed a resume screen or they chose someone else, although I got offers from companies where the job posting had been up for months and where they took up to two months to get back to me.\n\n3.  In my Q4 2025 job search I made a spread sheet because I applied to many (62 versus at most a handful) more companies than I did historically and that was the most convenient way to keep track.\n\n4.  I'd apply if the job was a good fit even with a 99% ghost rate.  I'm an individual not the average candidate who is under qualified as Joel Spolsky discussed 20 years ago in [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/06/finding-great-developers-2/) where \"almost every hiring manager in Palo Alto right now with 1000 resumes on their desk has the same exact set of 970 resumes from the same minority of 970 incompetent people that are applying for every job in Palo Alto, and probably will be for life.\"   \n  \nGoogle hired me in spite of a reported 0.2 - 0.7% acceptance rate, although to be fair that position came through an inbound recruiter contact.\n\n5.  Along similar lines I don't think stats would be useful.\n\n6.  Tools facilitating automated application are the biggest BS in tech hiring presumably causing long backlogs to talk to a person and some good candidates being lost in the noise.",

The screening process feels so disconnected from actual job performance, especially when you're more direct or don't play the corporate small talk game well. I've noticed this pattern too where founders tend to hire differently than HR departments do.\n\nTo answer your questions: I do bookmark companies but honestly it's pretty manual and messy. I use a basic spreadsheet to track applications because most job platforms are terrible for this. Timing is huge though, I've definitely gotten rejections that felt like they already had someone in mind before posting. The ghosting stats would actually be super valuable, like if I knew a company had a 70% ghost rate I'd probably still apply but adjust my expectations and not put as much energy into customizing everything.\n\nThe biggest BS right now is probably the AI resume screening stuff. You're getting filtered out by algorithms before any human even sees your application, and nobody tells you why. It's this black box where you could be perfect for the role but get rejected because you didn't use the right keywords or format. Companies are posting jobs they're not even seriously trying to fill, just collecting resumes or satisfying some internal requirement.\n\nSuper cool bc I'm also building something in this space too (called Sprout) because the whole system feels broken. We're trying to give people more visibility into company response patterns and help optimize applications for these screening systems. But honestly the real problem is that hiring has become this weird theater where everyone's pretending the process makes sense when it clearly doesn't.\n\nWhat specific automation stuff have you seen people build? I'm curious about the more elaborate setups you mentioned.",

We are not allowed to hire remote employees and we're not allowed to hire anyone who needs sponsorship.\n\nThe company is funded by an investment firm, and they've suddenly started cracking down on budget and adding a bunch of oversight. I feel like this somehow plays into it, but I don't know how. \n\nIf it weren't for my coworkers losing their jobs, I would leave now. But I'm trying to stay on long enough to hire my replacement or at a minimum cross train everyone that I can.\n\nI've been in the software industry since 1996 and I've worked at some great places and some bad places. This place was sold to me as a great place, and I think everything the hiring manager told me was false. There's no upside to my staying, other than the office will close without me. There's a good chance that it will close no matter what, but I can at least help it stay open longer.",

Buy a motorcycle, take ski trips, go to nice restaurants, take in a movie every now and again.  climbing corporate ladders is for the silent generation returning from WWII.  Automation kills the ability for you to shine in most situations; therefore, you need to invest money in something interesting and look for a way out of tech eventually.\n\nI'm a Christian but even WFH got to me eventually.  We desire to have connections with other humans so I'm now happily married and living in the Philippines.  We're building a farm and investing in other financial opportunities, so it's an option if you find yourself in a situation like that.  If you prove yourself in WFH then you can live abroad in cheap countries and live a life of extreme luxury.  Otherwise, you can just travel and take your PTO.  If you're WFH then you need to absolutely push for your PTO because sick days can be forgiven if you're good at your job.  If you end up WFH, then map out your PTO and make a challenge to travel to every continent to explore, after 5 years you'll find a place, an activity, and possibly somebody to make WFH easy.\n\nYou don't want to go to an office dude, and once you're in that position at your job, then you'll have to stick it out for at least a year.  If you're WFH, then switching to an on-site team in 6 months is WAAAY more doable, all you need to say is \"your mental health is suffering because of WFH\".  There may not be an immediate opening but it's not the same as asking for a remote position.  However, people who are onsite most likely have way more room to be toxic since they're \"putting in the work and commute\", so don't be surprised if you run into the exact opposite of what you like.\n\nYou play sports, BJJ, hang out with people, you probably have weird quirks like looking people in the eye.  Trust me man, the way tech is going, you're gonna find yourself in a bad work relationship, offending people over zoom is way harder than offending someone in person.  Protect yourself and if you get the position, take it; moreover, this person reached out to you because they're probably trying to save you without saying that part out loud.\n\nNow if you're a bloodthirsty, psychopathic, pathological liar, then absolutely work onsite and crush everyone by throwing them under the bus; however, if you're looking for peace then WFH.",

        "body": "Hey friend, I get you, you are going to be ok.\n\n\nFirst of all, you have a lot of anxiety and expectations, that oozes out of your pores.  It's not going to help you if no one takes you seriously.  Pick a 24 hour period once a week to do no school work, you need to let your brain rest.\n\n\nGraduating with a bachelor's of science majoring in computer science, for me at least, was an exercise in stubbornness.  I just didn't get \"it\".   The thing about computer science is it is not about specifics, it is about concepts.\n\n\nIf you can understand the concepts, you can code in any language.  You aren't getting a degree to \"learn to code\", I know it might feel like that, but that's not it.\n\n\nYour degree is learning how to learn to code, and that is a very distinct difference.\n\n\nIf you are a first year student with no coding experience and you jump right from class to assignment and expect to bang out code, it isn't going to work; to get it to work you need to build the synaptic pathways, to do that you have to work through it.  To do that, you need to pseudo code.\n\n\nYou can write out pseudo code like an essay.\n\n\nLet's take something very simple, adding two numbers.\n\n\nDo we need anything?  I don't think so, but let's put a comment at the top where we can ask for anything that we need to be brought in.\n\n\nNext we need to numbers.  How are we going to get those numbers?  We need to decide what type of numbers we want.  Let's say that we want two whole numbers, we need containers to hold those  numbers, and we want the containers to be empty.\n\n\nName container one and empty it\nName container two and empty it\n\n\nThen we want to get two numbers.  Let's assume we are going to ask a person, then write a function.\n\n\nAsk person for two numbers and store them in the containers, then call the function we will write.\n\n\nThe function will then be a box we put something(s) in and then something(s) come out.\n\n\nSo we say we cut holes in the box for thing 1 to go in so the box knows that thing 1 has the properties of the hole for thing 1, and the same for 2.  Then we cut another hole in the box for one thing to come out.\n\n\nThen that is it.  You start very high level and then you write out what you want to do, then you try to figure out how to do it.\n\n\nYou have be able to understand the concept of what it is that you are doing before you can code it.  Once you know the code, then it is figuring out the syntax.\n\n\nYou then start from the top and go to the bottom and change all that you know into code.  If you don't know it, try to figure it out, look it up in a book, spend a good 15 minutes on it.  Once you can't figure it out, put that specific part into AI and ask it to change it to code.  See if anything clicks.\n\n\nMake a word document and name it whatever you are having problems with.  Then copy and paste the pseudo code and the AI code into the document.  Then tell the AI that you don't like that one and you want it done differently, and keep pasting in the different ways of doing things as you tell it that you want it different; there will be a finite number of ways of doing it.\n\n\nLook at the document, is there anything in that document that \"clicks\" and makes sense to you?  If it does, put it at the top and highlight it.  That's the way to remember doing it.  Rinse repeat.\n\n\nThere's no other way to code than understanding the concept of what you want to do and then turning that concept into a reality through syntax.  Computer science is like a pyramid, the concepts you learn in year one will hold up year two.  I still remember having to use the Jacobian from calculus and being like \"What the actual fuckity fuck fuck?\"\n\n\nIf you don't have the time to learn the concepts of how to psudocode at a high level, I think you need to consider making more time by doing less.\n\n\nIf you can understand the concepts, but not the syntax, you'll be fine.  That will come as long as you keep working at it.",

I don't know that an employer in the meteorology space is going to want to go through that hassle.\n\nData science skills are, at least in theory, transferable to tech companies if the bulk of the work is similar.
