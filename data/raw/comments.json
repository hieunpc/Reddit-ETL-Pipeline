Now most teams never think about cluster management.\n- Analytics engineering emerged as a discipline. Beauchemin predicted DEs would need more SQL, but underestimated how much the transformation layer would specialize (dbt, semantic layers, etc.)\n- The 'modern data stack' hype cycle. Lots of point solutions that promised to solve specific problems, then consolidation as everyone realized 47 tools was too many.\n\nWhat stayed the same (unfortunately):\n- The gap between 'we have data' and 'we understand the business domain.' Still the hardest part.\n- Pipeline maintenance burden. Different failure modes now (API rate limits vs disk space), same percentage of time spent on it.\n- Stakeholder expectations vs data quality reality.\n\nWhat's genuinely better:\n- Getting started is 10x easier. A junior can have a working pipeline in a day instead of weeks.\n- The tooling for testing and observability actually exists now.\n- Version control for transformations is standard, not exotic.\n\nThe 'Downfall' article was prescient about platform engineering eating some DE work. But the semantic layer and data modeling parts got more complex, not less. Different work, roughly same headcount.",

There are other places where a data engineer is someone who writes SQL largely for ETL purposes and maybe just manages the schema and type definitions of a particular data set and optimizes the routine queries that are run against said database, but even then that can be a stretch.

We now have a double database solution and oracle is meant to stop soon even though the new database is not better just had more development in the past 15 years. Still ml models are scary and we don't hire people who know how to do it so they all end up half arsed. No Python server as we are big into sas although some teams use r to make models. We now have ai which isn't so bad for data as you can't just write stuff as the data is a bit unknown to the AI so it can only build small functions but they are always super complicated and anyone that wants to reuse it has to try really hard to understand the over complexity of a simple task.",

Automation amplifies problems as much as it amplifies solutions.  The data engineer gets the heat when the products of their automation designs don't meet expectations, and the QA inquiry too often reveals problems with the data itself, including missing values, data entry errors, mismatched or approximated semantics when bringing together variously sourced data, accuracy and precision problems, deliberate and accidental bias, agenda selectivity, etc.  AI is built on big data infrastructure, so its good that we have this professional layer to review our supply chains as we procede to the next generation of decision support.",

Have you considered having an “intermediate” type table materialization? We have several large models that have to be broken up into intermediate steps because they would either overload memory, or perform poorly due to CTE’s that are called multiple times, which we can instead just process them once in a separate model. What gets annoying with this, is we don’t want any of these intermediate models taking up space in our warehouse, so we have to use a custom post-hook on any end-state models to clean up the upstream intermediate models. It would be really awesome if you integrated this automatically. Let us use intermediate as a materialization strategy, and have them be autodropped once an end-state model finishes. I know you have ephemeral and view materializations, but none of those solve the problem of having too much stuff happening in the final query that uses them. Thanks again!",

Not sure who you report to, but asking these kinds of questions to your direct report also helps. If not, I might start looking for a new place to work for.   \n  \nAlso, realistically what you can do is to start building infra and pipelines along with what you're doing. You satisfy the current needs and start working on things you think are important or necessary to do what they ask you to do (reporting, dashboarding). \n\nOverall, I'd try to communicate a lot more and see what they say.

Are you just writing one off queries on raw data to populate them? In my experience ad hoc reports are a symptom of a lack of good models (and pipelines that build those models) going into your BI tools. If that’s the case it’s a pretty easy sell to your line manager that building a proper pipeline would mean dashboards get built faster and have way more reusability.\n\nIf you’re the solo data engineer, then you’re the sole authority and the only one who can explain why it is a problem. Have you raised this with them? If you’re just complying with the requests of things they think they want to see, then they’re gunna be stuck in a loop of forcing through ad hoc things - because it’s all they know.\n\nYou mention being an excel support desk too - this definitely shouldn’t be happening - spreadsheets can be avoided in almost all cases these days (with some exceptions). I LOVE it when someone requests a spreadsheet because it’s an opportunity for me to ask them “out of curiosity” what are they doing with the spreadsheet - then you almost always get given an opportunity to solve a problem that they didn’t even know existed, this can make people very happy and that’s the most satisfying part of this job, I find.\n\nMaybe I’ve got the completely wrong take here but it sounds like the company hasn’t been exposed to a modern data stack before and are doing things the old way, if you’ve already shown them how it could be better (time optimisation, data reliability, and undiscovered insights being the selling points that execs hear) - then fair enough leave - if you haven’t you’re sitting on a golden opportunity, cause it sounds like you’re the only authority. Best wishes going forward - but this sounds like you’re not doing data engineering at all and would be a red flag to me if I were to interview you for an engineering role and you spoke about this sort of setup.",

We had a batch job that ran for 8 years with zero external packages beyond requests and psycopg2. Worked great.\n\nBut rebuilding ORM patterns from scratch is different from just not using one. If you're writing your own query builders, connection pooling, retry logic, and type coercion, you're now maintaining all that code forever. Every bug fix, edge case, and security patch is on you. SQLAlchemy has had hundreds of contributors finding problems you'll never think of.\n\nThe return code pattern concerns me more than the dependency choice honestly. Python's exception model exists for a reason and fighting it creates code that's harder to read and debug. If your senior prefers explicit error handling, that's fine, but there are Pythonic ways to do it without making every function look like C.\n\nThe real question is what's the maintenance horizon here. If this is a one time data migration that runs and gets archived, vanilla Python is fine. If this is production infrastructure your team will maintain for years, the cost of rolling your own ORM will compound. Every new team member has to learn your custom patterns instead of reaching for documentation.\n\nWorth having a direct conversation about it.

Things like group by with aggregations, joins across 2 to 3 tables, window functions for ranking or deduping, and basic subqueries. If you’ve internalized those shapes, most questions are just variations.\n\nAlso practice explaining your thinking out loud while you write. Even if the query isn’t perfect, interviewers often care more about how you reason about edge cases and data shape.

For Pinterest, you can see how they would have gone with some of their decisions to effect more real time data consumption and analysis, yet looking at what was needed for their business line for retention of data and managing cost of space, how to scale those upserts effectively as well and the pitfalls encountered doing so. Really cool to see a very real and applicable use of these technologies in sensible fashion… it definitely piqued my interest on some of these technologies and will continue to follow and learn about as a consequence.",

So fast that it outpaces the slog it takes to get things implemented at an enterprise company. \n\nYour best bet is to find a data engineer or developer role you enjoy, and start using the AI tools to do that job better. \n\nBetter put, focus on the role and supplement it with AI, don’t focus on a role that only exists to promote some x AI tool for your company. \n\nSorry this is long but one more example: my company has “AI engineers” that spend a lot of time and energy making AI agents specific to certain areas - AI agent for M365, an AI document agent, email agent.. you get the idea. Then a few months later the outside world AI space comes out with agents that essentially work in any space, making a lot of their work extremely outdated in a matter of week/months. \n\nI can’t overstate how fast AI is progressing in comparison to how slow companies implement changes.",

Cool guy!\n\nIt tries to improve on multiple fronts ,mostly user experience (e.g. hyperlinks to problematic files, init command, pretty output , some SE better practices and of course leverage Rust speed and binary size), which are explained here: [here](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/faq/), in the 'How does dbtective compare to similar projects' dropdown. One of the improvements I wanted required a completely different architecture and [Rust traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) were the perfect candidate.\n\nThe simplest explanation of this architectural change is by example, comparing dbt-bouncers [`CheckModelDescriptionPopulated`](https://godatadriven.github.io/dbt-bouncer/stable/checks/manifest/check_models/#manifest.check_models.CheckModelDescriptionPopulated)  rule (which only applies to models) with dbtective's \\`[has\\_description](https://feliblo.github.io/dbtective/docs/rules/description/)\\`  rule, which can apply to all eligible dbt objects, for example  \\`sources\\`, \\`seeds\\`.  \\`macros\\` or anything that can be described (in the \\`applies\\_to\\` setting). So in \\`dbtective's\\` case, one rule can be used to expect descriptions on multiple objects, leaving less work for the user.\n\nWith this in mind we can set defaults that make sense (e.g. it makes sense to describe a lot of things so the default \\`applies\\_to\\` setting contains literally all objects that can have a description field for the has\\_description rule), but we can also easily remove or add objects if the project requires it, using the applies\\_to configuration.\n\nThese defaults I would like to eventually leave to the community or be fixed by asked the right questions in the init command. For now I've set them to what makes sense to me (this is also much of the reason to stay on v0)!\n\nHope that clears things up!",

So you're still in that window. \n\nYou can't make up for the tech debt and disorganisation of some places.\n\nDocumentation is a mess absolutely everywhere and those consolidation projects take years and fail every time, in that there will be N+1 repositories. And then they will do it again. It's the biggest boondoggle in the business. \n\nFunnily, they always go hard on permissions on that latest repository and will require multiple panel reviews and checkins for literally anything you want to put in, to the point it's impossible to use. \n\nSo don't think about that anymore. Focus on building your own documentation silo wherever it is and however you want to. The goal is a foundation for your own work, not a general thing for other people. \n\nAnd you've got other responsibilities? That's also common. Try to see it as a good thing in that you get some extra job stability. \n\nThat aside, are people complaining? Have you looked around and realised there are others who have been there for years or decades and not pulling their own weight? lol. They probably created most of these problems too!\n\nThis is all extremely common. If you move on now you will likely experience the same thing and worse, so my advice: seeing as you are not fully invested in this job, try to see it as your personal playground to try some other working and thinking styles, until you find something that lets you function there without the anxiety.\n\nIf anyone ever asks something you don't know, you're not the expert on that, but will try to find someone (and often, people will just forget it entirely!) If anyone calls you out on not knowing every atom in the universe, just repeat the same thing. Some people are aggressive like that but it's not you, they just have it in for easy prey.

I'd say without a doubt you made the right choice to focus on SWE over DS. The thing you actually get in DS is about Statistics-with-programming and how to properly employ research against data. All good things, not really what we're concerned about with DE. \n\n2. Since you're in SWE and looking at design patterns, keep in mind what it would be like if the only thing you had to care about was the data inside the objects. A lot of folks coming from a SWE background focus on the abstract object versus what is contained by the object. To move to DE you have to care a lot more about the latter. \n\n3. Things that will be evergreen in DE: python, SQL, databases, warehouses, data modelling (although the meaning of this varies person to person, company to company, much to my chagrin). Focus on these. Python at an expert level (focus on the data packages. Polars, Duckdb. And DB packages. Pscyopg, etc.), at least 1 RDBMS 1 NoSQL and 1 DB system you're just interested in, SQL to an expert level which will give you passable knowledge for most Warehouses as well. \n\n4. Tools that will be evergreen in DE: Airflow, Docker, GitHub, K8s. TOML/YAML as well. DBT is very good to know as well. \n\n5. And that the issue is that job descriptions are very heavily implying mastery while the actual job wants a jack of all trades. Get good at probing for this information in interviews with tech staff. Take advantage of mock interviews if you have the chance.",

Then you can do dimensional model on silver gradually as you gradually try to find the questions you want to answer. This is one of the many patterns currently practiced in big enterprises. You will learn integration patterns (conformed layer)  not just modelling. Dont dimensional model just because you have data. It depends on what you want to do with it.

An example of how [Shopify handles it can be seen here](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries#bulk-query-overview). But essentially an API request contains the details needed to start the long running operation, and the API returns a job number. The user then polls a 'job status' endpoint with that job number. Generally most providers I've seen use a signed url to a CSV as the response so that their API isn't locked up during sending the body back if it's hundred of megabytes. \n\nJaniF suggestion works well, if you need to write your own sensor for more complicated handling it's super straightforward.",

But for analytics engineering work, especially in niche domains with messy data like you describe, it doesn't work that way. The hard part of your job is not writing SQL, it's knowing which parameter to look at based on domain knowledge. That's exactly where AI struggles.Where AI actually helps me is the tedious stuff. Debugging weird errors, generating boilerplate tests, converting between formats. I'd say 6/10 useful is about right for debugging help. Where it falls apart is anything requiring judgment about your specific business [context. My](http://context.My) honest take after a year of heavy Claude usage for data work is that the people who are no longer doing anything technical are probably working on much simpler problems than yours. When you're eyeballing raw files to figure out which field is correct because documentation doesn't exist, there's no prompt that replaces that institutional knowledge.Try Claude for the parts of your job you already know how to do but find tedious. That's where it shines. Skip the hype about agents replacing analytics engineers, that's not happening anytime soon for anyone doing real domain-specific work.",

Not know what is the desired end result, or stakeholders not knowing what they want and you having to guess that is not. It's not clear to me what is the situation here, but you can use AI for both:\n\n- use AI to generate documentation of where each parameter/column is, what it describes, how to query it, etc. Review that documentation for mistakes/errors and rewrite/fix what needs to be fixed in the documentation. Then, the AI can refer back to this documentation when generating code, saving you time\n\n- ask AI to clarify requirements, or identify information gaps, and draft responses to requests that are not clear\n\nUsing AI to code is fine and useful, but you said that's not the part you struggle with.

It’s in use at DoD, DHS, State Dept that I know of. I moved from SSAS (which was an old version of Synapse) to Databricks once. It wasn’t trivial - converting whatever the MS language was to SQL or Python wasn’t obvious. If your Synapse is on SQL I’m sure it would be easier but you’d probably have to try it to see. Databricks/Spark SQL is currently very capable - it took a while to get there, but most things you can do on other platforms are there now. You said you need good RBAC - Databricks uses standard sql permissions and now has very good fine grained permissions including constraints and expectations for data quality assurance. Pricing model seems clear to me - pay based on compute usage (kind of a big markup) and not really much else. I’ve been in the fed gov in Databricks for 5 years now on a large data warehouse and I still think it’s a good product.",

State management is much cleaner, and you have much more control over the streaming pipeline. Also, it's so nice having real streaming and not \"micro-batches\".\n\nIn our case, Flink was used by a software engineering team. They use Java, as it was the language they already used.\n\nWe then tried to adopt it with a Python DE team. Turns out, PyFlink is quite limited, and does not really offer the power you would want from Flink.

You'll want to pick up, and use regularly, systems like Docker and Kubernetes. Even for your own small data projects. This will introduce you into that world where those things are heavily used. These are also cloud-agnostic meaning no matter what service provider your future employer(s) use you'll be squared on this front. In the same vein are things like VPCs and general networking which I spend more time debugging than anything else in DE/DataOps. After that you can get into the specifics of particular platforms. \n\nAs far as practicing is concerned: Start with `docker`. Learn the ins and outs of taking arbitrary python code you have and stuffing it into a container. Learn how to find images, how Dockerfiles work, run into the issues so you can troubleshoot them. Then see what it takes to incorporate tools you may be using to develop your code into the dockerfiles. Things like `uv`. If you can have one system managing both your local dev and your container builds you have less points of failure to troubleshoot. \n\nThen grab `k3s` for local development. This is, notably, \"actual\" kubernetes. That is opposed to things like minikube which are \"kubernetes in docker\". Nothing wrong with that, but when we're talking about \"rapid\" prototyping, k3s is as close as it gets to just managing raw k8s on your local system. You'll probably immediately want to grab `helm` as well. Read up on `k8s`, `k3s`, `helm`, and `kubectl`. Play around with trying to get your docker containers that do things or expose things up onto k3s locally. See what it takes to setup `postgres` on kubernetes, and how to expose it so you can communicate with it externally.\n\nOutside of those things, which are more typical of `self host first` shops, you can likely find playgrounds around specific tech. I believe `databricks` recently opened up a playground of sorts. Snowflake may as well, but I don't honestly remember. Google on `GCP` used to give you like $300 in credits, plus they have the open BigQuery datasets you can mess around with. I think all of these things are secondary or tertiary things to focus on though, as they are mostly provisioned and managed for you from an infra standpoint. It's not bad to see what the platforms look like behind the scenes, though!\n\nI find Data infra specifically very interesting. It's got some nuance that can apply to standard web infra, but often times deviates from it. Which ends up as a nice challenge and break from the typical DE work for me!",

I have thought of studying Linux (more than your regular CLI commands) and from there jump to Docker. I am following a book on Ubuntu and as the book progresses it introduces the concept of Docker in Linux in chapter 10 I believe, that's why I had thought of it as a good path to follow. Additionally, I am reading an intro book to Networking, I think is called \"Networking for Sysadmin\", it is the only book I've found is easy to follow on that topic with practical examples. From there my idea is to start doing labs in Azure and Amazon, to start getting hands-on experience in building infrastructure with IaC and then finally visit K8, possibly get a cert on that if time allows. Of course, my day to day for the next year will be familiarising myself with Snowflake, DBT and learning how to use Claude to write more efficient code. This is a 2 year plan. Alternatively, I could go the Masters way, and enrol in one to get a better picture of CS as a whole, but I feel there are many topics that I don't need, and my best bet would be focusing on the tools that I use day to day and potentially the ones I could use in a couple of years.",

You can even kind of simulate that functionality using old fashioned SQL, but it's a huge pain.\n\nIf, like most folks in our situation, you have no resources, no support, and no external understanding of the probelm, I've tackled it in Python. If your data isn't \"Big Data\" you can basically use Python to iterate over records like it's replaying an event stream. I basically have it scrutinize the identifiers on each event and ask \"Have I seen any of these identifiers in prior events I just processed? No, alright I'll give them a master, internal warehouse ID. Yes, I'll go back and find the master ID I gave some of them previously and assign it to this batch.\n\nI'm usually not a big fan of probablistic methods so I only count observations where there is some real identifier in common.",

That is to say, event driven data operations. \"When X happens, I publish to a topic. My subscriber is listening for that push and consumes the message to do push to Y\". You can use whatever for the message bus, there's plenty of easy ones.\n\nIf you're asking about general design patterns though, you'll want the `onSubmit` you mentioned to probably capture the data from an input, probably on the same screen as the button, and to do an operation against notion with that information. But that's just free-text-to-POST. If you wanted to spend a little more time on it, you could check that the GitHub username exists before pushing it, or return an error if it doesn't that way you're actually pushing a GH Username and not just text.

Not bad at all, but a different lane than classic DE that’s portable across industries.\n\nOn the flip side, if they’re giving you GCP projects, dataflow / airflow, dbt, warehouse design etc, that’s a strong DE move and probably worth the jump for both money and future options.",

Networking tickets to try connect to the source system from AWS. Also networking tickets for AWS to connect to destination systems. \n2. Finding out where all the variables for informatica were stored on the on prem server.\n   1. I hated this part soooooo much. \n3. Understanding the complex logic of the informatica jobs since people who built them left and no one understood what they were doing. I exported the XML for the informatica jobs and used copilot to create sql queries to pull from source systems instead of manually doing this. \n\nI know this didn't really answer you question but I needed to vent as this was an exhausting project.\n\nFor tools. I wasn't expecting large loads(Under 20gb). So I used Docker, python, and duckdb. I created a custom image to use on lambda and I orchestrated with AWS step function or Airflow depending on the team. I used ECS if I expected loads to take longer than 15 minutes. \n\nWe might have had to keep the on prem server if we could not access the source from aws. So Docker, python, and duckdb would still have been used. Orchestration would have been some sort of cron schedule. \n\nHope this helps and sorry for the vent. ",

I make double what I would in engineering. There will be decent private sector jobs available but considering you have BA in there, I would advise building out the scope of your current job insanely quickly to pad the ol resume and hunting pay rises or job hopping. The job is fantastic for analytical minds and formal training will make it easier if you know what technical options are available to you for the problem solving. \n\nI don't regret a thing 7 years down the line. My student debt is fully paid off, my job keeps me engaged and the pay was good to start so I never had to job hop (again, stupidly lucky) the only risk I have is I've had to dodge rounds of layoffs like a freaking ninja so if you can manage that you should be sweet long term!\n\nTldr; you've done the ground work to make great money in an interesting field, your anxiety is valid but you've set yourself up for big wins in the future.

In practice it appears to exist to try and create a role with emphasis on domain expertise to try and improve processes but without the salary premium in an investment in technical skills that would be required of a data analyst or other professional data roles. Sort of a what if there were a halfway business admin career level and a data analyst at a professional career level, but we can pay them cheaper. As result they tend to become data specs retrievers.\n\nWhere I call this a frankenstein role is because in practice when you do work the slow boring way, the technical details, that is where the pattern recognition develops. To see the insights in terms of what steps in the process can be eliminated. Where to break it into logical steps and streamline and automate. That technical work at the data analyst or more technical roles is where innovation happens, closest to the doing of the work. This is partly observation that in the industrial era it was common that those associates closest to the manufacturing lines would then observe a process improvement and go on to start a second business using those improved processes as a foundation. As we are in the tech white collar era the same principles appear to apply that those closest to the work observe pattern simplifications that innovate. In order to develop the intuition to improve processes there is no replacement for having performed that process. By doing so with time in a role a data analyst or other data positions tend to also develop domain expertise along with their technical skills.\n\nThus from my perspective what companies want from a business analyst requires experience in more technical roles, first. And this is what you see in more mature companies. The business analyst tends to be more of a senior data professional at a salary premium.

I'm making that assumption _because_ you included LangChain specifically. LangChain is going to be much easier than... you know, learning actual Machine Learning. As far as job prospects go, my personal money would still be on ML. Be the person manufacturing the shovels type of metaphor. \n\nIf I'm honest putting these two systems in a question about \"which to use to build a portfolio\" tells me you may need to ensure you're actually ready to present what you will build. The portfolio you make should present a really solid understanding of the framework you chose, allow you to speak to tradeoffs and choices, and show skills in troubleshooting and understanding limitations.

The honest answer is instruction files help with style but won't catch logical bugs.\n\nCLAUDE.md is great for things like 'use this date format' or 'always check if table exists before dropping' but AI will still write a dbt model that uses the wrong join type or handles nulls in a way that silently drops records. The instruction files can't encode business logic deep enough to prevent that.\n\nWhat actually works: dbt's built-in tests get you maybe 30% there. The wins come from singular tests that encode your actual business rules, stuff like 'revenue should never be negative' or 'customer count should be within 5% of yesterday.' We run those on every PR.\n\nWe also started requiring example queries with expected outputs in PR descriptions. Manual, yeah, but reviewers can run them and verify the logic. Caught more issues than any linter.\n\nThe sneaky pattern with AI-generated dbt is syntactically valid code that does the wrong thing with joins or nulls. We added a TESTING.md file listing these gotchas and requiring specific test coverage for them.\n\nFor open source where you can't control what people use, CI becomes the only guardrail. Require schema tests and singular tests per model before merge. If someone's AI code passes all that, honestly, good enough.",

        "body": "Howdy. Twenty-five-year-professional, thirty-eight-year passionate programmer here. I think you're feeling the right feelings but you might lack context.\n\nI used an LLM this weekend to knock out some database code. We have models (sqlalchemy talking to a Posgresql database), ORMs, and then GraphQL interfaces to fetch that data. So I had a collection of A's and I needed new collections of B's and C's and the interfaces for them. I described the problem to Copilot, and it did the work for me by creating new files, each of which was a 90% rewrite of an existing file.\n\nYou see the problem already. \"Why do you have to rewrite 90% of a file to do something as simple as 'a collection, but for a new type of data?' Because our abstraction is bad.\n\nBut here's the thing about software engineering in a professional setting: *the abstraction is always bad.* We are, forever, solving real problems real people have, balancing correctness, speed, and maintainability. As a programmer passionate about the profession, I want to push maintainability *all* the way to maximum.\n\nI am not paid to do that because it impacts speed. So we write enough abstraction to do the job and we limp it along until it becomes too burdensome to maintain.\n\nYou see code as art. And it is! I love creating a beautiful abstraction that cleanly describes and solves a problem. I do my best to write that code in my hobby-time outside work. But problems in the real world are not clean, they are often ill-described, and the deliverable solution is, as a result, messy and tricky to maintain. We can and do refactor, but not until we're *very* sure that the problem domain is so well-defined that hiding it behind abstraction to make it less verbose and error-prone will be worth costing us the flexibility of writing everything long-form. You don't write clean code to solve the problem every time because you don't even have a clear picture of the problem you're trying to solve. But each possible solution clarifies the problem and gets you closer. And LLMs, it turns out, are *great* at recognizing fuzzy patterns and applying transformations based on that.\n\nIf you treat code *only* as art (which you can choose to do!), you'll get paid like an artist. I'm not gonna tell you not to.\n\nBut solving real problems for real people usually requires writing mountains of bad code fast. LLMs are great at that. They're also surprisingly good at fast analysis of bad (overly verbose, redundant, ill-fit to the problem domain) code and creation of more code fitting the pattern. Which means someone's real problem gets solved faster.\n\nNo surprise people are gravitating towards that, because people have problems and want them solved.\n\nMy advice to you is to keep the passion. The algorithms *are* beautiful. Code *is* art. And, as you've already observed with your peers, letting the AI spit something out you can't understand and putting it in production is just the Sorcerer's Apprentice enchanting the broom to carry water and then letting it go.\n\nBut... Your mastery of craft will take you further *with* AI because you can use it to write code faster than your fingers can, and that gets real solutions into real people's hands faster.\n\nAnd programming and computer science is about the algorithms, but software engineering is about solving the problems human beings have right now.\n\nGood luck out there. The world is a big adventure right now. Bigger than it was when I was in uni. I envy you that, in a sense.",

To be honest, some of it is not bad; if you'd trust an intern to make repeated changes to your software, then AI can usually be leveraged to your advantage.  But if your codebase is complex and is 90% complete, AI often does a lot of harm along with some good.\n\n>And AI can't even code to save its life. It spits out nonsense inefficient code that doesn't even work half the time.\n\nYeah... I once asked AI to re-write code to be more efficient, and it wrote it using an algorithm that many people think is efficient, but that I knew from experience wasn't very efficient in my case.  It's as if AI accepts common misconceptions as fact.\n\n>The fact that people are saying that \"Programming is dead\" infruits me so much.\n\nCool word!  I don't know what \"*infruits*\" means, but I like it already!  I might even start using it myself!  `;-)`\n\n>I want my classmates to learn and discover the beauty of writing algorithms. I want websites to have strong cyber security measures that weren't vibe coded by sloppy AI. And most importantly to me I want to write code.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say.  This AI and Vibe Coding boom has only been going on for a handful of years now, so in another five years I wouldn't be surprised if the programming landscape will be very different.  Perhaps competent coders like you will be in high demand in 2030.\n\nI will say, however, that AI is unlikely to go away completely, and I've found that AI results tend to help us ***provided that a knowledgeable human*** ***vets the results*** first.  So if an AI generates results that are only 10% significant, a human can review them and find lots of good stuff.  But if we blindly use AI results that are only 10%, 50%, or even 90% accurate, we're liable to get nasty surprises 10%, 50%, or 90% of the time.\n\nSo my take is that blindly putting AI on autopilot has its problems, but using it as a search tool to find results we wouldn't normally find on our own is not so bad, provided we review all its results.",

If I took my time to understand the principles of analysis I am doing, the context I’m writing the code in, and then all of the CS analysis to make it beautiful, and then write the tests for it, it’d take me a month.\n\nCopilot can look at code I’ve written before and give the rough beats which I can then fill in quickly with context to my necessity, so I can be more intentional about any minute inaccuracies which might affect my ability to do a worthwhile analysis on the actual data I have.\n\nIt’s a way to work faster.

You should be able to run your code, and see that a chrome browser opens up, navigates to the site you specified in code, does the things you expected, and then shuts down. Suggestion: Have it perform this 10 times, and you calculate the average times between each action. Gives you brief superficial performance data.\n* Read all the rules of a large international lottery, then emulate it in a script. Write a for-loop or an equivalent that prints every X amount of money spent on lottery tickets until you hit the jackpot. It'll teach you basics about for-loops, ToString(), classes and to avoid lotteries.\n* Create an API that you can test using Postman/Insomnia (real world valuable experience).\n* Create a windows service (if you are learning .net that is), that you can install, start, stop, restart in windows gui (also valuable experience).\n* Install Docker Desktop or the equivalent on your computer. Then create a containerized small project, doesn't matter what the project is. What matters is that it runs inside the container and you can interact with the project through the exposed port (very valuable real world experience).\n* Create a project where you split its component into several containers, then orchestrate them through Docker Compose or an equivalent (very valuable real world experience).",

They do it 100% unpaid. Just for fun. When you are actually interested in programming you will naturally do the same. \n\nUnfortunately university level computer science programs are more than happy to take students who have never written a single line of code in their lives and I think that gives beginners the false impression that you can just be taught to write software from a school and you don't need to actually go into it with any prior experience. \n\nBut look at art or music schools. Can you imagine going to into a university music program and say \"Ok, now how do I play this instrument?\" Thats would be crazy. No respectable school would take such a student. \n\n> I keep seeing beginners (and even some experienced devs) struggle because they jump straight into writing code without fully understanding the problem. \n\nNo, they struggle because they are impatient and expect to be able to do more than is reasonable for a beginner.

By then just by reading the book i understanded it as simple as basic algebra.\n\nYou really do have to start with spending some time reading code and trying to make out what it does before you jump in.  It's not so much about what the code is, but 'why' the code is.  What is this code trying to do?  Why did they write it that was as opposed to some other way you have seen?  Each time you ask yourself one of these questions youre filling in the actual foundation of 'getting it'.  Actually trying to write the syntax is just applying that knowledge.",

You'll end up with a poorly performing mess, but that's okay. You have all the pieces. Now make it clean. Refactor to a solid structure that is maintainable and flexible. And finally make it fast.

Learn how to apply abstractions with protocols and ABCs, and injecting with FastAPI depends(). Start with just a REPL app if you must while you get the core structure, then evolve into fastAPI. (You can just write to a json file until you get a DB connected) \n\nBut I’d look into fastAPI, sqlalchemy for ORM, Alembic for migrations, pydantic for serialization and DTOs. Etc. \n\nYou have a lot to learn with Python alone. Could also throw in unit testing with pytest, also start thinking about docker, see if you can get a dockerfile + compose to spin up your app in one container and Postgres in another (I’d recommend focus on Postgres). It’s a lot if you want to go full stack with Python. It’s also not like C# where repo and unit if work patterns are implemented for you.

        "body": "Professional software developer here, and I agree with everything you've said. Building on your post, here's an analogy from my own experience that I think supports your point:\n\nI learned to write code before I learned to cook. I was equally interested/enamored by each of these skills when I first started to learn them.\n\nOne of the first things I learned to cook was [stir fried chicken with rice noodles][stir-fry]. For at least a month, I made this dish several times per week. This repetition afforded me space to observe and learn - I noticed when the color of some ingredients started to change in the cooking utensil (an observation I wasn't previously able to make). I started adding other ingredients to the dish because I had learned some intuition (which gave me confidence that even if my didn't turn out great, it wouldn't be terrible) over repeated exposure. Slowly, I was able to rely on visual cues without needing to set a timer (\"hey! the broccoli is starting to look like it's cooked\" instead of \"it's coming up on 3min, time turn down the heat\"). This is how I learned how to cook and how to understand what I was seeing on the stove. Prior to this, I had watched many cooking shows/videos and family and friends had even tried to show/teach me - all of this was \"tutorial hell\" and I never felt like I knew what I was doing. One lesson from this experience is that \"know what you're doing\" doesn't come before you build something for the first time. It's actually the other way around - you learn by doing stuff.\n\n<aside>  \nWhen I say that, I am reminded of providing tech support for my grandma. She'd always be afraid that she was going to accidentally break something. This is a real concern with programming languages - you could potentially delete files or crash your OS through some bug. But starter/learning projects rarely expose you to that functionality. If you're still afraid, consider using a virtual machine.  \n</aside>\n\nIt wasn't until I read this post, OP, that I made the connection between this cooking practice and something else I did when I was learning to write code (back in 2007 - I'm old, I guess). After I first learned python, I would often (and for no real reason other than \"I like to write code\") write a decimal to binary function in python. Sometimes it would take me a long time to write (30min was not uncommon), sometimes I'd write it in a few minutes. The point was never to write it quickly to \"beat my personal record\". The point was always to practice this new skill. Sometimes I'd write it recursively, sometimes I'd try something different.\n\nBut this repeated practice did for me, the same thing that repeatedly cooking the stir fry did. I was able to study different ways of solving the same problem and hone my understanding of how python works. Now, I didn't write my decimal to binary converter every day - I think the most frequently I did this was \"once a week\" for a few weeks (then, about once a month, and I eventually started to use it to test whether I liked a new keyboard). At the time for me, it was like re-reading my favorite passage out of my favorite fiction book (the was before Netflix, so that might translate today as \"rewatching my favorite episode of a TV show\").\n\nThat's really the secret sauce - practice for familiarity. When I use LLMs today, the value for me is that the LLM writes the code. The time savings for me comes from not having to physically type out the code. The thinking that goes into it beforehand (what architecture to use, what algorithm to use, what data structures to use, how to model the data flow and problem solving, etc; If I haven't yet made these decisions, I have a conversation with the LLM to help me decide) - I communicate all of that to the LLM and let it do very little beyond writing the code I described.\n\nIt does feel counterintuitive that learning to write code requires as much time and practice, because this learning time is often compared to learning other skills that require more time and practice to acquire and gain proficiency in. The key realization is that while learning to write code is faster than (say) learning to become a neurosurgeon, it still takes a lot (nowhere near zero) of time and effort. And while the proficiency threshold to make a meaningful contribution is lower than in many other professions, that threshold is not a plateau - the proficiency curve does go a lot higher and I think this might be one reason why beginners often get a wide range of feedback (from experienced developers with a wide range of proficiency levels)\n\nOk I took a couple of rambling tangents (sorry, it's Sunday afternoon), but the takeaways are:\n\n1. repeated exposure and practice are the key to escaping tutorial hell\n1. the proficiency threshold to \"build something\" is much lower to escape tutorial hell than it is to (for example) contribute to an existing project in a professional or opensource capacity\n1. the probability of accidentally making a catastrophic error is very low\n1. the notion that repeated exposure improves proficiency is not new (my cooking story), thought that's maybe more of a \"hard truth\" than a \"comforting fact\" as I had originally intended it to be\n\n[stir-fry]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8f752SdeAI",

It’s possible the thing you want to build has never been built before or at least hasn’t been built before the way you want to.  So you need to go out and find info about how to build the pieces and parts that you can, and extrapolate and experiment with the rest until it works the way you want.

Performance, bad inputs, unclear requirements. That is where intuition starts forming because you are not just applying a pattern, you are seeing when it breaks. That feedback loop is hard to simulate with passive learning.\n\nThe only caveat is some people jump into building without enough basics and just feel overwhelmed.

I do not mean that one should start lying and exaggerating things but I mean, be confident in what you know and in what you do not know. \"Yeah, I do not know frontend development but I'm considering learning it.\" or \"I'm a backend developer but having to do frontend tasks seems to be a good challenge.\" I have told these. Not during interviews but during 1:1s when I was moved to a fullstack position. And my boss was fine. Because she saw that I actually show an interest in improving myself. If I would be \"I'm worried about frontend tasks. I really hope I will not get any of these. Backend tasks are much safer bet.\" then that would be bad. Lack of confidence, no wish to grow, perhaps even stagnation.\n\nThen lack of confidence when being on probation period. Cool, you got hired! You passed all these interviews. But the next 2-5 (however long time period) months are also critical. Either you pass the probation period or the company has to tell that \"Sorry. We considered it but we do not see how things will progress from here.\" Perhaps different countries have different laws and such, but where I live, a person is put on a \"test period\" of a couple of months before his contract is finalized (meanwhile the contract is temporary). So, some juniors, they are not confident. They do not ask questions. They do not share their thoughts. They do not participate in discussions over new tasks and such. They get stuck and do not voice it out. They start comparing themselves with younger colleagues who have been in the field for longer time, then get some irrational fears, and let it affect themselves even more negatively.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say: this field indeed is difficult. But one should be confident in himself. Have a growth mindset. When you see you are lacking in something do not see it as a weakness but see it as an opportunity to learn new things. When you see that people are more experienced and more skilled than you then do not see this as a threat but as an opportunity to learn from them.",

Figure out the mouse works and screen regions, callbacks, etc.  You’ll abandon this but you gained insight into what’s going on.  All of that mouse info is tracked in real frameworks.  Be aware of it and use it.\n\nNow start higher languages.  Try some procedural and some functional.  You’ll start to like one.  \n\nNext, learn threads and asynchronous coding.  Wrap your head around the different ways languages and systems handle threads and how not to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\nIn parallel with learning threads, learn I/O, bottlenecks, buffering, streams, etc., combining these with threads and async code.  Do extreme tests and see how quickly you can process insanely large files.  How many large files in parallel?  How about millions of small files?\n\nThen there is database connectivity.  Combine the async IO stuff and now start getting structured.  Learn file types, how to process them, filter them, project to new types, get things in and out of databases.  What kind of database works for different problem sets?\n\nAt this point, you can good job in most shops.\n\nTo take things next level, learn AI and machine learning.  Learn the problems they solve and how to implement them.  This will give you insight into where the industry will be.\n\nSo the chain is understanding data. Data turns into knowledge.  Knowledge turns into wisdom.  Turning data into knowledge means identifying patterns.  These patterns are timeless, like identifying faces in a photo, or are a time series like identifying engaged customers based on purchase history.  15 years ago pattern identification was costly and hard.  It has since turned into toolset.  We can identify more and more patterns now.  And this isn’t going to slow down any time soon.",

You do not need someone to teach you how the product works for you to get started to work on it.\n\n* how to make a first contribution\n\nIt is the same as being assigned your first task at a company. You setup the code and pick an issue and try reproducing the issue and then determine the fix for it and write a neat technical report and paste it as a comment explaining how your fix works and how the application runs after you fix it and request them to see if they can review your PR\n\n* common mistakes to avoid\n\nPutting in no effort and using AI to make superficial fixes (eg commenting out the code that prints the error and claiming that you've fixed it etc). Making no effort to learn what the project is about and just choosing it because open source looks good on your resume. Commenting on random issues with 'Can you assign this to me' or 'Can I work on this' instead of actually putting in the work and then posting the solution there. Your job is to make their lives simpler and to contribute in a positive way, if you're making them put extra work then you're not helping open source but actively setting it back (especially if you end up not contributing and giving up midway)",

The use of a contiguous memory layout, as well as enforcement of homogenous contents, are both secondary aspects of what makes something an array. An array is an ordered data structure which has (close to) constant time access to its contents by index. It’s better to think of these data structures in terms of the performance guarantees they provide for different operations than to try to focus on their implementations. Implementations can involve all sorts of hairy performance optimizations which obscure the intent of the data structure.\n\nThe weird thing about JS arrays, and ArrayList objects compared to something like C or Java’s primitive arrays, is that they allow the data structure’s size to efficiently dynamically grow. The other weird thing about JS arrays is that they can be sparse, but that’s something you hopefully will never have to deal with. \n\nTo be pedantic, it’s pretty common for arrays to “hold” heterogenous contents in languages other than JS. I use scare quotes because arrays of objects generally don’t hold objects themselves, but rather pointers to those objects. In languages with subtyping (like Java) the pointers may indeed point to multiple different types of objects as long as they are all subclasses of the array’s declared generic argument. A typed language like Java thus allows arrays to hold heterogenous data, but requires you to access the data as though it is homogenous (unless you use an unsafe downcast). Dynamically typed languages like JS and Python are more permissive, but it’s (IMO) a difference of degree, not a difference of kind.",

Contrast with an \"associative array\" (no analogue in vanilla C, `Map` (and arguably `{}`) in JS, `Map` in Java). These are non-sequential. You look up by key, not by index. Some associative arrays define a predictable _iteration_ order (Java's `LinkedHashMap` uses insertion order, Java's `TreeMap` uses natural key ordering), but that's not true of all of them (Java's `HashMap` provides no guarantees).",

So it's entirely expressible as a type, and as such the array is homogenously `array[Any]` or however you'd want to express the type.\n\nThe other thing is that pretty much any language has some affordance for creating some sort of union, which you can then use in arrays. It will vary how ergonomic and error-prone it is, but in any case you can cook up an array of data that holds heterogenous base types.\n\nAs in, you can define some union of integers and floats and put that in an array, which will be homogenous in that it only accepts that union and rejects stuff like strings, objects, etc; at the same time it'll be heterogenous in that you'll need to have some way of knowing which of the types in the union a given entry is.\n\nSo the idea of homo/heterogeneity can be misleading,\n\n* because any sort of collection will always be homogenous if it's well-typed: all the elements in some collection `C[T]` are of type `T`\n* but may still be heterogenous in terms of base types: `T` may be a union of `T1 | T2 | …`",

The *class* only *describes*/*defines* the general setup, while the *object* fills it with data.\n\nThere is another thing to consider: The implementation of OOP differs vastly between programming languages to the point that it is not even directly comparable (just take JavaScript, Python, and Java - completely different implementations of OOP). \n\n\n1.  In terms of programming an object is an instance of a class. - It's the *data/state* (fields/attributes/members) coupled with the *behavior* (methods) of a specific class (type).\n2.  The binary data is scattered - the methods are stored in one place, and in one place only, no matter how many objects you create. The *state* (fields, attributes, members) are stored somewhere else, typically, but not necessarily, in contiguous memory blocks, individually for each object (apart from the exception of `static` members that also only exist once in memory). This is a very efficient approach as the data is usually a lot less than the methods.\n3. It is not actually that different. In some languages even structs can have methods - so the line blurs depending on the language. In a way, structs (as the structs in C) are the predecessor of classes.\n4. Methods are functions that belong to a class - it's basically just terminology. When a programmer talks about *functions* they mean *unbound functions* that exist outside the context of OO. When they talk about *methods*, they always talk about \"functions\" that are bound to classes and that only exist in the context of OO.\n\nThe difference between function and method is: `len(string)` vs. `string.length()` - the former is a function that exists outside the context of classes and objects, but can accept an object, and the latter is a method that exists in the context of the `string` instance of a class.\n\nIt's like \"please draw me a fish\" (\"draw\" being the function and \"fish\" being the argument) and \"fish, please draw yourself\" (\"fish\" being the object and \"draw yourself\" being the method called).",

The C language had not even been written at this point. \n\nAll of the boundaries that you're imagining were gradually defined over the next half century, and they are all domain specific. Each programming language has its own definition of an 'object', and the way that interacts with the other primitives depends on the implementation of that language and the hardware architecture that runs it.",

        "body": "I don't know Rust, but I know C++, so I'll explain it in that syntax, but the concepts are universal.\n\nI warn you that if you look at objects too low level, the concept itself dissolves. Consider:\n\n    class person {\n      int weight, height, age;\n\n    public:\n      void jump(int how_high), run(int how_far);\n    };\n\nIn memory - whether it's on the stack or the heap, it going to lay out in memory per byte something like:\n\n    [w][w][w][w][h][h][h][h][a][a][a][a]\n\nThis is the same as if it were a structure. Objects are programming concepts - when you get down to the machine, it's all bytes - bytes for data, bytes for addresses, bytes for offsets, bytes for instructions...\n\nAs for the functions, that gets compiled into the program binary, just like any other function. The syntax dissolves at the assembly level - to call the interface, you have to build a stack frame and push your parameters. One of the parameters is going to be the location of the object instance in memory - the hidden `this` pointer. So just as you have to push how high to jump, you also need to push who is doing the jumping. Again - the machine just sees program instruction sequences - bytes, and more bytes, and more bytes.\n\nYes, you can directly replicate what the compiler is going to generate for you with a `struct` and a function that takes a pointer, but why? The syntax is there to facilitate what you already want to do in a more concise manner.\n\nBut also, programming constructs are MORE than just syntax. C++, Rust, ANY language is more than just a high level assembly. The language defines the confines of what these things are, and the compiler is allowed to exploit everything else. In other words, stated more concretely - C++ has a SHITTON of Undefined Behavior, it's kind of notorious for it, but that's a GOOD thing, because everything the language doesn't say, the compiler can exploit for optimization. We want as much of that as possible, and then we can wrap those dicy corners with the standard library so you don't have to deal with it directly.\n\nThe hard part is cultural - getting people to use the facilities provided and stop writing raw imperative code that gets them into trouble.\n\n> What is an object in terms of programming? \n\nAn object is a user defined type, that models behavior, by encapsulating state, to protect it's invariant.\n\nSo an `std::vector` is always implemented in terms of 3 pointers. The invariant is that those pointers are ALWAYS well defined. There is no intermediate state that YOU the client can ever observe. You also don't actually know how the vector is implemented, and you don't have direct access. You defer to the vector to enforce its invariant, and it's behavior is well defined through its interface. When you hand program control to the vector, it can suspend it's own invariant - say, to reallocate, but that invariant is reestablished before it returns control.\n\nSo objects have a certain level of autonomy and agency. They know what to do, they don't need you to tell them how to do their job. It's why you employ classes in the first place, because that encapsulation keeps your program more correct and consistent.\n\n> How does the binary data and the methods in the class get managed at low level? Does the data get scattered in one place? Or it's just managed by pointers? \n\nFrankly it doesn't matter. No programming language gets that specific, because it's not portable.\n\n> How is an instance of a class that has no methods in it different from a struct type variable?\n\nTechnically there is no different. Idiomatically, a class models behavior, and a struct is a tagged tuple. It's a conventional difference in meaning. Classes make for terrible structures. A car has some state, about the position of keys, dials, doors, etc, and the interface will open and close things, speed up and slow down... But NONE of that is dependent upon the make, model, or year. Those are variables that are independent. The same car can go by different names and makes. Is that a Subaru BRZ or a Scion FRS? Trick question, they're the exact same car made in the exact same factory as a joint project between the two companies.\n\nSo if anything, you bundle your car model with it's pedantic properties in some sort of tagged tuple or relational or table structure.\n\n> How is a method different from a function that does some operations based on different values of its properties?\n\nAt that low level, there isn't a difference. But any language and implementation can make the difference more significant. A free function and a public structure, you can do anything you want, and while you can do everything strict and correct, there's nothing preventing me from writing my own function that fucks everything. A class with a method? You're encapsulating state and enforcing an invariant.",

Starting early has many benefits, but learning programming takes time (and never stops!),  depending on how you spend it, you become better faster or slower.  \nThe point I want to make is, you should focus more on your skills than on your age.\n\nYou're very ambitious and motivated, great, keep that and you will reach the goals you mentioned.   \n  \nOther than that, great work so far, keep learning!  \n",

        "body": "Like the others say, the structure is fine, especially for a program of this size. There are some things that you might wind up doing differently over time, especially in bigger projects. Which is to say, they can be considered overengineering for a program of this size & scope, but overengineering otherwise small programs can also be a decent way to learn about those engineering practices.\n\n*Avoiding \"magic\" numbers*: Your `else` case for the difficulty rating is meant to result in `easy` mode, but this can drift apart. If you decide to give `easy` mode 4 tries for example, then you need to update that number in two spots. There are a couple of ways around that, like storing the numbers in constants, e.g. `const int EASY_MODE_TRIES = 3;` and then using the constant rather than the literal number, and/or having an extra parsing step where you wind up doing something like an extra function that ends on `else { cout << \"Something…\"; return EASY; }`, returning something like an `enum` of the valid difficulty ratings, or even a struct. Error handling and parsing user input can be kind of big topics with lots of options.\n\nBut generally, magic numbers are a hazard for code maintenance, because it very often turns into questions like \"why is it _this_ number? can I change it? what happens if I do?\" and some constants with names and rationales go a long way to alleviate that.\n\n*More functions*: Generally we break code up into what's hopefully logical chunks. Often to avoid repetition, but also sometimes just to break up long reams of code into something more like a condensed sequence of subtasks. Opinions vary on how long a function should be allowed to get. My opinion is something like trying to be able to fit the entire function on the screen (but also not trying to bend over backwards to follow the rule), which I think is a fairly common middle-of-the-road opinion.\n\nThere are also a whole bunch of C++ concepts and best practices that you'll kind of have to pick up over time; one that may be good to get you to look into as soon as possible is \"[const correctness](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)\".",

Why is `<ctime>` included? Because if you didn't, the code wouldn't compile, because `time()` is missing. Right? In this way, the code speaks for itself.\n\n    // Convert difficulty input to lowercase (so EASY, Easy, easy all work)\n\nSee? This isn't a bad comment, though you could tighten it up. The important thing is to not tell us what the code tells us, because here's the thing - typically such comments and code disagree. So who's the authority? Which is right? The code? Or the comment?\n\nOne thing your comments are doing is making up for a lack of functions. You're lacking expressiveness, and so you're trying to name what you're doing with the comment. Perhaps your next lesson will introduce functions to you, and this will dry up.\n\n    std::transform(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end(), difficulty.begin(), ::tolower);\n\nThere is a bug here. It's really technical and subtle, and I don't fully understand it myself, but the [reference documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/tolower.html) warns you this is unsafe, that you need to write a function that casts your character type to `int`.\n\n    random_num = rand() % max_num + 1;\n\nThis is the same in every branch of your difficulty condition. Just hoist it out and write this code once, after the condition block.\n\n    std::getline(std::cin, guess); // Take guess as string\n    user_guess = std::stoi(guess); // Convert string to integer\n\nToo many steps! Streams know how to extract integers! Your problem is interleaving extraction with line grabbing.\n\nThe rules of extraction are:\n\n1) Ignore leading whitespace\n\n2) Start grabbing characters\n\n3) Stop at some delimiter character. Leave the delimiting character behind, in the stream.\n\nThe rules for line grabbing are:\n\n1) Grab characters one at a time\n\n2) Stop when you find the delimiter character, discarding it.\n\nSo imagine first extracting an `int` - something like `\"    123\\n\"; the stream purges the leading whitespace, grabs \"123\" and leaves \"\\n\" behind. Now you line grab, and what happens? We grab \"\\n\", which is our delimiter, and we stop.\n\nSo the thing to do is know when you're switching between the two, and `ignore` the newline as necessary.\n\n    int x;\n    std::string s;\n\n    std::cin >> x;\n    std::cin.ignore(); // Purge after extraction, before getline\n    std::getline(std::cin, s);\n\n    std::getline(std::cin, s);\n    std::cin >> x; // No purge necessary after getline\n\nAnother thing you should be doing is checking your streams. A stream is implemented as a \"user defined type\", which are made from `class`, `struct`, `enum`, and `union`. One of the things you can do is \"overload\" almost any of the language operators. That's how `operator >>` and `operator <<` - the bit shift operators, are made to work as stream extraction and insertion - they're written as functions that work with stream types. And when you learn to make your own types, you can write your own stream operators for them without having to modify the stream class itself - the pattern is extensible.\n\nContinued...",

Like, over 90% can’t program at all. Certifications can be faked and aren’t used very much. Manually verifying someone’s resume takes forever, and often employers will only tell you that someone was employed during certain dates. \n\nSo, you need some way to quickly verify that the person you’re interviewing can actually program. \n\nHistorically, I think it was Microsoft that is to blame for popularizing programming puzzles, but the reason they’re still being used is that it’s one way to be sure that the interviewee can program. Although it’s far from the only way, and you definitely miss out on people that can program in a more real world setting. \n\nPersonally, my favorite approach is to ask people to submit any piece of code that they wrote and are proud of, about 100 lines or so, and then we talk about it. Another popular alternative is take-home tests, which tend to be more similar to real-world programming, but are a bigger burden on applicants. One interesting approach I’ve seen is they ask you to review a piece of code and tell them if there are bugs or other issues.",

I was making a mod for Minecraft (using Java obviously). I had an item that could petrify entities by replacing the targeted entity with a modded “petrified entity”. In the petrified entity renderer I had to use Forge’s API in order to get the model from some render buffer somewhere. It then takes the model and applies a stone texture for rendering.\n\nHowever I quickly discovered a burial bug that occurs. If there is an actual instance of the target entity being rendered on screen at the same time as a petrified entity of the same entity, then any animations that played on the living one played on the petrified entity model. That obviously looks a little weird.\n\nI determined the cause of this was the fact the function I was calling to get the model wasn’t new model and was a shared reference or a shallow copy of a model. Now this were a copy constructor would have been very handy, but it didn’t seem to have one nor did the model class have the copy method implemented. \n\nI ended up writing this kinda ugly piece of code using reflections to solve it. It only needs to run once as it caches the model,  so it isn’t too bad performance wise, but the code is ugly. A copy constructor or similar would have been super handy.",

Some objects really do need to run some code to make a valid copy, because they internally manage some resource. \n\nAs a simple example, consider a list. The list object itself usually doesn't directly contain its elements. It contains some kind of reference to separate memory which stores the elements. That memory is a resource it has to manage. Stuff like allocate new memory when you insert elements, free the memory when the list itself is being destroyed, etc.\n\nIf you were to just create a bitwise copy of the list object, now you'd have two list objects, which are expected to manage the same memory, probably not knowing that the other one exists. This would lead to some serious memory safety bugs.

And at that point basic DSA and other stuff you've learned may look like kindergarten knowledge to you but from most lectures I've attended I can tell you that the base is absolutely crucial. If you can figure out the proper data structure(s) for your system/sub-system, the algorithms will follow without you having to explicitly design anything beyond business logic operations. And one of the most important statements I've learned is that whenever you're building something - a small project, a system, a library, an api, etc. think of it as \"Everything is a __\" where the __ is basically a morphable entity that you design from scratch. And the entire system can essentially be considered a single unit of that entity, even though it's made out of the same entity in smaller scales. This is where programming paradigms help alot. For example in Java, everything is an object. What is an object? For that you must know the details of OOP - which is just another programming paradigm. \n\nI can recommend https://roadmap.sh/ for a quick progress tracker as it covers the majority of this sphere.\n\nLastly, having a mathematical mind is crucial to programming, because getting desired results from any given problem through programming can be achievable via brute force in the worst situations. But solving a problem in an optimized manner requires a ton of math and math oriented thinking. Because taking shortcuts and cutting corners is what makes your code precise and fast. This is where your knowledge of DSA can be applied in smaller scales - competitive programming problems from sites like Leetcode are extremely helpful and will give you a good grasp of what to do in most situations.",

Sometimes the tooling available feels a bit like using a pair of wrong-handed scissors, some languages feel like they're full of [cow tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tools), and that feeling will vary across people. That's part of why we have different programming languages.\n\nIt is usually possible to become competent at some language that has low compatibility with the programmer, but I suspect most would rather avoid those languages and use those they feel comfortable with.

Outside of getting a degree in CS, that has always been the most helpful, since it both keeps me busy and gives me something to gauge my learning by.\n\nIf it helps, here was my road. I didn’t have a map for my programming career initially, but I’ve learnt that adapting is the best strategy for my own path. I wasn’t familiar with computer science at all growing up, despite having a father who was a programmer. I tried to go to college but dropped out to protect my grades. Then I worked at Lowe’s for a time. While there, I bought a game on steam that taught Python. Overnight, I fell in love with coding. I took a year and taught myself how to code in Python through learnpython.org. I also gave myself the framework of making a fully-Python-based game engine (which I still haven’t finished), so that I could learn how the language worked. Now I’m back at the university learning coding. I took the required course on C++ and also researched ahead on some C++ concepts before they were taught, such as C++ classes and templating. Now I have practiced with C++ for over a year and am working on my own language. So all that to say we each have different roads and different ways of navigating through life.\n\nIf you think you’re an imposter, you don’t have as much of a right to feel that way as I do, since I’m so late to the game and my life has more twists and turns than yours has. And I don’t feel that, because I’d rather give myself purpose and structure than to feel like I’m useless. If it helps you, a programmer should be able to find their own purpose when they seemingly have none. That is what is required in order for a programmer to come up with the software they make.",

You can use Github Project, Trello, Notion, Jira, IceScrum or sheet of paper.\n\nWrite nice-to-have and optional and keep them in mind when you code. It does not mean doing a lot of abstraction \"just in case\".\n\nThis will already help a lot.\nNow, don't refactor until absolutely needed to add a feature. You should not have to refactor a lot if you did the first part correctly.\n\nSometimes 1-2 workarounds are fine, everything does not need to be perfect all the time. Wait until the workaround causes more issues that it solves.\n\nFinally, from time to time, allow yourself a review of your project. List the pain points, bottlenecks, ... and plan refactors.

That is what refactoring is - it isn't something you can wave around that solves your weird memory-allocation scheme into something more professional.\n\nAnyways - first you plan how the code should be structured, you probably need to diagram something for this, as you won't be able to remember. You plan which classes you need, and which methods they should contain, what those methods should receive and return, and so on. You decide if some methods should perhaps be closer together in a single class, to keep coherence high, and you decide if some should receive fewer data-structures (or objects) to keep coupling loose ...\n\nAlso, you make sure that you have valid tests that can run for both the un-refactored and the refactored code - if not, you write them along the way.\n\nAlso, create a new branch for all this work, as you'll without a doubt break something!\n\nThen you begin - usually the steps are somewhat like this, but there's never a perfect recipe:\n\n1. Split functions and methods up into smaller parts\n2. Create additional classes and connect them\n3. Move functions / methods to their new classes\n4. Change globally available variables to locally where needed\n5. Change method parameters and/or return values - perhaps introduce new objects to be received and returned.\n\nBetween each step you test, and once the tests pass, you commit - then go on to the next step.\n\nThat is basically the way.\n\n  \nRefactoring *never* makes the code \"better\" or \"faster\" from the computer's point of view - it is usually still the exact same lines of code that runs, but they are structured better from the programmers' point of view, so that they'll have an easier time implementing new features and changing functionality!",

Yeah, your existing code is shit, it's even got bugs, but it's a known quantity. What you're suggesting is all new code, that accomplishes the same goals as the old code, and it's unproven. Remember that the customer doesn't see the code. You mean you want to take 6 months to deliver... the exact same thing as what we already have?\n\n> Like i dont know if i have some kind of RoadBlock but for me when you already have \"working\" Code but you know you can refactor it to make it better, faster, etc. it just seems like starting from Scratch feeling :(\n\n> Also i gotta be honest i really often do not know where to begin even >.> \n\nSecond, the human mind is conservative. We HATE loss, so we're susceptible to things like the sunk cost fallacy. So to save some of the cost you've put into this code base, to minimize your losses, you try to make a minimal change. It's usually not robust enough to be a total solution, it's a hack or bandaid. One or two can be forgivable, but they add up quickly.\n\n> But yea anyone got any Advice for dealing with these Huge Tasks of either Refactoring or Rewriting Large Chunks of your Code >.>\n\nThird, this is the difference between juniors and seniors. I have 37 years of mistakes to inform my design decisions without having to consciously think about it - that's called intuition. This may be new code, but I've already made up my mind about it 20 years ago, when I had to learn that one thing the hard way... So refactoring is so hard because your system is too tightly coupled and does not tolerate refactoring. All software systems have their limitations, nothing is infinitely extensible or refactorable or perfectly decoupled. The difference is how far you can go before it starts looking like bandaids or hits the hard wall that you need a redesign.\n\nOne form of refactoring is short-sighted, where what you have is \"over-fit\" (borrowing from my data analyst wife), too tightly coupled, not flexible or extensible, it only does exactly what it was designed to do, and how. So what you end up doing is redesigning the thing with YET ANOTHER over-fit solution.\n\nAnother form of refactoring is well seasoned. You design with flexibility in mind. This can be a hard sell even in the industry, because it can seem pointless at the time if the others think this is a well understood and fixed area. So good code is actually needlessly decoupled, because you end up tripping over it eventually, and you'll be glad you have that flexibility built in. It's stupid until you end up needing it. It's extra and unnecessary complexity until you end up needing it. It's needlessly expensive (premature optimization) until you both need it and discover the performance didn't matter here, anyway.\n\nAnd that's a dangerous one - performance, people will die on that hill, but then you become over-dependent on the performance of that segment to makeup for the failings of other, \"justified\", sloppy and expensive code. Well now you have to break this thing, and you lose the performance, and it's not itself a big deal, but it does expose the weaknesses of other code. And rather than fixing it, there's more bias to ignore it and blame other parts, put the burden on them to make up for it.\n\n---\n\nContinued...",

        "body": "Hey! If you’re just starting out with programming, I think you should give pseudocode a try. Many tutors and computer science professors have already developed an algorithmic mindset, so they often dive straight into teaching specific languages and syntax. In doing so, they sometimes overlook the root of the challenge: learning how to think like a coder.\n\nIn my opinion, when you're a beginner facing a programming problem, you should first grab a blank sheet of paper and ask yourself: 'How can I break this down like a cooking recipe?'\n\nFor example, if I asked you to write a function that returns a boolean based on whether a number is prime, you could map it out like this:\n\n>Function isPrime(n):\n\n>If n≤1 then:\n\n>return False\n\n>If n=2 then:\n\n>return True\n\n>If n is even then:\n\n>return False\n\n>For i from 3 to SquareRoot(n) with a step of 2:\n\n>If i divides n then:\n\n>return False\n\n>EndFor\n\n>return True\n\nOnce you’ve done that and you’re confident in your logic, go ahead and write the code in the language you're learning. If you get stuck on the syntax, just look it up. Remember: syntax is just a matter of practice and habit. The real hurdle is training your brain to think algorithmically.\n\nIt might seem a bit silly to use pen and paper for a simple function like this, but I promise you that after a few weeks, you’ll develop a real knack for deconstructing problems. After that, you'll be free to focus entirely on reading and writing the code itself.",

You have to learn to architect systems and break down work such that you can take the harder problems yourself and set your juniors up for success while also being responsive to your users.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that junior and mid level engineers get their work from senior engineers while senior engineers have a more active role in defining the work. You have to do that in such a way that you carve out safe rails for junior engineers to work along and good bones to respond to often chaotic business needs. Don’t discount the degree to which that will strengthen you technically.\n\nIt sounds like you are an experienced mid level engineer but a pure focus on directly improving your own technical skill will hold you back. Counterintuitively, you will grow more technically at this point in your career by taking on more of an ownership/leadership role with your people and learning to apply your technical skills to power everyone up.",

Don't identify problems that aren't really problems. For instance, if the code base is full of cruft and you say \"the code is bad and I'd like to clean it up, let me lead a team for 6 months to rewrite it\" then you're just stepping on toes.\n\n\nInstead, be ready to show the ROI and to show you've thought through the hard parts of what you propose and already have a feasible solution.\n\n\nOne of the first things I did when transitioning to lead was identify a problem with our database. Every day we got an automated data feed, which triggered a program that dropped a large table, did a bulk data import, reindexed it, and ran a bunch of queries. Almost like clockwork, the DBMS would fall to its knees and one or more senior people would do a little fire drill, 45 minutes wasted every day. They were just used to it and couldn't think outside the box. I did a proof of concept that did everything totally differently and placed almost no load on the DBMS, studiously avoiding any hint that the people who came up with the original system were idiots, and my project was adopted with me as the implementer. My star at that company rose significantly because they could see I could be entrusted with more than run-of-the-mill tasks.",

        "body": "This is very good, and I concur with the bulk of it. I think there's good reasons that Golang and Rust lean far more towards a model of \"These are the shapes of data structures and we describe them and then write functions to act on them\" (with a syntactic sugar to do method calls) than their predecessors. I'd also like to add one more thought in this space: as software engineering has cared more and more about the network and shipping data between execution domains, coupling data to behavior has fallen grossly out of favor because **behavior is local to an execution engine and data is not**. If my data is wrapped up in a class instance and I have to ship it over the wire, I now have to peel the \"shippable\" data from the \"unshippable,\" i.e. any dynamic method pointers, vtables, or other mechanisms to specify what class this is an instance of, and that's annoying. If your data is in a bog-standard language-supported generic structure, you can ship it to a bog-standard language-supported generic marshaller and be done with the problem of getting it on and off the wire.\n\nI think I'd like to tune your thoughts a bit, because OOP conflates a couple of goals and we might want to talk about how we toss the bathwater without the baby.\n\n**Encapsulation and interface boundary**: You mention the challenge of \"re-opening\" a class to add new behavior. Some languages allow that! It's generally considered an anti-design. The reason is that being able to wall off code and say \"You can touch this via this mechanism and no other\" is a feature that enables large, decentralized teams to collaborate better by hiding details. If I hand you a Date object with methods, you do not need to care how I'm implementing the methods (with the tradeoff being the only things you can do with *my* Date object are the ones the interface exposes). This leaves me free to change my implementation without breaking you (maybe; see Hyrum's Law), and that's extremely important for being able to iterate to a solution because we almost never know how to write the best solution the first time. The humble `string` is actually my favorite example of this; crack the actual implementation of strings open in many high-level languages and you find that they're fascinatingly complicated (implementing things like caching and memory-reuse on string copy and substring so that the programmer doing the most obvious things with strings doesn't immediately torpedo program performance). If programmers touched the string internals directly, it would make using strings in those systems a nightmare. Golang has interfaces and structs instead of classes and objects, but it also has the rule that you can't write a function that acts directly on the contents of a struct if you aren't in the same module as the struct so that developers can't write code that depends directly on another developer's implementation without consent.\n\n**Discoverability**: So I have a struct. What can I do with it? How do I find all the functions that could be applied to that struct so I don't reinvent the wheel? In OOP, the answer is simple: the methods on the class and the parents of the class. In the data-and-functions paradigm... Good luck!\n\nIt's not quite that bad. It *was* when computers were slower and smaller, which is one of the reasons I think OOP took off when it did. Nowadays, with a language with good static typing and an LSP, you can find all functions that take a given data type as an argument (even grep will work in a pinch, although you'll have to do your own composition analysis). But OOP gives someone a big leg-up on the discovery problem by imposing a paradigm of how code is sorted.\n\nThough I highlight the above, I concur with OP: **you don't** ***need*** **OOP to get those things.** It's just worth noting that when you throw OOP out, you're throwing out a paradigm that tries to give you those things for free (well, for cheap... The documentation engines I've seen for Java factories kind of give the lie to the notion that OOP \"solves\" discoverability). The trick is to know what your plan is to get those things without OOP in the languages you plan to use.",

OOP is about message passing - which you've missed entirely, OOD is about object modeling, which is orthogonal to OOP and entirely at your discretion - I don't use it. Objects don't couple behavior with data, they couple behavior with state. You can use OOD to model data. You conflate objects with types, and your arguments are mostly about types. You misunderstand aggregation vs. composition. Your conclusion is confused, because ECS is an architecture you can implement regardless of your paradigm.\n\nYou do have one valid criticism of OOP, and that is due to the agency of the object. Each object is an island of one, which for batch processing is bad, and for stream processing is worse. While you can make a character object and a string object - to get adequate performance, you can't composite one in terms of the other, so you get a scaling problem that composition in FP solves.\n\nWhile I still say stick with FP, I can also say the difficulties you have suffered from OOP is due to your misunderstands.

        "body": "> I don’t know how people learn programming.\n\nDefinitely not by *watching* tutorials. People learn programming through programming, through experimenting, through playing around, through failing, through breaking things, through fixing. In that line, I'll leave my [comment from yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r0wwoi/problem_with_watching_youtube_coding_tutorials/o4lz1x9/) from a related thread.\n\nIf you haven't done that yet, played around with the code, experimented, you have done everything wrong.\n\n>  Everyone says “build projects”\n\nAnd in that sense everyone is 100% correct. You have to build projects.\n\nYet, your (like most beginners'/learners') understanding of what is a project is wrong. Every single thing *you* program is a project, even if it is just `print(\"Hello World!\")`. That's how you learn. You have to start with small and simple projects (see the [FAQ - projects by learnt subject](https://github.com/desrtfx/SkillGradedProjects)) and start there. You have to grow your projects with your skills and your skills have to grow with your projects.\n\nYou don't start writing the next Photoshop, or Word. You start small and simple.\n\nEven the programs I just mentioned started way smaller than they are now. Word initially was just a better Notepad with formatting. All the features we now know of it developed over the decades that it already exists. My first version of Word was 3.0 under MS-DOS and then it was just a bit more than Notepad is today. It had formatting, it had pagination, it had already some limited spell checking. It didn't do much else at that time. Table of Contents, document fields, etc. came a bit later, over time.\n\n----\n\nStop *watching* tutorials and start *programming*. Experiment. Play around. Try things. That's the way to learn.",

Are you just watching the tutorials or are you using them as a guideline? Also , tutorials are rarely the best option to learn how to code . To write good code and build projects as you said , you have to understand the code you are writing and understand how it works . Use books , they are better .

I was going to post my Cayley-Dickson construction to show how I generate the complex numbers from the field of real (double) numbers and then apply CD once again to get one of the six unital quaternionic (not commutative but still associative) involution division rings by doubling the complex numbers and mapping i to one of ±i, ±j, or ±k, but I would have to post too much code (a few dozen interfaces) to make it make sense, so instead, I'll post something more self-contained that will probably be more interesting to people here, i.e. the factoradic representation of a number.\n\nStill, it's a really cool algorithm and way to generate the \"Cayley-Dickson tower\" which creates an infinite sequence of algebras starting with the reals to create the complex numbers, the quaternions, the octonions, the sedenions, etc. without needing to explicitly code any of them.\n\nThe thing about Cayley-Dickson is that you lose \"nice properties\" every time you recurse:\n\nWhen you go from the Reals to the Complex, you lose ordering, but you do get an algebraically closed field, which is always nice. (Every polynomial has a root in the field, and thus splits.)\n\nWhen you go from the Complex to the Quaternions, you lose commutativity (so xy ≠ yx for all x, y).\n\nWhen you go from the Quaternions to the Octonions, you lose associativity (so x(yz) ≠ (xy)z for all x, y, z, but you still have alternativity, which is a weaker form where (xx)y = x(xy) and y(xx) = (yx)x for all x, y.)\n\nThe Sedenions are where the shit really hits the fan: you only have power associativity and you get nonzero divisors, i.e. ab = 0 where a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson\\_construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Dickson_construction)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Tbf-d9sE4)\n\n**Instead: Factoradics**\n\nSo you know how normally, we write numbers in base 10, e.g. 1234?\n\nAnd then we can write them in hexadecimal and binary?\n\n1234 in hex is 0x4d2 and in binary it's 0b10011010010?\n\nWell, another representation of numbers is called factoradic and is based on factorials. The rightmost digit is always 0, and the number is written:\n\n    a_n * n! + a_{n-1} * (n-1)! + ... + a_1 * 1! + 0 * 0!\n\nwhere `0 ≤ a_i ≤ i` .\n\nThen 1234 in factoradic is:\n\n    1411200_!\n    = 1 * 6! + 4 * 5! + 1 * 4! + 1 * 3! + 2 * 2! + 0 * 1! + 0 * 0!\n    = 720 + 480 + 24 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0\n    = 1234 (as expected in base-10)\n\nHere's my factoradic encoder / decoder and the explanation. Note that I prefer to use functional programming constructs when possible: hence why there are no loops here (tail call optimized recursion is my looping: in Kotlin, when you use the keyword val, you cannot reassign to a variable): hence why you see the `aux` function in encode. I (distastefully) use a MutableList all the same to avoid unnecessary list copies.\n\nI can't seem to paste it here (too long?) so I made a link to it:\n\n[https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS](https://www.codebin.cc/code/cmllwos8a0001jp03ugeek04n:Baiu3weZiEvY5UJgeBhDwP3X9HThZJDag3BTmUgDsrtS)\n\nReleased under the 3-Clause BSD License, but not of much use to you unless you implement your own Factorial implementation (and there's a reasonable bit of machinery there as I represent a few dozen integer sequences and arrays).\n\nRight now I just finished polynomial rings / semirings and am working on quotient rings / semirings / fields so I can get the full gamut of finite fields for combinatorial constructions, elliptic curve cryptography (and other forms), coding theory, linear feedback shift registers, etc, as well as implementing geometric lattices nicely and naturally using rings like ℤ\\[x\\]/(x\\^2 + x + 1) for the Eisenstein integers instead of jumping through hoops to replace ω\\^2 = -ω - 1.\n\n(Not a beginner: I started programming when I was five and I'm 48 now and work in space astronomy. I have a BSc and MSc in comp sci and a PhD in math, but I have lots of holes in my math background, so this has been a great way to fill them in and learn more and program challenging, fun algorithms.)",

This will likely not work running it directly from Android, but a suggestion:\n\nIf you're genuinely worried about songs disappearing off of YouTube (and I would be - it's happened to me so many times), I would cache the songs locally to my machine: check to see if the song exists locally, in which case, play it, and if not, download it using yt-dlp (a fork of the - I believe now dead - youtube-dl, which runs in Python):\n\n[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)\n\nI have the following alias set up on my MacBook Pro (should work on any machine). Substitute your browser in.\n\n    alias yt='yt-dlp -f '\\''bv+ba'\\'' --cookies-from-browser chrome --no-check-certificate'\n\nThen if you want, say, video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w) (you don't), you just exec:\n\n    yt \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w\"\n\nand it should download locally. Save it as \"XqZsoesa55w\" and search for that locally and play it if you have it, and if you don't, download it. (That actually downloads the video and the audio: you can also modify the alias to just download the audio if that's all you want.)\n\nYou can also download entire playlists by putting in a playlist. (Quotes are probably necessary in that case, and optional in the case of single songs / videos.)\n\nYou don't need a YouTube subscription or anything like that, but I recommend you be logged in (so the cookies will work).\n\nI have had way too many videos that I loved throughout the years get yoinked either by their creators or by YouTube, and I no longer risk that happening. Every time I find something I like or something educational that I want to check out at some point, I download the entire thing locally.\n\nThe other option would be to just keep going the way you are, still cache songs locally, and keep a log of any files that are no longer accessible. Just copy those to your Android device and if a song doesn't show up on YouTube, check your \"saved files\" to get whatever has been deleted.\n\nJust a suggestion so you don't get burned like me and my \"significant other\" have multiple times over the years.",

        "body": "Generally, high vs low level, and interpreted vs compiled are 2 completely different aspects of a programming language. The definition of high and low level languages has shifted over the years as we have developed more and more languages. But strictly speaking, a high level language is any language that abstracts away any specific hardware details. This means that pretty much every programming language falls into the category of “high level”, with the exceptions of assembly and machine code “languages” (if you could call machine code a language). This means that even languages like C, are considered a high level language. This is because when you write C, you do not need to consider the specific characteristics of the hardware your code will be running on. As long as a compiler exists for a target system, your C code will run largely the same on any system (assuming whatever libraries you use are similarly supported). I would say that your professor is largely correct, using this historical definition of high and low level language. However I would add the asterisk that some projects, most notably Linux, have plenty of source code written by humans in assembly. In this case, the assembly is still source code, but is still a low level language since it is dependent on the hardware it will run on. (In large projects like Linux, this often looks like writing the same functionality multiple times in assembly for each target hardware system. So while C code largely only has to be written once, you may find multiple implementations of the same functionality in multiple assembly languages)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language\n\nHowever, this distinction has somewhat shifted over the years and people some times use more relative terms like “high*er*” and “low*er*” level programming languages. These refer to how close or far to the hardware your language is abstracted away. So this means that while C is technically a high level language, it is often perceived as “low*er*” level than something like python. You’ll even see some people say that C is generally a “low*er*” level language. However these distinctions are largely semantic and don’t have much real meaning, especially when you’re first learning. I would not get caught up on these.\n\nThe difference however between an interpreted and compiled language is completely different, and also in the modern day, much more complex. Generally speaking, an interpreter is any program that takes as an input some source code, and executes it without first compiling it to machine code. (Ripped from the first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))) A compiler is then any program that takes source code in one language as an input, and outputs code in another language. However, almost always, this looks like translating a higher level language, into a lower level language, typically from a strictly high level language, into a strictly low level language (like C -> assembly).\n\nSo the 2 concepts are somewhat related, but there is no exact relationship between them. Modern compilers and interpreters are much more complex and have many stages that translate source code through many different levels of abstraction. And, modern programming languages have started blurring the lines between what is seen as higher level and lower level.",

You might write a `mov` statement, but which specific instruction you get is dependent on it's parameters.\n\nHigh level languages target abstract machines and are portable. C++, for example, targets an abstract, byte addressable stack machine, two's compliment signed integers, little-endian, etc. So byte offset and bit manipulation on up - calling conventions, etc, all that is beyond the language, and must be defined by the implementation. So if your machine is word-addressable, the compiler has to translate byte addressing into words in some way.\n\nLanguages can affect architecture; C++03 is THE DEFINITION of the x64 Itanium ABI, and is standard for the hardware, which was designed around it. That doesn't some how lower the level of the language on that particular platform.\n\nSo it doesn't matter if the language is compiled or interpreted. You can build an interpreter around a virtual Turing Complete stack machine that runs an assembly. Or you can JIT compile an interpreted language like Java or C#, neither execution actually affects the high level nature of either language.",

If you haven't been dogfooding multiple flavors of unix or personally used Linux in a significant capacity then you will have a hard time. The people you see that are successful in this field now are former system administrators who have the ability to code. Core skills are Linux/Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)/networking/performance/CI + CD/security/IaC/k8s. It takes years to learn this stuff and then you have to maintain and expand your skills. DevOps was a large part of my first job and the first task I did when I joined was a cloud migration (myself with zero input in two weeks) but I had a decade of hobbyist experience by that point so it was fairly easy. With DevOps you do all this just to earn the privilege of being on call and getting woken up in the middle of the night.",

You need to start instantly and grow with your projects and your projects need to grow with you.\n\nYou have the false understanding that projects need to be big and complex. That's not how it works. You need to start small and simple and gradually ramp up scope, size, and complexity.\n\nAlso, tutorials do not \"teach\" you in a way that \"makes you ready\". Most tutorials just pre-chew everything for you and serve you. That's not how one learns.\n\nRemember learning math? You did exercise after exercise once you were presented with a topic - and that's exactly the way to learn programming - only that *you* should write your exercises. You need to play around with programming. You need to try things. You need to fail, to struggle, to fight, to fix and eventually succeed.\n\nYour problem is exactly that you fell into the classic \"tutorial hell\". You relied on being served and fed instead of learning to cook and eat on your own.\n\nStop using tutorials and start standing on your own feet. Yes, it won't be easy, but that's the only way to grow.\n\nI'll give you some more, similar posts:\n\n+ https://redd.it/1qdfc9k\n+ https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pmzjoe/how_do_you_learn_programming/nu4ufej/\n+ https://redd.it/1pmzjoe\n+ https://redd.it/1p7bv8a\n+ https://redd.it/1oynnlv\n+ https://redd.it/1ouvtzo\n+ https://redd.it/1opcu7j\n+ https://redd.it/1on6g8o\n+ https://redd.it/1ofe87j\n\nAnd finally, some book suggestions:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V.

        "body": "I'll list some things that might make you consider using message brokers, not in order of importance and not in a mumbo jumbo scientific way.\n\n1. A message broker is a separate, usually unchanging service\n\nThis means that redeploying your service has no effect on receiving data and storing event data.  \nYou could argue that writing events to a database is the same - and you'd be right, however we're not done yet!\n\n  \n2. Let's take a topic exchange as an example, you've created your topic exchange and have many routing keys for it. One of these routing keys is lets say for messages indicating that a payment has been completed.\n\nOne day, you'd like to send these payments to a fraud detection company (totally random example, I'm still having coffee), you could make the most barebones service that simply registers a new queue/binding to this exchange listening to the same routing key your main service already listens - and you'll receive a copy of all the payment events.\n\nThis plug and play style once your messaging system is set up is really comfortable and doesn't require extra work apart from occasionally adding a new field to your message.\n\n3. Manual acknowledgement + outbox/inbox patterns for your messages/events is intuitive and safe to work with  . Retries are handled with minimal work from your side with the correct configuration for your queue - connectivity issues and the like can be glossed over and you can define a threshold for dead letters where you'll actually have to think if messages reach there - but little connectivity issues or temporary outages don't really hurt you.\n\n  \n4. It's super easy to scale! Apart from being able to plug different consumers into the same routing key to get copies of messages to do different things with them you can also plug multiple (usually identical) instances of a consumer to a single queue so they can fairly share the work. It's really simply to dynamically scale this by adding or removing consumers to a queue that isn't doing the work fast enough.\n\n4.5-ish. Like you already mentioned and as it might be a bit obvious it really helps keep your system tidy(er) where each instance can just do its own thing and if you need something *else* you just make something fresh and connect it without bogging down your existing services with more responsibilities.\n\n  \nObviously it's not all sunshine and rainbows and you can easily make a sprawling mess of events flying all over the place and eventual consistency does have its own considerations.\n\n",

If the API actually also does stuff (goes to the kitchen and makes the stuff requested), it stops being interactive for that duration, which is its primary job. So the API delegates as much work as possible to keep being interactive, the work is done via queues and message brokers.\n\nIn short, any (real) work should not be done by the API, it should get done by something else. Message brokers are how that something else comes into play.",

Depending on your messaging setup, a service can just fire and forget to the message queue, cuz the delivery guarantees are provided by the queueing system.\n\n2) similarly it allows different apps to work at their own pace\n\n3) all your queues are in one place. Like imagine there are multiple instances of your application each with their own local in memory queue, a message might be sent to both and the work is duplicated or some consistency criteria might even break. You can have this sync without queues but if you need queues anyways, just using a service for queues that can observe all the events is massively helpful.\n\n4) the queue can scale independently \n\n5) observability, you have once central logical place where the queues report to even if internally they are all running in different physical/virtual systems. So you can then do 2nd level of adaptations based on the state of your queues. A queue suddenly having way too many events in it from normal might be signalling an issue somewhere else.",

For “metrics,” people often use it to avoid coupling request latency to logging/storage and to survive DB outages without dropping events.

OpenCV is a widespread standard image processing library. You can do C++ but I honestly would say the adapter to Python would probably be a bit more easier to handle because you can use Python for ML stuff as well if you want to, even if Python isn't exactly the fastest.\n\nOne of the problem you really need to figure out first is to determine the boundary of the problem. What do you mean when you say \"front\" and \"back\" of a robot?\n\nIf the competition has defined features of a robot, you can use that to determine what constitutes front and back. Using standard or advanced image processing algorithms are going to be an option in this case.\n\nA very straight-forward case would be if the competition requires every robot to show some sort of marker for the front facing side. You can use some variant of HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) or if its more complicated SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) to get a decently robust feature detection for the front-side and then deduct that the absence of that feature plus something else like rotational tracking will be the back-side.\n\nYou can also try the Generalized Hough Transform (although that one might be a bit too slow for pictures with too many pixels).\n\nAll 3 algorithms are implemented in OpenCV I think (although if not, you can certainly just build them yourself using the OpenCV toolkit).\n\nBut If robots can look arbitrary and you cannot say that there is some sort of fixed recognizable features, the detection is going to be tricky and OpenCV will not solve your problem. In the latter case, I would honestly consider resorting to machine learning. Retraining CNNs for classification can yield pretty decent results. You would need to have a decently sized training set of images of competition robots fronts and back. You would then do the pre-processing in OpenCV and then pass it on to the model or if you have something integrated like from Nvidia's developer suite, maybe use their stuff.\n\nThe problem with the ML approach is that you need a decently powerful compute platform on your robot. Even if the majority of computation happens at training phase, processing and then prediction still takes decent amount of compute power. Small embedded systems with a good GPU to handle matrix operations are necessary while not being power hungry monsters.\n\nYour other question is a bit vague: What do you mean \"friend or foe system\" for \"recognizing yourself\"?",

The simplest way to detect front and back is to add asymmetric markers to each robot, like a colored patch on one end or distinct shapes, so orientation can be inferred from the contour or marker positions. For friend or foe, you can give your robot a unique color pattern or fiducial marker and track that specifically, which avoids relying on pure shape detection.\n\nSince you are new to CV, I would start with basic color thresholding and contour detection in OpenCV before jumping into anything fancy. Real time performance in C++ should be fine if your frame size and processing pipeline stay reasonable. The biggest challenge will probably be lighting consistency and tuning thresholds, not the math itself.",

At some point you might specialize, but right now you just need experience using programming to solve any problem at all. \n2. Honestly C is an old language and not many working programmers today would choose it unless it was a very niche thing. The main reason is that C programs are relatively tricky for things like memory management and concurrency. C also doesn't have many features that modern languages have. That is actually why I mentioned Rust, which meant as a kind of modern C replacement. Rust is similar to C, but it has many cool features and still is very fast and runs \"close to the metal\" like C does.\n   * The general answer to the question of \"what is good to write in C (or Rust)?\" is: anything that has to run very fast and/or in limited environments like embedded systems (eg raspberry pi)\n   * a different answer could be a math-heavy problem. Something that uses a lot of data and does a lot of calculations on it very fast.\n3. Creating your own language is a great thing to try. I suggest trying it after you have learned a few different ones. After all, how will you know what kind of language you want to build if you have never experienced writing any language?\n4. I'm not sure I can answer the core of the creative block problem. I first got into programming because I wanted something to exist that didn't. I had a problem and the only way to solve my problem was to write a program to solve it. I'm not sure how you would come from the other direction, with a solution in search of a problem. I guess my advice to think about what you wish existed.\n5. Finally, I would not worry about \"knowing what you need to know.\" When I started with my problem I knew nothing at all. You will learn what you need to know as you go step by step through the problem you're trying to solve. At each step you will not know what to do, and you'll figure it out by searching, then you'll move on to the next step and repeat the process over and over until the problem is solved.",

Fast prototyping and scripting. But u can easily make a program in rust. And use that inside Python. Nice practical combo. \nBut these are just languages and it also depends what the market asks... U want to make money or really be a knowledge bomb and know how languages work inside.",

It’ll be a huge function.

It just points at it, thus, the sign can change to point at anything else that’s real. But the sign will never be the thing that it’s pointing at. \n\nIn C, pointers point at memory addresses. The memory houses the actual real data by (at the most basic level) cutting it into chunks where data is then housed(also called pages). \nYour pointer can point at the beginning of such chunk and then you can ask the pointer to move forward or backward through the memory to reveal the whole chunk.",

The pointer for the array stores the address of the very first element in the array - and here is where the \"0-based\" array indexing comes from. Since the elements are stored in a contiguous memory block and have a fixed size depending on the data type, it's easy to figure  out where the elements are: `base address + (index * size)`. You know the *base address* - the pointer, you know the *index* - the element you want to access, you know the *size*, which is determined by the data type. That's it.\n\nPointers are extremely useful, but more modern languages (or more modern implementations of languages) often *hide* them away from the user so that they don't have to deal with them. In C++, you have *smart pointers*, you have *references*, which are just extensions to pointers.",

With the new year, people are really dissecting annual reports of publicly traded companies, and after ~5 years of this bubble, no major player has reported a positive ROI on AI software integration. Not one.\n\nWe're seeing ~$22 billion in technical debt created by AI, because the slop they generated can't be understood by people. This is important, because the industry is finally really coming around to understand - you can't hold AI accountable.\n\nIf a corporation loses shareholder value, causes damages, or kills people, C-levels and employees can be held personally accountable. There was a time I was responsible for 60% of all option trading on Earth, can you just imagine the concrete shoes I'd be wearing at the bottom of some lake right now if I allowed AI to speak on my behalf? Where did all the money go? I dunno, Boss; I asked the AI and they don't know, either. How does this work? I dunno, Boss, the AI made it, and every time I ask, it remakes it in a different way...\n\nWe're also seeing the employment pendulum swing the other way. That technical debt we've accrued so far is going to take a decade to un-fuck, and we're still going with it, so there will be work for the rest of MY career...\n\nAnd things lag, so there's still a feeling of uncertainty that everyone is acting on, and employers are taking advantage of that while they can by offering low wages since it's still a saturated, employer's market. As the employee market dries up, those salaries are going to pick back up. That things are actively changing isn't a secret, if you know where to look and who to ask.\n\n> Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?\n\nI'm not quite sure how to interpret this one, yet. Businesses thought they'd replace junior level work with AI, but that means entry level positions would be essentially senior architect roles, basically what you're suggesting - and how can you do that without the experience?\n\nSo AI has caused some damage, and there will be a gap in employee demographics as we took a whack at 5 years of college grads who didn't find their footing in the middle of this bungling market experiment. They'll all be off into other markets, or set back from missing 5 years critical experience. If you've invested 5 years into something else while this market figures its shit out, you're probably better off sticking to that, rather than finally kick-starting a late career.\n\n> I see that companies are mostly hiring senior engineers these days, but if there aren't enough junior engineers, who will they hire are seniors in the future? ( sorry if this sounds silly ) \n\nThat's a very real question, and the answer is they're going to pay out the ear for the mistake, in the long run.\n\nCompanies are hiring seniors for two reasons:\n\n1) Trump. He's a bad actor, a Russian asset; he has grifted and pilfered this government and economy, intentionally destroyed it in ways that cannot be explained by economics or incompetence alone, and he's such a wildcard, that everyone is just buckling down and hoping to survive this administration, until we can get back to \"business as usual\". And to conservatives and authoritarians of the regime who disagree - you're evil.\n\n2) Corporate interest rates went up from 0% 3 years ago, and then the massive layoffs started happening. It wasn't due to AI. Zero interest corporate loans are federal subsidies to grow the economy. You fork off a subsidiary of your conglomerate, spend the money, develop the tech, and when the money runs out, you fold the subsidiary tied to the loan - taking the debt with it. But the parent company keeps all the IP. This scheme is over for FAANG, but not for smaller corporations - so expect some underdog success stories.\n\n> how will software work envolve in the future?\n\nAI won't go anywhere. But like outsourcing to a Sally Struthers country for pennies on the dollar, you don't outsource anything actually important. It has to be able to fail to deliver, or do what it's supposed to, and that has to be OK. It can be an aid, if it can generate simple code that is faster to verify than it is to write. It'll be useful for refactoring, permuting, generating (but not implementing) protocols, other things.\n\n> What should we learn to day to avoid getting stuck in the future?\n\nStick to the fundamentals. Get good at math. The one thing AI can never do is think, and that's on you to learn.",

It also looks like they are running into scaling issues aand quickly approaching the upper limit of what LLMs are realistically capable of, without having any new developments (meaning new architectures) up their sleeves. My prediction would be that most of us will use LLMs for coding in 5 years, but not for vibe coding. Stuff like autocomplete and boilerplate. \n\n>Or will AI simply raise the entry-level requirement for junior engineers?\n\nThis is actually a real issue, because junior devs have a harder time getting used to codebases and companies now that their normal tasks have been partially automated, and they are expected to start immediately with more advanced tasks. \n\n>how will software work envolve in the future?

The skills are not really different, using an LLM as a small help in coding is not really a skill you need to learn. You need to know how software works, how to write and evaluate it etc. just as we did back before LLMs were big.

Arduino Starter Kits (including the actual Arduino system) are in the range of $50 to $100 and you get lots of hardware (sensors, LEDs, motors, etc.) to play around with.\n\nMaybe, ask also in guitar or synthesizer related subreddits, or in the embedded ones, like /r/esp32, /r/arduino, /r/esp8266, /r/nodeMCU, and so on. /r/vsti and /r/synthesizers with their related subreddits could also be viable resources.\n\nAlso, my general advice would be to focus on *learning programming* first, and there, since you will need C++ use https://learncpp.com\n\nWe normally don't suggest C++ as first language as it is a difficult language to get into. Normally, we recommend Python (with the MOOC [Python Programming 2026](https://programming-26.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki), but that would not get you in the direction you want. You'll most likely have to bite the bullet and go in the hard way.\n\nWhat you will also need are really solid mathematical foundations of higher concepts. You'll need to go into waveforms, maybe FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation), maybe DFT (Discrete Fourier Transformation), and a lot more. Synthesis and Signal Processing use higher mathematical concepts. You'll need to work with sampling intervals, ADC (Analog to Digital Converters), and DAC (Digital to Analog Converters) and much more. You'll also need to have some musical understanding about the frequencies, etc.",

For pedals/synth hardware most people start with something approachable like Arduino or Teensy boards because they let you write C/C++ and interact with real components without drowning in low-level complexity, and from there you gradually understand how microcontrollers talk to knobs, switches, audio signals, etc. It really just comes down to writing code that reads inputs and controls outputs, and the toolchains make that less scary than it sounds. Honestly the best move right now is hands-on experimentation — build a tiny audio or control project, not your dream device — because that’s where the mental model forms. Since you’ve got a roommate doing EE, that pairing is actually ideal. Are you more excited about audio DSP/plugin design or physical instrument building long term?",

C++ is a solid language to focus on because it’s used both in JUCE and many microcontroller environments, so you won’t be splitting your effort too much. It might help to first get comfortable writing small programs that read inputs and control simple outputs before jumping into audio-specific processing. Building tiny projects like a MIDI controller or simple effect unit can clarify how code and hardware interact. I’ve been experimenting with structured beginner practice paths for people starting from zero in technical projects like this, and I can share if useful.",

I already have a pretty solid basis in understanding sound and music on a physical level and in audio form as well, since my major is in Creative Music Technology and I've got some excellent lecturers that help me understand a lot of the electronic components and processes that make up sound and audio.\n\nYou're right though, I shouldn't get too ahead of myself and I'll definitely focus on setting up a solid foundation in C++ first and foremost before trying to interface with hardware. It'll be a couple of years before my bandmate is skilled enough to make anything that requires my input anyway, so I'll just focus on that for as long as I can. Again, thank you very much for the advice, and I hope you have a good rest of your day!",

If you're self-hosting, the bare branch on the server has a pre-receive hook that can be used to reject someone trying to push their main to server's main.",

All AprilTag solutions I've seen are real sensitive to partial tags (i.e. the moment any bit of the tag is out of frame, they can't give you pose data anymore, and your camera has to be pretty decently high-speed to not get so much blur on a swinging sword that the tag isn't solvable).",

Javascript is the language that runs in your browser, and it is not even remotely the same thing as Java. \n\nSecond, leave multi-player off the table entirely for the time being. That's a long term goal, don't even think about it yet. \n\nSo choose a platform: web or desktop? You can do desktop apps with Java easily enough. If you're going web, Java isn't going to enter the picture unless you're designing something with a front end communicating with a back end, which, again, is probably too ambitious as a starting point. So choose a platform for your UI and figure out how to mock something up that looks vaguely like what you want the game to look like. It doesn't need to be pretty, you can always revisit and iterate as you learn. So your ui might just be a playing field and a row of cards at the bottom to start. \n\nThen define your game rules -- simple rules are fine for starters. \"Cards have a cost assigned to them and a player can only play cards they have the necessary resources to play\" for example. So implement the logic necessary to check player resources, subtract spent resources, generate new resources, whatever.",

I'd even go as far as to say that programming competitions often value things that corporations detest.  That said, excellence in one area of programming often hints the ability to be excellent in other areas.\n\nMany of the programs in competitions (which is where leetcode gets most of its examples) are small, easy to implement, but challenging enough they are not trivial.  However they rarely deal with most of the issues that companies use in programming.  Additionally, they favor large computational efforts using arrays, which is rare in business.\n\nConsider it practice, and the companies that hire based on leetcode scores generally don't get better corporate programmers.  It's like painting landscapes all day, and then hiring on to a company that paints architecture.    ",

A single source of IDs service can generally be easily designed and operated to internet scale these days and everything can descend from there. I do hold a lot of fondness for natural key based segmentation though. Requires an awful lot of prescience about your data though.",

There are many approaches, but generally the simplest is:\n\n* All the servers vote to decide which one gets all the writes.\n* The writing server tells all the other servers to prepare for the change, with all the change's data (including itself).\n* After knowing all the servers can now make the change, the writing server knows the change is doable.  Then it sends the signal to make the change.\n\nThis is the simplest way to do something, and it doesn't have a lot of protections that come with more sophisticated means.  Basically, to fix many of the issues in the basic approach above, you start implementing more sophisticated algorithms.  Or, you offload your storage of such things to a cluster of systems that already implement these algorithms (Apache Zookeeper, etcd, etc.)",

Examining someone on whether they can solve a leetcode style question tells you nothing about a candidate's ability to write and ship software. I have met people who work at FAANG that have been able to get there purely by memorizing leetcode questions but not all of them are actually good engineers and a good amount of them have never shipped anything.\n\nThe people who are using these cheating tools are just shining the light on the bigger problem here which is that our interviews are fundamentally broken and should be redesigned to actually examine someone's engineering skills and foundations. If I am hiring an engineer to work on web apps, I would want them to know skills related to that not whether they can invert a binary search tree.\n\nI expect this trend of cheating to continue growing until companies begin to realize how stupid the current interview structure is",

I wasn’t able to land a job in big tech at the time, so I settled for the first offer I received, which was at a major defense/aerospace company. By the time I was able to get out of that hellhole, Covid happened… luckily, I was able to land a job at a small company that was much better, but it was still a far cry from the typical perks enjoyed by those in big tech (the only perks were some free snacks and Keurig coffee; it was otherwise a fully on-site role in the middle of Covid). \n\nSince then, the tech job market has become harder and harder to get into/find new roles, as the bar for interviews keeps getting higher and higher. I’m just so mad that I missed out on what seemed like the golden age of working in tech… my career has been nothing like what I had envisioned when I chose this major for college back in the early 2010’s…",

I've used it to great effect at debugging. I would paste in some logs from one service and that elevated qps of errors started showing up around this time and it would go digging (monorepo, so all dependencies are in the same codebase) and walk the the graph and find some subtle change in some shared library in some other part of the codebase our team doesn't own that's used by a dependency of our team's service.\n\nDistributed systems are hard. Debugging distributed systems is hard. Agents make that just slightly easier. Not in all cases. But in a lot of cases they can save time.\n\nIn the hands of a good engineer, they're a force multiplier.\n\n> When pressed on the issue, our CTO admitted that on average, pre things like Claude, our engineers only spent about 1 hour per day on actually writing code. The rest was spent in meetings, writing RFCs, designing, etc. To me, this says that coding was never the actual issue.\n\nThe thing is, even a staff engineer is still writing code. Yes, they might be spending a lot of time writing and review designs and directing high level roadmaps and in a lot of meetings and influencing at the strategic level, potentially cross org, cross-product, but coding is still a crucial aspect of their role.\n\nI used to be a skeptic, but agentic AI can seriously help with the coding aspect of one's job.",

And here's the truth: people don't have even have the slightest clue of what they're talking about.\n\nOriginally I studied Finance and Accounting. My first job was at a Big 4 public accounting firm in 2016, they demoed an AI agent that could do our job to show they were \"cutting edge.\" Did we use it? No. We used excel workbooks that have been around longer than your grandma's fridge. Did we leverage Python, VBA, and so on to work better and faster like I knew how to do? No. Some of these people could barely move around a single sheet in Excel.\n\nThen I worked at a F500 company. In addition to regular accounting and finance work, tried as much as possible to automate. I tried to do things better, faster, more efficiently. I wrote \"shadow apps\" (not managed by the dev teams) for other financial analysts and accountants as the massive dev teams we had didn't have \"capacity\".  Eventually I hit a wall and essentially there was so much I wanted to incorporate and change but was denied the tools needed to deploy and maintain them. Basically \"sorry you're not an SWE so we can't give you access.\" So I left and now I'm building financial systems and doing meaningful work as a SWE and getting my masters in CS. And making more than I did before and happier.\n\nHere's my takeaway: you will be stunned to see how SLOW companies adopt tech outside of big tech companies. Even if you TRY you'll hit resistance.\n\nIf you have a desire to build a solution, you will have a job. If people on this sub or the vibe coding subs think an accountant at a F500 company will use Claude Code to vibe up a solution, I'm sorry but it will not happen about 90% of the time. If they didn't write basic Python scripts before, they are not vibe coding now. Anyone that believes that will happen are either delusional or have never actually worked outside of tech roles.\n\nAnd a final note: I could have automated 80% of my work as an accountant and financial analyst pre-AI. The only people to look at that career path as bulletproof are tech people who never worked in that field or tried to get a job in it.",

If a company wants to be somewhere, they'll lease property.  If a company doesn't want or need to be somewhere, they'll let leases expire.  And then everything else falls into line with the leases.\n\n10 years ago, every smart CFO advocated very long leases to reduce lease rates.  Now that companies have been shown that they don't need people onsite, every smart CFO is recommending that the company only renew very essential leases and let the rest expire.  This is a corporate finance tectonic shift on par with switching to defined-contribution retirement plans (late '90's) and switching to unlimited PTO (late '00's).\n\nIf you like working there, make yourself as valuable as you can.  It still might not make the difference, but it usually does.  If your boss can say about you to their boss \"I can't succeed without this person\", then you are usually safe.  That's your goal...if you want to stay there.\n\nAnd in a few years when your company's leases expire, then leadership will say that they've discovered or realized that WFH is a vital part of work life balance or whatever stupid way they have of justifying what is ultimately a financial, lease-centric decision.",

The people you surround yourself with shape your mindset more than you realize. If you are constantly around people who complain all the time, who keep saying that you can only get a job through connections, or that the first million has to be stolen, that kind of thinking will slowly limit you. It becomes normal in your head. It kills ambition.",

I had to make ends meet and worked at a local Speedway gas station for 5-6 months after 5 month post graduation realizing that my first job was not coming anytime soon. Eventually after close to 600 applications some 11-12 months after graduation I got my first offer! I too had that realization that “I was not going to give up till I had that offer”. I think after I made that decision I was applying to upwards of 10-15 jobs a day. \n\nI wish you all the luck, try to make sure your employer extends an offer to you!",

They do not position off-shore resources in such a way that makes them plug-and-play for any arbitrary development team.\n\nYour argument more or less rests on the notion that productivity and labor costs are the only considerations when developing a successful product — rest assured theres a lot more to it.\n\nBut sure, if all you bring to a development team is the ability to take tickets, and work for cheap, you may need to re-evaluate exactly what you’re bringing to the table labor-wise in the long term. Advice on how specifically you can/should upskill requires more context than fits in a Reddit post. Pick any arbitrary pile of podcasts or blogs related to product development, and when you read something which relates to a skill you haven’t mastered, learn that thing. Pay attention to what’s happening in your organization, and make sure your skillset is well aligned with the “big rocks” coming up.\n\nFrankly, not every software product demands “FAANG-level” engineers to be successful. But pretend you’re a company trying to be competitive in a market. The hypothetical skill-curve of labor isn’t flat among your competition. If literally every competitor sourced from the same off-shoring agencies, and all of those agencies were equally skilled at product development, what a fantastic opportunity for you to disrupt that market by having significantly higher performing teams right?",

I won’t speak to if phD holders are better or worse than staff engineers cus I only have anecdotal evidence but the staff engineers I work with are just incredible.\n\nI went on a business trip with this E6 who was very quiet. I knew they were a 6 but didn’t quite understand why, as I had never worked directly with them and they always just seemed to listen and didnt really speak. I figured they were just coding machines. As soon as we got a client in front of us it was immediately clear why they were a 6. The questions and follow up questions they were asking on a whim would take me an entire day to come up with and yet the questions seemed so obvious and simple. Then they were able to consolidate all of the information into learnings and built out an entire roadmap. \n\nIt felt like they were capable of thinking in a way I will never be able to.\n\nWe hired an external E6 last year as my teams tech lead. Within 3 months he had more context on every single engineers work than the engineers themselves.

A post grad researcher specialises in applying theory to the extent they may write new papers, it’s essentially a continuous studying journey after their PhD to move industry knowledge forward. \n\nWhereas being a staff engineer is going deep into the practical application, deep enough that you’re not writing papers to influence your industry or to propel your PhD knowledge. \n\nUltimately no one person can do it all, they are distinct roles for a reason. They specialise in different aspects. And there’s nothing ruling out someone from switching between should they want to change roles. I thought this was common sense tbh.",

On top of that, the field is shrinking.  Software jobs aren't going away, but as efficiencies improve and people continue to upskill their credentials and experience, people will be squeezed out of the job market.\n\nWhy would anybody in 2026 choose a new bootcamp graduate over them?

Working for some mega corp where you feel like a cog in a wheel is also a good recipe for burnout.\n\nMost people want to find meaning in their work and if they can, I think that mitigates burnout.\n\nI find that most developers are happy when they are doing their own thing or he/she is working for some company that genuinely helps people (I.e. a non profit).",

In this job market, you have to apply across the entire country and be willing to relocate anywhere. This is what people use to do several generations ago btw, move to random no-name towns for cheap housing and opportunity because life in the big cities was too competitive and expensive. Eventually, these towns became the powerhouses you see today. \n\n\nMilitary is also a terrific option. I came from the military. Joining the military was the single best decision I ever made in my life, getting out was the second best. I got out with $50k to my name at 23 and more character development than college could have ever provided for me. \n\nA lot of hiring managers are also former military and they will almost always prefer other vets that apply, for good reason too.",

Offshoring jobs to \"cheaper\" places means that those places  become less cheap over time because increasing demand for actual skilled talent which is generally not too high in supply causes salaries abroad to increase and the cost of living to likewise increase from the capital being sent there. It's the reason why tech salaries in a lot of offshore locations like Eastern Europe and Latin America have jumped dramatically in recent years. Not only that, but there's nothing really to suggest that \"expensive\" countries couldn't just lower salaries domestically. This is honestly something that everyone on these subs seem to miss and I don't know why. It may be argued that nobody in such countries would be willing to work for a fair amount less if it came to that, but if push comes to shove, I think it is reasonable to assume that there would be a lot of people willing to do so because otherwise it might mean not having a job. Also:\n\n\\> Over time, those countries will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.\n\nYeah, no that's very likely not going to happen.

On the surface that means 75% of devs get laid off. But in reality, this ignores the factor of human ambition and greed. The ultimate goal of a company isn't to punch off its current TODO list. It's to maximize profits. So at least some of those 75% should end up building new features and launching new products to generate more profits through efforts that wouldn't have been justifiable at the previous cost of development.\n\nAnd some of them will go off and start their own companies doing things with a person or two that previously would have taken a team, startup capital, etc.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI think the same thing applies to the idea of people sitting idle overall. If you look at all of the laid off people coldly as a resource pool sitting idle waiting to be exploited to generate profits, it starts to look as silly to not find a way to put them to work as it would be to not tap into an oil well sitting idle in your backyard. Not because you're trying to do a good deed by giving them a job, but because you're trying to make more money. Which is really the only reason anyone has a job today.\n\nThe truly difficult part could be the relative pace of all of this - if millions of people get laid off at an unprecedented rate, it will take time to figure out how to leverage this new human resource - what happens in that time? But in the long run, I suspect that the ultimate answer to how we keep ourselves busy in the face of these new tools will be the same answer that has accompanied every productivity increasing technological development in human history: we'll just do more. That drive is pretty central to what it means to be human, IMO.",

Just hire less people and cut down on time to train them as that’s lost revenue, and also lay off employees who are not absolutely essential or senior level people because they obviously just do nothing right?

I think another aspect of this is that the building of systems/services/projects gives you more things to connect mentally when going through books on \"advanced topics\". For example, after building a bunch of projects, and then going through another system design book you can make mental connections to what you've already made and think up use cases and improvements with the things they are talking about. If you just read books / take courses from the start and aren't building, nothing will stick as easily.",

It will take a lot to overcome so much global change. \n\nI enjoy programming and solving complex logic problems so that's the reason I am in the field still. At work we are encouraged to use AI more so I do it because it's being tracked. So less manual workflow and more of an agentic or llm type of workflow at the moment. \n\nBut overall just to say that even if I had the free time I still enjoy the craft and learning opportunities it provides. That is to say try and find a job that is at least tolerable and ride the wave. Try to keep the skills sharp in case the layoff hammer comes around. That's been my philosophy for the past several years been through a couple recessions so always be ready to shift if needed.",

Sure there’s technically less coverage until it gets fixed, but the impact on development when flaky tests block unrelated work is often worse than the benefit of that particular test.

Microservices, monorepos, etc - all handled extremely well. My teams are building internal skills and tools that have made our workflows even better. I've been able to knock out many of our highest-reported bugs on a legacy product that I would not have had the time to handle myself if it wasn't for these models being so good. \n\nUse plan mode. Give it guidelines for style and structure via an AGENTS.md or claude.md file. Outline a thorough plan for it yourself if you want. Tag in the files it should pay specific attention to, especially if you know the data flow or generally where the problems exist already. \n\nWe even have several internal frameworks/libraries, and the AI has been able to use those perfectly fine due to how much usage examples there are in our codebases (or if it's not sure, it just goes into the npm modules or vendor files and checks things out itself). \n\nThis sub and other SWE-related subs love to dog on AI and claim it's not useful or not good.

Something in your application materials is triggering an automatic rejection before human eyes ever see them. The fact that your network connections got you interviews proves you can perform when given the chance, so the barrier is purely at the screening stage.\n\nSix resume rewrites might actually be hurting you if each version strays further from ATS optimization. Consider this: get your most recent version reviewed by someone currently hiring in tech, not just resume writers. They’ll spot what’s causing the auto-rejections. Also, gaps on your resume or the layoff itself might need different framing. Some companies filter out anyone currently unemployed, which is brutal but real\n\nYour tech stack isn’t the problem since those skills are still in demand. More likely it’s resume formatting breaking ATS parsers, missing keywords that match job descriptions exactly, or your experience level falling into an awkward middle zone where you’re overqualified for junior roles but competing with seniors.\n\nStop applying to undervalued positions immediately. That signals desperation and companies assume you’ll leave when something better appears. Focus on contract or freelance work to fill the gap while maintaining your search. Breaking the unemployment streak often unlocks opportunities faster than anything else.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

        "body": "I have worked at 3 jobs in my career. Mid-sized DoD company as my first, second was not FAANG but it's one that i personally would say is at the same level as FAANG (or mag7) and the third and current is big tech. I wouldnt consider it the same tier as FAANG but i would say it's a tier just under FAANG. \n\nTo answer the question, i tdepends. I've never worked startup but i've heard startups have similar culture. But what i will say on each company i feel like it's general for each type of company.\n\nDoD- at DoD, this was super chill. The work felt meaningful but the work was also super chill. Like i could sit on a task for a month, work 8 hour days where half the day i twiddled my thumbs and still get good reviews at the end of 6 months. I remember getting to my project and it was a year away from being \"complete\" and it took us 3 years to complete it and nobody was mad or batted an eye. It was a poorly run project because everybody just wanted to do 8 hours and go home. Nobody was really trying to go all out for them. The pay wasnt the best but it was good. I would recommend DoD to anybody who likes CS but doesnt love it to want to learn new systems, new code, etc. Just wants to get their day done and go home and not htink about work. But it'sv ery easy to get behind the times and not move ahead in your career. You will get promoted pretty quickly but wont learn much really. Nobody even sends an email after 5 pm.\n\nFAANG level - when i left DoD i wanted more pay and to learn more. It was a huge culture shock. I went to cloud services. The company i worked for was known for having work life balance but I didnt ralize cloud is where that dies. It was super competitive. A SWE2, did twice as much work as a senior at DoD did. I made good money but god it sucked. Seniors and up were so booked they had no time to help juniors. Reviews were not based on what was expected it was based on how you compared ot your coworkers. I literally got in my review, \"his coworkers do more than him\" becaus ei didnt work 60 hour weeks like osme of them. That wasnt the reason but whne most are doing 60 and you are doing 40 it shows in the work. I got laid off and honestly didnt even miss it. If you werent sending emails or getting at calls at like 8pm you were behind. It felt like you always had to be available. \n\nBig tech - i got a job in big tech and was making more than i was at FAANG. Honestly it's been great because the work is meanigful, i work for a cloud service that's big but not as big as the faang one. But because it's not as big, nobody feels overworked. For the first ime iin years i had people say \"dude it's 6pm go home\". It's a good level of feeling like youa re doing meaningful work and not feeling like you have to work 60 hours to keep up. \n\n  \nSo i will say, even if the work isnt as meaningful or worldwide as FAANG, you can definetely work at places and do meaningful work. Every company to some degree is meaningful, just some more than others. ",

It just honestly makes me feel so demoralized about my future and it makes me sad to see an industry that’s revolutionized so much of our day to day lives basically cannibalize itself with AI.\n\nAI is not the reason that you have gotten zero interviews over two years, with thousands of applications. At that rate, someone should have interviewed you either by accident, or as courtesy for whoever was referring you.\n\n>We just can’t compete with robots who don’t need to get paid and don’t need breaks/rights.\n\nIf you cannot out-compete a free tier-ai, that is a you-problem. If, with 5 yoe you cannot out-compete any ai, that, too, is a you-problem.  \n  \nI'm not being snarky - you are doing something very, very wrong. It might be an easy fix.

A lot of people believe LLMs are the silver bullet from that and can eventually replace human support agents. However banks also have to deal with a lot of regulation and tend to have a mountain of internal controls which hamstring their AI efforts. There's still a lot of ML being done at a bank in other areas including credit scoring, risk modeling, and fraud or anomaly detection; but it's not groundbreaking stuff and honestly it's kind of a solved problem at this point so you don't hear much about it.\n\nMy personal take is if you want to actually do ML engineering you should aim higher than ML at a bank.",

Because of this belief, along with the price of LLMs (for now) everyone is just implementing the existing offering because it is seen as a \"no-brainer\".\n\nIt is my belief that this will not continue.\n\nFirstly, the prices of LLMs will go up, how much by? No-one outside of those companies know definitively.\n\nSecondly, LLMs are shit and need constant monitoring and verification, which most people don't do and even fewer do well. This will cause (and probably already is causing) quite a lot of very avoidable pitfalls and designs.\n\nThirdly, LLMs discourage you from thinking, just about anything. There has not been a single study that has proven the opposite, only this point.\n\nSo I guess to answer your question, everyone is lying about ML at the moment because LLMs are a cash cow the likes of which hasn't been seen for quite a while; far wider reaching than crypto or similar fads.\n\nThings will change though one way or another.\n\nAlso, any of you cock wombles who want to tell me I'm wrong, I will be ignoring you unless you can back up your claims with data.\n\nEdit: changed AI to LLMs",

If the C level manager wants us to, then he needs to say so and own the scheduling repercussions.\n\nI think the C level guy doesn't like me for some reason, and that's fine. The last time he visited he told my boss that I seemed unhappy.\n\nEdit:\nI'm playing a dangerous game of \"chicken\" with my boss's boss. Because of the storm I caused, the platform team sent out a company wide email with the C level boss on it clarifying timelines, and I responded to the email with a \"Reply to all\" thanking the platform team and acknowledging that if teams adopt the new platform now that their delivery dates may get delayed. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get called into my manager's office over it but can't stand that the C level exec wants to play both sides of the fence.

So if you ask on experienced devs, you'll probably get a lot of people who are saying language doesn't matter and what not, but the good ones will say the opportunity is only good if you are willing to make the leap to learn the other language.\n\nJava is one of those languages that can feel \"old fashioned\" by todays standards because of the fact so many other languages figured out shortcuts or answers to common problems that still exist in java.  So my conclusion has been it always is universally painful when anyone is trying to traverse going from something like dotnet or python to a java system.  I'm living that pain right now and I'm primarily a dotnet dev that got hired into a java shop that needed a dotnet dev for a side project.  \n\nAnd you are right Java Spring is full on magic box because people have built answers to so many problems.  It's less programming and more like fitting together pieces of a puzzle, which is why I kind of dislike it.  However, it got that way because raw java is the literal boards and nails of high end compiled languages because it was open source and the first one.  Had this experience when going between android, iOS, and windows.  It was like the windows stuff was somehow between two extremes in approach.",

The next day there were interviews in the morning.  Early afternoon they met with people one on one and gave some of us a job offer, put some people on a maybe list, and gave others no offer.

It’s common to see a PHD or masters as a prerequisite on job listings, let alone just a relevant bachelors.

With my employer at least, there are concerns with the wildcard nature of bootcamp/self taught hires, whereby graduates are seen as more consistently good/less risky. So the degree requirement is part of a generalised move to standardise data science and put a level of assurance to baseline expectations of skills. \n\nIn addition, AI has obviously changed the hiring field and a big concern of employers is hiring someone shit that is propped up by AI. They may assume there is more risk of that with a bootcamp hire vs someone with strong degrees.",

Try to get any tech job during your break between school.\n\n\nSomething you can try is look for full time jobs in your area.  When you see the posting, try to contact through the careers area of the website, email, or if you have to, through the application itself.\n\n\nHowever you are able to try to contact someone, let them know you are an older student who will be graduating in two years, you are checking out different careers, this one caught your eye, and you are wondering what the career is like, what courses might help, and any advice anyone who will talk to you has.\n\n\nAsk for a phone call, email, or buy them a cup of coffee or lunch.  Get the advice and just listen, don't \"but what about, or I heard, or people say\", just listen and ask actually meaningful questions.   Right after, and I mean right after, write everything down, whatever you can remember.\n\n\nThis is both local advice, networking, and a sort of introduction to an interview.\n\n\nKeep doing this as you can.  Keep your eye out for and ask about any local events where IT people meet to talk IT stuff, if you can, try to attend.  The goal is to be seen.\n\n\nGetting the degree and being a good fit for the company and the team are what is important.  Regardless of what you take, you are not going to really know what you are doing for the first five years, so when people give you free advice, listen.\n\n\nIdeally, you will graduate having had a few tech summer jobs, and have networked with several people.  When you are close to graduating, reach out to any of them that gave you their contact info and ask them if they know if any job opportunities.  Do this slowly, not all at once, you don't want to burn any bridges.\n\n\nGood luck",

I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.\n\nOMSCS is not going to move the needle in terms of recruiting, most recruiters are aware of the program and its 90% acceptance rate after they've seen thousands of applications of people blasting through Georgia Tech MSCS (online omitted of course). Everytime I say this I get someone pointing out the rigor, which I don't find to be a working argument because any decent engineering program is going to be fairly rigorous in its own right. \n\nWhat recruiters actually care about is name brand and the selectivity signal that comes with prestige. Example in point: a majority of interns are completely useless and are a complete net loss for the company. Having a nice internship from a good big tech is still going to move the needle very favorably resume-wise because of the bar of what it took to be accepted, and the signal to recruiters that you were able to get in a prestigious company, even if you didn't really do anything productive.\n\n>I've heard several people say they completely blacklist WGU grads so that's why I'm concerned with just having it on my resume.\n\nNo one is specifically blacklisting WGU, this seems very unlikely. The simpler and more likely reason at hand is that your resume is probably not competitive enough for the current landscape. Adding OMSCS to your resume is not going to change that either.\n\nThe reality is that it's going to be very difficult for average CS grads to find work within this environment and landscape. The easier times when many people could reasonably make their way into a decent SWE job have passed, and is most likely not going to come back. SWE payroll has always been one of the biggest costs that companies look to reduce within their financials, and rampant outsourcing and AI have done a lot to cut down on available jobs. ",

It isn’t even a meaningful productivity booster because the things I spend most of my time on are human problems, not technological ones. Its benefits are, therefore, marginal at best. \n\nAlso, without such significant supervision that it’s easier to write from scratch, AI screws up. Right now, I’ve hit a wall with it in a personal project because it can’t actually do anything in a live environment. It can tell me its unit tests pass, but those unit tests are *worthless* because the application simply *does not do anything it should* in a live environment. But the AI will ignore me when I say the tests are irrelevant.",

How long has basic literacy and arithmetic been a requirement, yet the average person still reads between a 6th and 8th grade education and many college students continue to need remedial math.\n\nPeople might be doing more.

Managent sometimes doesn't care and will push things onto you to see how much they can squeeze out of you until you break. Then they'll blame you.\n\n\nYou could try pushing back. But that has its risks especially if your team or management is mainly composed of folks from india. No hate towards them, but they have a different work culture. \n\nPersonally I'm looking around and seeing if I can get lucky working at another company while scraping by and not getting on anyone's bad side.

I know so many kids I graduated with who couldnt find a first SWE job so they picked up help desk jobs. They all just moved into different kinds of IT. One guy transitioned into iphone repair and a few got QA roles. The most successful guy I can think of became a \"cloud engineer\" or something like that, boasts about his engineering title, but once I saw he posted on his IG story a terminal just spamming logs, and he captioned it, \"doing some coding today\"... our mutual friend told me that he is basically just still doing IT and hates his job.  \n\nBut if you ask any of them, none of them afaik, actively continued to try to get a SWE job or tried to continue coding.

First was Graduate Algorithms. It used to be homework plus exams, but they switched it to basically exam-only for grading. From what I heard, that change happened after one semester where the professor/TAs flagged a bunch of students to the Office of Student Integrity, and most of them ended up winning their cases. After that, they moved to exams only.\n\nSecond was AI course. They rolled out a VS Code based IDE called NOSI that tracks all of your activity. And in that class, you’re not allowed to use AI at all, or even the internet. You’re expected to rely strictly on the textbook, lectures, and write your code in that IDE. It also got two take-home exams that are like 50 pages each, and you get a week for each one, also no internet allowed.\n\nThird was Machine Learning. This one is the complete opposite, you can use as much AI as you want, even to generate all of your code. But the class is so hard that even with AI, it still took me like 20–30 hours a week (so they basically made the course almost impossible to get through without using AI). On top of that there’s also an Honorlock-proctored exam.\n\nSo yeah, just from these 3 classes alone, it’s basically three totally different approaches to dealing with AI tools.",

It was professor dependent too, i knew people who got caught for 1 assignment and failed the whole calss. SO i was terrified to even google anything. \n\nIm not sure how it is today, but imagine that tool has updated for AI as well.

I disagree with comments saying going back to school for CS can't hurt, because it absolutely can hurt to study while working full time: your bank account, your relationships, your health. I had a lot of difficult life events happen almost as soon as I started the OSU program that made the whole experience really painful. Don't take the decision lightly",

The imposter syndrome is real, but tbh I think you're overthinking this.\n\nHere's the thing about those foundational gaps you mentioned. Yeah, they're important for certain roles, but for the path you're describing (backend dev, cloud infrastructure, applied ML), you can absolutely fill those gaps without going back to school. I've been learning this stuff in real time while building, and honestly some of the best engineers I know are self-taught or have non-CS degrees.\n\nThe AI systems architect goal is totally doable without a formal CS degree. What matters more is understanding how to design scalable systems, knowing your way around cloud platforms, and having practical experience with ML workflows. I'm seeing this firsthand - we're building Sprout (an AI job search tool) and the technical challenges are more about system design, data pipelines, and user experience than theoretical CS concepts. The foundational stuff comes up, but you learn it when you need it.\n\nThat said, if you do want structured learning, there are way more efficient options than a full degree program. MIT OpenCourseWare has excellent systems courses, Coursera has solid ML specializations, and honestly YouTube + building projects will teach you more practical skills than most university programs. The Georgia Tech OMSCS program is solid if you really want the credential later, but you could probably test into it with your existing experience and some strategic self-study.\n\nThe real question is whether you need the degree for credibility or just the knowledge. For backend/cloud/systems architecture roles, your portfolio and ability to solve problems matters way more than your diploma. Plus you're already employed and gaining experience - that's honestly more valuable than classroom time right now.\n\nWhat specific foundational concepts are you feeling most lost on in your current work? That might help you prioritize what to tackle first without the whole degree commitment.",

        "body": "Hi Brad,\n\nThank you for your thorough response. From first hand experience, i’ve sort of ran into the same conclusion. Most of what i do requires basic logic and problem solving. Honestly, lately, i tend to prompt engineer a lot of my work, especially boiler plate tasks. Not because I can’t solve it myself but just to expedite tasks that would have otherwise been super tedious. Of course, i always make sure to double check what’s been implemented.\n\nAnyways, i came to realize that I don’t really encounter too much heavy math or really any of the foundational topics i mentioned in my post. Well, except maybe data structures and algorithms. But I know for a fact I can just revisit those topics on my own. Even then, the type of data structures and algorithms that I come across or use aren’t really all too complicated.\n\nI guess i’d like to pivot into something with a little more “job security”. I feel like ai systems management is the way to go. But, to be perfectly frank, i haven’t taken much of a deep dive with system design nor machine learning. Im just at that stage where I’m thinking about pivoting into those roles. Right now im doing mostly basic crud both fe and be. Which is why im wanting to do something that’s a little more future proof. That’s why im considering perhaps going back to school. To learn the fundamentals of cs. But, I honestly do feel that I can teach myself these things. The tricky thing is coming up with a solid structure/strategy. In fact, i asked chat gpt and it actually did lay out a pretty solid plan. Thank you for those course recommendations btw, ill make sure to look into those. \n\nMaybe it’s the confirmation bias talking (i really do try to look both sides of the equation), but your response has sort of helped put my mind at ease. Honestly, I’m fine with hearing both sides. I just like not keep all of this bottled up in my head as I tend to overthink. I generally go with my intuition, but, it’s still good to keep an open mind. Thanks again for your perspective",
