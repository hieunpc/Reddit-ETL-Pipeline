Also for later versions, 2012, I think, there was some TDS incompatibility and I had to throw pytds in the mix for it to work",

The \"silent schema change\" and \"currency confusion\" cases are exactly what drift detection can catch.\n\nI've been working on profiling/drift detection for similar reasons. The pipeline can be green, but if a source system changes how it sends data (format shifts, new status codes, distribution changes), you won't know until someone notices downstream.\n\nWhat I've found useful:\n\n* Track distributions over time, not just point-in-time checks. If average transaction amounts suddenly double, that's a red flag even if the values are technically valid.\n* Monitor schema changes proactively. When a new status code appears or a column's type shifts, alert on it instead of silently dropping data.\n* Compare against historical baselines. A 15% change in distinct customer counts might be normal growth, or it might be double-counting. Context matters.\n\nThe tricky part is reducing false positives—weekend vs weekday patterns, seasonality, etc. I've been using type-specific thresholds and adaptive baselines (moving averages for high-variance columns, prior period for seasonal ones).\n\nSchema and row counts are easy; catching that a source system changed from dollars to cents is harder. That's where statistical drift detection helps.",

How complex the data is and how forward you go towards the insights/analytics layer? If the data is not complex and you insights to be extracted, delegate this to a modelling tool like dbt and use your pipelines to pull data only and trigger dbt to keep it simple. \n\nIf data is complex requiring many normalisations or multiple sources that a simple sql cannot do, threat your pipelines like a library to process data in its context. \n\nBut remember early optimisation is the evil. \n\nSo its not a question of preference, is what you have to do at THIS time to keep it simple, readable and maintainable for your future self without over engineering. This rule is only yours (or maybe also for your team). \nSometimes it is ok to over-bloat one or two flows because you will touch that once in a year and nobody else will or if it fails nobody will get hurt. I personally consider this and also I don't mind to have duplicated code 3x into 3 flows, so the 4th one will justify a refactor.

It's more like a cook book than a manual so don't beat yourself up for struggling to get it.",

Because of this tendency, I think the book is important to read before entering DE *and* to revisit often in your career. Tools and techniques make it easy to lose sight of why you exist as a DE in the first place; as important as knowing the ins and outs of spark or airflow is, the business doesn't care about how you did it. They care about value and they care about cost. If you don't know that, you kind of don't know anything. This book teaches you to think on that level.\n\nAs an aside, knowing the fundamentals of DE is now more important than ever, because a lot of hyper-specific tool knowledge can now be delegated to AI (obviously you should educate yourself on tool fundamentals). Hope that helps!",

It's theoretical knowledge that pays off over the long term vs specific knowledge that pays off in the short term\n\nRead your other question about Kimball, I also read that one lol 😂 and reviewed it too\n\nFundamentals of DE is better first as it's a high level view of the field of DE **including** data modeling, of which Kimbal is the default methodology in many places \n\nEven folks who say they don't do Kimball throw around and implement Kimball concepts \n\nFundamentals of data engineering goes over Kimball versus Inmon and Data Vault, so you'll get a primer before you dive into the data warehouse toolkit later if you choose to go deeper \n\nHope this helps !",

You can't rebuild it if there's an error - you migrate it.  Which sucks.  You can rebuild it from a dimensional model, but now the OBT hasn't saved you any time at all.\n   * OBTs can't relate an event to dimensional data at different points in time.  For example, see invoices from 2024-12-30 with customer, sales member, or product names as of 2024-12-31, 2024-01-01, or today.\n   * OBTs can't show you what all the possible values are for some low-cardinality dimensional field.  They only show you what appeared at that time.  If you want a drop-down list of them, if you want to show metrics by all possible values, or even to merely show all possible values for each period of time for visualization consistency - you're out of luck.\n   * OBTs can deliver worse usability - when you've got 400 columns and they aren't organized by topics - like dimensions.\n   * OBTs can deliver worse performance - when you've got hundreds of columns with large high cardinality fields, then your columnar storage isn't helping as much as you need, and you end up building more smaller files.\n\nSo, both approaches have value, but generally a OBT without backing versioned data is the weaker solution in terms of usability, maintainability, and functionality.  It could still be worth it - especially if the reporting tool is optimized for it.  But it's not the upgrade.",

This allows you to start developing reports / dashboards more quickly while still working your way through the full dimensional model. This is most often done when rapidly prototyping in a tool like PowerBI. \n\nOBT also works better for some niche storage / warehouse types. An example of this would be Microsoft ADX which actually has very poor join performance if you have a dimensional table that may be large. ADX has no row indexes which means lookup key performance is very bad. In order to mitigate this limitation ADX very much favors OBT data design over dimensionaal / Kimball modeling.",

Even when there’s a data engineering team, they’re usually loaded with pipeline fixes and requests from 4 different business teams.\n\nThe only times I’ve seen the “ideal” happen, where DS genuinely focuses on experimentation + ML, is when the company already invested in good infra, contracts, lineage, etc. And that’s honestly rare.\n\nSo from my seat:  \nWe talk about the pyramid a lot, but most orgs are still in the “cleaning + stitching things together” phase.

Split queues: platform/ingestion tickets separate from analytics asks, and require an impact brief with an accountable owner and an SLA before any net-new pipeline. Centralize definitions in a semantic layer (LookML, dbt metrics, or Cube) so “revenue” means one thing; DS shouldn’t redefine metrics in notebooks. Add cost/freshness SLOs and auto-archive unused tables after 30 days to keep the estate tidy.\n\nWe run Snowflake with dbt, and DreamFactory lets us expose curated tables as secure REST APIs so product and apps teams ship without custom glue.\n\nYou get closer to that 90% DS focus only when contracts, ownership, and pruning are non-negotiable.",

I've seen it outright fabricate what the behaviour is in a confident way.\n\nIf there's a simple one of script, AI is usually fast to write it, such as \"Write a python script to download this bucket of files then parse the json of the files to extract this field and output it\" so I can find bad values that are breaking pipelines.\n\nIt's great for the little things, and outright horrible for the bigger things, and anyone who thinks it can handle the bigger things is causing more problems than they are solving and actively degrading system reliability.

I had to define the entire architecture and how we have everything setup with dbt and the modeling layers(the whole medallion architecture).\n\nlast release we had couple of issues, and it found the exact root cause and the modeling design flaws. It also recommended some solutions but they were not all that great, mainly because it didn’t have the business context. \n\nWe use read only roles, so it cannot change any data.\n\nWe have our entire architecture very well documented, so for us it was easy to generate those claude files for claude.\n\nOverall, my expectation is that it will enable and empower everyone to find the root cause of the problems vs just full refreshing the models. We have a couple new non-data engineers on-call and it will make them independent. \n\nIt will definitely save some time. I don’t think it will work everytime, however, but will definitely save us some time troubleshooting data issues.\n\nOther things the team has been doing is writing dbt unit tests.

Enable AQE with skew handling, and set preferSortMergeJoin=false. If you truly need zero shuffle, write both sides as bucketed tables with identical buckets/keys (Delta/Iceberg works best) or drop to RDDs: partitionBy the same HashPartitioner, persist, join in mapPartitions. I’ve used Databricks and Trino; DreamFactory helped by exposing small dim lookups as REST so Spark could just broadcast them.

Roles were found through contracting companies in the cloud vendor PSO programs. The company would bill the resources(DEs) at 200-250$/hr to clients, and contracts would generally be 3 months to a year. Contractors were mid-senior DEs and paid 100-225k. Companies were all US but across sectors from retail to tech.\naside: Negotiate people! I had access to the numbers and contractors that were doing the same role, same tasks could have 75k spreads in salary. Also change jobs, you don't owe any company anything and it's how you really bump your salary. \n\nProjects I did as a contractor with PSO included:\nBuilding a CLI wrapper around GCP's CMLE that allowed data scientists with local PCs, with graphics cards, to have a containerized workflow that would work locally and a flag of '--cloud' would run the same job on CMLE. Crazy reduction in spin up times, validation of flags and savings on cost of spinning up clusters with hundreds of graphics cards for 10 minutes to fail during startup. \n\nLots of data migrations. \"Get this Oracle DB into the cloud like bigquery... no its license expired and we don't have the ability to do CDC or replicas to avoid pulling too much during working hours oh and you need to use a vpn tunnel that is 25mb/s.. no we don't know what data we want so get everything... how does cloud work?\"\n\nHelped a startup convert their Data Workflows that executed in an on prem location to separate compute from storage, then containerize compute, then migrate storage to the cloud, then migrate remaining compute to the cloud. (Not distributed compue. Python/Java ETLs).\n\nAnd really, listening to a ton of meetings that cover insider Political BS(Which team owns what data, who should have permissions, VP wants method A but acquired company does it method B and wants to keep the current method, etc). Realizing when your contract is just to 'validate' some execs preferences and agreeing. Also constantly pushing back on Realtime data everywhere.",

In a scenario if prompt injection happens or there is a case where the policy gets bypassed, the attacker would only get access to details in the isolated view and have no way of accessing the entire database.

Force the agent to show its SQL every time and link to a saved view/dashboard so users can sanity-check. Wrap execution in a Snowpark Python proc that auto-adds LIMIT and a time window, uses a tiny warehouse, times out fast, parameterizes inputs, and logs prompt/SQL/cost/bytes scanned. Precompute the top questions with Dynamic Tables/Tasks, cache results with TTL, and invalidate via lineage.   \n  \nAdd checks before returning: compare to last week/last month, cap variance, and if it trips, return a warning plus the vetted dashboard. Keep outputs structured JSON and validate; for long docs, RAG over a small, approved glossary so definitions stay consistent. CI matters: canary prompts with golden answers per dataset, block deploy on regressions. We run dbt and Airflow for orchestration, and DreamFactory to auto-generate locked-down REST endpoints so the agent only touches curated Snowflake views.\n\nDon’t chase perfect answers; ship a guarded assistant that’s easy to verify:)",

Statistical tests (KS, PSI) still work on samples. For categoricals, stratified sampling helps catch rare value changes. For partitioned tables, profile only the latest partition(s) instead of full history.\n\nIn terms of frequency, I run lightweight profiling (schema, basic stats) on every run, and save detailed stats for a few runs per day. Tier by importance—critical tables every run, others maybe 2–3x daily.\n\nI built a profiling tool that does adaptive sampling (random, stratified, top-k) and handles partitions. It stores results over time, so drift detection still works even with sampling and less frequent runs. \n\nTrino supports TABLESAMPLE directly in queries (SELECT \\* FROM table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (2)).

I'd probably manage the transformation logic with dbt, but most data warehouses will support scheduled queries and/or views if you don't want to introduce an extra tool yet.\n\nThis has the advantage that, in the flattened tables, you can include only the fields you currently have a use for, while still storing all the unused ones in the warehouse as raw data.

Debezium is great but only if you want to own the complexity.\n\nIf you end up syncing Postgres into a warehouse and need the targets to stay correct without juggling all the CDC edge cases, a real-time sync layer such as Stacksync can help keep those tables aligned so you don’t have to chase failures down the chain.",

It seems very powerful and there's a lot to be configured, but ultimately for our team it didn't work out. I felt like I never understood the current state of things, and some errors and warnings would resolve themselves and other times I'd have to reach out to support, for what felt like a similar error message but it got stuck.

If you share the grain you’re targeting, I can sketch the simplest version of that layer so all your facts play together without manual unions and if the model needs to sync back into another system later, Stacksync can keep those reporting tables aligned without extra pipeline work.",

        "body": "Hi,\n\nYes, it’s definitely possible to retrieve this kind of metadata. Power BI (and now Fabric) provides several REST APIs that can help you. One of the most useful ones for your scenario is the **Get Activity Events** API:\n\n[Admin - Get Activity Events - REST API (Power BI Power BI REST APIs) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/admin/get-activity-events)\n\nThis API gives you detailed activity logs, including actions like **ViewReport**, **EditReport**, **CreateReport**, and more. It covers most of the user interaction events you mentioned. A few key points:\n\n* **Permissions:** You need to be a Fabric (Power BI) Administrator to access activity data for the entire tenant.\n* **Retention:** The API provides data for the past **30 days**.\n* **Format:** The output is JSON, which you can easily process and load into Snowflake or any other data warehouse.\n\nIf you want to go deeper (e.g., dataset usage, queries, refresh history), there are other APIs like:\n\n* **Get Refresh History** for semantic models\n* **Get Reports / Get Datasets** for metadata\n\nYou don’t need Purview for this; the audit logs are part of the Power BI service itself. Purview is more for data governance and lineage.\n\nIf you’re planning to replicate what you did in your previous org (loading into Snowflake), you can schedule calls to these APIs and push the data into Snowflake via an ETL process or a simple script.",

Fabric has a CDC/Copy job feature and you can also use Delta Change Data Feed in Lakehouse tables to capture row-level changes for reliable upserts.   \n(3) automate discovery of new tables by keeping a metadata table or using the Fabric REST/metadata APIs in a pipeline to list Lakehouse tables and loop over them to create/update copy jobs. Community threads show people scripting this when they need to scale. \n\nAbout schema drift: Fabric’s copy tools can do mapping but they are not perfect at automatically absorbing arbitrary schema changes for all workloads. If you expect frequent schema churn, consider an ELT pattern: keep canonical data in the Lakehouse and run periodic MERGE queries from Lakehouse into Warehouse tables (or materialized views) using the Delta CDF or SQL MERGE so you have deterministic upserts. \n\nIf you want a starting checklist: pick Copy job for initial load, enable incremental or CDC for high-change tables, build a pipeline that enumerates tables and triggers jobs for new ones, and use Delta CDF or MERGE for schema-safe upserts. If you want, I can sketch a simple pipeline loop (pseudo-SQL and pipeline steps) you could drop into Fabric.",

Add Great Expectations for data quality and send alerts to Slack. Expose a clean gold dataset to data science via a small FastAPI service behind API Gateway with keys/OAuth and versioned endpoints. Document the whole thing, use Docker for local dev, Terraform for basics, and a tiny GitHub Actions CI.\n\nFree learning > subscriptions: AWS Skill Builder or Google Cloud Skill Boosts, dbt Learn, Prefect and FastAPI docs, and Snowflake/BigQuery free tiers. If OP wants certs, do one that matches your stack: AWS Solutions Architect Associate or GCP Professional Data Engineer; Databricks Data Engineer is good if Spark/Delta shows up.\n\nI used AWS API Gateway and FastAPI to expose versioned assay datasets; later added DreamFactory to auto-generate read-only APIs from Snowflake without building a service.\n\nShip a small, well-instrumented pipeline and you’ll learn the warehouse, the lake, and APIs faster than any course",

If they do, it tells you when it's useful to use MV (in terms of query performance). \n\nThere are two considerations for the cost - the cost of refreshing said MV and also the cost of the query. Unfortunately without more details, this can only be answered by testing it out. The use case you describe, barring any complexities, is actually one of the more common use cases for MV. \n\n[(The following use cases highlight the value of materialized views. Materialized views can improve query performance if you frequently require the following:](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#use_cases)\n\n* **Pre-aggregate data**.

An example is at my company I am under the swe name but work on and own some DE and my org is paid very well. But we also own the data for lots of high priority ML products. \n\nI also think saying data is a cost center is just not super true. I think a lot of companies are viewing data as a service. ML teams require lots and lots of data that is accurate and growing in complexity. This requires lots of work. Most companies are putting a lot of money towards data teams now and are viewed as essential.\n\nSo in terms of pay I think this is a non factor (there are more important factors like what company you work at and how fast you grow and promote).

Dbt at least is SQL with some jinja that you can pretty easily port to something  else.

Other things justify having a threshold. Other things don't matter. Forget any sense of engineering tidiness: this is about RoI. Your time is the I - what's the R? If you ignore this thing, what loss in revenue or reputation or whatever will occur?\n\nJust because a certain column never had nulls before doesn't make it a non-nullable column. Is there clear documentation / data contract saying it'll never be null? Otherwise, it might instead be a clue that the system is now being used in a novel way, and you (or your downstream data consumers) might need to react to that. Not DQ, just an evolution of how you need to interpret the data. \n\nE.g. Maybe the developers of the source application are now \"overloading\" the orders table, using it intentionally to store some entity that isn't strictly an order, but has very similar columns - except there's no such thing as a user for this new concept. There's probably a type_id or similar in this case, that has a new value distinguishing this novel use case from the old use case. \n\nAll this is just one example explanation, of many; the wider point is, there could be a good reason why the userid column is null. Rather than going to the data owner trying to raise it as an assumed problem, you might get a quicker answer if you assume the best and just ask \"can someone tell me what it means when there's a null userid?\". \n\nIf that is in fact a bug on their side, they'll probably (in my experience) deal with it quicker when you approach it this way.",

In your case, that sounds like AP\\_Number level, since you want to reprocess specific APs without touching the whole EQP.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On avoiding reprocessing:\\*\\*\n\nTrack what you've already processed with metadata (timestamp, checksum, or version) stored somewhere lightweight - could be a simple metadata table in your warehouse, or even a manifest file per batch. When new data arrives, compare against this metadata to determine what's actually new vs. what you can skip.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On the Part\\_Number optionality:\\*\\*\n\nSince Parts are optional and variable per AP, I'd process at the AP level and handle Parts within that processing step rather than trying to partition by them.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Alternative approach:\\*\\*\n\nWhat if you partition by ingestion batch (timestamp when client sends data) rather than by the hierarchical data structure? Each batch could contain multiple EQPs/APs, but you'd process the whole batch as one unit. Downstream, you'd have the full data hierarchy in your warehouse with proper keys for querying.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Question for you:\\*\\*\n\nWhat drives the need to reprocess individual APs? Is it data corrections from the client, or something else? Understanding that might help determine the right partition strategy.\n\n\n\n(Side note: your client moving to database storage sounds like it'll simplify this significantly - might be worth investing effort there rather than over-engineering the S3 ingestion flow)\n\n\n\nCurious what you end up doing - hierarchical data ingestion is always interesting to solve!",

You need 3-5x speedup just to break even cost-wise. The real win is if you need results faster rather than cheaper processing.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Why not widespread?\\*\\*\n\n\\- Requires code changes and testing\n\n\\- GPU-enabled clusters cost more upfront\n\n\\- Many workloads are I/O bound, not compute bound\n\n\\- Operational complexity (different instance types, drivers, etc.)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*My suggestion:\\*\\*\n\nStart with profiling your current Spark jobs. Use Databricks' Spark UI to see where time is actually spent. If you're spending 80% of time on shuffles and joins with minimal I/O, Rapids could help. If you're I/O bound, optimize partitioning and file formats first (Parquet, proper partition keys).\n\n\n\nRun a small POC on one heavy workload, measure actual speedup vs. cost increase, then decide.\n\n\n\nHas anyone in the community actually deployed Rapids in production on Databricks?

So if you can't explain in the most technical terms encryption vs encoding, you can at least talk about how your application encodes values, why it's important for the application and where you use encryption.\n\nPersonally I'll generally take the developer who can talk me through what they'd improve in a project over the guy who can tell me what each gang of 4 design pattern.

I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then it took me 6 months to learn to walk again. When I reported back to my job when the surgeon ended my FMLA and I could prove I could descend down 2 flights of stairs in less than a minute, my office was on the 3rd floor of a 5 story building. I had to prove that in case of a fire in the building and couldn't rely on anyone to help me down the stairs. \n\nBut as I made it back to work after 6 months, my termination papers were waiting for me as they had already replaced me. \n\nI say that to say that every in person interview I have ever been to in the last 41 years, I was always offered the job. I've been been to 4 in person interviews this year and none of them have contacted me after I left the building. \n\nBut all 4 interviews have gone the exact same way that your interview has gone. When I sat down with other employees for a technical review, all 4 interviews with them would ask odd ball questions that had nothing to do with programming. Most of the people I had interviewed with I saw a sheet where they had to google for these odd ball questions. \n\nI'm also a back end developer and one question I was asked is how would I use a Friend Class in C#. Now Friend classes are mostly used by testers, not developers. I've never ever used a Friend class in production. But the guy asking the questions wanted an answer, I made up some answer of how I would track down a bug that was happening in a Entity Framework class and returning invalid data. I said I would use the a Friend class to inject various variables into the Framework class to possibly see where the problem is coming from. \n\nNow it would really be a lame company to work for if they were using Friend classes in production, and I would bet that they were not.  But the guy interviewing me said \"Well, that isn't what we would do.\" The interview then ended. \n\nThe manager would return to the conference room and I would be walked out the building. More than likely it was just a gotcha question to say that we interviewed US citizens and none of them were qualified for the position so we need to apply for more H1B visa holders, or something similar. \n\nAll 4 interviews where similar things. This one just happened to be the last one I went to in the end of July.",

It is not even close to being the same.\n\nTreat it as a learning experience and understand that preparing for technical interviews is very very different. Remember that interviews are intentionally designed to expose what you *don't* now. Good interviewers rarely focus on what you *do* know. Interviewing is a skill and you should definitely focus on it if those skills are weak.\n\nI would actually argue that with these concepts.. the theoretical foundations have to be there, yes, but how it's applied in real world scenarios is far more important. The edge cases, the pragmatic approaches.. the theory only goes so far. And the only thing that matters here is experience. You won't really understand hashing until you've screwed it up. You only really understand securing an API until there you cause an unauthed API incident, etc. Having text book theory about all of these with no real world use is actually worse. Best to be honest and say, \"I don't understand the inner workings entirely, but this is how I have used it, and this is what I learned, found interesting, found tricky..\"\n\nThe other thing you nailed, was your understanding about your communication style. You need to develop clear, concise, confident, vocabulary about these concepts, it has to be second nature.\n\nOf course, any seasoned dev can google/stackoverflow/llm the answers and patch something together in a real job context. But can they think and speak on the spot and come up with a clear approach to a complex problem?  Interviewers look for \"architectural sense\". Are they just slapping ideas together, or can they actually build and piece together a system, that works? Can they document and write a spec, without help?\n\nYour ability to communicate ideas, problems, solutions, and tradeoffs, as a dev is more important than your ability to code. Maybe not at first when you're getting started, but certainly in mid career, and late career, it's everything.\n\nThere are plenty of resources and courses online to learn about just about everything. It needs to become an obsession on your part, to consume as much knowledge as you can AND then apply it in personal projects, over and over again, from scratch, from frameworks, from everything, until the skills are cemented. It's brutally tough, I get it. There's so much to learn and specialize into.\n\nBut in this job market and hiring climate, only the obsessed, people who truly love this stuff, will make it. There is no room for casuals anymore. The bar is so much higher than it was a decade ago, but there is also ten times more resources/avenues for learning/getting started.",

So I compiled the game with debugging symbols, ran said game in GDB, replicated the bug and I found the very instruction that had crashed it by following back up through the stack trace - somehow a zero had gotten plugged into the denominator of a division operation in the physics engine. Armed with this knowledge, I wrote a guard clause around the function that crashed and ensured that the value was non-zero (but instead really really really small) and this fixed it. And this wasn't even advanced debugging, this was literally backtrace viewing, stack frame traversing, and register inspection.\n\nThe moral of the story is - it still pays to learn low-level computer science, assembly, C, and of course debugging tools like GDB and valgrind. You will be an indispensable programmer when a problem comes up that no one else can solve.",

Did you omit it for the format because of time/space constraints?\n- You claim \"don't learn SQL like it's 2010\", but then never use any features post SQL'99. From skipping through I didn't see a single CTE, window function, recursive query, lateral join, json data, tree data, vector data or generalised indexes. This is really basic stuff. Sure, it's not an SQL course but a database design course - but these features are capabilities of databases nowadays that can be used.\n- you seem to do this implementation agnostic, but some stuff here is highly database dependent. Postgres does not have a tinyint type, text data behaves very differently on MySQL vs Postgres. Of course that can't be fully addressed in these videos, but with a full video on string types to wave this away as \"text may be better on any length\" is... weird.\n- ~~same with date types, a datatype introduction there should have timezones in it.~~ - nvm, it does mention it in the constraints video\n- NULL algebra is relegated to one of the last chapters it seems, but it's a gigantic footgun.

I focus heavily on entities, relationships, cardinalities, constraints, and conceptual/logic design. Because of that, relational algebra, window functions, etc aren't core to the curriculum for this class.\n* I also intentionally keep the SQL examples **implementation-agnostic**. If all you want to learn is vendor differences, you need to look elsewhere.\n* For the data types videos, the goal is to give beginners enough intuition to make reasonable design decisions, not to provide an exhaustive catalog of every nuance across engines.\n* As for NULL semantics, that topic *is* included, but it shows up later because students need some conceptual grounding first. By the time they get there, they’re ready for a deeper discussion of null traps.\n* As for \"A table is used to represent a single entity\", it helps beginners learn in the 1st lesson. Nuances like junction tables are inappropriate in the 1st lesson, and are covered as the course progresses.\n\nThese choices are mainly for pacing and approachability, especially for students encountering databases for the first time. That said, your points about relational algebra and modern SQL features are fair for someone looking for a different style of course, and I appreciate you raising them.",

So, this is not a useful phrase for detecting plagiarism. However, \"fourscore and seven years ago\" *is* improbable.

It will essentially go through line by line, and then look for similarities to the library. I can only think of how to apply it to essays and papers, but it could be:\n\n1. Step 1: Start with similar words. The checker will take the piece you're working on, and compare similar words to others. If the piece you're working on reveals a high number of shared words, then it gets \"flagged\" for further examination. \n2. Step 2: Take the piece you're comparing, and the other pieces of work that share some close similarities, and then reveal similar phrases/sentences. If the similar phrases ended up being long enough (multiple words/sentences), then the likelihood that it was plagiarized increases. (ie: a phrase \"too bad\" isn't going to flag it, but if someone quotes a full abstract from a scientific paper then it flags it as copied).\n3. Step 3: determine a way to program it to detect plagiarism vs referencing/quoting other works. You'd have to look up formatting options (like the usage of quotation marks, and other steps required to reference other notations). \n4. Step 4: Iterate and reiterate the process until it becomes better, faster, or more robust. \n\nFor code and math, especially on the lower scale like cs50, it's harder because a lot of the solutions for dedicated questions have 1 solution.

Then you keep building several until it looks a little less crappy. Then you build other objects and repeat the process. If you do that enough times, you'll naturally pick up other tools and methodologies that'll help you with your building. Over time, you'll be able to start building a house with your experience. \n\n\nYou won't know what many tools are called, names of all the screws, and the best way to use everything. You just pick them up and try them out, learning as you build things.\n\n\n.\n\n\nYou're a **beginner** trying to build a house (Minecraft mods) when you don't even know what a hammer does (Java). Of course that'll feel overwhelming. \n\n\nFirst, play around with Java. Follow a tutorial or two about it. Maybe do a course or make something cool. There's no \"am I ready?\" You're ready whenever you say you're ready, whether that's after a 1hr yotube playlist or a several week MOOC. You'll *never* know everything about Java. Never. You can get a PhD in CS with Java and not know how to build a single project. Fortunately, you don't need to know *everything* about Java or CS to accomplish your goals. \n\n\nDon't let that lack of knowledge make you afraid to start building with it. You can start building things even after a simple 1hr tutorial. It would be a far cry from MC mods (little chair vs a hige house), but it's definitely enough to start your journey. \n\n\nI'd probably go through a beginner course utilizing Java. Udemy? Coursera? mooc.fi? Pick your poison. Anything works. [Pick one of the links at the beginning and get started](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/1kla4xc/comment/ms0p7yn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n\nI'd probably go for the Udemy one. Hyperskill is more expensive, but it'll probably be the easiest intro to Java. The mooc is probably going to be very in-depth, and very hard, but free. Probably overkill. Coursera might have some free courses. There are many. Just choose whatever beginner Java course you can find. \n\n\nWhatever your choice is, just go through it until you know a little bit about Java. Your goal is simple exposure and to be able to build small little things that output into a terminal. They likely won't teach you how to build things in MC and you may be exposed to a lot of concepts you won't find immediately useful. Just get comfortable seeing code, using code, and thinking like a programmer.\n\n\nDon't go down a rabbit hole of things (remember the PhD comment?). Java can build practically anything, so you'd be able to learn so much without achieving your goals. Just get the basics down until you're comfortable. \n\n\n.\n\n\nOnce you have a basic understanding of what Java is, go straight into learning how to mod.\n\n\n[Here's one resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1csh3yp/comment/l44waul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n[Here's another](https://www.mcjty.eu/docs/intro)\n\n\nThere are a lot.\n\n\nDon't freak out. You won't know anything really. The above Java stuff was just getting you used to the hammer, nails, properties of wood, etc (depending on the resource, you may have built a chair or two).\n\n\nThis, however, is the real deal. You're actually going to start building chairs, and it's going to suck and it will look like crap. You won't even know a lot of the things being talked about and you'll feel like you're at the very beginning again. That's okay and perfectly normal. You have to acquire a few more tools, but Java is the biggest learning curve and the one everything interacts with, so it's the one I recommended getting comfortable with first. \n\n\nGo through tutorial after tutorial about Minecraft mods, follow the beginner steps, and try to recreate things as they do it. Then try to do it again without the video, pausing each time. Then try to manipulate what you've created, or even break it. Then try to repeat the entire process from scratch until you recreate it (minus the setting up your tools part).\n\n\nThen move on to the next tutorial. Once you've acquired enough small skills, try to go about building a simple little thing yourself (you can even try after your first tutorial). This simple thing might be insanely hard. You might have to reference different documentation and videos to help you out. Once you finally finish it, try to improve it. Try to recreate it if you really want to reinforce the knowledge. \n\n\nThen move onto the next idea. \n\n\nOnce you do that enough, you should be able to see other people's source code for their projects and be able to pick out little bits and pieces that you might want to try yourself, or research about to see what it does. Try to contribute to an open source mod or pull from their projects and play around with the code. \n\n\nThat series of building is what will eventually get you to creating your own big ideas. \n\n\nPeople legit go through the Kaupenjoe videos (first link) without even knowing *any Java* and successfully learn how to build projects after a year. You can start that way too, but I thought maybe it'd feel better knowing a little bit about Java first (if you already don't know anything). If you're overwhelmed, skip everything I told you and go straight to that. It'll be very hard and scary, but learning to program is a marathon, not a single sprint.\n\n\n.\n\n\nI can't really help you beyond that. Things take time. Don't stress about memorizing everything, being perfect in everything you do, or finding the best paths. Just progress, 1hr a day, every single day. \n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nA painter doesn't get good after their first stick figure. They do tens of thousands of failed small attempts that build up to the occasionally solid large attempt. As they build up their skills from a ton of small, crappy projects, the eventually move onto more and more quality on each piece. \n\n\nTheir skills don't manifest from perfecting their pain brush, getting the best pigments they can, or knowing absolutely everything they can about color theory. \n\n\nDon't worry about getting the best tutorial, learning Java perfectly, and being overwhelmed by all these new ideas. Just go through the first thing you see related to MC mods, that makes sense to you, and work up your skills, little by little. ",

        "body": "There is no best way. Everyone learns differently. Knowing how you learn the best is key to maximizing your success. Once you have that pick a course or path and stick with it. You will be overwhelmed, drained, annoyed and disappointed regardless. Learning is never a cake walk. You'll hit barriers and it will take effort to get over them. Programmers are just the people who stuck with it longer than others. Nothing special about them. \n\nA good way to retain what you learn is trying to apply it to your goal. Since you have one already that's excellent and a great motivator. Every time you learn something think of how you can apply it to that goal of making apps and modding Minecraft. No matter how small there is always a way to apply it. \n\nThe first language is always the toughest. You're not only learning the syntax of a language and how to order things, but you're also learning computer science concepts at the same time. Once you get the concepts though you can easily transfer that knowledge to another language or project. It's like you're building a house. You need to learn how to hammer nails and which screws go where. But you also need to learn how to make a foundation and how to support a roof. \n\nSo keep it up. You can't force things so take breaks and decompress and let things sink in. You won't become making apps tomorrow, but you can learn the building blocks a little bit every day or every other day or even once a week. Persistence is the name of the game.",

Keep in mind if you have no gone to college or taken a lot of high level CS/math courses, there might be a language barrier between academic speak and how you are used to reading things, but it can be learned just like anything else.\n\nAlso, books are great and more comprehensive in my opinion.  You say you want to get into a website; I HIGHLY recommend checking out Jon Ducketts HTML/CSS, Javascript/JQuery,MySQL/PHP books if you ever have some extra money.  They are absolutely excellent, and while they use some outdated tech like JQuery and PHP, I think they really teach you the fundamentals of web development to allow you to harness the power of whatever is at your disposal rather than relying on cobbling together frameworks.  \n\nHope you find some other good stuff as well, good luck!",

The last few years for me have been a mix of excitement progress and “why is this breaking at 3am when it worked yesterday.”\n\nI started by trying to build full businesses before I fully understood the foundations which meant I learned everything through fire. Postgres migrations, RLS rules, serverless functions, auth flows, environment variables across local and production, production/preview deployments, recreating the wheel instead of using battle tested code, running 2/3 projects in parallel, trying to get plugins to work together that don't offer api, customizations the whole stack… I touched all of it way before I “should have,” but it forced me to actually understand how systems fit together instead of just syntax.\n\nThe wild part is I used to think feeling confused meant I wasn’t good enough. Now I realize even experienced devs get stuck. Half the job is debugging your own assumptions the other half is Googling or talking to an AI chatbot until the error finally makes sense.\n\nIf I could go back I’d tell myself this early on:  \n  \nYou don’t learn by memorizing you learn by building the thing that feels slightly too big for you and breaking it until you understand why it broke. Every time something failed in production or mis-configured itself or refused to link or deploy I came out understanding the system a little deeper.\n\nSo yeah my advice is this: don’t be afraid to jump into the deep end. Build real stuff. Ship broken stuff. Fix it. Iterate. That discomfort is literally the path.",

Kernel Stack - You don't want to share privileged kernel details with userspace accidentally, so the switches to supervisor mode swap stacks.\n\n2. Signal/Exception Handlers can be told to use a separate stack, because signals may come when your out of memory. You can sigaltstack() to set this up. Check out man sigaltstack.\n\n3. Cooperative Multi-tasking - exactly what your saying, when you have a more than one function executing on a single thread of execution, so you may have stackful co-routines with there own stacks.",

It can and it can be good at it, but it can be a bit too easy to rely on. If you use copilot in your IDE, when it gives you a massive block of code as a suggestion, I would say it's fairly likely you don't know exactly what that section of code is doing.

Get it to write and explain sections so you can see what it's doing and how it's doing it, but try to write that code out again and understand the code you're working/copying. \n\n\nIt's early days and I'm confident that the education system is struggling to figure out how to let students use LLMs as learning resources, but not as cheating resources.

I would create a static instance of the class and try to do everything with that.\n\nI finally understood that a class is essentially a \"cookie cutter\". You use it to create an object which looks like the class. Then you call the methods on that object. The reason you would want to do this is because you have multiple objects which are essentially the same, or similar. \n\nFor example, take the ghosts in Pac-Man. You could write this by declaring X and Y co-ordinate variables for each ghost, but then you'd have a bunch of variables like ghost1x and ghost3y and ghost4x and so on. Think about how writing collision detection would work. You'd have to check if ghost1x==playerx && ghost1y==playery || ghost2x==playerx && ghost2y==playery.... nightmare.\n\nInstead, define a ghost class, and instantiate it four times, once for each ghost. The ghost class could include a collision detection function, to check if its *instantiation* hit the player. Now you can just write something like:\n    if greenGhost.hitPlayer()\n        player.gotCaught()\n\nYou don't have to worry about how the calculation of the collision detection works any more -- at least, that is the theory.\n\nHave you searched for beginner-friendly OOP tutorials outside of video sites?

The real way you learn OOP isn’t by studying diagrams, it’s by modeling small real systems, giving each class a clear responsibility, and avoiding the “giant class with 20 methods” trap. That shifts your thinking from: the procedural way: “What steps do I need to do?” to the OOP way: “What objects exist in this world, and what responsibilities do they have?”\n2. Tutorials don’t teach design, books do. If you want actual design and not just syntax, these beginner-friendly resources are gold: **\"Head First Design Patterns\"**: the best intro to OOP thinking, **\"Practical Object-Oriented Design\"**: very readable and extremely practical, and **\"Refactoring improving design of existing code\"**: not OOP-specific, but teaches you to *see* structure and smell bad design\n3. Another underrated tip: read good OOP code. Python libraries, open source github repositories, or even frameworks.\n4. On the language choice: Python can teach you OOP, but it’s a multi-paradigm language, so beginners often get mixed signals. If you want the concepts to crystallize faster, something more “pure OOP” like Java, C#, or Ruby tends to make the underlying principles way clearer. Once it clicks, you can apply it in any language.\n\nAnd honestly, everyone writes procedural code inside classes at first. Keep going. The moment it clicks, it really clicks.",

If you genuinely are interested in tech, just keep on pushing, it’ll be worth the effort. if there’s a simmer of hope to pass the test, study as hard as possible to pass it. worst case scenario, you have to retake the class but you now know everything in all future exams. \n\nAs for your career in tech, you have to do side projects and internships. As long as you keep these up, you’ll be fine after graduation. Many graduates lacks experience needed to land a job, which is already over saturated. If you don’t like tech, then you should find what you want to do. since you’re only on your 3nd semester, you still have a bit of freedom to explore while you take all the prerequisite aa classes. \n\nOn the side note, you should have financial aid no? You could also look for jobs in your school like desk help. you could study while getting paid. College isn’t for everyone, there’s different ways to make money. But it is an investment.

The reason I (for example) can read documentation now, is that I have mental models ready. Just yesterday I had to read the cods for a linear algebra crate in rust, and for a database ORM (also in rust). Reading those today feels familiar, and I can anticipate where I am going. I know most of the terms used, I have done the relevant math manually and programmed it before. Everything fits into the models I have built in my brain neatly. \n\nComparing this to when I first started writing ray tracers at university: I just passed linear algebra, and had no pracical experience. Everytime I read an unfamiliar word, I had to go back, and refresh my memory of that specific thing. \"How does XYZ relate to ABC again?\". The more unfamiliar words, concepts and language features you have to keep in your head, the harder it will always be for you to read documentation, or to plan and write complex code. \n\nThere are basically two ways to learn this stuff: Theoretical and Practical. \n\nTheoretical covers stuff like lectures, and classes, but also online courses, reading a book or a tutorial. This can help you gain information a lot faster, since it is (hopefully) well structured and presented in a proper way to learn. \n\n Practical is things like coding, but also exercises you would do for class or for a course (or in a book). This will solidify the knowledge you gained from the theoretical part. It also forms shortcuts in your brain. After you have build the third backed with APIs, you will instantly know what to do when you start your fourth. You will have a folder structure figured out, some patterns you want to use, and how to name the endpoints. This is the type of knowledge you only get by implementing the same concept repeatadly, you cannot really get this from theory alone (and people who only got this from theory alone most often have really weird, and mostly impactical, solutions to certain problems)",

Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\n\nBut that _does_ take some experience, so don't feel discouraged if you're not there yet.\n\n> Do you guys have any advice on how to be able to navigate docs and understand what you really need when solving new problems. \n\nI generally already have some idea of what I need, at which point it's just a matter of searching for a function or method with the right type signature.",

One of the greatest difficulties at being good at writing software is being able to find good documentation. Without good documentation, it is extremely difficult to write good code.\n\nDespite what many may think, one of the best things Microsoft did in their early days was to provide exceptionally good documentation. \n\nTheir MSDN documentation was distributed in CD-ROM format, and it provided gigabyte levels of very accurate technical information. It was called the MSDN Library.\n\nMicrosoft would pay their technical writers' large amounts of money to produce highly accurate technical documentation.\n\nThose roles are now gone, as technical documentation now comes down to reading the source code or battling through autogenerated documentation.\n\nBut the lack of high-quality documentation is missed, at least by me.",

Computer science hasn't changed significantly in the last 5 years.\n\nNote that this is teaching computer science, not programming and certainly not software development. They are different fields. You could finish this whole course without knowing how to write a single line of code, but you'd know a ton about how a CPU and RAM works. The course's programming module seems to lean heavily on a book called Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) which is known as a maths-heavy academic textbook with little practical application in the industry of writing code. \n\nOn the other hand you could take a software development course, learn how to build a full-stack web service and deploy it to the cloud, but still think a computer is a magic box where binary happens.\n\nYou could compare it to a racing driver vs a car mechanic. It would benefit both to know how a combustion engine works, but knowing about catalytic converters doesn't make you drive faster, and knowing about racing lines doesn't help you fix cars.\n\nThere's no \"wrong\" career path here, but software developers who know fuck all about CPUs are far more employable than computer scientists who can't code.

There are many (many, many) ways to accomplish this, so it's hard to give a good recommendation without it.\n\nI will recommend Python for the programming language, Flask for the web framework, and Waitress for the server. Python is about the simplest language to learn, Flask provides tools for building a web service in Python, and Waitress acts as a go-between to accept browser requests, turn them into calls to your program, and send the results back again. I would also recommend Flask-RESTful (I would structure the form submission as a REST API call). All of these have very good documentation.\n\nNote that as a security measure Waitress only responds to the 127.0.0.1 interface (your local-machine loopback) and cannot bind to ports under 1024, so you would usually bind to port 8000 or 8080. For local testing or demonstration this is quite sufficient; if you want to serve pages to other machines, you would usually install nginx as a reverse proxy.\n\nYour laptop very likely already has Python installed, but it is a good idea to make sure it is up to date. If you open a command-line window and run \"python -V\" it should respond with something like \"Python 3.12.3\". The current stable version is 3.14.0, and that is the one you should be running unless there is some specific reason you can't. (On Windows! On Mac or Linux, don't go monkeying with the system-provided version.)\n\nIt is recommended to start by setting up a virtual environment, to prevent something you're adding from interfering with things you've already installed. You can do this by running \"python -m venv my_app\" followed by \"my_app\\Scripts\\activate\". You can now install the modules by running \"pip install Flask flask-restful waitress\" and start work.\n\nCheck the Flask getting-started docs; it will walk you through writing a minimal web app. Use templates; you can probably drop most of your existing html code into template files and use it from there with minimal modification and without cluttering up your code. Check the Waitress docs; they will show you how to call your app and get it running. Try to keep everything as simple as possible until you get a minimal version up and running; you can always gild it later.\n\nGood luck! 🍀",

Apache tomcat, by default listens on port 8080 (for unencrypted traffic and 8443 for https if memory serves). So, if you opened up your browser and entered http://localhost:8080/mystery, then assuming your web app is called \"mystery\" you should see the index.html (or index.jsp) of your site.\n\nNow if you determine that your IP is 1.2.3.4 (it won't be, but let's assume it is) you could go to another PC and enter http://1.2.3.4:8080/mystery then you will likely get a \"host refused connection\" error. This is because the firewall on your laptop isn't allowing anything from the outside to get through - unless you set up the firewall to allow external traffic using port 8080 (or 8443 if you want https) to get through...\n\nNote, if you do open any ports, only open the one or two that you allow and when you are done close them. In fact I would open them when I needed them to be open and close them once I've done the demo from the other computer.\n\nThere are plenty of other potential things you may need to take into account. For example, it will be much easier if both computers are in the same \"subnet\". If you don't know what that means, then just connect to the same wifi AP and hope that the configurations are such that they connect to the same subnet (e.g. try not to use a professors laptop and your student laptop - this is unlikely to be an issue as it is unlikely that there will be such configuration issues,  but you never know for sure unless you try it and know what to look for when it doesn't work on some computers ).",

Also take some control theory courses. I know a lot of folks say that you can do software engineering without a degree - by and large that isnt the case for the type of work you want to do. I have 10 years of experience and have never worked with anyone without at least a technical undergrad degree. \n\nBut that is in of itself insufficient. You also should get involved in organizations that build things. Find a Formula SAE team and write the embedded software. Build a cubesat with a team. Get involved in something tangible and multidisciplinary and demonstrate direct contributions to complex software systems.\n\nOnce you have started school and have at least one concrete project outside of school you have done - message me on reddit and I can look into helping you land an internship at a company doing the kind of work you want to do.",

Great ! thats always true with programming so practicing how to break a problem down into manageable bits is a skill you will always need. Then once you've done that you have the \"stuff\" check out some docs. \n\nfor example say you wanna learn more about how the memento design pattern, well put together some simple code, we dont need to go and make a full blown text editor ( but that would be a useful project) you can just build all the functions and have them output strings to the terminal this way you can practice the class structure and the design and organically generate questions about why and how as you build. then go find the answers to the whys and hows. \n\n  \nif you wanna get more abstract with it i've always found \" watch one, do one, teach one\" to be the best way to learn. \n\nwatch one:\n\nfind a source that explains the full process, consume all the data it has, eg a text tutorial, a video tutorial, teacher explains etc etc\n\nDo one:\n\nyou go away and do the thing you just learned answering the questions you discover along the way.\n\nTeach one:\n\nfind a person to explain it to. They don't have to be technical just any human willing to engage with you. Demo what you did and explain it, the pressure from this should force you to know the material well and the questions they ask may provoke new areas of inquiry you didn't think of. having someone ask questions also forces you to examine the things you think you know, do you really know it ? or just feel like you do.\n\nif you just need to memorize pure data for tests or things to just know you can combat the forgetting curve with spaced repetition.   \n  \ngood luck! and try to have fun with it :)",

        "body": "Like any other programming problem: start by clearly saying *what* you're trying to do, then break that down into smaller subproblems or steps until it's approachable.\n\nIt sounds like you want to identify *all* of the possible poker hands. Start with just one type of hand, e.g. a flush.\n\nWhat's the definition of a flush? It's a hand where all the cards are the same suit.\n\nOne possible way of doing it is to say: \"a hand is a flush if: it's all hearts, OR all clubs, OR all diamonds, OR all spades\". And then write code to check each of those four conditions. This approach will work but it's a bit tedious.\n\nIf you think about it for a second, then it should be obvious that \"a hand where all cards are the same suit\" is equivalent to \"a hand where all cards have the same suit as the first card.\" So you don't need to write four separate checks for the four possible suits.\n\nAnd so on. You can repeat this kind of analysis for each type of hand. For some of the hand types, you will need to examine multiple possibilities, e.g. for two pair, you'll need to check the different possible cards that might make up a pair. For a straight, you'll need to check whether there's a straight with aces low (5-4-3-2-A) or aces high (A-K-Q-J-10).\n\nThere are many possible ways to implement this. If you're a beginner, I would suggest that you first focus on getting something that works *correctly*, even if it's ugly or verbose, and then look for ways to simplify and optimize it. And you should write lots of test cases to make sure that your code behaves as expected.",

So, how I would've done that is this - I'd create a Card class, so i don't have to store suit and value as a raw dictionary, instead i can assign those to a card's attributes through constructor, e.g.\n\n```\ncard1 = Card(❤️, \"Q\")\ncard2 = Card(❤️, \"7\")\ncard3 = Card(♣️, \"J\")\n```\n\nAlso, I'd override comparison dunder methods in Card class, so that i can compare two cards like this:\n\n```\ndef __eq__(self, other):\n    if self.suit != other.suit:\n        print(\"Can't compare cards with different suits\")\n    else:\n        return self.value == other.value\n```\n\nAnd \"less than\" dunder method, so i can tell if the card has higher or lower value:\n\n```\ndef __lt__(self, other):\n    if self.suit != other.suit:\n        print(\"Can't compare cards with different suits\")\n    else:\n        return self.value < other.value\n```\n\nI would also wright a method to compare suits, so i can understand how cards relate to each other.\n\nAnd also, think about how you, as a human, identify that you have a flush, for example? You will take a look at you two cards, check their suits, ignoring their value, then you'll take a look at the table to compare those card's suits to the ones that you have on hand, and IF total amount of cards with the same suit is 5 - you have a flush! So all these hands definitions can be converted in to the functions where if all requirements are met - you've got straight, full house etc.",

That wastes a ton of space. \n\nThe solution is dynamic library files (these are \".so\", or \".dll\" files). A dynamically linked program will be compiled in such a way that when it needs access to a library, it will access the compiled library code at run-time from the library file instead of having it baked into the executable. \n\nOf course, you could just bake the library code into the executable as well. That's static linking, and it's common when you're writing a program for a system with limited space. It also means your entire program is all in one piece.\n\nAs for dynamic/static typing, that's talking about the data being read. \n\nAll data has \"types\". Data can be an integer, an unsigned integer, a character, a boolean value, a floating point number, a double floating point number, etc. and all of those are stored & interpreted differently by the computer - as far as it's concerned, everything's just 1s and 0s.

Code is also stored in memory at runtime and instructions have memory addresses (line number offsets from the start of the executable file). To call a method, you create a new stack frame for it on top of the stack, set a return pointer to hold the line you are currently on, then jump to the first line of the function you called. At the end of the function, you set a return variable in the caller’s stack frame and jump back using the return pointer. \n\nSo, how do you know where to jump? If it’s a method in the same assembly, that’s easy. If it’s in another assembly, you have to determine the jump address. That’s linking. Assemblies have a table of jump addresses at their start so it’s possible to read and set these addresses. Static linkers set this at compile time and if the actual assembly used differs at runtime, interesting things can happen. Dynamic linkers use a runtime to load assemblies and will resolve these jump addresses at that point. Note that virtual methods that support polymorphism have an expanded table of jump addresses by concrete type since they can overload methods. The runtime selects the jump address based on the actual type at runtime. See v-tables for more information.\n\n\nTyping. All memory storage ultimately has a type. It has to since types are literally encoded differently and processed by different cpu components. You can choose to set that type yourself at compile time (statically) or let the runtime take its best guess (dynamic). The later is rarely necessary with objects in languages that support ad-hoc tuples (like js grab bag objects). With primitives or collections of primitives, it’s not a good practice. With types, you want strongly typed code that lets the compiler do as much validation for you as possible. Anything it doesn’t check can still break as an exception at runtime.",

The line of code you reference in your question would be an invocation of a library function, and that library function would talk to a driver, and that driver would send voltages out the USB port that produce the required signals to tell a motor to run or an actuator to move or the like, or it might read a camera video stream or a lidar or gps output.   This is not much different from coding up a laptop or something, these computers had a full operating system and mouse/keyboard/monitor support for diagnostic efforts and so on.   Its 'barely' embedded, in the big picture of that world, but we made many a 'robot' (mostly, unmanned aircraft and later, watercraft) with those tools.  \n\nThe other level is where you do more of that hands on, sometimes actually wiring devices together yourself and sending voltages to them with some agreed upon way, often directly setting an address to a value using a C or assembly like language.   I did a lot less of that, as it is slower to produce the product and a lot more weeds to get into for each individual component.   For example we had one 'smart' actuator that ran code, but you had to wire it up a certain way to accept a program and then wire it up a different way to run the program installed on it automatically when it got powered on.   There was extensive documentation for making that work.  \n\nI would start with a simulation.  keep the stuff that would be hardware isolated so you can replace it, and build a sim where you drive your robot around and have it do the things you want it to do all in just pure desktop code.  Then if you want to build it, you can pick out the hardware and change out the isolated code to interface with the motors and sensors and all.   We had full simulation for all our vehicles, crude but it got the job done, to test our control systems and such safely in a virtual world.   Eg if your robot is going to navigate a maze, get the logic for that done in a sim, if its going to avoid obstacles, do that in the sim... get it all working best you can before a live test.",

If you let it hand you full solutions, you won’t build your own internal map of how things fit together. But if you treat it like a senior engineer who gives hints while you still write the code yourself, your skills level up fast.\n\nWhat helped me early on was giving myself stretches of time where I didn’t ask anything until I had at least tried to outline the solution. Even a rough plan is enough. Once you have that, AI becomes a tool that fills in gaps instead of a tool that replaces the entire thought process. You’ll be surprised how much you actually know once you force your brain to engage first.\n\nVue is a great choice to learn because the mental model is clean. If you keep building small projects where you write most of the logic yourself, you’ll break through that “wall” feeling. And once you’ve done a few builds where you genuinely understand the moving parts, AI becomes a speed boost instead of a crutch.\n\nYou’re in a good spot. You just need more reps without a safety net so your confidence catches up.",

Add what you want to learn and let that be your guide. You will see progress as you go.\n\nAlso, looking things up and figuring out how to solve problems is the main part of programming. The typing (programming) part is only between 10-20%. The other 80-90% is looking things up and learning how to solve that next small problem This never stops. After over 30 years, I only know basic syntax. I don't create things from memory and I don't know anyone who does. We are all doing it the learning way some have just been doing it longer than others.\n\nBest wishes.",

For example: \n\n¿Do you want to have a quick, stable and reasonable job that can be repetitive and monotonous but really simple if you put your efforts on it? \n\n¿Do you want to program physical things that can explode with bugs that not even experienced engineers know, with the cost of reading 1500 pages of documentation and spending a lot of time in debugging? \n\n¿Do you want to design a website? ¿Design the whole logic of websites? ¿Maybe both, deploy them? ¿Do you want to automate things even if they are stupidly funny? \n\nAnd so on, the point is that you should not start by picking a language or just by watching random videos on what you should and shouldn't learn, most of them are bullshit in my opinion. Think about what would you want to do that you could program. If you already know the basics, try something a bit harder, accomplish and then try something harder than the last project and so on. \n\nPersonally, my ADHD-coffee-abuser ass cells were suffering from tutorials, \"yOu sHoUld kNoW tHisS iF yOu wAnT tO sUcCeED\" and programming in Java in college. Almost a month ago I changed my focus into an obsessive-constantly changing way of studying, defined topics and since then I've been improving A LOT.

I got into this initially as a frontend dev in the early days of the internet being what it is. Wrote my first CMS so I could go completely unhinged with design. But kept pushing it, and pushing it, and pushing it. Kept my own rinky dink CMS running for over 15 years. \n\nA year ago I was pissed about how few GOOD automated options there were for music imports. That could respect tagging rules, be very picky about renames, not lose meta files, and be able to import images and lyrics. A year ago I knew nearly zero python. Today I know A LOT of python and A LOT of Bash. I love what I'm doing so I just do it naturally. \n\nSo find something you want to do and make it happen, if it's right you will keep wanting to do it and make it happen.",

Your interests show up while you’re working, not while you’re thinking about working.\n\nAs for learning, there’s no magic source. Videos, books, courses, docs, all of them work. What matters is whichever one actually gets you to sit down and build something. Once you’re building, the fundamentals start making sense because you’ve got a real reason to learn them.\n\nSo don’t wait for clarity.

Be Active: Exercise is really good for your brain and keeps you motivated. Taking up sports or going to the gym will do wonders for your emotional health, physical health and your brain.\n\n2. Do Something: On my course, there are a lot of people who do nothing outside of University. As long as you're taking up a part time job or working on side projects, you're already beating a lot of the competition. In my interview at my internship, they prioritized my soft skills and what I learned in my prior role as a Restaurant Supervisor, and it's why they took me on.\n\nMake the most of your free time at University too. You won't be at a stage in life where you have so much free time again. Go out and have fun and work on side projects, and good luck :)",

Get a STRONG foundation of knowledge with data structures.  Learn how memory actually works in a computer.  THINK like a computer rather than a human.  DOCUMENT your code! There is so much more to cover but just starting off this is the best advice I can give you.  Also try to stick with 1-2 languages and really master them, its better to know 1 language inside and out vs 7 language on a surface level.  I'd suggest c++ but im biased af.  If you have any questions feel free to ask I got my BS in SWEG, CS, and mathematics.  Applying for my MS in CS and electrical engineering while working right now.  As for sources that helped me id say stack overflow is #1 then cpp reference helped me a lot, geeks for geeks is okay but id try to avoid that, and dont under estimate the value of YouTube (you can seriously learn anything on there for free)",

Be creative, try solving random a$$ problems. I mean that's what CS is about - solving problems or types of problems through computation. You can really fck around a lot. Maybe publish your projects and source code at some point too. Just have fun and experiment with all these powers you can learn.\n\nIdk and GOOGLE A LOT. Search everything up that interests you. Click on new things. You'll be able to penetrate nieche's and topics that'll definitely help you make decisions on what to do with your time.\n\nAnd if you find most of this completely boring. Never forget to overthink your life choices.

Python and C++ both have their place but solve different issues.  I would recommend C++, simply because c++ is considered by many one of the hardest programming languages to learn.

I told her that they could contact me directly. \n\nThey were in Canada and had this website... [https://www.minorityassist.com/](https://www.minorityassist.com/) They told me that they had paid $5,000 in Canadian money to have the website developed and it was doing nothing to bring in donations and they needed a better website in a hurry and they would pay me to create a better website. They said they needed it in 5 days. \n\nI said I could recreate that website and make it better in 4 hours. I was given the go signal. Less than 4 hours I had something up and running with a light box and scrollable images on the front page and menus at the top. \n\nI was told \"No\" on the attempt to recreate the same website. I said, \"Okay... point to me a website that you really like and would prefer to be like\". \n\nThey had a website that was done by a student in 2013 that took 9 months to complete.

The only problem is that another company owned the [minorityassist.com](http://minorityassist.com) url and they would have to use another one. What I found for them was the .net url. They purchased it from GoDaddy. \n\nSo, I recreated that website in 2 days... Yes, 2 days... \n\nIt is here... [https://www.minorityassist.net/](https://www.minorityassist.net/)\n\nThey paid me $1850 in Canadian money. \n\nThey didn't want the \"Corporate Sponsors\" page anymore and said to delete, the one on my created website, not the one on Wix...

That also answers to your \"And what parts did you actually have to code? Frontend? Backend?\" part. If it would be just backend then it would be just an API. Unuable for regular everyday users. If it would be just frontend then it would be stateless and there would be no way to interact with other users. A fully functional CRUD application needed both backend and frontend even in early 2000s. Just then you had more likely no frameworks and you were using the regular language itself.\n\nThe comment in that thread says it took couple months for Zuckerberk to make it. Which is realistic time for a single person team. Because you won't be just writing the backend and frontend but also deploying it, setting up a database, figuring out its hosting, do some elementary security testing, etc. \n\nA random beginner could not do it. A person had to have a knowledge in creating CRUD web application. Which would be doable for a person who had spent months in learning it (do keep in mind, writing that early Facebook took couple of months already by itself), trying out smaller projects, and then going for that bigger project. Doable for a CS Bachelor student (2nd-3rd year or such). \n\nThe current Facebook for sure is not duable for beginners nor for students. It has whole separate teams working on different parts of the system.",

Possibly you also need to talk to a therapist or doctor if you're having issues with feeling like something \"messes up your mind\".",

Not relating to interviews, but to getting deeper and deeper until you loop around and feel that you got nowhere.\n\nFirst of all, wanting to know the fundamentals of everything to the core is not bad, but it is dangerous.\n\nYou have to realize this is an impossible task, and that should be the most important basis before any action. Nobody knows everything, but many pretend they do, even beginners, beware of gurus and savants, do not compare yourself to them, because you would be comparing yourself to an illusion.\n\nNow how to choose, when to dive deep, when to stop, when to not dive at all. I cannot answer that for you. But I can tell you my solution. Focus on projects.\n\nI always had this problem, but it never shows up when I have time pressure from a client. When there is time pressure and the main goal is not to learn, it is to get the project done, then I magically start to prioritize things properly.\n\nI have side projects with no time pressure, usually they get nowhere, but I do not expect them to.\n\nIf I am working by myself for myself, I have to create time pressure and reinforce it all the time, or else I get into study loops or refactoring loops or planning loops.\n\nMy suggestion to you is to not direct your learning toward interviews, at least not as the main focus. Interviews are abstractions, they are meant to assess knowledge, but they are very flawed.\n\nIf you focus on knowledge that helps you build actual software projects, that is useful, and nothing in the world can ever make that not useful.\n\nIf you optimize for interviews and the interview landscape changes, then you have wasted your time.",

Set a timer for that period of time, like 30min. When it stops, you stop. Add to that initial list of things you planned to research later.\n\nYou won't memorize everything (and don't need to), and often times simply going through the main material, only learning enough to continue on with said material, will help you build a foundation to reinforce the rabbit holes you'd be digging through later. If you start with the rabbit hole first, then you may wind up with collapsed tunnels as you have nothing to tether that knowledge to. That'll result in digging those same tunnels later, wasting your time.\n\nDo just enough to build a basic mental model of the theory and your material. Only focus deeper when you need to.\n\n**If you need a different perspective:**\n\nBeginners in art require a lot of quantity to produce quality, and as they get more reps, the more quality becomes important. Starting with only one painting that they focus all their quality on often stunts their progress compared to those who've done a healthy mix of both. You're focusing way too much on quality. Lean more towards quantity for now.\n\nProgramming is solving problems by building solutions, like a trade. You need to build a lot of projects to get better at programming so you have something to tether theory to. Learn what you need to build those projects and occasionally a step beyond, and that experience will reinforce the times you dig deeper.\n\nYou *can* focus a lot on theory to make *learning how to build projects* a smoother process, but theory isn't the thing that makes you a programmer. Just like how knowing the properties of a hammer, how to make sandpaper, and different types of trees doesn't make a carpenter learn how to build a house, memorizing every definition, theory, syntax, etc, isn't going to be the thing that makes you learn how to build a program.\n\nYou actually only need very basic theory to start building programs, just like a carpenter can start building incredible things with a hammer, nails, wood, and a saw. Keep to your priorities, as you'll likely be hired as a programmer, not a computer scientist. \n\nWith that said, **chase the fun**.\n\nI actually enjoy digging into things and learning theory/CS concepts, so I like to mainly do that with little bits of project-building sprinkled in. That's severely limiting the speed of my growth as a programmer, but it's what keeps me interested in programming in the first place. It sounds like you're the opposite of me as you're getting overwhelmed, so chase what's fun for you.",

It's the difference between being able to put together scripts that automate things and generally glue other people's code together without knowing (or perhaps caring) how good it is (or could be), and being able to write whatever you need to, from scratch if necessary (given other time/resource/knowledge requirements are met, of course).\n\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks) is a mostly-applicable example of the above.

Much harder I would argue.\n\nI have nearly two decades of experience (20 years), and I would not be able to support myself I I had to find freelancing clients. That's one of the reasons salary type jobs are so popular, you just show up and get paid.\n\nEven if you did find one client to pay you for 10 hours of work ($500), it might take you easily 20 hours of advertising & marketing to land that client. Congrats you're now making $15 hour.\n\nThe other about clients is you need to pitch them an entire complete solution. Ex: I will build you a website that will increase your conversion rate, \"cleaning data\" might just be a small detail they don't care about.",

You might say \"man this is annoying; who the hell programmed this thing??\".\n\nAs a programmer, though, maybe you're using your OWN  piece of software.

It sounds like you are going for a Computer Science degree, and wondering, why they don't teach you to be a programmer, but a scientist. \n\nMaths (and DSA and all theoreetical CS courses) are very much required to become a computer scientist. You have to learn all of the basics, so you are able to specialize in any CS subfield later. This also enables you to understand, to have a common vocabulary and knowledge base with others, even if they have a different specialization. I spezialized in computer graphics at uni. One of my best friends in networking and distributed computing. Although we barely had any courses in common after the first 2 years, we could talk to each other and explain one another what we were doing and how it works, with barely any problems. \n\nThose skill are not immediately, obviously useful. But they are necessary for computer science. \n\nAnd as someone who was a tutor for a DSA course: Those courses are there to give you the toolkit to reason about algorithms, analyze them and even figure out new ones if you need to. They don't teach you how to program, and that's by design. It is a different skill. \n\nProgramming on the other hand is something completely different. It is a craft. The program doesn't care if you know Dijkstras Algorithm, can integrate in multiple dimensions or know the difference between average and median. If helps to know those things about as much as a knowledge of a structural engineer helps you building wooden cabins. Good to have? Sure. Can you learn it quicker and easier for this specific usecase? Also yes. \n\nIf you want to learn programming, you will either have to hope that your school has some courses in that direction that will be helpful, or you will have to take your foundational knowledge (like maths and DSA), get some tutorials and get programming. \n\n>Should I choose a specific field of software engineering\n\nNot 100% sure, but it sounds like you really should focus on the fundamentals first\n\n>I tried to read books on software design\n\nagain, fundamentals. You are trying to run before you can walk. \n\nIf you are still at uni/school at a level where you just had your first DSA courses, and maths, the size of project you are supposed to tackle is tic tac toe in the terminal. A calculator. An CLI that simulates how fast your money can grow with a 5% annual compound interest. \n\nOnce you have that, a good next set of problems is the size of small games. Rebuilt Tetris. Flappy Bird. The Akinator! \n\n>and we didn't actually code in class because we were told \"I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science.\"\n\nAnd I nearly missed this quote, but it fits too well with what I tried to convey before: This is not a problem, this is how it is supposed to be. You are in a course designed to make you a scientist, not a craftsman! Sure, most people in Cs degrees end up going into programming, and I would argue we are better at it because of out degree, but you really should listen to your teachers.",

For projects, if you are doing this to get a job then REST and CRUD are your friends. REST is mostly frontend to backend. CRUD is mostly backend to database. There is a lot to learn there and also around those two main things.\n\nFor the projects you build, incorporate those things into it. TODO app? Add  REST, backend, and database. If you really want to learn how to become a software engineer, turn this into a SaaS. Add signup/login, membership management, subscriptions and payments, calendar scheduling, email reminders. SMS. Learn how to deploy this to the cloud with automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.\n\nUse git/github throughout and create pull requests for each new feature. Start small and add new small things one at a time. Pull request in between.\n\nThis sets your roadmap for learning how to do this.\n\nOnce you can do that, pick an existing project you use or have seen. Think about how they built it using what you learned from the full stack TODO SaaS application. Start building it to learn how they did it.  \n  \nThat is how you build projects.

In either case, you're going to have to have threads wait on each other to catch up before continuing.\n\nAs for what \"synchronizing threads\" means, it means what it does on the tin. Threads don't run at consistent speeds, and they run independently of eachother. This means when you run two threads, the order they finish in can vary at run time, which can be bad if one relies on the result of the other to do its job. This can also result in two threads using the same resource at the same time, even when they shouldn't - imagine two people being able to book the same seat at a movie theatre because they both clicked \"book\" at the same time.\n\nTo synchronize threads, you give them a way to communicate, and that's where Mutexes & Semephores come in.\n\nMutexes are a shared resource that can either be \"locked\" or \"unlocked\" at any given time. If you wanna use it, you have to lock it so no one else can use it. You also have to unlock it before moving on lest you fuck everyone up.\n\nSemephores meanwhile are kind of like hall passes, where mutliple threads can use the semephore at the same time, up to a threshhold; useful less for strict ordering, and more making sure multiple types of thread (ones that involve heavy processing for example) aren't running at the same time, gumming everything up to a standstill.",

The most expensive one is around 130 bucks but there is a full range between the 15 and 130 bucks ones so you'll probably be able to find one that accommodates your budget while doing what you need it to do, for example the pi400 has an integrated keyboard and sells for around 60 bucks, found one second hand for 35 a while back and that was pretty nice. You could definitely look into second hand ones into your area, or maybe ask for it as a Christmas present if that's an option, it won't run any games but for second hand stuff you can get that, a monitor and keyboard and mouse for under 100 bucks and have a fully functional setup for programming and browsing he internet and your parents could use it as a computer too if they need it (might be a good selling point for them idk).",

No direct CRUD on tables must be permitted.\n\nThis protects your data from badly written/optimised/long-running queries, unauthorized modification, etc without having to write a separate server application and inventing its own protocol.\n\nA client application should still handle disconnects, failed transactions and error messages from the RDBMS as appropriate for the situation. But that applies to if it's communicating via an intermediate server app as well, it just means your app developer needs to understand a bit about DBs because that logic and connection config will need to be in the client application.\n\nBe strong when a \"power user\" wants to connect excel, BI or something equally silly to it to run queries directly. Nothing except via sprocs which the DBA writes (and if you are the DBA, learn about query optimisation, transaction deadlocking and isolation levels, indexing, etc)",

If you want to control a music player, you'd need to see if the player has some API to allow that. If it doesn't, you may need to resort to something like PyGuiAuto to simulate clicks on a UI to pause/play/next song/whatever.\n\nSo, you'd need to be able to write code that can run on your phone (either a native app or a web app), and then some code to run on your computer to do the controlling. Both ends would likely require different languages as well unless you do everything in a broadly explicable language like JS.\n\nEdit: If the two devices will always be on the same network when you want to make use of this functionality, you could skip the broker and just run a typical web server on your computer. Then you could have the phone load up a web app that you write served from the computer, and the server could do the controlling actions directly.",

Pure Python: pyHanko can iterate embedded signatures and validate them; grab signercert subject CN and signingtime from the validation result. Lower level: with pikepdf, find AcroForm fields with /FT /Sig, read the field’s V dict for /Name and /M, then parse /Contents (PKCS#7/CMS) using asn1crypto or cryptography.x509 to get the actual certificate subject, which is more trustworthy than /Name.\n\nNotes: PDFs can have multiple signatures or a separate DocTimeStamp; you don’t need the Windows cert store to read signer info (it’s embedded), only for trust validation-use pyHanko’s certvalidator if you need that. For API pull of signer details from completed e-sign docs, Adobe Acrobat Sign and DocuSign provide it, and SignWell also exposes simple endpoints for names and timestamps.\n\nBottom line: pyHanko or pdfsig are your quickest wins; pikepdf + asn1crypto if you want full control.",

I agree the system is terrible and stupid, but I really don't know how to \"fix\" it.\n\nThe only way to really know someone is competent without putting candidates through some ringer of bullshit is to know them beforehand. If you've worked with them before, obviously you know how good they are. But that doesn't work at the intern/new grad level (for the most part, aside from rare cases), so I really don't know what to propose.\n\nLeetCode OAs and interviews are stupid as fuck, but I don't really know what to propose for big companies either. It sucks for students who want to spend their time gaining useful skills that actually help with the job, but solving this problem is way easier said than done.",

There are people who put an insane amount of effort in to help people. There are folks who sit on their ass.

You can look into roles like Business Systems Analyst, Configuration Analyst, Implementation Consultant.\n\nI'm an implementation consultant and my role consists of configuring our software for clients pre-launch. This includes some pretty basic coding as much of the configuration is done with scripts, and writing SQL queries to validate configuration/data. Most of my coworkers were previously systems analysts at a competitor company, so I assume that's a similar role.\n\nBasically look for roles for techy people that aren't necessarily programmer roles. Tbh with just HTML/CSS experience it will be really hard to get a SWE job with how competitive things are right now",

So learn the basis of Azure, AWS, or GCP to the standard that a dev is expected to. You don’t need to go super into the weeds, but get an understanding of CICD Pipelines, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.\n\nThis is pretty much the bare minimum knowledge for devs with a few years experience nowadays at least for web devs.\n\nDo that then study some system design methods (neetcode has videos for it as well as leetcode) and a few DSA questions. Don’t go too overboard on it though like many here will, if you aren’t trying to crack Big Tech, a good chunk of companies don’t even ask leetcode.\n\nFrom there just apply and hope for the best, the market is as good as it was 3-4 years ago.\n\nEdit:\n\nBiggest thing is probably to not ask this sub for advice, it’s full of unemployed people, students, and sky is falling doomers that can’t see what their weaknesses are",

I know a lot of juniors are having trouble. \n\nHowever, unless you didn’t mention it. I don’t think your husband is able to get a job with the profile you mentioned. \n\nTo get a junior job you’re going to need a portfolio demonstrating what they can bring to the company. \n\nA band, first reaction, wouldn’t need much UX work. They might need graphic design or visual work but I’d imagine UX design needs is small. And the process and methodologies he shoes likely isn’t going to be the same as a corporate company. \n\nFreelance work is fine but if he hasn’t has a role in the industry, the likelihood that someone knowledgeable hired him for actual good UX work is low. I’ve seen a lot of people with no UX knowledge take advantage of people with no experience and the work produced is just not up to par. Plus, it sounds like this was from years ago. \n\nIf he really wants to get into UX design he’s going to need his portfolio and resume reviewed. He also might hear that he needs to rework everything. His portfolio needs to be *better* than a new graduate’s portfolio. Cause if all being equal someone is going to hire the new grad if the portfolio looks about the same. \n\nHis portfolio is going to need to show UX case studies. I apologize if it is, but just the way you’re describing it makes me hesitant. He doesn’t need many. 2-3 fully fleshed out good ones is fine. They also don’t need to be “real.” Most juniors work on their own projects showcasing websites or apps they created (doesn’t need to be developed but needs to showcase the experience). \n\nAnd I wouldn’t be surprised if it’ll take a year+ for his portfolio to get up to par. He’s competing against people who learned for 4+ years with internships. ",

If he is not into Coding, drop the idea ASAP! \n\nSo let’s assume he wants to be a UX expert. Does he have a website with a portfolio of projects? Does he share a Github or anything that shows how often he works and what he works on? UX is great because you can prototype almost everything. If you cannot prototype it, you either lack the skills or the idea is simply bad and not intuitive.\n\nFreelancing is extremely hard for someone without experience. Most freelancers are people who could easily take senior consultant jobs but choose self employment instead. That level of expertise is exactly what companies expect when they hire contractors.\n\n**So it comes down to two paths.** Either he goes to college, gets a degree, gets internships, and builds connections, or he starts mass producing UX templates, prototypes, and other tangible work. \n\nHe also needs a proper portfolio and a tailored CV/resume and projects outlining for each company he tries to get a contract with.\n\nRemember this about freelancing. You are basically a private organization advertising yourself to a potential client. You are not just looking for work. You are already self employed and you are offering a service. \n\nThere is no cheating the system. Either you produce a lot of visible work or people will pass over you because there are plenty of candidates with degrees and strong portfolios.",

Turns out, my family was just super tech illiterate and im just a typical late millennial. And now that im in industry the imposter syndrome hasn't left me since day one. Which is both good and bad. I constantly feel like I should be seeking new knowledge while also feeling like I have no idea what im doing, because honestly sometimes I don't and that stress does get to me at times. Google is my friend.

As far as I can tell, the improvements in LLMs have really started to slow down, and I see no reason why they shouldn't continue slowing down even more given that:\n\n* There are limits to how much energy can be allocated to LLMs; this ultimately puts a limit on how much training can be done.\n* We are running out of additional data to train LLMs on; this is another thing which puts a limit on how much training can be done.\n* Low-hanging fruit of algorithmic/architectural improvements have largely been solved (from models like DeepSeek) so there are now fewer and fewer stones to turn in this regard.\n* Moore's Law is dying and the low-hanging fruit of hardware architecture improvements seem to be picked by and large, meaning that hardware efficiency improvements will likely plateau. (see [https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance](https://epoch.ai/blog/predicting-gpu-performance) for what I'm talking about)\n* Neural scaling laws which model performance are inherently increasing BUT concave down when more parameters/data are added, meaning that improvements should continue to get smaller over time; and this is not just the case for LLMs, but for any AI that could exist.\n\nOn top of that, there's reason to believe that the models may get worse. Much of the data now on the internet is AI-generated and it is inevitable that a great deal of it will be used to train new LLM models, thereby causing them to overfit and degrade somewhat. Let's also not forget that the CEOs and researchers have a lot to gain by hyping up AI, so if that is what is causing to feel concerned, try to not to let it get to you; there's a long history of this kind of stuff happening when relatively new technologies emerge, but the end result has always been exaggerations.",

The people who were older than that did not have kids or did not have a spouse (or, had spouses who were in demanding industries). I saw 2 cases where people left 3 months prior, or 3 months after the birth of their child.\n\nI think a lot of people try to make as much money as they can from 22-32 and then downshift. They shift to either remote jobs or more 'chill' industries like traditional banking, defense, or they start to do their own independent thing. Some do leave tech in its entirety when they see those 'stable' tech jobs aren't paying much more than less intellectually demanding roles.\n\nI do think there's some disparity in fairness compared to previous years. 10 years ago, someone at 33 with a kid on the way could have gotten a remote arrangement from their current company.

But there are some reality to your concerns.\n\nThe goal isn’t to produce value anymore, it’s to maintain trust. This means a few things:\n\n1) you’ll find a good amount of people that have little to no desire in growing themselves or improving the environment they are in. People can be close minded and would rather maintain existing process. You’ll need to track down like minded individuals\n\n2) everything is a risk assessment. The approval process to get new tech is a pain. Bureaucracy slows down initiatives, you’ll figure out “work arounds” that’ll help you continue to work when waiting for permits or approvals. For example, maybe using localstack to build a POC because your new AWS feature isn’t approved yet\n\n3) tech debt… classic right? Except it’s a little different in that it’s harder to introduce new technologies that could alleviate tech debt. These people have also been in a bubble, so they don’t know about all the new stuff\n\n\nIf you’re worried about the title, honestly don’t be. You’ll find that there’s a good amount of people that have title based on tenure over skill. Sure, they may know the domain better, but they’ve been out of the game for a long time. \n\nKeep your head up and maintain a growth mindset, you’ll be just fine and maybe you’ll guarantee your retirement.

I could jump into a Go project and fix some bugs and probably learn a bit, but I'd be much better served by augmenting that with doing some quickstarts and writing my own programs and tests that encapsulate the problems I'm trying to learn how to solve.

For a senior level role, I would expect a lot of interviews to focus on strong system design (differs a bit between backend and frontend though). If you're targeting big tech, you're likely going to encounter some form of algorithm interview rounds. And of course, prepare for your standard behavioral questions as needed. A lot of times, these boil down how you resolve inter-personal issues of deadlines, disagreements, prioritization, etc.\n\nOutside of technical skills though, linkedin premium is probably a good place to start, though you might want to only use it for 2-3 months and decide from there if you still need it. I also think the primary thing to focus on is applying to listings early. Another side note for linkedin is to reply to recruiters if they do reach out, even if you are declining them. I believe doing so increases your profile's score/visibility to recruiters as someone that replies so you'll likely receive more recruiter outreach in the future. I don't have a concrete source on that though 😅",

Get work experience while in school.  I worked in tech support, then as a QA while I was still in school.  I then proceeded into QA automation until I finished school and started my first full time software engineering job. Now is a great time to pick up a job in an adjacent field until you have more experience to get into a team as a software engineer.\n\nAs far as AI is concerned, I love it as a tool and am looking for ways that our team can effectively adopt it into our coding practices, but it's not the magic wand some people love to say it is. It can help speed up development of \"boilerplate code\" that is tailored to a specific purpose or to help get answers to a new codebase. The demos where someone creates a web app or phone app just by prompting is great for creating a prototype to get feedback from the market on whether its worth spending engineering time to actually develop that feature.  The code generated may be useful enough to build off of, but as a codebase grows in complexity, the likelihood of using any large amount of AI-generated code becomes increasingly difficult.",

People who are over halfway through their career usually aren't trying to prove anything, and they just want to live their life and coast in stability until retirement.   The lack of this doesn't mean it's not chill, but if you see people like this there, then it probably is.\n\nPeople work hard because the moment you truly relax is the moment you stagnate in your career.  So you'd want to look for people who are probably satisfied with where they're at in their career.   Which also kinda lines up with Google being chill.  If you're at Google, you're close to the peak of software engineering.  Of course, you do have to do occasional overtime for deadlines, but from what I've heard from people, it's not so bad.

Their only argument is that 2 years is shorter than 4 years. Do your own research and cost/benefit analysis of a bachelors vs masters.\n\nIf I were you, I would go through a bachelors and do internships every year during the summer break until graduation.\n\nPersonally, I think that CS Masters that only teach you \"coursework\" don't have much value. The value of a \"Masters\" is to have deep knowledge and research experience in a particular field (for example Computer Vision, or NLP or...). That's what companies are looking for when hiring for ML roles and requiring Masters/PhDs.  (Source: I work in the industry).",

        "body": "You've got a decent base for the resume (the AI transcription tool and the compiler project are solid), but they're getting buried under resume padding that actually makes you look less experienced/skilled rather than more.\n\nWhen you list basic CS fundamentals alongside advanced engineering work and harder courses, recruiters assume you're conflating simple homework with real projects. They can't tell what's impressive and what isn't, so they default to assuming it's all entry-level. Mention the most advanced courses, but cut things like \"Computer Science I/II\". A short list of courses that sound more impressive is better.\n\nThe skills section needs serious trimming. That LeetCode level notation doesn't mean anything to most hiring managers. It's not an industry standard, and honestly it reads like you're trying too hard to quantify something that your GitHub and projects should already demonstrate. Same with the soft skills list. Saying you have \"time management\" is meaningless when you could just show it by describing how you delivered a complex medical AI tool with proper NLP pipelines and error detection.\n\nYour language list is creating a credibility problem. Eleven languages including VB and Prolog makes it look like you've dabbled in everything but mastered nothing. Recruiters know that's not realistic for someone graduating in 2026. You'd be better off splitting this into \"proficient\" (languages you've used in substantial projects) and \"familiar\" (things you've learned but haven't built much with). Don't bother listing languages where you're only familar that are unlikely to be relevant for the types of jobs you're pursuing to keep the length reasonable. That honesty will make you look more competent.\n\nThe Task Scheduler project is actively hurting you. Your first two projects demonstrate real engineering thinking; then you list a project whose features are \"arrays, scanners, and conditional statements.\" That's literally week-three CS101 material. Removing it entirely would strengthen your resume by raising the average quality of what you're showing.\n\nYour game project description has a weird gap. You did a great job explaining the design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy), which shows architectural thinking, but you completely forgot to mention what you built it in. Unity with C#? Unreal with C++? Custom engine? The tech stack matters way more to a hiring manager than knowing it was inspired by backrooms-style horror games.\n\nMore generally, every bullet point should pass this test: would a junior developer find this impressive, or would they think \"yeah, that's just normal programming\"? If it's the latter, cut it. Your resume should show the ceiling of what you can do, not document every step of your learning process. \n\nYou'll have a bit more empty space, but that's better than getting mentally downgraded for a bad relevant to irrelevant ratio or preventing the reader's eye from catching the important parts in the 10ish seconds they're going to skim it.",

        "body": "TLDR: Don’t move for less than 300-400k, Consider moving within Canada first. \n\nCanadian SWE (6 yoe) current living and working in NYC. From my opinion, it’s only really worth it if you can make significantly high salary, such that you can buy your way out of American problems. This is significantly harder for someone with a family, as your expenses will be higher and you will be impacted by more specific issues than someone who is single (Schools, Health care costs, etc). Even in a lower cost region like Baltimore, I wouldn’t move for anything less than 100-300% salary increase over your Canadian salary. \n\nIf you’re really committed to this \n\n- Don’t focus on the L1-B visa, Consider TN. Apply externally to jobs in cities with tech hubs (SF, NYC, Seattle). With your YOE you should be able to get some decent high paying jobs (200k-400k). These should pay enough for you to support your family with 1 income; so even if your spouse can’t secure a visa, it’s still manageable. \n- Plan for potential private school expenses. Public education varies based on where you live, so either plan on paying more rent in a high income area or paying for private. \n- Plan for a short stay. Both L1B and TN are employer tied. So you WILL (not maybe) eventually find yourself having to come back to canada quickly if your employment ends. \n- The tech market is tough right now, but from what I’ve seen it’s still pretty competitive for senior level roles. \n\n\nTbh, \n\nConsider moving within Canada. There are definitely senior level jobs in Canada that pay way more than 100k, you may just have to move to Toronto or Vancouver. Also, 100k CAD seems low for senior even for Canada.",

Once, it even removed a test case unrelated to my feature. Still, they’re incredible for understanding a codebase—like a supercharged Stack Overflow. But I’m still the driver.\n\nLLMs will stick around once they can run cheaply. Right now, companies are subsidizing usage to grow, but eventually the economics will shift. They’re not the be‑all for AGI, and the hype will cool.\n\nThe growth phase for OS‑level apps is over. The iPhone in 2007 was a hardware revolution—suddenly everyone had a computer in their pocket, spawning entire industries. AI is different: it’s a software paradigm layered onto what we already have.\n\nThe job market won’t “recover” to old norms. This is the new normal: pruning human labor.

You know beforehand and you call them out when you see them coming. Giving stakeholders a heads up is good. No heads up when people are counting on you is really bad.\n\nIn general though it sounds like you just need to spend some time so be sure to get AI to summarize docs for you and help you with coding as well. This will limit the number of surprises but surprises always happen. If you never hit surprises then the scope of your work isn’t big enough for you and you’re ready for more challenging work. Not communicating changes in assumptions and no requirements that were found would be a problem but people will give some leeway to new developments that were discovered. \n\nProd issues? Everyone makes these mistakes. I caused one a few months back and even the most senior members of my team have done this too. Again if you haven’t done this then you haven’t worked enough or the scope of your work is too little. It happens to everyone. For these take charge and learn from them. Everyone makes these mistakes and can learn from them. \n\nI’m a manager turned IC again and I can say this: you want a good relationship with your manager too so play the political game. The manager is generally on your side because if you do well so does the manager. A lot of these issues can be communicated with the manager to help unblock you. \n\nCan’t give estimates right away? Yeah no one really can unless they’re super familiar with the subject matter. When your work becomes more ambiguous as your level goes up these can be more difficult. What I do is I give a large estimate (adding to my current estimate) or tell the people involved when I can provide an estimate and why I can’t I do it now.",

You could also check out donnemartin/system-design-primer or binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability on GitHub for more patterns (but those can overwhelm you a bit - only do it if once you've got the basics down and i'd also recommend using GPT to identify the best ones based on your existing prep)\n\nAs for the E5 interview, I think you can totally ace it if you stay organized and consistent! Just set your constraints early, pick a clean baseline design, call out the obvious bottlenecks, and talk through how you'd scale or handle failures gracefully. If you've got time, running through a couple full mocks with that approach would definitely help (educative has those built in too).\n\nGood luck! You've got this!",

I started very similarly to you, doing QA automation at a large bank even though my role was officially Software Engineer. I built out the QA testing framework for cloud infra in my spare time, and the cloud infrastructure team liked it enough to take me in after a few months. I did that for a few years before hopping now to a backend role at a fintech. As long as you're building code and interview prepping, you just need a bit of luck and some years of experience under your belt, and enough code work to talk about in interviews.",

To be honest the toughest CS class is trivial compared to even an easy medical school class and you get into the tough ones like immunology and it's an entire semester of WTF. \n\nThe important part. Don't go into medicine for money. It pays well but not everyone is cut out for it. I know I wasn't and it took me a couple summers doing cardiology research work decades ago to understand it. \n\nIf you can, try to job shadow a medical professional to see what it really is all about.

You are still in school hopefully so max out with all AP classes if you can so you can get all your math and general cs courses out the way.\n\nIf you want to build something build something through action and consistency, do not stop until you have actually made something.  Don't overdue it but don't just stop either and have a finite timeline in place so you can get it done within a reasonable time without spending all of your time on getting it done.\n\nIt sounds like you had interest in videogames, ok that is nice, go build a something using a framework or engine like Unreal that is simple but functional using something custom you built in C++.  Once you do that create another project to incorporate what you have learned in school.\n\nLearning is always worth it as it is a hard requirement to stay relevant and marketable.  You stop learning and eventually your market value decreases as your skills stagnate and become less relevant and in demand.",

I have seen people get jobs in the first semester dude just because they got paired with teammates who worked in FAANG or their desired role. Also one huge advantage with OMSCS is you can check out all the career fairs available in-person if you're willing to drive/fly to Georgia.

Will an interviewer ever request a specific language or will they let me do what i know. \n\nAdditionally for take homes and assessments and that wil i be expected to learn new language syntax in a short period of time? let me know your stories and or struggles! Thanks!",

It's also usually after the first (or first couple...) interviews, so they already read your resume and talked with you about your skills, so they know what you do and don't know.\n\nI've had technical interviews when I knew literally zero of the many languages they used, they were aware of what I did and didn't know, and they asked me technical questions about the languages and frameworks I knew. They were mostly focused on my decision making (ie why would you use such a framework or library, when would you not, what are some of it's features and strengths).\n\nIe a position with go and erlang asked me about my extensive next experience, why would you use it (forward facing web app, fast server supplied applications) and when would it not be as useful (super immediate information like real time financial information where you want it client side rather than server side). This was relevant to what the position was about (financial position basically).\n\nWe briefly discussed what they used, I let them know I was aware of it and it's strengths, and that was about it. 90% of the interview was focused on system design decisions and AWS which is both language agnostic.\n\nTake homes or assessments will likely just be done in the language you're familiar with, and syntax lookup is usually allowed.\n\nGot to 4 interviews with them and waiting to hear back, but they said I did well on the technical interview.",
