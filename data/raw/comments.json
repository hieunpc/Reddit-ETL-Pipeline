Today’s platforms have to support analytics, data science, and increasingly AI workloads alongside traditional BI.\n\nThe criticism of Databricks and Snowflake feels a little unfair; they are not trying to replace data warehousing fundamentals, they are trying to support multiple workloads. Both platforms can absolutely deliver a well-designed data warehouse if the right discipline is applied.\n\nIn my experience, the real issue is people rather than platforms; there is a strong tendency to chase modern tools and certifications while neglecting core concepts such as data modelling and integration. I regularly see engineers openly say they have no interest in modelling, which I would argue is foundational to being effective in this space.\n\nSo I agree with the spirit of the post; that we have lost sight of fundamentals. I do not think modern platforms are the culprit; they simply expose gaps in skills and architectural thinking that were always there.",

In data analytics and engineering the real problems are and always have been people and processes. Technology only enables them. What actually got us here is weak data management and governance.\n\nThat said, I also partly agree with the criticism. Modern data stack tooling has reached a point where many organizations think that throwing Databricks or Snowflake at every data problem and calling it done is enough. This is especially true in organizations where IT (which should not be the owner of data in the first place) is expected to “fix” data issues. They look for technological solutions to what are, in reality, problems of processes, roles, ownership, and culture. In that sense, the frustration expressed by Inmon is very much understandable.\n\nSo the concept of the data warehouse did not fail. Technology simply made it easier to avoid the hard work. Vendors and consultants sold a convenient illusion. Integration and enterprise data are not a tooling problem, they are a design choice and an organizational commitment, and a governance problem. Expecting a platform to solve that is exactly the mistake that keeps repeating itself. Blaming modern platforms for the decline of data warehousing feels like blaming a database for poor data modeling. The real issue is that many organizations never built enterprise data capabilities in the first place.",

You generate the code to download the historical weather and air quality data (backfilling) into feature groups (tables) and write an incremental pipeline to download weather forecasts, weather observations, and air quality observations. \n\nThe 1st challenge you will encounter is how to perform a temporal join to join air quality observations with weather observations. This requires an ASOF LEFT JOIN between the tables. Only a few data warehouses support it it (and Hopsworks feature store). You want that data back in Python (e.g., Pandas DataFrames) to train the model. Hopsworks provides that data via Arrow from the Lakehouse tables. If you go via JDBC/ODBC to your data warehouse, performance will be vile - Arrow (ADBC or ArrowFlight) is best for Python clients.\n\nMy book (referenced in the thread) covers these fundamental skills of backfilling vs incremental pipelines and data models - star schema, snowflake  schema data model and OBT (don't use this for ML!).",

Tests and freshness checks punch way above their weight, especially for client work where trust in the data matters more than fancy metrics layers. Lineage and docs also get used more than people admit once teams grow.\n\nThe newer features are interesting, but I have seen mixed adoption. Semantic layer sounds great, but many teams already solved that in BI tools or code. Sometimes it feels like dbt is trying to be the control plane for the whole stack, which is nice in theory but adds cognitive load.

E.g. requiring that analytics solutions only use data from gold when in production, but allowing analysts to utilize tables from other layers for their development and testing iterations. \n\n\nDogmatic approaches is reminiscent of the age-old debate/criticism of centralized data warehouses that took years to develop before anyone in the business would get data access, which reduced their value and usefulness and accelerated the development of \"shadow BI\"-setups in business departments that didn't get their needs met. You can't develop in a vacuum and expect users to accept a (to them) long delivery time just because you want to run the data through all the layers in your architecture. Of course, you also have to protect your setup and governance, but sometimes speed of delivery is more important than perfected delivery. ",

Scalability -- build templated scripts of processes that only require inputs to run. For example, the name of a source, its connection, the name of the tables, and so on.\n\nPros: scalable, easy to add new sources (just add a config)\n\nCons: Harder to understand than \\[2\\] as there is an extra layer of abstraction (the \"metadata\" layer)\n\n2. Ease of understanding -- simply have processes for each source that move and/or process the data. It's a bit easier to understand for other people and new joiners since there's just one thing to look at which could be a bit more scalable in the future since other people can chime instead of you bottlenecking your data team\n\nI've seen 2 work well when there isn't loads of data but a big need for data in the company. \\[1\\] works well in say traditionalindustries like manufacturing where realistically it will always be a central data or IT team trying to process probably quite a lot of data, so it depends but the key always is design first then modularity IMO",

At different layers of the stack there's different approaches.\n\nFor custom API extractor's, I wrote the first two as completely separate. Then when I was working on the third, I started by copy-pasting stuff from the first two, looked at where things were identical and put as much of the overlapping code as I could into a library. Then I made all of our future extractors use that library. We were writing them in go so this took the form of an interface which extended `io.reader` that the custom extractor would implement.\n\nFor loading, using the aforementioned library produced data in a standard format along with a schema file that could be used to generate a snowflake load statement. Then we had a single snowflake load component defined in our task orchestrator which we re-used everywhere, changing only the configuration. (We used argo-workflows as our task orchestrator instead of Airflow. I... don't recommend doing that)\n\nAnd then for transform jobs, I'd conceptually sort them into two categories. \n\n1) Transforms which you can determine programmatically from some sort of metadata. This could be standard transformations you perform on every table like an upsert, or it could be parsing fields out of a JSON document based on a schema. You should generate these SQL statements with code. You can have that code be DBT macros, use code-gen to generate DBT statements, or just generate and run the SQL statements from your application. I'm not a huge fan of abusing DBT macros for stuff like this because I find JINJA to be kind of messy, but a lot of people swear by it. Probably comes down to personal preference. As for having the code that generates the SQL statements also run it, you should avoid this unless you directly benefit from detecting and implementing schema change on-the-fly. Otherwise just having a daily/weekly pull request that you generate with a script is probably fine.\n\n2) Custom business logic transformations. I wouldn't do anything special here. If it's in DBT that's enough standardizaiton.\n\nThen once you're writing custom transformations you can kind of do whatever you want. DBT forcing everything to be SQL select statements is a pretty high level of standardization.",

They should return you a bad request but other systems often don’t follow best practice. \n\nRemember the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) when it comes to integration. \n\nUltimately if you’re going the route of a watermarking pattern to ingest incrementals and not dedupling downstream it doesn’t hurt to have some internal validations e.g asset min(created_at) > last_created) that fail the processing. ",

It's a combination of:\n\n*  Market temperature\n* You as an individual at a technical level\n* You as an individual at a personal level\n* How realistic your expectations are\n\nFrom what I read on the subreddit, people who struggle a lot tend to have very unrealistic expectations for their first role, underestimate how much work is required, as well as overestimate their own position within the job market e.g. no years experience, done one bootcamp, \"can't find a remote job paying $200k USD - job market is COOKED\".\n\nPurely anecdotal although I got into Data Engineering during the previous DE boom 5 years ago, so I had market temperature on my side.  Additionally, I was unemployed so was programming, studying, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours per week as well as applying for jobs within the country I'm a citizen of, so a lot less complications in terms of borders.\n\nBased on what you have written, there is a possible issue with borders although if the subreddit is anything to go by, a lot of US work is being outsourced to your location.  I'd definitely consider asking r/dataengineersindia as they're likely well positioned to answer your question.",

Oven if you do the stuff with python. You will do the same things as with SQL.\nAs an analyst your tools should be\n- power BI\n- microstrategy\n- Tableau\n-  Qlick\n- SAS Vita workbench (visual analytics)\n\nThey are all about the same thing. Visualize data.\nCreate Heatmaps, graphs. Distribution layout.\nAdd trend lines. That kind of stuff.\n\nData engineering is really preparing the data, order it in a way that you can create the graphs. Workaround data bugs, remind source system to fix their data. Enable analysts and scientist.\nYour tools are concepts. Data Vault, Kimball Star models.\nYou work on data bases like Oracle, postgres, terraria.\nOr Kafka, Apache iceberg or had up to name fancy approaches.\n\nData science is ML, fancy mathematics to get some insights from existing data.\nMaybe ask some data science guy. I would say your tools is mathematics first. Haha.\n\nI would not pick the job by fancy names/ tools. What do you want to achieve?

Thanks for providing more insight.\n\nWhen I started consulting in data engineering I have been told everything lower 3 years consulting in data engineering consulting is junior grade.\nThere has been some truth to it, because no one taught me what data engineering is about and I learned through experience and failure in different projects.i would not say this is necessary today, since the knowledge is better accessible. For example here in r/dataengineering are multiple experienced engineers that are willing to share their experience. And AI also gives nice ideas on how to tackle the challenges.\n\nMy advice is do not focus on tooling as the primary goal..\nLook into data governance ( most boring data engineering topic IMHO, and I put it here because it is about metadata)\nData quality ( that's always a thing, and IMHO the most interesting part)\nData modeling strategy ( that is the most difficult part. ).\n\nAll of these topics you can tap in today without changing jobs and they will accompany your DE career.\n\nIf you see a job that features a tooling that interests you, go for it.there is nothing wrong in that. But see it more like a car acquisition you always wanted to drive.\nAlso when applying to position try to highlight your core data engineering skills that you already have. I think that's a better thinking approach then do tool bingo. You might also discover more interesting jobs by doing so.\n\nI hope that advice helps you and provides some motivation to you.",

In real pipelines, the biggest gains aren’t perfectly structured outputs, they’re time saved on discovery and triage. Analysts, data engineers, and analytics managers spend far less time opening PDFs, scanning documents, or hunting for the “right” version. Error rates improve mainly because fewer documents are missed or misinterpreted early, not because extraction is flawless. Complexity still exists, but teams get faster at deciding what matters and what needs attention, which is often the real bottleneck.\n\nFor data roles, this is where a local, intelligence-driven system like VaultBook has had practical advantages. Instead of forcing everything into schemas upfront, it keeps documents intact and applies intelligence at the retrieval layer. Data analysts quickly surface related reports, prior assumptions, or historical decisions. Data scientists revisit source material tied to experiments or models without re-parsing files. Managers review contracts, specs, and analysis together in context. Because the intelligence runs locally and focuses on relevance rather than brittle extraction, workflows stay simpler. The measurable benefit is less context switching, faster recall, and fewer “did we already analyze this?” moments. That kind of efficiency compounds quietly, which is often more valuable than flashy automation.",

If you go that route (management or lite-DE), prepare to have very strong domain knowledge and stay within your industry even if you switch job. The pay isn't bad, and maybe even better if you're political and ambitious. \n\n\nThere are heaps of companies who are still using legacy systems and still need DE who are really good at SQL. You do have to upskill and learn data modelling. You should volunteer for those sort of project in your current job to at least say you have experience with data modelling such as Kimball. There are lots of courses on data modelling you can take. \n\n\nOnce you got your foot in the DE door doing SQL and data modelling, you should learn Python, infrastructure etc and become a more well-rounded DE. The job description for DE is constantly changing. It's getting more and more heavy on infrastructure and companies just expect you to be able to do anything. But always know your strong point. \n\n\nThe expertise I'm still advertising for myself is data modelling, Databricks and the ability to step into Data Analyst role if needed (because I was one). You'll be competing with DE who used to be software engineer. They'll be much better than you at coding. There might be DEs who were SREs/DevOps and they'll be better than you at infrastructure. I also have another friend who isn't that technical but she became the data lead and earns way more than me. She has excellent leadership skill, communication skill and also very studious and has a millions certificates so she can participate in any technical conversation even though she doesn't write code that much. \n\n\nSo work with your advantage and continuously learn to overcome your disadvantage, regardless which path you take. ",

When you get to the \"Set Scripting Options\" part of the wizard, there's an \"Advanced\" button—click that, then look for the \"Types of data to script\" option. Change it from \"Schema only\" to \"Schema and data\" (or \"Data only\" if you just want inserts). That will include insert statements for your data.\n\nFor views and security objects like users/permissions, the wizard sometimes skips them by default. Make sure they’re selected under \"Choose Objects\"—expand the tree to manually include your View and Security options. For user permissions, you might have to script those out separately, as SSMS sometimes leaves out the explicit DENY/GRANT statements for users.\n\nOnce you've done this, your .sql file should include create table statements, insert statements for your data, view definitions, and possibly some user/permission scripts. Double-check the final script to see if everything you need is there—sometimes for things like user permissions, you'll have to supplement with a bit of hand-written SQL at the end.\n\nGood luck! If your module ever evolves into building internal tools around this database and you want a less manual way to let others view and update data (especially if you don't want to give direct database access), there are platforms that can help you spin up safe, web-based interfaces pretty quickly. But for now, the scripting approach should tick all the boxes for your assignment.",

When they break, it will be noticed and important people will know your name.\n\nIf you want to DM me - feel free to. I transitioned from Biology (Genome Sciences and Technology, University of Tennessee Knoxvile) into industry about a decade ago. I can’t promise i’ll have relevant advice on how to do it yourself; but if you have questions I’m happy to do what i can to provide you with my opinions/observations.",

How much stuff will they need to return? Staff, Inventory, Asset-Type (in case multiple assets are of the same type/specification - entry-cards, laptops, servers, mice, etc)\n\nSoftware and Deployment - what stuff do you have to roll-out across the organisation?

What about Windows 12?\n\nUsage/Telemetry - how and when was the asset last seen on the network/in-the-office/stock-taken on a shelf?\n\nPolicy - what usage/returns policies are there for different asset classes?

If possible collect only the past week each week. \nIf it is an api limitation that forces you to get a full year with each call, collect and store the raw data as is, or clip it to just the past 7-8 days if it is enough data to risk storage bloat.\n\nThen make a bronze/ Staging layer that filters out duplicate rows and stores just new rows as a new file as parquet in a dated store. (Like: data/year=2026/week=1/data20260104_20260111.parquet , data/year=2025/week=52/data20251227_20260103). Then you can use duckdb on the parquet store to query directly with sql or to render a single deduplicated table in your destination format if necessary for your use case.",

This is meant for things like system or temporary files, but it can be annoying in cases like yours.\n\nIf renaming isn’t too disruptive, prefixing with something else is an easy fix. Otherwise, in Spark 3.0 and above, you can tweak behavior with the `spark.hadoop.mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.input.dir.recursive` option (set it true), but that doesn’t affect the underscore rule—hidden files are still skipped.\n\nA more targeted workaround is to explicitly list files you want with something like `spark.read.json(list_of_files)` instead of giving a directory, or you could rename the files as part of your ingest pipeline.\n\nThere isn’t a PySpark flag to disable this hidden file rule, unfortunately. If you need to keep underscores, consider scripting a rename step or using a pattern that Spark will pick up. The docs are a bit buried, but this is standard behavior and catches people out all the time.",

More businesses tend to mean more data sources and more data. So this should be measured as a fraction infra cost. How much that fraction be will depend on how much the budget holder willing to allocate (and how much the VP of Data can justify the importance of data to the business). And as the storage grows, can we archive the old data?\n\nSilver: similar to bronze. Its scale and cost grows proportionally to the business needs. Optimizing compute is a matter of optimizing the query, using spot, tuning knobs, etc.\n\nGold: Many data analysts may not create an optimized query. No filtering, no limit, select *. I feel that the cost per query should be charged back to individual BU because it depends on the BU needs and how adept each BU's analyst optimizing the queries.\n\nJust my 2 cents based on what I saw.",

So instead of returning 204 I must return a boolean for a success or not.

        "body": "I'm gonna tell you something that took me way too long to figure out and honestly still pisses me off that nobody just said it to me directly when I was your age.\n\nStop building shit to impress other programmers. Start building shit that actual people need.\n\nYou're seventeen, and coded for like 6 years? Cool. I was similar. And I wasted years, like genuinely wasted them building technically complicated garbage that nobody used. I'd make elaborate systems with clean architecture and clever algorithms and other developers would be like \"wow nice\" and I felt smart. But you know what? That's just jerking off. Nobody outside of programmer circles gave a shit because none of it solved actual problems.\n\nThe real turning point isn't learning another framework or getting better at leetcode or whatever (ofc that's important too at some point). It's when you stop asking \"what's a hard technical challenge I can tackle\" and start asking \"who around me has an annoying problem I could maybe fix\". And I mean really asking. Not imagining problems, not building solutions looking for problems, actually talking to real humans about real annoying shit in their lives.\n\nI wish I'd done at seventeen instead of building my tenth todo app with a new fancy tech stack. Go find someone, it can be your parents, a teacher, local business owner, literally anyone, and ask them what repetitive annoying thing they deal with. Then build the dumbest, simplest possible thing that makes that less annoying. Not elegant. Not impressive to other devs. Just useful.\n\nFor an Example, my friend used to manually copy-paste data from emails into spreadsheets for her work every morning. Took her like 45 minutes. I could've built a script that parsed those emails and dumped it into a CSV in literally an afternoon. But I didn't, because that wasn't \"interesting\" to me. I was too busy implementing a custom database engine for a project nobody would ever use because I wanted to understand B-trees. See the problem? She had a real problem that cost her actual time every single day. I had the skills to fix it in hours. But I never even asked because I was focused on impressing myself and other programmers.\n\nThis will humble you hard. All that clean code and design patterns everyone is proud of... Nobody cares when they can't figure out how to log in. The clever optimization doesn't matter when they just need a button that exports to Excel because that's what their boss wants. \n\nYou know what's funny? Even Linus Torvalds had to learn this lesson. When he built Git, he didn't start by designing the perfect distributed version control system architecture. He started because he was pissed off at BitKeeper and needed something that worked for the Linux kernel workflow, specifically handling huge numbers of patches from contributors he didn't fully trust. Git's internals are actually kind of ugly if you look at them. It's basically a content-addressable filesystem with some scripting on top. But it solved the actual problem he had, which was managing kernel development. All the elegant design came later after people were already using it. He built for the problem, not for the architecture. That's why Git won and all those \"better designed\" version control systems nobody remembers lost.\n\nOr another time, built an inventory system with proper relational database design, normalized tables, foreign keys, the works. User wanted to bulk-edit 50 items at once. Couldn't do it because I'd built individual edit pages and never thought about bulk operations. They just stopped using it and went back to Excel where they could edit multiple rows. My database design was objectively better than Excel. But Excel let them do their actual job faster, so Excel won.\n\nYou'll realize pretty quick that like 80% of what you thought was important is completely irrelevant and all the boring stuff you ignored is what actually matters. Authentication, error messages that actually tell you what went wrong, handling edge cases like what if they upload a file that's too big, making sure it works on their old laptop with Chrome from 2019, having an undo button, that's the stuff that makes or breaks whether someone actually uses your thing.\n\nThis field is packed with people who started young. I've met self-taught developers who picked it up at 25 and they're way better than me at a lot of things because they focused on solving problems instead of collecting technical skills like they're achievements in a video game. There's a guy I used to work with who switched from being a chef at 28, learned to code at a bootcamp, and he's one of the best developers I know. Why? Because he spent 10 years in restaurants learning how to handle stress, communicate with difficult people, and deliver under pressure. Those skills transferred. His code isn't always the prettiest but he ships things that work and people actually **want** to use them.\n\n[continuation in the replies]",

A stupid question that gets answered is better than a stupid question that does not get asked and you remain stuck.\n\n2)when you get this idea about comparing yourself with others then instead of saying \"I might have an imposter syndrome\" then self-diagnosing yourself with it solves nothing. When a person knows more stuff than you then learn from him. When he does something better than you then ask for hints and for advice. People who are more knowledgeable than you are your opportunity not your threat. Talk with people not self-diagnose yourself with irrational stuff.\n\n3)when there are hackathons, open door days, seminars, internship offers, student job fails, then again, talk with people. Use these opportunities. Attend these events. Even when you are saying \"But I do not know anything.\" When you know nothing then you have nothing to lose but only to gain. Be proactive.\n\nFrom technical side:\n\n1)go for degree studies. Pick a university/college that is known for its CS program and apply to it. Does not have to be Harvard University or something. A local state college also does. Without a degree you'll be fighting an uphill battle. For various reasons.\n\n2)do not build calculator apps or TODO apps. Build stuff that matters. You won't be using that calculator app you made. And there is no \"But perhaps somebody might start using.\" No perhaps. If there is no need for it, then do not make it. Make things that matter. Start with yourself. Build stuff for your own use. Something related to your interests and hobbies. Perhaps something to make your daily tasks easier and faster for you. Something for your friends and family. Like this you are learning to solve real world problems not making useless template \"projects\" that everybody is copy-pasting from some tutorial.\n\n2)Leetcode and competitive programming are useless in the real world. Yes, there are companies that might ask such questions during their interview phase, but other than these, useless. Prioritize actual real life problem solving not focus on how to make an X task as fast as possible. DSA (data structure and algorithms) has its place but that place is not in Leetcode nor in competitive programming. Apply DSA in your projects, instead.",

Did I study the *library*? Nope. For one project I had I needed to do image manipulation *(straighten/skew an ID card)*, so I learnt how to do just that. Nothing else; anything that I try to memorize will end up being forgotten after a few days in a different library.\n\nMy recommendation: Learn just enough for doing the task you have at hand. Once you feel satisfied with the current project *(or abandon it like 95% of projects that are started, because finishing one is extremely hard)*, move to a different project that requires you to use a different part of the libraries you are interested in. Do not take it all at the same time, just bit by bit and motivate yourself with the project.",

        "body": "Most people responding in this thread are wrong. They’re coming from only their own personal experience and they don’t realize how much variation there actually is between people. I’ve taught software engineering to a couple hundred people. There is a spectrum for what you’re describing. I used to call it rabbit hole vs. fuzziness. Some people are comfortable moving on with just a vague understanding of a topic (these people are “fuzzy” on the details). Others can’t move on until they’ve understood every last piece (they get lost down the rabbit hole). Go too far on the spectrum in either direction and you have problems. In my experience with people learning programming, you run into way more people having problems because they’re too “fuzzy.” But you DO get some people who struggle because they consistently go too far down the rabbit hole — even when working on a specific project, even with a tight deadline. You should 100% address this. I have two tips:\n\nFirst, keep a very dynamic, organized todo list. What I mean is, before you start working on pretty much anything, you should explicitly write out high-level goals and todo items. Generally, what do you aim to accomplish? And what do you think the high-level steps are that you need to take to get there? Then as you work (and get a better sense of what needs to be done on a granular level), start to populate more specific sub todos (nested/indented below the correct parent todo). Cross todo items off as you complete them — and add more as you realize you’re missing them. You should be switching back and forth between doing the work and managing the todo list. Keep the todo list correctly organized in a hierarchy (sub todos indented below the correct parent). This process is helpful for a number of reasons, but in your case the biggest one is it helps keep you focused on the bigger picture. You’re constantly reminded how what you’re doing fits in to getting you to your initially stated goal. That way you’re working toward the goal rather than being distracted by every single thing you don’t totally understand.\n\nKeep a separate list of open questions. Writing them down can help you resist the urge to chase down all the answers right away. You can always come back to the list and answer the questions later if time permits.",

It’s like a mailbox where the OS acts as the mailman and figures out how to transport the mail. \n\nSockets don’t necessarily need an address - e.g. you could have an anonymous socket for communicating between processes on the same computer. In this case, it’s usually held in memory by the OS kernel until the socket is closed. Sockets can also be local-only, and are often bound to a file path so other processes can also go find the socket and send mail to your program.\n\nWhen you’re writing an HTTP server you *do* want an address so that others can send you mail (HTTP requests), so when you bind to a socket with a specific port you’re telling the OS “if you get any letters to this address, stick them in my mailbox.” By binding your socket to a port, you’re giving it an address that is reachable over the network. Otherwise, you couldn’t have a server that just sits and waits for requests - nobody has a way to send your program any requests!\n\nHere’s a pretty good [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/D26sUZ6DHNQ) that explains sockets simply and in better detail than many developers ever know or care to learn. \n\nIn practice, you usually just need to know that it’s a stream of data handled by the OS, very similar to reading/writing files, and how that data is handled beyond that is not really your application’s business. \n\nIt is helpful to know that sockets usually stay open for a while after you’re done with them (in case the other side has more data to send), and you’re limited in the number of sockets you can create, so it’s prudent to reuse sockets where possible rather than open new ones regularly.",

Usually the first file you open is file #3, the next one is #4, the one after that is #5, etc.\n\nIn traditional UNIX sockets, when you say \"I want to make a network connection\" the OS says \"OK, your network connection is #3.\"  Then later you can say \"I want network connection #3 to connect to server 10.234.5.67 on port 80,\" followed by \"Send the bytes 47 45 54 20 2f 0a 0a over network connection #3\".\n\nMost of today's networking systems evolved from traditional UNIX sockets and work basically the same way, even on \"non-UNIX-like\" platforms such as Windows.\n\n> Is a socket an object?\n\nThe socket is the object in the OS's internal data structures that is manipulated when you tell the OS to do something with network connection #3.\n\n> Is the socket a number?\n\nFor the purposes of asking the OS to do something with a socket, the socket is #3...but \"3 means the connection between this computer and 10.234.5.67\" is only valid in the context of a specific conversation your program had with the OS.\n\n> Is the socket a file?\n\nThe \"numbers the OS hands out, like #3 above\" are called *file descriptors*.  They were originally made for files, but were adapted for sockets.  When you want to write the word \"hello\" to a file that you previously opened and the OS told you it was file #3, you tell the OS \"Write these bytes to file descriptor #3:  68 65 6c 6c 6f\".\n\nOne interesting decision they made was that if #3 refers to a network connection instead of a file, then *you can still tell the OS to read or write bytes exactly the same way*.\n\nA socket isn't a file, but it sort-of acts like one.\n\n(UNIX domain sockets are a different beast.  I'm not going to discuss them here.)\n\n> Is a socket an IP:port combination?\n\nNo.  IP:port combination is a setting you put on the socket for outgoing connections.  For incoming connections you set a port; the OS only gives you connections from others requesting that port.  You can also optionally set an IP address for incoming connections, sometimes called a \"bind address\".  In case your machine has multiple IP addresses, the bind address tells which one you're interested in getting connections from.\n\n> when creating an HTTP server, why do we use sockets\n\n\"Why do we use sockets to make an HTTP server?\" is like asking \"Why do we use a print statement to put data on the screen?\"  Because that's what the system provides.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff going on under the hood!  For example the humble print statement could be replaced with a syscall or a BIOS interrupt or writing pixels directly to a framebuffer or [building your own graphics card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs).\n\nBut as a beginner you don't want to think too much about the underlying layers just yet; you'll just get confused and overwhelmed.  \"Use a socket for network connections\" is the networking equivalent of \"Use the print() statement to put text on the screen.\"",

If you can't think of one go browsing places on Reddit, Github, etc. and get a look at what others are making and see if you want to try to clone something or put your own twist on it.   \n\nI usually try to ask myself what needs to be done to get the project going.  Like I'd break it down into steps and go.   If you're wanting to deploy something with Docker then pick something that can run in a Docker Container, figure out how to containerize it or if it's already done try to figure out what they did to get the project container ready,  look into how the container is built, and then look at the steps needed to deploy the project somewhere.  From there you can begin to find where your knowledge gaps are and then go search for appropriate documentation, videos, etc. as you go.  \n\nIf you're having attention span issues then try to train yourself to do a little at a time and then come back.   (Or speak with some medical professionals about possible ways to help) \n\nI have used books, looking at open source code, videos when those came around, and talking with others to learn things.  From there I try to build and stop to review materials and to brainstorm on how to get around blocks.  You can use LLMs to help with learning as well, but you need a way to validate information coming from them as of now and you also need to learn how to not let it do all the work for you if your intention is to learn.   \n\nIf you're wanting to learn something try not to give up and keep at it.  Good luck on your learning journeys.",

It's the darkest now it has ever been, but I think this will now change. \n\nThere will absolutely be a correction in headcount I think. We have over-attracted through the crazy times of the dot com bubble and subsequent aftershocks and the industry became the goto for everybody who wanted a comfortable office job but didn't really know what else to do. The industry accepted it because there was enough grunt work to do and people could be absorbed but this is coming to a very sudden end. The internet business landscape is now \\*much\\* more clear, it's not being pumped full of money like it was for the first quarter of this century. In fact, most of the money that was made in that process is now going into AI development, but they already have the barons in place there. It's not the same free-for-all the early internet was, so a recession is happening now. I think we probably all need to take a moment to mourn the fact that our \"golden age\" is coming to a close. It's still, and will probably remain a respected and well compensated profession, but not the wilds it has been. \n\nIn the interview you did absolutely the right thing. I've interviewed quite a bit and the second you presented your, \"You know, I think you'll be able to get a better impression of what I can do if I show you this....\", I think you're getting very close to a yes from me for almost this alone. If, afterwards, I feel like I do have a better impression that I might have got with my own questions, and that impression is of somebody who will do a good job, then welcome to the team. I can't tell you it will land with \\*every\\* interviewer, but the goal of the meeting is to figure out if a person joining the team is for the mutual benefit, if the interviewee can legitimately help us to mutually achieve that given what they know and I don't, then, yes please.

MOOC Helsinki is gold so definitely stick with that.\n\nHere is a solid progression path with the specific skills you need for each stage.\n\n**Beginner Skills**\n\n* **Core Logic** You need to master `if` `else` statements and loops like `for` and `while` to control the flow.\n* **Data Handling** Get comfortable with `int` `double` and `String` types and using the `Scanner` class to get input from the user.\n* **OOP Basics** For things like a Bank Simulator you specifically need to understand Classes Objects and Constructors. You also need to learn Encapsulation which just means using `private` variables and `public` getter and setter methods to protect your data.\n\n**Beginner Project Ideas**\n\n* **Number Guessing Game** This is a classic for a reason. It forces you to use random number generation loops and conditional logic to tell the user if they guessed too high or too low.\n* **Console Calculator** Build a calculator that runs in the terminal. It helps you practice breaking your code into separate methods for addition subtraction multiplication and division.\n* **Simple Quiz** Create a multiple choice quiz. You will need to use arrays to store the questions and answers and a loop to cycle through them while keeping score.\n\n**What you need** You really just need a good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and you should absolutely start using Git for version control right now. \n\nGood luck and keep putting in the work!",

A CLI tool that grows features, like persistence, undo, or import and export, will teach you more than jumping straight to flashy apps. As you move up, projects that involve failure handling, like a small server that must recover from bad input or partial crashes, force you to think like an engineer instead of a syntax user. Also, not using AI for a while is a good call, but do not confuse that with avoiding documentation or reading other people’s code. Learning how systems break and how you fix them is where the real growth happens.",

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04\\_dpk&t=4239s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqjA04_dpk&t=4239s) You learn SQL, C, Python, HTML/JS/CSS, Networking, and Flask.  \n  \nGenerally, you \\*alone\\* decide what you need to know based on the problems you would like to solve. Nobody else does. The deep knowledge beyond 'checkboxes someone told you to fill' comes from your own independent learning. \n\nTo learn 'real coding', pick something in your life you want to automate, or you wish was better. That's the key. Toy projects are fine, but it is nice to make something someone can use. Say you are in a Discord server, why not make a bot that does some useful task? As you make the bot, let people test the commands, see if they identify errors.   \n  \nThe Python classes you teach to kids, what resources do they have to learn? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a pretty website with all the information related to the course? Wouldn't it be nice if they had a Leetcode style interface to do problems at your website? Wouldn't you want to tell them, \"Hey kids, look at this website \\*I made\\*, let me know if there are any problems with it?\"\n\nIs there any software you use you think is dated? \n\nAs you make these useful projects, you get a hunger for wanting to improve it incrementally. You identify the necessary technologies to learn as you make these useful projects.\n\nif you were making my website suggestion, the learning could be like this:  \n\\---\n\n1. \"i wanna make a website. how do i make a barebones site?\" -> consult youtube, perhaps watch Harvard CS50 for an HTML introduction, watch other youtubers you like. copy down the examples the lecturers give, maybe afterwards start writing your own barebones site. when you start writing, you consult documentation for intricate questions. learning generally goes: YOUTUBE VIDEO \\[brief intro\\] -> WRITE CODE -> CONSULT DOCUMENTATION | Repeat.\n\n2. \"i wish the site was pretty!\" -> learn css, watch a vid on css, put it in your site\n\n3. \"damn, this code is getting messy... maybe i need this fancy react.js format to make the webpage snappier & stop repeating myself.\" -> learn react.js, watch a video, start writing it, consult documentation as needed\n\n4. \"i wish the kids had a pretty editor they could write in... oooh what's this, monaco editor? i'll use it in my project.\"\n\n5. \"what's this tailwind css thing i've heard about? it could make making my site prettier easy, lets try it.\"\n\n6. \"hmmm... i want my site to have a backend so they can submit code.\" \\*google\\* \"oh, what's this, Judge0 is a framework that allows me to implement a judging system for the coding problems students submit?\" \"hmm... flask is good for site backends? lemme try it out!\"  \n\\---\n\nLearn by DOING... there are 'buzzwords' to know, such as: Docker, Tailwind CSS, PostgresSQL, CI/CD, Flask, Django, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn. But the main way to learn these things is writing useful software you care about",

As far as react, I fiind react to be too daunting of a skill to learn when you are just learning javascript from scratch - start a little simpler and learn how the DOM works in a website, and how you can manipulate the DOM to create dynamic effects on a web page such as responding to clicks and looking up autocomplete search results with ajax.\n\nWhat you have to understand is react is a solution to the difficulty of doing the basic DOM manipulation when programs start getting more complex, but it itself is just working with basic DOM manipulation under the hood.  When you understand what it is doing under the hood then you are able to better understand why it works the way it works.",

Strong fundamentals age well.\n\nStep 2: Build a core base first (3–4 months):\nOne programming language properly (Python / Java / JS — doesn’t matter much)\nData structures & basic problem-solving\nGit + basic Linux\nThis alone puts you ahead of many students.\n\nStep 3: Use web dev as a vehicle, not a destination.\nWeb dev isn’t bad — generic web dev is.\nBuild 2–3 small but real projects:\nCRUD app\nAuth + database\nSimple API\nNot to become a “frontend dev”, but to learn how software actually works.\n\nStep 4: Let interest emerge from doing, not thinking.\nMost people don’t “discover” interests — they develop them after building something.\nAfter that, you can branch:\nBackend / systems\nData / analytics\nDevOps / infra\nApplied AI (later, not now)\n\nImportant reality check:\nAI won’t replace developers who understand systems, trade-offs, and can build things end-to-end.

If anything it raises the bar, automating the repetitive code-monkey parts and leaving space for those who can solve problems",

System topics and real-world tradeoffs mattered more than I expected.\n\nIf there’s one thing I’d share: you don’t need to rush interviews, but doing a few earlier can be really useful. They act like a compass, showing what skills are actually worth prioritizing.\n\nEnjoy the ride. Rediscovering is already a big win.",

If you want to store more geometric data than just the points this may not be the best solution, but I think it would still work well enough.\n\nEach position in the array would represent a cross point of a longitude and a latitude line.\n\nSomething like\n```\nPoint[][][] sphere = [\n[ [], [], [] ], // Latitude 0, longitude 0,1,2\n[ [], [], [] ], // Latitude 1, longitude 0,1,2\n[ [], [], [] ]  // Latitude 2, longitude 0,1,2\n]\n```\nOf course, you would define the sphere something more like\n```\nPoint[][][] sphere = Point[3][3][1]\n```\n\nThen if you wanted to reference a specific point, it's just an array lookup.

Something that’s bitting more than you can chew can be good.

In school you don't really have a lot of time and you can't put in as much focus or effort into it as you would like. With work it's not like that; you have one thing to focus on, makes things a lot more manageable. At that point what really shines through is your persistence; persistence is the key thing in programming, at least in my eyes. I will say that it is hard to decide whether it's right for you or not. I guess the answer is, when you are doing it are you focused on it and are willing to sacrifice things for it? If yes, I think that's enough. Don't let school kill your confidence. If you are drawn to programming, that's a very good strength, you just need persistence, diligence, and curiosity to carry you further",

You should evaluate your life, what you can handle, and what you prefer. All advice will fall short and even you won't know whether staying/switching/dropping out was the best. If I had to make a similar decision now, I'd switch, but only because I lost much more time than I expected. \n\nThe mental distress is really what you should sort out  though. It doesn't necessarily go away if you quit your pursuit of programming, and may stay with you after you're done with education. Don't be afraid to consult a professional.

Sure, from one side, you'll be learning a bit less than you'd learn during your Bachelor studies as your Master studies will take less time. From the other side, you have already covered probably a lot when it comes to Databases related courses in Bachelor program. Still, a Master degree for non-CS people should teach you various topics that will be covered also in CS Bachelor program. So, you can cover that gap.\n\nI personally think that you won't get such quality from learning online. All these bootcamps and online tutorials are more like for beginners. I have checked some and they do not cover more complex topics one will learn during his university studies. They won't force you to work on your thesis project where you have to come up with something more unique than another \"X management system\" that you'd get from bootcamps. \n\nUniversity studies will also give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects in your Github. When going by online tutorials and online bootcamps your imagination will be limited. They will tell you to make a TODO app. You will make a TODO app. Nobody will use that TODO app.\n\nIf Master studies cost a lot for you then you can try some online learning and see how it works out for you. Your current career definitely will be a bonus point. But if you see that you are not landing a Junior developer or a Junior data engineer role (forget jumping into a Mid-level or into a Senior-level position) then consider going for a degree.",

Here is where Joe badly misinterprets his own thought process: “Of course!” Joe thinks. “It’s all so simple now. The key to understanding monads is that they are Like Burritos. If only I had thought of this before!” The problem, of course, is that if Joe HAD thought of this before, it wouldn’t have helped: the week of struggling through details was a necessary and integral part of forming Joe’s Burrito intuition, not a sad consequence of his failure to hit upon the idea sooner.\n\n\n\nLearning is also a good mix of strategies that are entirely general to the human species across any domain, and tactics that will work for you specifically in some specific situation. If you find some great way for you to learn concept A, it doesn't necessarily mean that it'll work for some other learner, or that it'll work as well for concept B.\n\nWhat you're asking about is general enough that we can only give very general learning advice, like [Oláfur Waage's _Learning Rust the wrong way_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL9LANLg5EA) (more about learning in general with Rust as a specific example of something to learn).",

If you're able to memorize the information and regurgitate it on command, but don't feel like you really understand what it means, then you've most likely been skipping over steps 3 and 5, meaning you're just encountering new information and trying to commit it to memory without *using* it.\n\nIf you don't understand how something works, try to write something that uses it, and as you run into issues, start Googling away to find the information that you need. If you encounter more things you don't understand while Googling up info, follow up on that as well until you feel like you actually understand what's going on.

AI will be/is important and will be/is generating this stuff super easy and quick, but it’s not quite that simple…..\n\nA few months ago I decided to dive into Identity in ASP.NET (basically built in .NET authentication) and .NET does so much of the heavy lifting. It abstracts all the details away, allowing you to just focus on plugging it in, creating your policies and then focusing on your business logic instead of infrastructure.\n\nHowever…. I sort of quickly realised, that if you don’t understand how it works internally, the abstractions don’t really help or make it any better. You still have to call the relevant methods in the relevant order, and understand what’s going on in order to get the most from it. The abstractions, just save you having to write your implementations… it’s not a substitute for understanding how it works.\n\nI see AI as the same. It’s an abstraction. We ask it to generate code, it does. That saves us time and speeds up development, but if we’re unable to understand the inner workings, we won’t be able to get the most out of it. \n\nThe best way to learn is to build. So build these solutions yourself, and understand how these work not because you’ll be building these yourself in the future but because it is imperative you understand the inner workings to get the most from AI generated code….",

If you don’t know what’s happening under the hood, you can’t really use them well — whether it’s [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Identity or AI-generated code.\n\nMy struggle is more about the next step after that understanding. Even if I go deep, build things properly, and really learn how they work internally — will there actually be an employer willing to take a chance on someone without formal work experience? In many cases, resumes are filtered out automatically before a human even sees them if you don’t have 3–5 years of relevant experience.\n\nPart of me knows that building something unique, finishing a real project, and showing it publicly might be a way to bypass the traditional job search. That also takes time, just in a different way. And realistically, 6 months isn’t a long time at all — maybe even 1–2 years isn’t.\n\nSo for now, I’m trying to treat programming as a serious hobby and long-term investment, and see where it leads. No matter how the industry changes, I still believe that understanding programming fundamentals will become almost mandatory, and once you have that, switching languages or technologies is much easier.\n\nI’ve also been living outside my home country for 6 years, and while things are generally fine, being a foreigner adds extra friction to everything — internships, official employment, even simple life stuff. I just hope that all these difficulties add up to something meaningful in the long run.",

However, just because theres many job listings for particular languages doesn't mean its always easier getting a job. Javascript is the most in demand (going by listings in the U.S.), but there are also many more Javascript developers than any other language and can be very competitive depending on where you live. \n\nYou'll often find that knowing a niche language and a niche industry/application will in many cases make it easier to get a job and you will be paid better for it, the mean salary for Rust dev's is like 150,000, almost 50% more than a Javascript developer. In my country, some of the best paying and hardest to fill dev roles are for COBOL developers because COBOL is the ancient backbone of a lot of finance and government systems. \n\nWhat you learn to build is also probably more important than the language itself (although these are often related). For instance, python developers are in demand because of the boom in machine learning and AI, if you learn python but don't develop skills in machine learning or AI you're going to find relatively fewer jobs available to you.",

From a CX angle, that gap between theory and reality is exactly where most frustration lives. Keeping the project small and useful is smart because it keeps momentum without overwhelming you. Stick with it, that discomfort you are noticing is usually a sign you are learning the right things.",

I use AI at work and half of the time it underperforms. Even IF we talk about the future even then the AI, as we know right now, will have similar limitations. AI is not actually \"intelligence\". It does not think. The current LLM models just process your textual input and then calculate which words should be most likely for the output. They do not analyze the whole picture but have a tunnel vision.\n\nSo, having said that, go for programming if you want to do that. \n\nFirst, learn to make stuff without AI. Then, when you can already build stuff on your own, learn to use the AI (and also how to NOT use the AI). AI should not fill a gap of knowledge, for you, but it should just speed up these tasks that you would know how to do on your own as well. Like this you'll be able to assess the output that AI gives. If you use AI as something to fill gaps in your knowledge then you are unable to review its output.",

They don't understand what's going wrong, so they start a new chat and go from there until it starts to go wrong. AI also expects that the path to the goal is known, but it's not and technical debt grows.\n\nThis is the AI that non-developers are so impressed by, they're blind to how bad it is. They don't understand how having AI add patches creates difficult to maintain code, they don't understand that it's a bad idea for AI to play chinese whispers with themself as they rewrite a codebase, they don't understand that AI can't actually think and strategise and plan for the future.\n\nThe AI that programmers are impressed by is it's like having access to a senior developer who isn't tired of you. You can talk strategy with it so that you can enter new fields, like you can go to AI and ask \"I'm looking for a high level overview, no code, use and explain jargon, and provide multiple options.

        "body": "IT is more like software development's somewhat less-competitive, more reliable cousin in terms of careers. It's one of those (mostly) low-pressure desk jobs that you do to make a stable income while you do what you really want to do in your free time. That said, it will contribute close to nothing when it comes to helping a career in game dev. The knowledge will 100% be helpful, but it won't help you get a programming job unless it's ultra entry-level (and 99% of game dev jobs aren't entry level).\n\nIt is an excellent job to have for paying bills though, and depending on the environment/level of independence, it can give you lots of time both at home and at your desk to learn programming independently. As long as I get my tasks done each day, I can pretty safely bring my laptop to the office to study/work on my own projects most of the time.\n\nI will say though, \"building a multiplayer online game\" is a very, very ambitious goal shared by many aspiring game devs who don't know what it actually takes to do something like that. To the point that it's a known red flag/meme if a dev tries to crowdfund an MMO. If you intend to make games by yourself, your scope needs to be reduced \\*drastically,\\* and you'll not only learn more but be more satisfied with the process if you focus on making small, simple games. If you want to make something bigger, then find friends/collaborators to work with-- particularly people who are willing to work on something for the fun of it instead of trying to turn it into a business. It's very, very difficult to \"start a game studio,\" so you want to start by making games for fun and learning to enjoy the process of making them before you \\*ever\\* think about monetizing. Basically don't think about monetizing/turning it into a business until you \\*have business.\\* And if you want to get into programming for an existing studio, be prepared to spend years and years doing contract work to build a reputation, and to navigate a highly competitive field where you could be let go at a drop of a hat.\n\nMake small games. Fail faster. Fall in love with actually making the games, not the idea of making games. And know that game dev, especially solo, is a very multidisciplinary endeavor where each discipline within it can take years and years to master. Pace yourself.\n\nSource: IT person of 6 years who gave up game dev because I found out I don't actually enjoy the process of programming after even more years of trying and going to school for it. What I discovered was that I actually wanted to tell stories, and I didn't need to force myself to be a programmer/artist/designer/writer/composer unicorn to do that. I could just write stories instead.",

You need basic ones, and more specialised ones for programming certain things (e.g. writing a networking protocol will require you understand networking), but they diverge very early on into generalist vs specialist. IT generally isn't really a path to (games) programming work per se, it's more a path to help desk, ops, sysadmin, database admin, infra, devOps, etc. If you want to work as a programmer, providing you can already operate a computer to do basic file admin, web browsing, text editing, etc., you should just start programming right away and focus on that. If you need to earn money right away and IT jobs are all you can get right now then it's better than starving... We very much need IT people to keep the software we write up and running.\n\nFor games and multiplayer online games specifically you'll need to have good overall programming skills and pattern awareness to implement the gameplay logic. Plus OS awareness, networking, database design/implementation for the online part. Plus a good understanding of 2D or 3D graphics as applicable for the rendering part. Then there's all the art...\n\nIf you use a modern game engine you can mostly get away with just doing the art and use their abstractions for most of the other stuff. Still very much need to know most of the above though, just not as much as if you were to implement it.\n\n\"multiplayer online game\" is very ambitious, so a very rough idea of what your expectations starting from zero should be: A small/toy 2D game you could build within the next few months. A very simple 3D one within the next year. A moderately complicated multiplayer online game within the next *decade*.",

Or I'd have an idea for something, and I'd follow different tutorials for each part of it (e.g. one tutorial on how to connect to an API, another tutorial on how to save data in a db, then put the pieces together to build a scraper). \n\n  \nNow that I'm much more experienced... I do exactly the same thing. I built a tool recently for orchestrating restic backups in kubernetes using CRDs and it was the same process. Follow a tutorial to read/write kubernetes objects from python, follow a tutorial on installing CRDs in a cluster, etc.. put the pieces together and go. The only difference I suppose is more often than not the \"tutorials\" I'm following are docs pages instead of explicit tutorials, or sometimes a short \"how to\" from an LLM.

        "body": "First off coding is work, it doesn't produce adrenaline but rather headaches, drowsiness and fatigue. \n\nLets not 3 Mile Island the world here, C or Python, should not cause somebody to feel slow and dumb.    So the first thing that comes to mind right now is to choose one, which if you are learning is C.\n\nNot to date myself but I first got interested in computers before the S100 bus debuted, so maybe 13 or 14 at the time.   For years all I could do is read Byte and when I could find it Dr.Dobbs.   It wasn't until the Vic-20 came out, 1980, that I could actually afford a computer and that ViC 20 was barely usable.   So for a good number of years my interests where satisfied by reading what I could.\n\nIt actually took me a while to get to college and that was where my first formal training started and unlearning the VIC 20.   At the time the school had Sun workstations so that was like a step into the future.   So what motivated me, well the place I was working for was paying the bill.    Since I didn't want to go hungry anymore it was a good idea to keep working.   \n\nNow that said not a programmer per say but use the knowledge almost everyday before working.   So staying sharp with software was important.   However that required me to keep writing code, sometimes toy programs and in a couple of cases finding bugs for an Open Source project.   At work I had some focus on CNC and PLC controllers which is always a challenge, beyond spread sheets and Python code.    So even if work was NOT as a programmer, I was heavily involved in automation.\n\nNow that I'm retired the motivations are different.   For example to keep track of my investments, I have spread sheets of stock portfolios.   Now on the surface one might laugh at spreadsheet programming because it looks to be simple but I'd have to say there is as much depth there as their is with Python.   The motivation is that I need to keep this organized and understand where my next meal is coming from.\n\nIf you want to stay sharp though, who doesn't and frankly at this age you work at it, yo need to do more than stock portfolio management.   To that end I keep a couple of hobbies going and use those interest to drive software development there.   This is the key, use it or loose it.   If you want to have any usable skill at all with respect to software you need to stay in the game.  Motivation is sometimes hard to come by or even keep, so you really need to integrate programming into projects that you are interested in.   Programming itself can also be a motivator, simply learning about new languages can motivate some.   I didn't even know that C3 existed until yesterday for example and it actually looks interesting.   For most of us though we need that outside pull to start a new project.\n\nLets say you are into bicycling and those little trip computers look to be so handy.    That lust could be the motivator for a DIY trip computer for a bicycle.   Going DIY means it can work exactly as you expect, in every way it is yours.   The challenges are the motivator.   What are those challenges (just a few):\n\n1. Embedded project.\n2. Battery operated (maybe solar) and thus needs to be efficient\n3. Small custom Printed Circuit board.\n4. Limited screen size and I'o possibilities.\n5. Case size limitations.\n6. Limited program and data space.\n7. Limited programming languages due to microprocessor.\n\nIn any event the project becomes the challenge.",

So if you want to use the term \"functionally retarded\", you've come to the right person.

Things like pointers are tricky for beginners, but those are tricky for beginners regardless of whether they're good at math or not.\n\nModulus is something that will come up in any programming language. It's usually used to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number. It's pretty easy, conceptually. Divide two numbers. Discard everything before the decimal point. That's modulo. Like, 9 % 3: That's 9/3, or 3.0. Discard the 3. You're left with 0.0. It's evenly divisible.\n\nNow do the same thing, 9 % 4. I'm pulling out my calculator for this part. That's 2.25.

If you build a game using raylib, you'll need to learn quite a bit. If you encounter difficult maths problems, someone has probably figured out how to do it so you don't have to work from scratch, and there are plenty of good resources online to learn the harder stuff. You'll also naturally develop your math skills as you progress as a programmer.\n\nI will now offer rambling unsolicited advice on learning math based on my own experience. I believe many people that believe they are bad at math are encountering two related problems that make it difficult to identify or articulate why learning math is harder for them relative to others. The first is missing prerequisite knowledge, the second is study methods that do not work or are inappropriate for them. The exception is for some cases where neurodevelopment and learning disabilities create hard limits, however in many cases these can be managed by adjusting your study methods (as was the case for me, as I have ADHD and dyspraxia).\n\nLearning math and learning to program are very similar in that there are foundational concepts/skills you need to learn or develop in a particular order before you can learn more advanced content. When I got to university I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge; elementary stuff that compounded from my early education through to high school (which I ended up dropping out of). This conceptual debt made it harder to progress over time, while others only had to learn one new concept to solve a problem, I might need 5 or 6, which snowballs very quickly. This also made the traditional lecture -> tutorial -> homework learning pipeline ineffective because it assumes you have certain prerequisite knowledge and they cant/won't help you identify specific concepts needed to catch up.\n\nI found it much easier to learn at home following youtube videos (I highly recommend organic chemistry tutor), khan academy lessons, resources on the r/learnmath mega thread, or good textbooks with clear progression and references to related previous topics. These formats are easy to pause if something is too advanced, giving you the opportunity to go learn prerequisites as you need, before returning to the original problem. To practice I would follow videos of worked examples, print 50-100 problems to work through, then mark my own answers to find if/where I was going wrong. I'd also return to reattempt packets of questions later. Now I have the ability to not only deal with difficult math problems day to day, but when I can't I have learned how to learn to solve things. Good luck, and apologies for the wall of text!\n\nTLDR; Don't worry. You probably aren't bad at math, missing prerequisite knowledge and/or study methods that don't work for you might be falsely giving you that impression.",

If you miss one of those concepts or don't fully understand it, you're screwed.  The concepts taken slowly aren't that bad.  Don't be afraid of taking a step back and reviewing what you thought already knew.\n\nMath is a lot like programming in this respect.  There's parroting a concept and then there's applying a concept.  Understanding programming ideas and actually writing a program are two very different things.\n\n> Is C a language I should keep trying to learn\n\nSure.  It's fun.  That said, it's one of the more primitive options.  If you feel another language has something more to offer you, that's your call.  However, you're learning both programming and a programming language.  The language is not the hard part.  Once you wrap your head around programming, the language is just an implementation detail.\n\n> or would it be wise to simply use another language that isnt as math intensive?\n\nThere isn't one.  The math you run into in C is to be found in any other language.  Some languages will let you get away with being more sloppy, but I'm not sure if that's better or worse for you.\n\n> I don't have very little foundation with mathematics beyond basic +,-,*,/ problems.\n\nAgain, you generally don't need it.  Also, unlike on a math quiz, you have a computer to check your work.  You might think the formula you wrote will offer a certain result, but the computer will let you know if you're right.\n\n> I'm struggling pretty hard to get through the math related portions.\n\nI'm the programmer who sucks at math, which is why I tend to respond verbosely to things like this.  Programming really doesn't require math.  A mathematician will say it's all math, but that's their problem.  Programming requires a way of thinking and, amusingly, some folks who are very good at math kind of suck at it.  I hate seeing folks with math frustration allow that to gatekeep their possible programming glory.\n\nI got a minor in computer science, where the only higher math course required was calculus 1.  I took it twice, passed the second time.  I also tutored people in programming.  One student, a science major, had her 4.0 in jeopardy because of a basic programming class she thought would be easy.  Another student I helped out was my former calc professor, trying to learn programming.\n\nBeing science or math oriented doesn't equate to programming success.  Some of the worst code I've ever seen comes from engineers; folks who know and use far more math than most mortals.\n\nI mayn't be great at math, but I can program and have done it professionally for decades.

All your current experience plus a reasonable amount of software development knowledge should open up some exciting doors.\n\nMy second observation that you are more than welcome to ignore is that, based on your comment at least, you might be at risk of spreading yourself quite thin. Python alone is going to open up hundreds of rabbit holes you can dive into, web development is fantastic to have an understanding of especially if you want to hook your python scripts up to services or APIs but again is a bit of a behemoth, and ethical hacking is of course a huge field in itself.\n\nI'm not trying to dissuade you from any of it, it sounds like you find loads of it interesting which is fantastic, but focusing on one at a time to a reasonable depth and making sure to cover your fundamentals would be my advice. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is a great course / website / book if you want to start seeing some results early on. LLMs can be great personal tutors too if you're happy to be patient with them when they lose the plot, but they're pretty double edged in that they will also rob you of learning opportunities if you lean on them too heavily.\n\nHope some of that helps!",

Inheritance promotes this naturally, composition can as well through factory methods if designed well. \n\nSo, assuming the calling code doesn't know or need to know the difference, we can look at the tradeoffs in the interface implementation.\n\nIt is not clear to me how composition supports sharing of common behavior. It seems like it would require complex rules for the \"base\" class to execute or skip common behavior based on instructions from the \"derived\" class. This adds complexity to the delegation mechanism and reduces flexibility.  \n\nIn this simple C++ example, `derived::foo()` has flexibility to add to or completely replace `base::foo()`. It also has access to shared behavior in `base::bar()` at any time. I am not sure how this flexibility can be supported with composition - would love to learn more about that.\n\nFurthermore, this inherent flexibility of inheritance supports unique implementation requirements. I believe with composition that must be designed into the equivalent \"base\" class from the start. It is impossible to think of all the odd requirements clients may have in the future.\n\n    class base\n    {\n    public:\n      virtual void foo();\n    \n    protected:\n      void bar();\n    };\n    \n    class derived : public base\n    {\n    public:\n      virtual void foo() override\n      {\n        // derived::foo() can choose to add to, or entirely replace base::foo()\n        // derived also has access to base::bar() at any time.\n      }\n    };\n\nIn the end, it is best to avoid \"this or that\" thinking. Both composition and inheritance are tools available to be used when they make most sense. I get the idea there are a few problems with inheritance from people using it incorrectly and they look for ways to not use it all, even if it means bending over backwards.",

Because I used to have the same questions when starting out years ago.\n\nDicts and classes are different, but both can be made to do similar things (ie composing objects from scalar types).\n\nThe difference is that, in most languages, classes provide neat abstraction features, like inheritance and methods, and greater control about how you can use it.\n\nClasses can be defined, shaped, and optimized however you like, while dictionaries will just be dictionaries which is optimized for doing 1 thing that is O(1) access time with acceptable storage for the key space.\n\nOn optimizations, let’s say you’re modeling a square rectangles. With class, you can just define it as having 2 fields like this\n\n{ width: int, height: int }\n\nEvery instance of this rectangle object will cost you 2 ints of memory space. If the int is 64 bit, then your rectangle is just 8+8=16 bytes each, and 10 rectangles will cost you 160 bytes.\n\nIf you instead wish to use a hash map/dictionary to represent the rectangle with int width and height, that dictionary is probably using much more space than just 2 ints because how hash maps are implemented. If you have multiple such rectangles, it’ll waste more space pretty quickly due to having to initialize mostly empty map to store 2 values. Every insert incur further work as the program needs to hash and potentially resize the haystack or change hash function to fit more keys.\n\nAnother thing to think about is a dictionary is just a hash map, so its access time is slower than just field access (it has to compute the hash value of the key, whereas with class, the location of the field value within the object is already known).\n\nOh and another thing is with dict/map, you don’t know if you’re gonna have a value at that key unless, you know, you access it. This happens at runtime. With classes, it’s a compile error if you’re accessing the field that does not exist.\n\nLast thing is maintainability and DX - with maps, if you decide to change the “key” you’ve been using pervasively like class fields, you’re gonna have to change all occurrences of those string keys. Whereas with classes, your LSP might support renaming that field with just a press on F2. This is very useful when the codebase is huge.\n\nUse maps to store values when each key is considered sibling or equivalent to each other, e.g. mapping post codes to region names. Think of it like dynamic lists/arrays, but with key access instead of index access.\n\nUse classes to encapsulate more complex objects that you want to extend with methods and your own initialization rules, etc.\n\nI’m sure you’ll get it the more complex your program becomes.",

Python is so dynamic it doesn’t really matter, but having a statically typed compiler at your disposal catches a LOT of errors in code. It’s one of the things I actually love hate about say JavaScript. Everything is basically just a dictionary essentially (every object you can just ref properties by saying obj[“prop”]). \n\nTo the point that some people want the flexibility of dynamic programming but will actually go to the effort of invoking the Rosslyn code generator to verify property names at compile time to get the benefits of both worlds. Like if you’re consuming a json file in a data dictionary you can use this feature to compile time verify property names and so forth. \n\nPersonally I hate any form of loose typing bc it’s a ticking time bomb if not for you, another developer. I also hate string literals that aren’t defined in constants and magic numbers. These will bite you or some other maintainer of the codebase if you let them litter your code.",

        "body": "So I think you are misinterpreting what a class is; a class is a language-based concept that allows you to create custom data structures that also have behavior (or member functions) attached to it.  This allows you to make ANY data structure that you want that follows the rules of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.  Classes allow a language to be called object oriented, since in object oriented programming, the focus is on creating more and more of these data structures which when declared in code are called objects, hence object oriented programming.\n\nA dictionary is a data structure.  So you can for instance create your own dictionary class implementation, though I’m sure one exists in the C# STL. \n\nSo two completely different things essentially; a class/object is a programmer-implemented data structure with associated behavior(s) attached which follows the 4 laws of Object Oriented Programming, and a dictionary is a data structure that if you really wanted to you could implement that.\n\n\nAs for your second question, explicit type declarations are very important in the programming world because they essentially allow one to know at all times a general idea of how many bytes/chunks of memory a variable is taking up, as well as help with avoiding implicit type conversions which can cause a lot of issues.  You won’t see this come up much as a beginner but the second you start working on anything that’s a bit complex, you will see why this is a big deal.  This was something that I struggled with when I started in JavaScript, as the dynamically interpreted types would lead to really odd behavior at unexpected times. \n\nThis becomes more apparent the further you get towards the hardware; python is built upon a great deal of layers to emulate natural language to its best ability, whereas in C/assembly you are dealing with extremely explicit operations that having a byte offset could cause the entire program/system to crash.  To give even more explicit control for this reason, you will later see C/C++ users will use even more strict types like uint_32 and long long or even stranger looking types to someone who has never used lower level programming languages.  Also, tbh, it just helps with readability, being able to know exactly what each type is defined as.\n\nAs far as running a script, anything dealing with Windows is gonna be a pain in the ass (I’m an arch Linux user if u can’t tell by my windows cynicism) but it’s what u gotta do since C# is .NET.  But essentially all the stuff u did in VS is just for programmer ease of mind, but really thats just an automation tool.  Hell if you want to just open up a terminal and run a script real fast all you gotta do is type \n\ndotnet run [name of program].cs \n\nAnd it will run it.  VS generates a ton of metadata files to help with the building process which is why it’s a pain in the butt to set up but once you do it will make it a little faster.\n\nAnyways do you have any other questions? I hope I explained well, I use a great deal of Java but I’m mostly a C/C++ developer so much different domain but still same concepts",

Why don’t we put everything in 1 file or 1 folder and have automatic access to code written in other files?\n\nTLDR: it’s for organizing large codebase. We can separate different concerns with namespaces.\n\nIf you have organized folders for other computer files/works, why not source code?\n\nYou probably don’t feel the need to modularize your code into modules/namespaces because your program is not yet complex enough.\n\nImagine if we work at Google, with millions of lines of code. And now you want to name something specific to some implementation, maybe you want to implement search result for a TV. There’s a very high chance the name “SearchResult” is probably used somewhere in there. Without namespaces, we must come up with new names every time we want something different, like “SearchResultMobile”, “SearchResultMobileWeb”, “SearchResultTV”, and so on\n\nWith namespaces, each names or symbols are confined to only have meaning in its namespace, so you can have mobile.SearchResult, mobile_web.SearchResult, and tv.SearchResult instead. All code relating to TV implementation will live in the namespace “tv”, not cluttering other namespaces.\n\nNamespaces help separate concerns, and the “import” part is explicit - you have to define wht and where you want to bring symbols outside of our namespace (eg folder, in Go) into scope, to avoid you running/compiling code accidentally (which might be malicious or just bugs).\n\nMy example might not be good, but at least it demonstrates the point.\n\nMy tips: Whenever you are asking why programmers do stuff the way they do, imagine you have to work with big ass codebase (100k LoC++) with incompetent coworkers, and maintain that code for years, then you’ll understand why.",

You should probably start there.\n\nThat being said, about programming itself: I think the first step is to really understand why you want to program. Is it because it fits the idea of a \"better you\"? Do you want it to be your profession? Do you want to impress people? Do you need tools to make your life easier? You need to spend time thinking about that, otherwise you will program for a whole lot of bad reasons. And programming is probably one of the less gratifying crafts for people who do it for bad reasons, because you're inside, on a chair, you encounter a lot of problems, you create a lot of complexity; it can easily make you feel like a fraud, dumb, and make you realize the human brain is very ill-equipped when it comes to computing. In a way, that can be depressing.\n\nOnce you understand your reasons and don't lie to yourself, I really think you should understand your learning profile. Some people like the bottom up approach (like [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), [Build Your Own Lisp](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/), things like that), other like high-level stuff. Some people like to study pure algorithms, others need to build tools. Some like \"boring languages\" (boring can be good) like Python, Go or Gleam, others need more exotic languages like Haskell, Clojure, etc. Some people like to read books linearly, others explore and start 10 projects in parallel. The point is to understand how you learn the best.\n\nOnce you do, please pick preferably one technology (language) that fit your personality and let it be your main mode of expression for a while (probably years if you're serious). Don't rush. See [this page](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html). Understand the language and the ecosystem. Become good at it. Mastery plays a strong role in pleasure and contribute to create that wholesome \"flow\" feeling.\n\nAnd please don't be too hard on yourself, don't seek perfection. Avoid burnout. We all need to have some unstructured fun sometimes. Kanban boards are good, but not very fun, especially if you just sit in front of them. Don't overthink or become fixated on \"protocols\"; just do stuff without producing artefacts - no notes, no plan, no Git repo; avoid paralysis. You can even delete your code afterwards, that's ok. The absence of metrics or artefacts doesn't mean there's no improvement. It's a bit like learning a foreign language: even if the only thing you do is speak with people, you will improve, sometimes way faster than people who use elaborate notes, methods and tools.",

I love chess, so I spend a lot of time running and fine tuning a ridiculously complex model to play chess. I wanted to learn rust, so I made a cookie clicker clone in my downtime (and during some of those meetings). I wanted some side money, so i made an insurance navigation tool for small single owner clinics.\n\nThe wonder of programming is: you can build just about anything, make some of it public. It's not impossible to get a job in tech while you're still in school.\n\nWorth noting: I have no formal education in CS.",

If you don't need dynamic content, just go down a static site generation route with astro, eleventy, nuxt, next.js/nextra etc and deploy it for no money with github pages, cloud flair pages, or vercel or other similar services.\n\nFor desktop applications, it depends what exactly you want to do. If you want to make a productivity app, chat app or monitoring dashboard for instance, electron is a good choice because you are already familiar with JS/HTML/CSS and its got a well supported ecosystem. If you want it to be lighter weight but stick with javascript, you can use NodeGUI/ReactGUI, although theres less plugins and a smaller community. If it's anything where you need performance or deeper access to windows APIs, it's probably got to be C# or occasionally C++.

It’s overkill for many personal projects, but is the standard for enterprise software in my experience. I also just think it’s nice to have a server for the UI for a million reasons, even just to have things like environment variables without rebuilding.

Repeat building more core understanding and building bigger projects.\n\nDuring this process try to step back and identify weak areas and focus on them.\n\nKey advice, don’t get hung up on remembering syntax and language specifics, that can be looked up while coding.

Look up Bob Tabor and go through his javascript course.  It is as easy as it gets, but you won't be a developer when you're done.  What it will do is instill concepts and maybe give you some confidence, because when you are done, you'll realize, Bob Tabor makes it look easy.  But he's slow and methodical.\n2. Start on a free and easy platform like w3schools.  They are constantly adding content and I have full access (got it on sale), so I can pretty much do anything, learn new skills as they are added, get certifications.\n3. Lookup roadmaps and game plan all this\n4. Eventually I think you need to consider paying to learn, on a platform or in college.\n5. You might look into Team Treehouse\n\nI have used Team Treehouse's platform and they have what's called tech degrees.  Some companies have heard of them and people have gotten jobs after completing their curriculum.  But it's no guarantee.  Thing is, without something reputable on your resume, you won't get a job, so if you're learning for fun, great, if you're looking for a career, well, just go on indeed or elsehwhere and see how many jobs there are for inexperienced engineers and look at the requirements.  Nearly all require a degree, and nearly all are using ATSs to scan resumes, so no degree means, resume is dragged to trash bin.  Self-taught is alright, but you won't save yourself time, and you should think about paid school, just because that's the smart route.  Employers trust Professors, not youtube instructors.  I mean, it's okay to be home-schooled, but I'll tell ya, you may still be studying in 6 years on your own.\n\nSo that's my recommendation for you.  Have some goals.  Lookup roadmaps.  Game plan.\n\nHonestly, you should consider a different career, like delivering pizzas.   Something that's less resourceful than building code.  Dreams die when reality hits.  None of this is easy.  If you use Tabor and w3schools, maybe they instill the confidence for you to move onto harder learning, because that's beginning stuff, and you need to get into intermediate and advanced concepts and learn far more than HTML/CSS/JS to get a job (or to show anyone you're serious).   My guess is, you'll give up like everyone else.   But if you are driven and surprise us all, please check in with progress reports.   Use all the doubters as your motivation.\n\nRemember, failure is not only an option, it's expected.",

If you have trouble with this start really small. Put an input box on the page to enter a transaction. Try to get the transaction into the database. Try to display a transaction. Then start adding features one by one from there. I would do authentication later as I think it can be complicated to start with.",

You can write automated tests to test your code, and only merge into main if those pass. For a small project you might just think \"whatever\" but a big project this is very very useful.\n\nLog viewer looks fine - but path to log is hard coded in. What you should do is change it to take command line arguments, for the path and the different options it presents the user with.\n\nLook at some code that accepts and parses command line arguments - You want to use this mechanism if possible. Consider this: if you want that interactive aspect where it asks you to pick an option and then you pick one, you can still have that if you use command line args, but you'd wrap it in a shell script (or batch file on windows). You don't really want to restrict any tool you write to interactively ask the user for input, when all user input it requires can be given up front as command line args.",

Low level stuff, like C++ with Allegro or SDL or SFML. Or Java/C# with no engine (this is how minecraft or factorio got made). This will really get your gears turning, but you will have to do everything yourself. You learn a lot, but slow progress.\n2. Unity (or Godot). Faster results, but a lot of complexity gets hidden away and you learn more about the specific engine and less about programming.\n3. Maybe something web based? I hear you can target webassembly with nearly anything nowadays, I'm sure you can make a roadmap from that.",

Now about the tips:\n\n-do not implement stuff until you fully understand the logic behind it. Its really hard to debug a physics engine if you dont know how the state is supposed to look at each step of the process. (If you have to make the calculations by hand for some test cases, then do it, its slow but it helps a lot with debugging)\n\n-get yourself the best way of debugging you can. Something that lets you visualize stuff like the vertices, lines, bodies, variables, etc. Do not debug by guessing whats happening.\n\n-start small, make you engine by breaking it down into its smallest parts and making sure each small part works and connects easily to the rest of the code (like legos). Using assertions helps but im not sure the general opinion on assertions.\n\n-dont be against looking at the industry standard solutions. For example, if you are dealing with colision detection, trying to make your own version instead of just looking up the already existing algorithms (aabb, gjk, sat) is most likely going to take you longer and give you a worst result. The algorithms that already exist where created by really smart people with a lot of math and programming knowledge and, unless your use case is really strange, its probably better than anything most people could come up with.\n\nLastly, seriously, this is a humongous task, you should only make a physics engine if you either\n\n-find it fun\n-want to learn\n-your use case truly cant use any existing engine",

A photo of a street fair and a charcoal portrait aren’t going to have the some complexity of palette. But if you accept that it has edge cases, and are fine with how it looks on a nice diverse set of test data, then _k_-means is probably a reasonable choice.\n\nColor space conversion is very wise. Straight lines in sRGB (the default color space in 95% of situations) are not, in general, perceptually uniform. The first image [here](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/perceptually-uniform-color-spaces/) is a nice illustration of that. There are a few computationally simple but roughly perceptually uniform colorspaces that make much better choices. The page I linked recommends HSLuv. Personally, I prefer [oklab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space); I’ve also heard good things about [Jzazbz](https://observablehq.com/@jrus/jzazbz), and there are a handful of others. All have their strengths and weaknesses. But almost anything will be better than sRGB for this purpose.\n\nBe cautious of color spaces that are just called HSV, LAB, etc., because both those terms are more like categories than specific spaces. The simpler ones are merely new coordinate systems for sRGB, which will not solve anything.",

Just picking something solely for the reason that it's familiar is poor reasoning for anything other than personal hobby projects that will never end up on someone elses computer. It's not subjective; languages makes different trade-offs, and specifically JS and Python trade off basically everything just to have a simple syntax which is not something that you want in a financial application or any long-term project where you expect a lot of changes and new feature requirements\n\nI was involved in a buyout of a company where the code base was Python. They went bankrupt because their solution ended up costing way more money than they could possibly hope to make. Even just for the infrastructure. Each transaction has a set price, and if the cost per transaction is higher than what customers are willing to pay, then that's game over. A lot of companies go bankrupt this way, it's just not talked about because it's depressing",

A more appropriate denomination for the technology would be pseudo intelligence! It generates a lot of slop and then takes that slop as input to generate even more slop! It takes human experience to know what is efficient and what is not. AI can still be a useful tool but you still have to learn how to drive it!",

The FAQ has plenty of options. If you're starting from scratch you need to learn to code before you can start learning AI. Python is perhaps a good place to start because it's one of the main languages used to train AI models these days - certainly not the only thing you'll need, but a good starting point.\n\nOne good course is: [https://programming-25.mooc.fi/](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/)\n\nBasically there are plenty of excellent free courses on how to code, and there's nothing stopping you from learning to code and building stuff - including AI - completely on your own.\n\nTo get a career in the field, though, you generally need either a college degree, or somehow you need to prove your skill and experience without one, which is possible but quite difficult.",

You will need a different one depending on the situation. Good algorithms deal with internals, like salt, for you. Salts are important, so identical passwords don't produce identical hashes and to make attacks using procomputed hash databases harder. If you store a password, you usally store the salt and the salted hash in the same DB, so when the user tells you their password, you can put \"salt.password\" into the hash and compare to the DB.\n\nPasswords should not be transmitted in clear text, no. I would suggest making a REST server where you gan login using the password and that only accepts HTTPS, so the entire communication is encrypted, so no chance someone reads the password. The server gives a JWT back to the client, which is basically a string that says \"whoever has this token is logged in as Backson and can execute commands as him until 21:35 UTC, signed, the server\". The client can send that together with a request (also encrypted) so the server can check the request, check that the JWT is valid and contains a claim that allows that action, and if everything is in order can execute the command.\n\nGenerally, you can make your own server that is reasonably secure if you follow some best practices, but if you make a mistake you open the door for exploits and lawsuits. Just as a hint: storing peoples emails is illegal in the EU and many other countries unless you follow very strict rules, and losing peoples email combined with other data (god forbid any passwords) you can get into deep trouble.",

I once learned under a professor who said, if you don't understand something, figure it out, and the reason is everything in coding is a building block.  If you don't understand something now, it's only going to get worse when you need to apply such later on.\n\nThe reason I ask about college is today's job market is hell.  The biggest thing are ATSs, like workday ATS.  They are recruiters for a lot of companies and these days they're expecting applicants to create a profile for every damned job, and it sucks.  Basically, they'll scan your resume for keywords, and without a degree, or experience in lieu of, your resume won't move onto the next stage.  If you look all over reddit, you'll hear stories of people applying for hundreds of jobs, horror stories about being over-qualified.   I don't want to ramble, but without a degree, you're going to find it hard to get an interview.  You'll need connections.   I mean, get a linkedIn account and start building your network with students, professors, anyone who can vouch for you and your skillset.   Upload everything to github.   Work on a profile website as you progress and incorporate your skills there.\n\nAnyway, good luck to ya, but my advice is get a college degree.  With the learning you're doing, you could enroll in college and maybe bypass some prerequisites.",

One company we worked with had a NSFW mode on their site, so I usually worked with that toggled on whenever it was possible. Otherwise, browser extensions can also be useful to blur/black out images as-needed, and on staging sites where we did a lot of our dev work we wouldn't test with actual NSFW content, and instead use whatever bland imagery/videos we had on-hand. This actually works out better in most cases; If you're troubleshooting compression issues on UGC, it can be handy to test with specific images/videos so you can see differences in compression in a more controlled format.\n\nNow, when troubleshooting production problems? Yeah, sometimes you can't avoid seeing some.. Stuff, and even if whatever it is \\_is\\_ your kink, you're there to work, not jack off (especially if it's a production issue that's costing the business money).\n\nGiven I primarily do front-end work, the hardest part for me can be focusing on the issues no matter what is being displayed front-end center..

We had to dig deep into how to prevent the presence of these bots and taking down their posts and deleting everything in short notice before they'd shut down the whole forum. Unfortunately vBulletin didn't have many tools at the time to recognize these posts like modern online community sites do, so we had to implement this from scratch (with the help of a group of students from a local university one of the cofounders of the forum was tutoring their thesis)",

You’ll have to change careers if you need to now. When things recover, they’re going to hire new grads, not older grads who haven’t worked and been sidelined for years. My best advice is to take those super lowball offers from crappy companies, as the experience you’ll get will be much more valuable than the actual salary you’ll earn.

I got fired from my first job for poor performance and had a new one lined up a month later. Interviews were a breeze compared to today. A simple phone screening, and a single 2-4 hour in person round. Maybe half the interviews I did involved some light whiteboarding.\n\nIn 2006 I decided I wanted to live a different place and started interviewing for new opportunities. It was so easy to get offers. In March 2006 I had three offers to choose from after interviewing over a span of a couple months. I choose poorly and so in August I started interviewing again. And again, I ended up with three offers to choose from by the end of September.\n\nIn 2008-2010, like 60% of developers at my company were laid off. I barely missed the cut because I got lucky and transferred to a strategic project just before my old team got decimated. But everyone I kept in touch with found a new development job within a few months at most.\n\nIn 2018 I got laid off and had two job offers within a month. Interviews were a little more challenging than they had been in 2006 but still stupid easy compared to today. \n\nThings seem to have become so much more cutthroat since then.

        "body": "I dropped out of school in Jan 2000 as I was offered stock options for AutoDesk’s web start up. The first crash happened 2 months later. I’ve worked steadily since then in the industry. \n\nThe **2000** one was wildly different because we didn’t communicate well on a global scale at that point. Prior to the crash, I heard stories of people making it rich in tech, but generally tech wasn’t all that well respected. The average person wasn’t using the internet for a ton. My out of college salary was 38k if I remember correctly. The prediction was the options I got would be worth 350k, which was more money than I’d ever dreamed of. (Spoiler: They were worth 0). \n\nThe crash happened, the company failed, people were laid off. That part was similar to now. Everyone was just waiting for it to be their turn, comparing themselves to their peers. Fearful. \n\nI eventually took a job working for the government for 34k. Getting a job was hard. There was a fear that this internet thing was just a fad and we’d struggle to get pretty mediocre pay. Still, I wasn’t super nervous. I got into it for engineering and if all I did was write C++ Windows apps forever, that was fine at the time. For me, things started returning to normal in \\~2004 when my original company had been sold and asked me to come back for 63k / year. I took the job and worked there until 2012.\n\nBy the **2006** crash I felt more like a mid level engineer. The *economy* felt bad, but in my corner of the world it felt like everyone knew tech was the future. Things were still optimistic for me. There were still layoff fears, but we didn’t really have any and my company was pretty stable. \n\nWhat feels different to me this time? It’s been an employees market for a long time and that’s changing. I know so many people who have made more than your average doctors do. Hell, I do and I’m a college dropout. It feels to me like this could be a huge realignment if it continues. \n\nHow long do I think it will last? My personal, uneducated guess is that companies will shift back to wanting engineers. At some point they’ll realize the tools can multiply their productivity (Not replace it) and at that point they’ll want more people and produce more faster. I think this will come in the next 2-3 years likely? At the same time, I think some damage here has been done. You need a job more than it needs you and I think it could take a long time for that to shift back completely (If it ever does). I don’t actually thing we’ll see the boom at the level of \\~2018. Or at least I won’t. Maybe you will!\n\nIn the early 2000s I saw a ton of people who got into software to “Get rich quickly”. They took an online course and called themselves web developers because they could “Save as HTML” in word. A lot of them shifted real estate agents or other jobs. I think we’ll see the bottom of the industry drop out like that again. \n\nWhat helped me survive? Uh. I’m a hard worker. Probably a bit of a boomer take (I’m Gen X), but I’ve always been very professional. I saw so much shit that I wouldn’t pull during the late 2010 boom era. Don’t get entitled. Don’t be a pain in your bosses butt. \n\nEntitled things: Complaining about a company offering only vegetarian food on certain days of the week. Someone had a hissy fit at my company when they told employees they could no longer take home entire boxes of Snickers after work. New engineers turning their nose up at 200k at FAANG right out of college.",

I ended up with only 4 interviews:\n- Macromedia. They owned Flash and Dreamweaver which were leading internet software at that time. They were later acquired by Adobe. My interview was canceled before it was scheduled because they decided to stop all new grad hiring. \n- MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This was basically a defense contractor job. It didn’t work out because I wasn’t interviewed for a specific position. They did general screening. I got put in a database then never heard back. \n- Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Same story as with MIT Lincoln except it’s an atomic lab. \n- Hewlett-Packard, working in their printer division. I would have had to relocate to Boise. I turned this down even though I had no better offer since the work and location seemed too boring. \n\nI eventually got a part time job working for the university. This was supposed to convert to full time but the funding fell apart. The project was funded by tech companies who were cutting back. \n\nI ended up going to grad school instead. By the time I finished four years later in 2005 (with no PhD), the job market was somewhat better. It was not hot but more places were hiring. I got an offer to work in big tech on well known but old school software. It was pretty good for what I needed then. Salaries were way lower than now, especially when it came to stocks. I think my initial grant was like $5k over 4 years. \n\nLater, the job market improved A LOT. I got raises but eventually jumped to newer, better paying companies.\n\nThe Great Recession in 2008 was very different. Tech was hit but it was short lived. Maybe a year? All my friends in other industries got laid off and the bad job market dragged on. In tech, mobile phones juiced a huge run up in software that roughly correlated with the rise of the iPhone once it had apps.",

I wasn't impacted, I don't really remember any friends or neighbors being impacted either. Maybe it was my location, but as bad as I heard it was supposed to be, I never saw it first hand. \n\nI'm not affected this time either, since I have my own company, but it definitely feels different and more serious, at least in this industry.

I did this myself once and it was enlightening. Even one audience member, because I have no idea who they are, triggers entry into somewhat of a performer mode. You know you're being perceived, so you become self conscious, much like in a real interview.\n\nThough I note it won't be pleasant for the first few trials, I suspect it would cause adaptation to this problem, and work like gangbusters. Like you'd specifically intend to work through verbalizing algorithm complexity analysis in front of an audience on Twitch to practice working thru the issue in a similar state. You can modify the idea but the core is to be live streaming solutions, in front of an audience of at least one person (max ten maybe), who you know or don't know. \n\nAs a separate point, I suggest that there's multiple ways to approach becoming more comfortable, less nervous\\*, and cognitively smooth during  interviews. Could even work to just approach some programmers you know IRL and ask them, \"hey can I spend forty minutes explaining complexity analysis to you with examples over coffee? I'll pay for it.\" And then focus on being calm and collected throughout.",

He is killing team morale, and if his behavior continues to go unaddressed the good people on your team are going to start heading for the exits.\n\nTaking the management position puts you more in the line of fire, and TBH this is kind of the most un-fun situation you can walk into as a new manager, but it also gives you more control over how this goes down and *potentially* gives you an opportunity to get some great peer feedback from the other team members at performance review time if you effectively clean up this messy situation.\n\nIt's up to you, and how much initiative you want to take. Taking the manager position under these conditions is definitely the higher risk, higher reward path. I think I would have a very honest discussion with your boss and tell them you might take the position, but you need to know the full context of what you're walking into before committing to it. That seems like a fair request to me. The comments that concern me most is the current manager saying things like \"this is a really delicate situation right now\". That *could* mean that they are just naturally conflict-avoidant and are (unrealistically) hoping that the kid will knock it off on his own (he won't). *Alternatively* it could mean that the manager knows something about the situation that you don't, and as a new manager walking in to deal with it I would want to know what I'm getting myself into.",

I thought a lot about it and realized i didnt want to do the upskilling work necessary to be appealing in the tech job market— this led me to realize that the industry work in general may not be for me. \n\nSo as a CS major— be very introspective about whether you are willing to do the work you’ll need to do to get internships and jobs rn. Even if the job market gets better, it will still be just as competitive in my opinion— from here on out just the degree won’t be nearly enough. Ask yourself if you’re afraid of doing the extra work because you’re doubting yourself *or* if it genuinely just doesn’t interest you. It was the latter for me, so I switched. \n\nLastly, look at any data your current college puts out about career outcomes, and look on Linkedin to see how people who graduated in CS from your college recently are performing. Talk to any upperclassmen you know about their struggles or successes in finding internships, because if you dont get an internship during college, the only thing thatll help you in the postgrad job search will be luck and an immense grind on applications and a project portfolio. Ask yourself if you enjoy CS enough to do that. A lot of people are! I was not.",

Most people in tech would not make it in either of those, especially not HVAC. You can't be soft in those jobs like you can be in tech. And then are you really sure you want to take those 13 years of experience and basically flush it down the toilet? Because that's effectively what you'd be doing at that point. Basically no going back to tech if you go that route.\n- In regards to starting a business, you really should think long and hard about some of the problems you've encountered at work in the past and see if there are missing tools that you could work on. Doesn't have to be complex or fancy, just has to have no real or good solution currently. I'd put this variant way way higher than career switch if I were you.\n- What's your education? If you are some other engineering degree (electrical, mechanical, etc) you could probably look into more hardware focused companies and get more luck there. The job search for SWEs is different in those industries in some ways.\n- Sounds to me like you really need to do a deep postmortem analysis on your last failed interview and either grind LC much harder or get some help figuring out behavioral/system design questions...\n- From my recent experience with small companies, they aren't as rigorous with their interview process, so if you really do want a job sooner rather than later you might want to expand the search to those companies as well. Check yc for some of those companies, plenty posting jobs on LinkedIn as well. They come with some downsides obviously but beggars can't be choosers.",

Or are you used to clearing interviews with rusty coding skills? \n\nAt what point in the interview do you feel it shifts negative. After coding, system design or behavioral. Some of the companies some friends have gotten hired at recently don't do the leet code style grind interview and focus more on experience, design and some normal problem solving. Most of them have describe what sound like normal interview experiences. But having worked with them both, they were both competent engineers, one of them was brilliant. And they are both very easy to work with and likable.\n\nMy personal goal while employeed is to master the tricks to provide optimal solutions for the majority of leet code mediums or hards.

It has little to do with whether or not AI is useful; it’s clear that there is a market for access to LLMs (even if the people who want to pay for them are wrong about their usefulness, which I’m not saying they are or are not.). \n\nThink about previous bubbles: the dotcom bubble did not mean the internet was useless, for goodness sake, nor did the housing bubble mean uh, houses were useless. In both cases, it rather meant investors had made foolish decisions about where to put their money in a mad rush to profits driven by hype. It is pretty clear at this point that there similarly just is not a path to investors making their money back given how much investment has gone into this now. \n\nHowever, the thing about any bubble is there’s no telling what it will take to pop. It may go tomorrow, or it might take another few years. There’s no way to know, usually. In the case of the housing bubble, you could look at when the higher rates of crappy ARMs kicked in and make a pretty solid bet things would fall apart at that point (see The Big Short) but that was a special case.\n\nYou can look at the AI buildout and see, “okay, we’re building data centers like there’s no tomorrow, Nvidia’s accounts receivable is ballooning [ie, they’re allowing companies to take out debt to pay them], we keep inventing more 2008-style debt instruments to build these data centers, OpenAI and Anthropic and Cursor are completely unprofitable” and you can see that this cannot go on. But the bubble will only pop when investors lose faith in a major way, and there’s not really any telling when that will happen. There are some signs it might be soon, but it won’t happen until it does.",

If you’re an engineer at heart, your best bet would be to market your experience elsewhere but keep your job. A long vacation may be what you need to at least stave off burnout for a little while longer while you do it.\n\nBut burnout, contrary to popular belief, comes from a sense of a lack of control over one’s situation, not simply just the overwhelming workload you’re tasked with. In other words, a vacation will not save you on its own, no matter how awesome it is.\n\nMy advice would be to get 1:1s with the senior engineers on your team (NOT anyone on the management track.. yet). They should be on your side. Explain the challenges you’re facing and whether they have any advice for you. Best case is they identify that you’re being overworked and will help you manage upward. If you’re a high performer with a boss that won’t look out for you, it’s common that they will just assign more and more work for you without taking into account your workload. Managing upward comes with your growth as an engineer.",

At best, only small subsets our department work on the same project at the same time, and there can be a lot of siloing.\n\nOn the other hand, we do our best to cultivate a robust team culture of our own. We frequently share insights with one another (including at regular, roundtable department meetings),  do all sorts of bonding activities, try to ensure our bench is at least 2-deep on any topic, and we have a manager who thinks strategically about how we develop our staff and which projects we engage with. Even when our junior staff are going off on their own, we ensure they're never truly alone.\n\nAnyway, I would encourage you to speak with your manager about your concerns and what you can do to ensure you are learning/growing/thriving, not getting burnt out, and so on. You need to be managing up, helping your manager better serve you. Meanwhile, as others have said, you should have earnest conversations with the senior engineers on your team.",

It did everything they wanted, using every tool they requested. I included a demo of it running, install instructions and a README section covering possible improvements.\n\nIn the end I got rejected for not including tests.

Picking up “slower” hobbies. For me specifically, the gateway drug into slower hobbies was painting. Having a hobby/skill that takes a long time to develop and see results from is what you need to get out of the lowest effort dopamine cycle of social media. You need to do something that delays your dopamine payoff for much longer than minutes to start training your brain to not expect it all the time.\n3. Diet and Exercise - this fits in the same category as #2 in that it’s a slower payoff activity, but I think it deserves its own mention because being able to physically see your progress is huge motivation and doing it just puts you mentally in a better space.",

As a simple example, let's take variable assignments:\n\n    x = 1\n    y = 3\n    y = x\n    print x\n    print y\n\nWhat would the output of this block of pseudo code be?  Among students new to computer programming, a variety of answers are common:\n\nSome, intuit overwrite semantics and answer:  \n1  \n1\n\nSome, intuit swap semantics and answer:  \n3  \n1\n\nSome, intuit move semantics and answer:  \n0  \n1\n\nA good teacher will have a series of test questions designed to ferret out these mismatched mental models, and correct them.  Once students have good mental models of how languages behave they can finally start learning.\n\nSo I doubt that you are cooked.  You probably just need a bit of guidance.  If you're struggling with a particular concept, go talk to your teacher.  Write out the different possible code snippets you're considering to achieve a particular task, and have him explain why they do or don't work.\n\nHave you tried sitting down, and just writing some simple code to see if you understand things.  I would suggest using a language that offers a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) so that you can try things out interactively without getting bogged down.  A google collab notebook, or a Jupyter notebook can be great for this.\n\nI got started writing software when I was in 4th grade on my Commodore 64.  Started out just faffing around with loops to repeatedly print things like \"I am the greatest!\" on the screen.  I played around with sorting algorithms.  I created a program to display the Mandelbrot set (it took about 12 hours to calculate on the C64 when written in BASIC). I even learned to use raster-interrupts and bank-switching to create a double-resolution interlaced display (albeit at an eye-watering 30Hz).",

If you're the oncall engineer, you may need to wake up and fix things if shit hits the fan, but it's supposed to be a rare occurrence.

I had multiple instances of middle of the night calls being put on the spot in front of higher ups for unfamiliar systems. Worst case was a week after joining a new team, hadn't even gone through onboarding yet lol. \n\nThe FAANG was much better. Engineering had a lot of power in determining what's actually important. So I got a lot of tickets, but they didn't have to be settled as soon as I got them. I had 2 instances of staying up overnight, and both times multiple engineers across my organization worked on the issue since it touched all of our systems.\n\nIn both instances, I was expected to be near a computer or phone. Telecom you had a 15 minute window to answer a page before it's escalated to backup then manager. FAANG had a window as welp and provided me with a separate phone which helped keep me on top of oncall.",

Part of being a developer is actually validating requirements and things you’ve been assigned. It’s an ongoing dialog. \n\nYou got through a CS program, you’re smart enough to figure it all out but be proud of your work but also humble and you’ll be a better developer for it. It took me 6 months to get okay at asking for help. I was used to never needing assistance in school. I never got any help from tutoring or anything in computer science classes bc it always clicked and was easy for me. I had this weird sense of pride about that. I did good work my first 6 months like that but definitely spun my wheels a bit and could have done better had I just embraced collaborating with folks. Now if I don’t understand it after spending a few minutes looking stuff up, I ask for another set of eyes or to talk something out.

I had one class where the dude worked at Netflix and it was during covid and they sent him home to work. He ended up moving right after, to my college town. He was still working at Netflix, but then taught our DSA class as well. Some days we wouldn’t have class cause he’d have to fly out to California. Anyways, that was my best class by far, we did SCRUM every time we met, everyone solved the leetcode style homework projects together, we had class assignments that were a bit harder and the whole class worked together.

Completely self taught myself graphics programming through The Cherno, LearnOpenGL, and Game Engine Architecture Volume 3, since my college classes did not really cover it in particular. Made the switch because I desperately needed something more fulfilling job wise than game dev, which was drying up way back in 2018 just about. Way before Ai and outsourcing has caught on. I enjoyed C++ so I did that. Then fast forward a bit more I dabbled in web dev a bit (did use Ai to initially learn, and figured it out in about a month), did that a bit longer but really did not like it. So, basically just learned I love working in C++. From there just continued building little c++ projects and am now actively working on my engine which is in a presentable state, but nowhere near complete (if it ever will be). Recently been diving into embedded for job opportunities, since even graphics development is a big challenge in my area. Been screwing around on my Nucleo board, and building circuits and what not. The job doesn't require embedded, but is definitely embedded oriented. So, I have a bunch of little nick nack projects in c++, my engine, and this sample embedded project just to show I am interested in embedded. At the end of the day, I have quite a bit to talk about in an interview. I bet they would maybe be surprised for someone to explain how they developed a fairly large project, made design decisions, and just know the full ins and outs of the project they built, especially from new grads. At least, that's just under the presumption that a lot of candidates may be going full fledge into Ai and not understand a lick of what they are doing. Regardless I feel as though I do fit the role, it is super duper entry level after all (they listed wanting someone with some form of knowledge in at least one out of every language under the sun basically), but was just concerned how fast they expect you to adapt to something more complex than you have ever worked on before. My engine is three projects, with about 100 files, but that's a drop compared to a companies code base with thousands just on one project.\n\nEdit: All of that just to say I am currently waiting to hear from them, though they are located near me in bumb-fuck nowhere. So, there may be a couple qualified candidates, but not many. On top of that, they have five roles open for the position, so just increases the odds.",

My 2 cents:\n\n\nThe startup will make you better at building things quickly, give you access to way more interesting problems, and also allow you to have more responsibility than you ever would at big tech. \n\n\nThe tradeoff is that it’s the wild west. Coding best practices, well-scoped projects, clear roadmaps, internal tooling, may be minimal or nonexistent. That’s not inherently bad, and it can make shipping much easier, but there is less support in ensuring you’re writing good code, so it can very much be a sink-or-swim environment. \n\n\nI have learned much more in less time at my startup than I had at my previous big tech job, but my big tech job was very important in teaching me what large-scale corporate software development looks like: what guardrails are important, what good docs and code look like, how to navigate corporate politics, etc. I also think unfortunately brand name does matter and it was helpful to get my foot in the door when I started looking for jobs, but that can be overshadowed by building cool stuff.\n\n\nSo my main advice is to do your best to learn best practices in software development, and actively look for someone who is experienced and can mentor you.",

I think you have a myopic view of things right now. \n\nMy day to day could be anything from helping some data scientists put model production to setting up CI/CD for devops stuff, managing IAC, etc. Its a mixed bag, its not a job title but rather a mindset.\n\nDont worry about breaking into this field, become a good software engineer first then you can move onto bigger things (by software engineer I do not mean grinding leetcode). Fall in love with computers.\n\nThe way I look it, the laptop and its components were basically rocks some time ago and this fact absolutely fascinated me, i love everything about software/hardware. Bring that curiosity inside you and every door will be open for you. You have time ! Study hard what you love",

Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)?\n\nIt's a broad area. Anything related to infra supporting developing and running ML models is counted as ML infra. It's not all about MLOps. E.g., supporting models to run on a new type of accelerator (think about TPU, ASIC, ...), is also ML infra; code-designing software + hardware for faster network for ML workloads, ... \n\n\\> Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too.\n\nE.g., the compiler is supposed to take a model and compile it to hardware-specific code that should be able to run on a specific type of accelerator. But the model keeps crashing in the runtime --> the compiler didn't handle an edge case properly (this needs lots of efforts to repro) --> submit PR to patch the compiler --> re-compile and deploy the model.\n\n\\> a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality.\n\nNot necessarily. But you need lots of self-learning while you work. It's unlikely a school program can cover what you need.\n\n\\> On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here?\n\nIt's not very entry-level friendly. Lots of folks worked on adjacent areas (maybe non-ML) like databases, networks, compilers, before joining.\n\n\\> What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year... It's admittedly quite \"late\" in my college career since I took a while trying to figure out what I wanted to do. These are recommendations that ChatGPT recommended to me but am seeking some further details from real experts and professionals.\n\nHighly dependent on what type of ML infra engineer you want to be. \n\nBut generally fundamental courses like OS, compiler, database, DSA, can be very useful to help you self-learn more stuff along the way.\n\nAI can help you progress faster -- but you need to have the basics to understand what it is talking about as things can get abstract at first place.",

Despite my skills being a bit rusty I came back overall much better than I was before the burnout, mentally a lot sharper. Over the following 7 years I was able to nearly triple my pre-burnout salary.\n\nDuring the work-cation time you could also do some kind of side project that you always wanted to do like game dev, some AI project, whatever cool thing. It'll keep your skills sharpened and you can actually enjoy using your skills for yourself for a bit. Put the results on your github, and then you'll have a leg to stand on for the resume gap.",

Don’t spend more than 15 mins coding it for the first week or so.

What used to be a PM + 5 engineers in the future might be 2 PMs vibe coding + 1 super deep engineer supporting with human effort. \n\nThere will still be a need for hardcore deep tech people to do truly novel / hard things. But there will be so much opportunity for people who actually have product / business skills to create prototypes and find PMF before that point.\n\nFor you as someone who doesn't currently have those deep skills, this is a fresh slate. On the tech side you would be competing against people like me who DID spend 10 years coming up the old way, hands on. Whereas on the product side, I think a lot of the engineers are hopeless and even demonstrating luddite behavior as they see their jobs threatened. That seems like the path of least resistance for you.\n\nIt does depend on your nature a bit also. Personally I have always enjoyed both the product and engineering sides. I gravitated to the tech side because it was more valuable and the limiting factor. I very much feel that shifting now the other direction for a lot of types of software products.",

I would still require a visa to live in the US, but I've had multiple points in my life where I could have chosen to move to the US permanently. I chose to move to the UK.\n\nDublin, Paris, and Berlin don't, imo, have a better tech scene. You get a lot more jobs and variety in London. The pay also doesn't compare and you usually have much more growth opportunities in London. I speak about Dublin from experience, I moved from there to London. The other two I've mostly seen from a distance and talking to friends. Berlin is probably the one that gets closest, but the truth is that FAANGs all have large tech offices in London, they don't all have one in Berlin. Add that to the language issue (I don't speak German) and it doesn't make much sense to move there.\n\nThe US tech jobs are a much more interesting problem. The Bay Area and Seattle have objectively better tech scenes, higher salaries, and more variety in jobs. My problem with both of them (but especially the Bay) is that I do not enjoy or want to live in either of those places. I enjoy living in a city where I can walk places, where there's public transport, where there's a museum, culture, and arts scene, where it's easy to travel to other countries, and where not everything is tech.\n\nNYC would be a good option, and while the salaries aren't as good as the Bay, they're still likely better than London. I think it provides a good mix, and if I were to ever move to the US I would go there. I do still not like living in the US generally though. As I said, there's certain aspects of how European cities work that I enjoy, and to add to it, I enjoy getting plenty of days off to enjoy my free time and I feel like I have more breathing room while still finding interesting things to work for good pay. Between that and the fact that I've now established myself here and I have a friend group that I'm happy with and a flat I own, I'm unlikely to want to move.\n\nEdit: another issue with the US I forgot to mention, the immigration precarity has always been an issue for me with the country and to a degree still is. In the time I've moved to the UK, got permanent residency and citizenship, many of my friends in the US haven't been able to get permanent residency status. In that period I've not really had any prolonged periods where I can't visit family or leave the country for holidays, whereas I've had friends who weren't able to leave for **2 whole years**. Most visas you can get to move to the US can put you in that situation if you ever want to turn your status into a long-term one, and you're treated throughout a lot of the process as if you're somehow doing something wrong. It's not a situation I want to put myself in",

The four big ones in the US: Bay Area, Pacific Northwest, NYC area, perhaps Austin area all need London people to go through an already difficult and now even more difficult US immigration system. Besides those what is there? Dublin, Paris and Berlin are downgrades from London in terms of volume of opportunities. There’s no single city in Europe, Canada or Australia actually that I think has more opportunity than London. Lots of other places are better to live in imo for quality of life btw, but if we’re talking strictly about volume of job opportunities there aren’t as many. Dubai and Singapore also have less opportunities and then India/China aren’t going to work for vast majority because of low salaries and cultural differences. I’m of Indian origin and just got back from a trip to India, it’s a fine place to live if you have an online business making an income to sustain your life there, especially if you like sunshine, but to work there, it’s not going to work for people born and raised in the west and for those wages your lifestyle would be very poor.\n\nThe reality right now is tech jobs are in a precarious position all around. Outside the US, London’s probably the best, but that’s not saying much with the changing landscape with AI and lack of VC investment in anything other than AI. It’s the most stressful time to be in tech imo with respect to knowing what’s happening I’ve ever seen in my 20 year career.",

Sure they’re more inclined but CS for embedded is perfectly valid and you aren’t seen as a lower tier candidate because your degree is highly relevant. Ofc this depends on position, you have no clue about PCBs or pure electronics but for an embedded software position it’s more than enough. \n\nI’m a CS grad, and in my BS I had about a 40% overlap with the CE program.

Georgia Tech’s OMSCS is 50% students who did not get a BS in CS. You just have to finish the prereqs (calc 1&2, cs 1&2, Lin alg, prob and stats, discrete math, DSA) and then you can apply with an unrelated bachelors. This goes for most MSCS programs. I bet you’re close to having these already since you’re a semester into your AS.\n\nA lot of what I read online mentioned it’s possible to get a job with an AS albeit way more difficult, and you’ll eventually hit a ceiling and be required to finish the bs for a promotion at some point anyways.

The hardest part about switching will be convincing both recruiters and hiring mangers that your experiences maps for web development.  \nSince the market is so saturated right now recruiters are leaning super heavy on having semi exact tech stack matches. But generally if anything you did in game development involved any type of VM/Cloud work, or any type of ui design with C# than lean heavily on that for when applying to web specific stuff.",

Restart DSA slowly (consistency matters more than speed) and stay interview-ready. Alongside that, pick one area and go deep.. backend (Java/Spring), frontend (React), or data/ML. Build 2-3 solid projects and be able to explain them clearly.\n\nKeep your resume sharp, apply daily, and use LinkedIn actively. Many people switch out of WITCH within 6-18 months. Your CGPA and DSA base are good , you just need focus and patience now.",
