I don't have all of the source data I need to make these and use work either so I need to identify those, build views in SQL server for the source systems that the orchestrator can query and add to the extractors. \n\nIt took Claude Code an hour with almost no interaction on my part aside from approving the plan upfront. It one shotted the whole thing. All models compiled. Then I had it build a tool to cross validate the data from the old system with the new system.\n\nBy no means was this sexy or even complicated work but it was insanely time-consuming. That would've been a couple days worth of work doing it by hand. Hell, just cross referencing out which source data I was missing would've been annoying and painful. I know because I did pretty much this exact same task by hand about six months ago.\n\nI spent effectively 25 to 30 minutes on the whole thing planning upfront.",

If your company has ample confluence docs, uses jira well, uses datadog or some central observability, GitHub, Aws, then just using the relevant mcps + clis with an agent cli can do pretty wild stuff. If you have multi-repo setup, you can run the agent at a parent directory with a minimal md for context about what each repo is, with more robust md in each repo. You can use skills that teach it your particular workflows (eg when you make a pr, watch the ci to pass, if it fails investigate logs on circleci using circleci mcp).",

Second system syndrome is incredibly common at all levels.\n\nYou can try to document everything, and particularly provide metrics around how things are running to make a case that it’s actually in hand. I would assume there’s a deeper issue with data access that you aren’t fully informed about, so you might not even know what you’re arguing against.\n\nUltimately these decisions are completely out of your hands, a C-level executive that’s recently hired has absolute authority to start changing things entirely by opinion. It’s going to take several quarters for wrong decisions impact to be felt to the point of them being blamed for them.\n\nIf your new CTO doesn’t buy what you’re selling, and you’re not willing to go along for the ride with an open heart, absolutely look for the quickest exit.\n\nI say all this as the C-level executive. It’s also very possible the new CTO is seeing/know something you don’t, and what you’re reacting to is the first step in a long term plan that they themselves can’t clearly articulate because they are new.\n\nIf you do stay on, you should try to build a new relationship and pull in the same direction for the next year before passing judgement.

I am sorry to say it, but he is already planning to get rid of you, otherwise your input would be valued.  Don't assume that a long tenure of good work, or good relationships elsewhere in the company, will save you - if your reporting line is against you, it's over (unless you can move laterally within the org, but you would likely have to substantially change roles to get out from under the CTO.)  Your performance reviews are about to get worse as well, due to downward pressure to push you out.  They do not have to be fair, and defiance is pointless - if the CTO wants it, a \"case\" will be built for removing you, even if it takes months or years.\n\nThe safest bet is to update your resume and reach out to contacts you trust.  Presumably you have those, from former coworkers happy with what you accomplished.  It is far easier to change your environment than to change the nature of a CTO who is not interested in engaging with you on goals, tech, costs, etc. on their merits.  I am sorry you are dealing with this, but you should not pass up outside opportunities while holding onto \"hope\" that something gets better there.",

Your manager has likely built his career and secured his position by, as you say it, running the corporate playbook. He is in meetings you are not in and has access and built in authority in a way that you do not. This gives managers a natural political advantage over their ICs - so you need to tread carefully. \n\nI would not risk overplaying your hand by going to the CTO to break out from under him unless there is a clear business need you can point to - even then this is even harder without your manager on side. \n\nI’ve worked with managers like this before, yes they suck to work with. But judging on your post and responses I think it’s very likely that your manager has marked you as someone to keep an eye on and plan against. You’ve tipped your hand by openly having conflict with them. A coup at this point will fail. This person hasn’t made it to this point just to let an IC who wants to do things their way ruin their career. \n\nIf you go to your CTO and effectively say “I can’t work with this guy because he doesn’t let me operate the way I want to”, what would your CTO say? You need a better way of framing it. Also you only get one shot to pull the “change things or I’m leaving” card and you better have an offer in hand that you’d be ok taking if things didn’t go your way.",

I can guarantee that senior managers will side with the other manager 100% of the time because it's an old boys club and you're not in it.\n\nYour metrics are meaningless to them. They don't really care about new customers or cost savings, that's just how they control and direct underlings what to do. The only thing they care about is how they can directly steal even more from the company for themselves. \n\nSo the only real option, as always, is to find another job.

Being dependent on a single engineer is his nightmare. You think you can take this to the cto because he smiled at you and said good work a couple of times. That’s not the case. \n \nIf you wish to stay at your current place, you should stop the open conflict with your manager. Continue putting out great work, making sure you get the credit and the cto sees it. Eventually there will be an opportunity to move, either vertically or laterally. But don’t hold your breath, people like your manager often stay with a company for a long time.

Those being proper orchestrators (Airflow, Dagster, Prefect to name a few), transformation systems (Spark/Ray, Warehouses, etc), and if you wanted to, 'accessory systems' like Kafka and vector extensions to common DBs since you mentioned Postgres and ML/AI. To be clear, I don't think you ever need all of them. Each shop has, unfortunately in many cases, so many options that you'll be unable to really cover everything. If you did, say, an example of streaming some mock data (or real if you can get it) into Kafka and using the operators in Airflow to do some light filtering and dropping that in like TimescaleDB (a PG extension for time series), you'll have enough to go on to speak about the topics of orchestration, real time workflows, and useful DB system choices if you spend the time!\n\nOn the other hand you mentioned the transition from Orchestrating ML workflows as a DE to going to creational ML workflows as an MLE. I don't think the transition is impossible, but I will say it's difficult. When I/my company looked for MLEs we specifically waited for very skilled candidates. Many applicants were trying to make the same transition you're mentioning but the reality is the skills are harder to obtain or practice on your own than SWE or DE skills. Hell I positioned myself to at least cross-train for it to fill the gap while we waited, but I was ultimately turned down. That's all anecdotal. MLE is a bit of a hot job right now, so you will definitely have competition up and down the skill spectrum and there are only so many positions to go around. \n\nOtherwise yeah soft skills like another commenter said. If you do a personal experimentation project, practice documenting it like it was going to be used by other engineers and was production-ready. Social skills, communication skills, etc. are never bad things to take on!",

I cannot speak on senior interviewing but I've passed midlevel interviews for Google, Meta, and Microsoft for DE roles in the past year and they all ask pretty similar questions.

Architecture (Lambda / Kappa) OR Data Modeling - usually companies ask one or the other\n\n  \nBehavioral gets underrated a LOT. I once had a MS DE loop where they asked zero SQL / Python and basically 3 rounds behavioral and 1 architecture. HMs love it when you can explain high impact projects you've worked on (both technically and business value wise).\n\nI also think the scope of work for a DE in FAANG companies are generally quite limited. In Meta / Google in particular most DE work is more akin to a Analytics engineer where you're spitting and shitting out SQLs all day. Microsoft / Amazon is a mixed bag in that regard",

I am very comfortable saying that tools are the least important part of the job.

We have BQ and I've used PG/MySQL/Maria/SQL Server/Oracle/... so can probably help.\n\nData types and nullability are concerns you'll need to learn and handle properly with any columnar DB, but there are also DB settings around nulls you should apply so that you don't end up with reports showing 0 where they should be null or logic that has to test for '' rather than null in a string.  Data types between any two pieces of software typically require a map, so that shouldn't be a distinct concern.  DDLs are a bit different e.g. `LowCardinality(Nullable(String))` but after thirty minutes of learning this should be second nature.\n\nJoins - there are many types and you should learn about the different ones e.g. left anti join, any join, global left join.  If you build outputs with many (10+) joins or you join on functions you'll find the performance isn't great, but that's more of a design issue - design to (left) join on UInt64 fields.  The weirdest thing to get your head around is that join order matters, which is bizarre if you're used to a query execution planner doing this for you.  For heavy queries expect to specify the join engine and a few parameters to get things running just right - an LLM can give you a starting point and tuning tests, so not too hard.\n\nTable engines - Used properly this can speed things up massively and convey intent - the Set engine, for example is a great way to check if a value is good / bad without an additional join and operates near instantly.\n\nPrimary Keys - not really a thing here, instead you have order by.  There are table engines which should apply the primary key, but it's better if your logic sets this to be the case rather than relying on the engine itself.  Expect to footgun yourself at least once here.\n\nSCD2s - can be challenge - ASOF LEFT JOIN is great in principle, but if you have a list of preferred suppliers stored as an SCD2 you'll need to order by supplier id and valid from and add a 'future' non-preferred record so that transactions after the end data don't continue to return 'preferred'\n\nSyntax:\n\n - argMax and various array functions are excellent and Claude is great at writing them\n - being able to refer to results from the same select can really cut down the CTE chain\n - if you're running on a cluster or with multi-client and orchestration, the boilerplate can get a bit OTT, but that's true for competitors too\n\nMemory use - All columnar databases love to eat memory, expect to have nodes with 128GB+ if you've got a few tens of millions of rows of wide data.\n\nClickPipes - not used this.",

Often it’s come as a csv file, so I literally open it in excel, and use auto-sum on the entire column, then compare that to my final table.  If it’s too big to do that, then I have to faff around a bit more, but that’s basically the gist of it.  I’m really aware that I want to be doing a better job at it, so would love to learn better techniques.  Maybe that’s the answer to your question in my case - because I haven’t come up with good ways to perform the tests. \n\nFor the record; that’s just the initial data load. Once the pipeline is in place; I have a qc table which loads figures from raw, staging, and dev tables. It compares them and notifies me of any variance. And compares against previous weeks, looking for larger than acceptable differences. And a few other checks, depending on the data, such as if a bunch of products have moved to a new category but they haven’t carried the old products with them as they’re not selling. Still important when calculating growth so I address it. \n\nBut yeah, I’d love to see how other people do their testing.",

We have experienced cases of nafarious actors injecting welformed data but real data.  We have seen cases of data corruption in mass because a bad batch of memory in certain class of device which we detected before the manufacturer. \n\nIs too slow and too expensive, we can measure a select subset of the data before that at least notifies us something may end up being wrong or bad, we evaluate input data after the fact to train our anomaly detection and provide data for any investigation into issues.  \n\n\nWe have extensive test datasets and do back testing on on pipeline deployments. So if it is a production pipeline a very bad outcome like 0 rows is near impossible ( if I was on call this week that near impossible event would happen tonight, but I'm not on call). I tell our new hires and interns.  At our volume something that is 1 in a billion will happen several times a day, so if it can happen, it will happen  so plan for the possibility. one funny example is the framework we were using did not include North Korea as valid iso country code. We ought that in test because we used the list of iso choices from the iso docs not from the framework docs. Then we checked and even though we should not be getting data from north Korea we actually were getting a little bit on and off.  \n\nThat's why we don't test our data fully.  \n\n\nBigger question though why does it take 4 hours for a pipeline of the size you referenced?",

Learn what it has to offer for ETL (EMR, Glue) and then it will be easier to learn databricks and compare the compute types.

When you are performing this for building a complex dashboard, it will take quite a lot of iterations which could lead to many browser tabs being open and a lot of context switching.\n\nWhereas in Sopho, there is just Canvas which is basically Notebook + Dashboard. Notebook has SQL cells where you can write SQL queries and also Chart cells where you can use those SQL Cells to create a visualization. Later when you have iterated and finalized the charts you want to be displayed, you can go over to the dashboard view of the Canvas and place the chart cells from the notebook in the dashboard. The benefit is that everything is in one place so no need of keeping multiple tabs open and switching contexts for building a dashboard with a lot of charts. The notebook basically acts as the backend for the dashboard. This workflow is inspired by closed source platforms like Hex and Fabi.\n\nSopho uses Rust in the backend as opposed to JVM based Metabase and Python based Superset. Like Metabase, Sopho is a single binary which Superset is not.\n\nCanvas is the only differentiating feature that is delivered right now in this version. I am planning to add more AI native features to it because Metabase AI is an enterprise only feature. I also plan to keep Sopho fully open source with no dual licensing and tiering.",

I am not saying learn Kafka in details but learn how any message queue can be used in pipelines. Similar for other technologies. After collecting different small pieces and understanding how they operate in a system, you can move to more detailed topics like how can you use flink to distribute/optimize the ingestion pipeline etc. \n\nFor experience, if you can build and manage a living system, you can implement it anywhere in company. e.g ingest some data to data warehouse, create reports with scheduled queries and deploy it on a server. If you can learn and able to show how you did these things properly in interview it means that you are getting somewhere. \n\nImagine you started working in a big enterprise company and you have a database table and you need to show some reports on the data.

Even scala, for good and bad, isnt a focus much in the Spark space where Python is still king. \n\nIs it good to look into these languages and understand them? I think so. I have had on countless times needing data from the software engineering team, or need to understand how the function of said data works and its way easier for me to just see the endpoint and understand what it's doing. Sometimes you get crap data and you need to identify why the data is crap. It isnt often, but it has happened a few times where it's useful.\n\n  \nAlso, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to build out REST APIs for any reason, while you can certainly use django, and I do like me some django, you might be forced to make them in .NET or Java or Rails or whatever it may be that the company dictates. I have built many personal projects using all sorts of programming languages just on the sheer fact it allows me to understand the inner workings of the data I am getting. That has allowed me to have deeper conversations with the SWE team for when and how they produce data. \n\n\n\nTLDR, I think its good idea to understand it, and makes you a better DE, but is it necessary? I dont think so at all. ",

Are there multiple queries in a row that filter based on the same column?\n\nIn general, repartitioning your data in RAM memory using the .repartition() method can speed up filtering or aggregating by that column, because it avoids a full shuffle. But if you are running this query only once in a single session, you are simply moving the shuffle one row above so it won't help much.\n\nIf this is a recurrent query that runs every day, every hour, etc. I would suggest physically bucketing the data on disk before doing any join or filtering. Spark should be able to read the raw data, bucket it once and keep it like that for further runs. But I don't know all the details of your architecture so I'm not sure if this would be viable in your setup. \n\nSpeaking of joins, do you know if it is guaranteed that one of the two views can fit into a single partition in memory? In that case, you can force a broadcast join to avoid a shuffle join, but this is only in the cases where you know more about your data than the catalyst optimizer, so to speak. Be careful to not make your worker nodes run out of memory by forcing a broadcast join when the catalyst chooses a shuffle join, however.",

You'll be surprised how fast it'll go.  Have it write the ingestion scripts, then ask it to explain *why* it chose a specific schema and made the decisions. Focus on the architecture, not the syntax. You need to understand the why across all of the decisions; this is very important. This gives you a ton of experience.\n\nFor a project, just use a public API like NYC Open Data (Citibike)**.**  \"Which stations run out of bikes during Monday rush hour?**\"** . Collect the data, model it, and show some insights to answer that question. Then go a step further, do holidays change the trend? What about YOY growth?\n\nThis isn't 'extra' work; it’s proving you're a partner who builds systems that actually solve problems. That’s what gets you hired whether you go for DE or analyst.",

        "body": "Hi, I work at LanceDB but want to add a bit of detail here. Lance's file format is versioned, with the current default version being 2.0. 2.1 is already out there and is going to be the default soon, and 2.2 is also implemented and in the testing phase. The choice of file format used can impact the level of compression and performance you see, as the format is continually being improved.\n\nRe: performance, the F3 paper ([https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2025/zeng-sigmod2025.pdf)) shows numbers comparing Lance vs. other file formats and this is a good source of information (outside of the LanceDB team) in terms of scan and random access throughput (it shows that Lance is the fastest). The compression ratio shown in the paper is the worst, but the paper benchmarked against an old version of Lance (pre 2.0).\n\nFrom a roadmap perspective, Lance file format 2.2 that will come out soon has significantly more compression algorithms implemented, with some performance improvements as well. So more numbers will be published soon once that's out.\n\nRe: your performance observations, a) the version of the file format used matter, and b) the data types may not have the best compression ratios for that file version used. In LanceDB's internal suite, we regularly test against these modalities: long-form text, images and video blobs. For these cases, the write amplification in Parquet due to row groups is significant (which is the reason Lance was created in the first place). That said, even for conventional tabular data types (floats, booleans, etc.), Lance should perform on par with or better than Parquet, no matter the scale of the dataset. If you're getting sufficient performance out of Parquet, then well and good, in the end, what works best in practice is all that's needed!",

The gap between what is documented & what is actually used, is a massive headache, so your head is in the exact right place.\n\nu/Johnlee01223 is totally right about the complexity, though, building a custom usage graph means parsing millions of messy SQL queries. It turns into an edge case nightmare real quick, and parsing all those logs at scale can easily nuke your warehouse compute budget.\n\ntbh, to save you from reinventing the wheel, DataHub actually has this built in natively. It hooks directly into BigQuery (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`) or Snowflake (`QUERY_HISTORY`) and automatically translates those raw logs into the usage graph you're prototyping, mapping out column level lineage, real join relationships, and showing exactly who is querying what.\n\nTo keep the compute overhead low, we use server side query pushdowns to filter out high volume bot or service account traffic before it ever hits the parser.\n\nIf you're curious how the architecture works or what the output looks like, check this quick breakdown [Dataset Usage & Query History docs](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/features/dataset-usage-and-query-history).\n\nbtw, which warehouse are you testing your prototype on right now? I can point you to the exact docs for it, happy to chat more on this..",

So that depends on how convenient it's going to be to query that.  If your database supports JSON properly I think general querying would be easier.\n\nJSON will let you have arrays as property values.  You may want to somehow forbid that because people will eventually do that, even though your response to my question was basically \"no\".\n\n\\> I do not want business logic to depend on null checks for columns.\n\nI think that you cannot meaningfully enforce required properties on the  database schema level if you choose a JSON or EAV.  For EAV it's impossible I think, for JSON you'll have to implement tooling that maintains CHECK constraints (if your database even supports that).\n\nI think the only reliable way to have required properties is a classic 3NF schema, but you don't want that; so maybe you would consider relaxing one of those requirements...",

        "body": "I have been tasked with similar issues but in way less complex environments, and I don't envy you on this. But it can be fun to dive in, and play Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\n\nI would start simple, and forget about the 350+ pipelines. Start by diving into the easy places to get a head start and list all the problems you've found to kind of semi-cover your ass and set expectations:\n\n* Sporadic errors\n* Data loss on type conversions, \n* Lineage tool needs to fed better data or it is useless for this purpose.\n\nI would write something up, saying that the first 2 points must be fixed in order to get reliable result and success. How far have you found the first 2 points in your flow? If it is near the end, get some colleague to focus on fixing this, while you audit numbers earlier in the pipeline. Get someone else to fix it anyway, you focus on auditing data at other places.\n\nThe 3rd point about lineage tool is not relevant yet. If you don't find a few clear errors that fixes stuff down the line, and you must go detailed through almost all flows as your last resort, the lineage tool *must* be improved and to be relied on. \n\nThat is probably probably not a small task in itself, and there's likely a reason it is superficially setup as is.\n\nAs for the actual data hunt; you most likely have already done so, but compare the 2 curated tables. If they are identical you know to whether to go forward or backwards in your flows for errors. If you need to go back in your flows, make an audit somewhere in the middle between the source and curated tables of going backwards. Does data match, does transformations makes sense.\n\n  \nThen you do the same, figure out if you need to go forward/backward again. Audit somewhere in the middle again so you don't go through all steps. \n\nBreak down your audit spots, and focus on 2 to 5 KPI's and the data they rely on. Document your code to easily reproduce the check at different spots for that part of the data, so you can show others.\n\nAnd make those others quickly check you're on the right path, and that they agree you compare the proper data, so a misunderstanding does not lead astray.\n\nDepending on urgency and resources available, I would show findings and clearly point out, that it doesn't make sense to compare and audit those KPI's if you can't trust the data in the first place. Suggest a plan, split up the tasks. Whether you are solo or can get help from team mates, don't do a bit of data loss fix, and then some audit, and then some check on sporadic errors, back and forth, etc. \n\n\n\nIn all 3 tasks there's a bunch of rabbit holes to dive into, and I at least had trouble keeping a mental overview on the project itself and its progress while jumping from rabbit hole to rabbit hole. \n\nAlmost fixing almost all problems at once, so the puzzle pieces suddenly match perfect at the same time hasn't happened for me, at least. And it sounded like a simpler setup than yours. \n\nNow it became quite long, TL;DR, break stuff down, audit certain data for certain KPI's midway though the flow, and midway from last checkpoint, etc. Focus on specifics tasks, don't do everything at the same time, and then you've got this, as long as you don't let yourself get bullied on timelines. Stand up for yourself, and let management know if you've discovered deeper problems, which requires more time than initially expected.",

You cant optimize \"after you're done\", there wont be anyone paying your time to do that if it already works.\n\nYou need to clean it as you go, and your starting state is increasingly better with experience; not a single giant god-file of procedural code.\n\nThat then takes you to the next trap. Once you've finalized one use-case, you want to refactor it, because now you can do it \"better\". That's a trap, you'll need to learn to accept \"good enough\" somewhere along the way and take your lessons to the next project instead of getting stuck in this loop.\n\nWith that in mind, I actually think this is bad advice. I prefer devs who think a little before coding. Knowing your context boundaries can already help you structure your implementation greatly; starting with something like hexagonal is not slow anymore, it's fast and you can use scaffolders for it; openapi generators if you're using good structure will also accelerate API exposure AND consumption; so you arent over-engineering it if it took you 1 hour to setup and saved you 50 hours of refactors or bug-hunting as you implement, while simultaneously making it easier to change.\n\nYou write code once and read it 100 times.

They correlate, but they're not the same thing.\n\nMath gives you vocabulary (sets, functions, proofs) and trains abstract reasoning. But the specific skill of \"I have a complex problem — how do I break it into tractable parts?\" is best built by solving a lot of programming problems with deliberate reflection, not by restarting algebra.\n\nFollow the math list others recommended — it's solid. But in parallel: do structured problem sets (Exercism, Advent of Code easy levels) and after each one, write out in plain English how you decomposed the problem before you touched code. That explicit practice of \"problem → sub-problems → approach\" will do more for your logical thinking than math alone, faster.",

And since the title is How to learn Javascript, make it more JS relevant, as currently, it's not. \n\n>These tips work for many other languages too (C++, C#, PHP, Python, Java, ...)\n\nSo for PHP (since this is learn programming) and leaning into a previous point of helping beginner you in their journey:\n\n - Learning base PHP, using the PHP dev server (less setup).  Get error reporting setup.\n\n - From HTML, learn [templating](https://phptherightway.com/#templating).\n\n - Learn proper routing using urls vs direct file links.  Introducing HTTP, like 404 Not found.\n\n - Learn routing with HTTP methods using forms (`GET /form` & `POST /form`).  Starts the thinking in \"MVC\" & \"Restful\" like patterns.\n\n - Learn about validating (not sanitizing) data, returning early, sending error messages to the template with HTTP response codes.\n\n - Learn about databases (using SQLite, less setup) to populate & read data.\n\n - Next would be refactoring to smaller testable functions (Are you receiving the data (input or code to function) you need? Are you getting the output you expect?), \n\n - Then OOP and better project structure.\n\n - Try this out using the common beginner User Registration/Login projects and learn about password_* functions (vs md5, sha1, etc), etc.\n\nA beginner would then be comfortable getting into current concepts found in libraries and frameworks.\n\nSee how this was more focused to learning based on experience?",

Before you worry about tools like Burp Suite, the single most valuable thing you can do is build a rock-solid mental model of how software actually executes. I'd seriously recommend working through CMU's Bomb Lab and Attack Lab (both freely available — just search \"CMU bomb lab\" and \"CMU attack lab\" and you'll find the assignments plus tons of writeups from students who've completed them). Bomb Lab teaches you to reverse engineer a binary using GDB and disassembly, figuring out what inputs defuse each \"phase\" of a bomb. Attack Lab goes further and has you actually craft buffer overflow exploits, including code injection and return-oriented programming. These aren't theoretical exercises — they're teaching you the exact thought process security researchers use: read the code or binary, understand the expected behavior, then ask \"what happens if I send something the developer didn't anticipate?\"\nOnce you've internalized that mindset, the web security stuff you're learning (endpoints, parameters, open redirects) starts to click because you realize it's the same pattern at a different layer. A security researcher looking at a web app is doing the same thing you do in Attack Lab — tracing how input flows through the system and finding the spot where untrusted data gets used in a way the developer didn't account for. Tools just automate parts of that process; the skill is in knowing what to look for and why. Build that foundation first and everything else will make a lot more sense.",

That intuition gives you a place to start, and hypotheses that you can check.\n\nSoftware hacking isn’t that different. You’ve studied code. You have an intuition for things based on prior knowledge.

However, what I've observed is that the people around me who learn things \"fast\" usually only have a surface-level understanding of the topics that they supposedly learned.  When something goes wrong (as it inevitably does), they're left to \"googling and praying\".\n\nOn the other hand, when I do a proper deep-dive into a topic, I can not only diagnose problems without googling them, I can avoid them altogether.  Even though I spent a lot of time learning it, the \"learned it fast\" people usually end up coming to me for advice when they get stuck.\n\nWhen I graduated, the world-wide web was pretty new and although the internet proper had been around for a while, it didn't really hit mainstream until the web came along.  So I started hearing people talk about things like TCP/IP and sockets and firewalls and routers and I didn't know what any of that meant (they weren't teaching it in college back then unless you specialized in networking).\n\nWhen I asked for clarification on these, the attitude I got was kind of like \"you absolutely useless fucking retard what are you even doing in the building you worthless piece of human trash everybody knows this and if you don't already know this you should go kill yourself you clueless moron\" (be prepared to be treated that way a lot if you want a career in software, it kind of goes with the territory unfortunately).  So I decided to teach it to myself and I picked up a big heavy book called \"TCP/IP Illustrated\".  It took me a long time to work through it, but it answered all the questions that nobody seemed to think I was worthy of getting answers to and I could suddenly predict how things were going to work before I tested them.\n\nAnd then something unexpected happened.  All the \"kill yourself moron\" people started coming to _me_ with questions about why things were failing.  It turns out they didn't understand it _either_ and they were upset because my questions were uncovering their lack of understanding and they were afraid they were going to be found out.\n\nYou don't learn slow.  You actually learn.  You're surrounded by people who don't.  Keep going.",

Also, placements aren’t a perfect signal of skill.\n\nThe best way to calm the overwhelm is, as someone suggested, to pick one track for 8–12 weeks (e.g., Java and DSA or web dev). Build small projects that you finish (and can explain). If you are struggling with learning, maybe build a lesson or activity planner to help you keep up. Also, do a little daily (30-60 min) learning instead of binge-learning.\n\nFocus on consistency and fundamentals, and you’ll be fine. Fundamentals are especially important as AI changes how tech works. What kind of role are you aiming for - backend, frontend, or undecided?",

Basically, `MouseEvent -> { button2.setVisible(true); }` is a \"lambda\", which is like a method but it's created \"on the fly\" within a line of code instead of having to be defined ahead-of-time like other methods are. `setOnAction` takes that \"lambda\"/method/codeblock and registers it to be executed when `button1` is clicked. Altogether, your line reads like this:\n\n    button1.setOnAction(         // when button1 is clicked,\n      MouseEvent -> {            // run the following code:\n        button2.setVisible(true) // make button2 visible\n      }\n    );\n\nIf you want to dig more into the details, i unironically recommend asking an LLM for two. although they can hallucinate, in my experience they are *very* useful for exploring popular, well-known, well-documented technologies like java. good luck!\n\noh, one last thing -- the `< >` are what's called \"generics\" and they let you write code that's much more flexible than you'd be able to without them. very very useful stuff, but a little hard to explain in a couple sentences \\^\\^",

A quick way to verify the records is to run a `dig txt <your‑domain>` (or use any free “SPF/DKIM/DMARC checker” site) and make sure each provider’s include/selector shows up and that SPF stays under the 10‑lookup limit. For DMARC, set up a rua/report address so you get daily aggregate reports; those will flag any failed authentications before they become a user‑facing issue. It also helps to give marketing or support tools their own sub‑domain so you can rotate keys without touching the main domain’s DNS. If you need to validate large lists of domains or catch typos in bulk, a service like ValiDora can automate the checks and keep the process predictable.",

We were on SES, everything looked fine in our logs -- emails were sent with no errors. Turned out our marketing team had set up Mailchimp on the same domain months earlier without telling engineering, and their SPF record addition pushed us over the 10 DNS lookup limit. So SPF was silently failing for ALL outbound email, not just marketing.\n\nThe worst part was nobody noticed for weeks because the emails that failed SPF still had valid DKIM, so most providers delivered them anyway -- except Gmail, which had started enforcing DMARC alignment more strictly. And of course Gmail was like 60% of our user base.\n\nThe show original trick in Gmail is genuinely the single most useful debugging tool for this. I also learned the hard way to set up a DMARC policy with rua reporting from day one, even if it is just p=none. Having those aggregate reports would have caught the SPF overflow within the first weekly digest instead of waiting for user complaints to pile up.\n\nOne thing I would add to your list: if you are using a subdomain for transactional email (like mail.yourdomain.com), make sure that subdomain has its own DMARC record. DMARC inheritance from the organizational domain is not always straightforward, especially when you have different policies for marketing vs transactional.",

Nobody updates the SPF record. Now two out of three email sources fail authentication and nobody realizes it until customers complain they never got a password reset.\n\nThe tools are excellent at what they do. The gap is that most developers set them up once, confirm the first test email arrives, and never think about authentication again.

That said if you are serious about programming 90% chance you will have to learn Linux in some capacity anyways. \n\n\n- windows is easier for tool setup at the beginning, at a certain point it flips. The less consumery the tool the more the ease of use starts to favor Linux. In my experience windows has nicer GUI tools and Linux has (significantly) nicer CLI/TUI tools\n\n\n- windows + wsl. I write a lot of c# and play video games, so pure Linux is a nonstarter. Dual booting adds way too much friction. WSL is the best of both worlds - Linux cli + windows gui. \n\n\n- yes. A lot if not most server-based software runs on Linux via vms and containers. A lot of automation and build tools also run on Linux. Familiarity with the system is a huge boon. \n\n\n- it's good enough for me. I use it both at home and at work. Some tools I use, fwiw: git, tmux, c#, ts, python, rust, nvim, vs, vscode, docker, K8s, k9s, ansible, terraform. I use all of those in wsl except visual studio. Modern wsl networking is pretty seamless. I can run a postgres db in docker desktop, a .NET backend in visual studio and a next.js frontend in wsl and have everything talk to eachother just using localhost urls. ",

I got my first role knowing maybe 60% of what was listed. The rest I learned on the job.\n\nAlso - the fact that you started before ChatGPT and learned fundamentals the hard way is actually an advantage. A lot of newer devs skip straight to AI-assisted coding and have gaps in their foundational understanding. You won't have that problem.\n\nDon't stop learning.

I'd say that the software developers (professional or not) who do it (perhaps also) as a hobby, are the best developers. This is because the people who are the most interested in the field, are likely to be better at it than those who are not. And if you're interested in it, it is probably a hobby of yours, even if you do it professionally also.\n\nI sometimes hear the question \"Can a software developer be self-taught?\", and I'm usually like... who the f--- *isn't* self-taught in this industry? I mean, if you're interested in software development, did you seriously *wait* to start doing it until college? I started with BASIC on the Commodore 64 when I was 12 years old. Switched to C at around 17 years old. In college, I had to show our *teacher* how to implement linked lists (not because I was good, but because he was inexperienced with C). Sure, there were things I learned in college which I probably wouldn't have learned otherwise - or at least not as soon - for example, SQL, and other things which I found boring. But all the advanced stuff I learned on my own, because I wasn't going to sit around waiting for college to finally get around to teaching the stuff I was interested in.\n\nSo, yes! You can definitely learn software development as a hobby only. I know things are more complex now than when I was in school, but on the other hand there are so much more resources available for free now. Back in the 90's when I got started, while the net was around, there wasn't as much content as there is now. For most things I wanted to learn, I'd order an O'Reilly book. You don't have to do that anymore.\n\nHere's what I would do if I were you. Do some tutorials, but don't *only* do tutorials. Find something simple to build - something you *want* to build. And I do mean simple - really simple at first. I started with text games like \"Guess my number\" - \"Your guess is too high, try again\", and so on. You don't need graphics. Just find something that interests you.\n\nAnd when you get stuck - google it, ask an AI - not to do it for you, but to *teach* you how to do it - or come here, and ask us. Since you're not trying to do this professionally, only because it's fun, you don't have to stress about it. Just have fun with it.\n\nGood luck! ",

        "body": "> I do have one or two senior developers I reach out to occasionally, but they’re very busy and I try not to bug them.\n\nI struggle with this as well, but to be honest, you just have to ask. \nDon’t be worried about bugging them, worst case they’re annoyed but they’ve got bigger stuff to worry about so they’ll survive. Best case, they’re happy to help, worst case, they forget about it in a day or two. \n\nAs long as you’re not asking them to fix it for you, but to guide you to the solution and to help you better understand the problem, they shouldn’t complain.\n\nI don’t know what Axios, or interceptors are, but it sounds like your API key is rotating because you’re getting an auth Bearer token.\n\nIn Bruno, you probably have an API refresh key that you’ve configured. This is your credential to the service, and it’s only used to request a bearer token, a temporary api token with privileges to the other endpoints in the API.\n\nIt sounds like you’re copying the bearer token from Bruno into your application. Bruno is just an API client, so all its doing is sending an HTTP request (i.e GET/POST) and returning the results. \n\nInstead of fetching a bearer token manually in Bruno, you can change your code to send the api request that fetches your bearer token for you, process the response to extract the token, and then use the newly retrieved bearer token to fetch data from the other API endpoints.\n\nDO NOT HARD CODE YOUR API REFRESH TOKEN, you’ll need to use environment variables or a secret manager to fetch this in a secure manner.\n\nTo sum it all up, add some code to use your refresh token in an http request to fetch a bearer, and use that bearer for your other api calls. \nIf the calls that use your bearer token return an UNAUTHORIZED response (likely 403 status code, and it should include a message saying that the token is invalid or whatever), you know you need to request a new one, so call the code that uses your refresh token to request a new bearer.\n\nHope this helps. Even if this works you should still ask the senior devs to double check, they should tell you if you’re supposed to go about this a different way. I don’t have much to work on from your Reddit post so I’m taking a lot of guesses as to what’s going on.",

Cool, you found a leak in your brain you need to fill. You wrote the code and know you need to do something to the code before you run it but you dont remember what that thing is, so research using that information to move forward. \n\nYou are reminded you need to compile Java, you then remember learning in school that theres interpreted languages and compiled languages, Java/Kotling being compiled languages require you to compile your code before you run it. A little more research to figure out how to do that, likely ``` javac HelloWorld.java ```. Now its compiled so you can run it by finding the command to do so by googling. \n\nIf you do that process, you'll have quickly written Hello World, which if it didnt take a lot of time that means you dont need to study that, great. But also you've learned how to compile and run via the terminal commands, which taught you what your old tool used to do for you. \n\nThen move on to a slightly more complicated project than Hello World, which will require less re-learning because you now know how to compile and run. Keep building small programs using basic concepts, of its too easy add more features, if its too hard then you know what to practice. \n\nFocusing on one language like Java or Kotlin will make it easier to learn another in a fraction of the time, so i would focus on one language. Swapping between syntaxes of different languages and different ways to do the same thing is just gonna bog you down, but getting comfortable with a single language will catch you up to speed with programming, and make picking up your other desired languages even quicker. \n\nIt may seem slower, but really honing your skills with one language will make learning more languages faster after you have that foundation.

My previous programming experience helps of course, but I'm getting back into it very quickly.

Whereas an experienced writer will never think in these terms and will instead be like, \"A paragraph has exactly as many sentences as it *needs to have*.\"\n\nI think you're making a smart observation though: if I make a unique class for *this thing* won't I have to make it for *every other thing like this*? That's not a question of \"too many\" that's a question of whether you are choosing the right abstractions. Don't repeat yourself. If you find you're making several effectively identical or similar classes, then consider whether some other approach might not be better.\n\nDo you need a separate class for each ability? Maybe!

Another day you have whole day for yourself. You can cook whatever you want in the kitchen. The menu changes. Daily tools you are using as a software engineer, also change, depending on the task, depending on the service, etc.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\n1)I write new features to the service we are developing and maintaining. For example in addition to being able to buy a ticket via an app one can buy also via an SMS (for some elderly who do not use smartphones, or whatnot).\n\n2)I debug why the stuff does not work or why it behaves weird. Today I had to figure out why a system that is expected to check the uptime of our service is sending empty notifications. Where is the text?\n\n3)I review the code that my team mates wrote. Code review. To catch some nonsense. To turn attention to some missing business cases. To suggest some improvements. etc.\n\n4)I do technical analysis and help our business analyst. He does not write the code. Reading code is difficult for him. So, he comes with his less-IT-questions to me and I provide answers to him. For new tasks for us to work on.\n\n5)I improve our infrastructure. Like this uptime checking service I mentioned in 2). Today I set it up because otherwise it would be more difficult for us to know when something just does not work at all.\n\n6)Attend meetings. May it be discussing new tasks, discussing some big problem in production environment, discussing team events, or something else.\n\n7)Write documentation. Not comments in the code but documentation for the business people for them to know how the stuff works and what it does.\n\n8)Do technical analysis for new projects. The stuff that software architects do. Come up with a structure for the project, suggest different solutions (with pros and cons), come up with the main idea what and how the project should do, discuss with the business side, etc.\n\n9)Onboard new members. A new guy like you comes. He has 1000 questions. I try to create and improve our onboarding manual so the new guy can follow it and hopefully in the end he has a working local environment and can start working on his first task.\n\n10)Update libraries and frameworks. Fix vulnerabilities.\n\n11)Drink tea and scroll in the Internet while the system does whatever it does with my code changes and I have to wait meanwhile. (e.g. wait behind the running pipeline)\n\n12)Do some manual testing of the code I wrote. Before I pass it to the QA. Sure, there are unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests and such, but not everything can be tested and sometimes environment differences come into a play. So, I will check that the business use cases of my task are covered. A sanity check.\n\n13)Write these tests that I mentioned in 12)\n\n14)Think, think, think.

Since you learn better with explanation the r/learnpython community is surprisingly patient with beginner questions and you will likely get clear answers faster than waiting for a single mentor. \n\nYou have a solid plan just start small and stay consistent.",

We want the computer to do something, we tell the computer to do it.

Essentially oracle JDK is the canon jdk.\n\nNow anyone can actually take that reference specification and create their own version of Java and that is exactly what those distributions are. Azul, microsoft, amazon... all of those JDK were actually versions of java developed by those companies themselves. So basically the Java specification is the document that tells companies \"Hey if you want to create your own java and have it work with any java code for some version these are the stuff you need to support\"  \n  \nHence there is widely varying support as well, like Azul still supports Java 8.\n\nThis can get pretty complicated, there is a community process where people can vote/have a say about what features are getting added to a new version of java, and they do it by creating a JSR (java specification requests) and JEP (Java enhancement proposal).\n\nIf you are just starting there is no meaningful difference you will have when using any jdk (for the same version).\n\nIt will start to matter later, one of the major being in GraalVM where there are some pretty neat changes to make java more cloud native and reduce startup time and memory usage",

Input: it expects specific parameters of certain types and/or a specific starting state. Output: it returns a specific type and/or changes states. \n\nWhen choosing what to test, you want to test only public methods, whose contracts are not expected to change frequently. Do not test private methods directly unless they contain something particularly complicated. In that case, try to refactor the complicated bits into separate pure functions to reduce churn during later refactoring.\n\nYou also want to design and edit your code in a way that avoids changing contracts unnecessarily. For example, add new parameters to the end of the list and make them optional, preserving the previous behavior in which they did not exist.\n\nIf you find your contracts changing all the time, this is a problem with your code design. Not only does it make unit tests fragile, it makes coordination with other people and new features far more difficult than it needs to be. Read up on clean code strategies and code architectural patterns. \n\n\n**How to test**\n\nThe most common issue I see in fragile tests is allowing state changes to fall through from test to test. You must start and stop every test at a neutral baseline state, not allowing tests to affect each other. Every test should be able to run by itself or in any random order compared to other tests. In fact, there are many test frameworks that provide a randomized run feature to help you find and prevent this form of fragility.\n\nTo do unit testing correctly with non-pure functions, you must make sure to create fixtures, which are state controls. Before each test, your fixtures set up the correct state. After each test, you tear down those fixtures back to a neutral baseline. Do this using the test framework's built-in services. In class format, these are often methods named like setUp and tearDown. In spec format, they are named like beforeEach and afterEach.\n\nEach test has the following pattern:\n\n1. Set up fixtures, mocks, fakes\n2. If state may change, assert beginning state\n3. Call the function under test\n4. Assert returns if applicable \n5. Assert state change if applicable\n6. Assert mocks/fakes were called as expected, including the expected parameters passed in\n7. Tear down fixtures, mocks, fakes",

So, one can only check that once the function has been called, the data has indeed been stored. \"This function saves the data from the given data array in atomic write operations for each element of the array from first element to last element\" as interface contract describes a different behavior to check for - here the order and amount of calls to storage indeed matters.

It doesn't mean that everything should be inside the same function from a programming language perspective, but that the user of that module shouldn't be concerned about the underlying functionality. Think of private methods, or unexported functions - you can still have lots of these.\n\n**Grokking** takes a more \"inside-out\" look at code, where Philosophy assumes that you are designing something for other programmers to use, Grokking assumes that you are in the midst of building something complicated, and have to make sure that you yourself understands it. And of course you should build it with as small functions as possible - ensuring that each function only operates at a single level of abstraction.\n\nI'm not to sure about the parameter passing - it's been a bit long since I read either, so I'm not sure what exactly they are saying. But generally, receiving parameters or objects simply to send them on to other functions is considered somewhat bad design - but of course, if you want a deep module you'd have some \"facade\"-functions that receive everything, but doesn't really do anything about it.\n\nMy personal take on this is to consider whether a function is a \"worker\" or a \"delegator\" (my own nomenclature) and divide functions into those who do stuff, and those who just sends work on to a number of other functions. But if any function only calls a single other function - that might be a sign of bad design.\n\n  \nAnyways - as always, these kind of suggestions are always suggestions, not hard and fast rules. In some cases you might actually benefit from doing the opposite ... It is always best to learn and experiment, trying to stay strict inside one model, and then trying another, figuring out what works best for you and your project!",

Whether you agree with one or the other book depends on your coding style your mental model of how the code works.\n\nI haven't read the books so i don't want to talk all that much about the exact points where they contradict but i am sure that if both authors talked to each other they would agree in many areas. From the limited summary you provided i get this impression from the authors. Both authors want to structure their code in such a way that allows them to understand their code better.\n\nOusterhout does this by creating strong modules in such a way that you only have to use the module and dont have to understand its internals. This essentially lets you ignore large part of the codebase because you just use the module.\n\nNormand does this by making very clear where change happens and what change happens. This allows you trace through the code better because you can disregard those places that don't interest you right now.\n\nBoth sound like good advice to me. You don't have to exclusively pick one and stick with it. Try one out and see how you feel about it and make up your own mind. Personally, after writing a lot of Rust the Normand approach sounds much more appealing to mean than large modules, but sometimes a large module is the way to go.\n\nOne think i would like to point out where i strongly disagree with Ousterhout. If you have a function with a lot of parameters, i agree that turning those parameters into objects doesnt help. All it does is that it wraps up the parameters into a slight easier to work with package. Functionally the function still has the same amount of parameters. Here is the part where i disagree; Placing those parameters into a global context doesn't help for exactly the same reason. How you have a function with a bunch of effectively global variables and all the downsides that brings. If you want to reduce the amount of parameters you have to actually reduce the amount of parameters. One way to do that is to do what Normand tells you to do.\n\nPS: Great question",

The idea there being, you don’t actually have to remember all the details of all the functions, you’ll simply know what they all do from a quick glance at the code. — The thing about these conflicting or seemingly conflicting advice is that they all come from a context which includes the authors entire personal background and the situations they’ve contended with, it’s possible you’ll never contend with the same kind of situation, and it’s possible that you’ll contend with “mutually incompatible” situations inside the same code base. In my experience that means you’re working in many layers of abstraction, and the way to solve that is to start delineating between which layer of abstraction a set of functions lives inside of, so you can apply the appropriate techniques there, and a different set of techniques in a different layer.",

A similar book I can recommend is [Data-Oriented Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming), which is also about how Clojure does things, but with examples in other languages. Clojure was desinged very deliberately by Rich Hickey as a reaction to the problems of C++/Java OOP. Hickey's various talks go into more detail about his philosophy for Clojure.\n\nIn Clojure, we just use (immutable) maps for most things. Keys in Clojure's maps are considered more fundamental than the mere aggregation of them, and can have a namespace independent of the map they happen to be contained in.\n\nMany Clojure functions accept and return a map. They may update a subset of the keys they care about and pass on the rest. You can test and understand these functions with just the subset, but easily compose them with functions that use a different subset. Clojure also uses \"global\" (albeit namespaced) objects for program state, but typically only a small number of them. It's often just a single atom for the whole program containing a large map, like an in-memory transactional database.",

        "body": "This is gonna sound even more demotivating at first so sorry.... what you're struggling with right now and what AI is obviously pretty good at... is literally the easiest part of a programmers job. \"Coding\" is truly not in any way the majority of the process of coding, or a programmers job at all. If i was told tomorrow that AI is eliminating any coding my job requires writing by hand because they added magic and it now can perfectly output code, than I wouldnt worry at all. \n\nEven if in the future all we do is read code given to us by AI and fix bugs, then my ability to code makes me uniquely suited for doing exactly that over someone who only has ever used AI. And they will never invent an AI that can take in a client's requests and create their dream program, because clients are literally the dumbest people on earth and cant even describe what they want to human beings yet, and research on inventing the perfect client who doesnt change their mind after a feature is built or prioritize the complete wrong thing is lacking. \n\nAs far as code is concerned, you need to practice and apply the concepts you learn, forget leet code and homework, you need to build a million small programs and do that a few hundred times, its just practice. I dont think \"ok i need to make a variable to hold a number, what was the keyword for that? Oh yeah, int, but the number is going to be a value of currency so I should use a float. Ok, now I now I want to multiply that 5 times. Whats the keyword that starts a loop? Oh yeah, for. So i need to take that variable, and type the word for. Then I need parenthesis, and inside the parenthesis need to define the starting point and I was taught to set that to 0 so Ill type that. Then I need to define where to stop looping so Ill take that first statement and set it less than 5, whoops I mean 4 because I started at 0. What was the last part of a for loop again? Oh yeah, thats how much the counter will increase so ill increase it by 1 each time. Now I cant forget to use the curly braces for my logic.......\"\n\n\nThats how you first start out, and likely will think for every new keyword and bit of syntax you learn when starting out. Many \"intermediates\" still code at a snails pace that way and are convinced that an AI being able to do that instantly is doom for the entire field. \n\nAdvanced developers arent smarter than you, we've just written thousands of for loops and defined a billion variables through sheer repetition and practice. I think \"it need to hold the value of money here\" and my fingers define a float variable. I want performance some action on that variable 5 times and I dont even think about the syntax, I type it. Ive done it a million times, its dont have to remember the keyword \"for\" or where the curly brackets go. Not at all because Ive planned out in my head to do that, Im not nearly smart enough to think 5 whole seconds in the future. Im dumb as shit. But because Ive used the keywords, seen the patterns, and practiced over my career everyday, it just comes out without ever thinking of the syntax.\n\nBeginners think coding is just syntax m. Syntax is the easy part, and literally anyone can memorize the syntax of a language. If you can read this comment written in English, you're proof of that, but you have 2 decades of practicing English. If you understand the CONCEPT of something like a loop or defining a variable, you've done the hard part. The part that seems hard, and the part that AI is great at is the syntax, which requires practice and repetition. \n\n\nAs far as your concerns over the field transforming by the time you graduate... I gotta laugh, cause this field always has been seeing constant drastic shifts. Many of us here could tell of a time before Zuckerberg and his demons released the plague that is React into the web dev world, and suddenly if you didnt know React than you weren't hireable as a front end developer (according to some)... that was 10 years ago. Think about that, a whole new language and technology became almost a requirement for many jobs a decade ago, that doesn't happen in most professions.\n\nTake it even further, Javascript didnt exist like 20 years ago, if you want to work in web and you dont know Javascript you're boned. Doctors dont learn new bones every 10 years, and lawyers may learn new laws, but your countries entire consimtitution likely doesnt see drastic changes very often during the course of a lawyers entire career. There are programmers alive today that use to write code on paper. The fact that something new comes along and you get to learn it is a feature of development, not something to freak out about. \n\nAt the same time, during covid, developers who were masters of a language developed by cavemen as they fought off dinosaurs were paid extraordinary amounts of money to come out of retirement and update welfare systems in the US because their skills using COBOL was desperately needed and the number of people with that skill set is very small. \n\nThe last Java job a few years ago I was brought in for was working on a major upgrade of a codebase all the way up to the new and fancy Java version 8. We are currently, today, are on something like Java 24... There are so many jobs out there that will not budget major upgrades, or their systems are too critical to allow risking downtime or potential user issues, and chugging forward without the latest and greatest stuff is what the people signing the paychecks have determined is the best route forward. Corporate jobs are not startups that require microsecond code optimizations and the newest database architecture at the risk of user downtime. \n\nHell, there's programming jobs where intellectual property or government security clearances are required and your VPN or workplace may not even allow for internet access, let alone an AI assistant reading every line of code and doing who knows what with, and your resources are the language documentation and whatever else the previous devs left for you. \n\n\nAnd in a world where even those jobs all somehow disappear and AI takes over... ok...? Use the AI tools? You want to be a programmer and build stuff, thats why im a programmer. If a client was going to pay me a ton of money to program an app, and that \"app\" was a sandwich, i wouldnt use Java, id use bread and turkey, and maybe a knife. Code is just a tool you use as a developer, if the project pays well and requires Java, ill use Java. If it pays well and uses French, I'll use French. What does it matter? If the paycheck gets signed and you get to make things, who cares what tool you use.",

At the beginning it was like a miracle, it knew everything. As the project got bigger with more files and more interdependencies, so more complex, AI started chocking. It was suggesting or doing things that made no sense, it was constantly contradicting itself etc. After also reading some news about how so many companies that went all in on AI and fired developers started losing money, because it did not bring so much value and was rather breaking code than fixing it, I got more confident. You don't have to worry about anything. They have already started hiring back developers to fix the AI mess. It's only going to get better from here. F them all and their AI, Adobe, Amazon, Google.  Just focus on yourself, create your own projects for fun and the learning you achieve will just be a side effect for the future. Cheers 🥂",

Pick one small project that feels slightly above your current level and stick with it for a few weeks. You learn more from finishing one messy project than from watching ten tutorials. The overwhelm usually comes from trying to optimize the perfect path instead of just building something imperfect.\n\nAbout AI, it is changing things, but it mostly shifts the leverage, not the need for people who understand systems and problem solving. Tools get better, but someone still has to define the problem, validate the output, and design how pieces fit together.

How did you get past that stage?\n\nTLDR: Write it down.\n\n  \nThis is normal in any creative process. It's called writer's block. What I do to get past it is to write a one paragraph \"scope\" statement. This is a general description of the problem that I am trying to solve. It's important to write it because even if you think you understand things completely, you will often find there are details about the scope that you haven't clarified yet. Writing it down makes you confront the details.\n\nOnce you have the scope clearly articulated and you better understand the problem, start writing your psuedocode; just a list of steps to get there. Each step will have sub-steps, but don't focus on them yet because you will overwhelm yourself. It always helps to define things generally before jumping into the details ( I think it has to do with the way the brain structures information, but that's a different topic). If you do get lost in the details, you can just back up to your scope statement and you will find that there is something that perhaps you didn't define as well as you originally thought.\n\n  \nAn important note about AI: \n\nYes, it's scary to see things changing so quickly.

Clear goal, specific problem, short feedback loop? Two focused hours where you struggle productively can beat six hours of half distracted tutorial watching.\n\nOn days when you don’t feel like coding, it can help to lower the bar. Review old code. Refactor something small. Read documentation. Keep the habit alive without forcing deep work every single time. Forcing it when you’re fried often just builds frustration.\n\nProgress in programming is much more about sustained months of consistent effort than heroic daily marathons.

That way you’re actually using what you learned in meaningful ways. Then, plan milestone projects around using what you learned in a particular module.\n\nWould you rather be given the necessary information and a project objective, and then figure out how to break it down yourself—without being told exactly what to do line by line—rather than having someone walk you through every step of a project?",

On this journey, you will constantly be learning, and honestly you're probably always going to feel like \"something is missing\". I've been programming for like 7 years now and I still always feel like a dummy.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't really a checklist of things to know, and once you complete that checklist, you're considered a \"good programmer\".\n\nThe reality is, if you want to be a good programmer, you have to actually build stuff. By doing that, you'll start to to understand what works and what doesn't. And when I say build stuff, I mean doing it on your own as much as you can. Avoid following tutorials and using AI to help you - take the time to actually break down and solve problems on your own. It will be uncomfortable, but stick with it! It gets better over time. And that's what makes good programmers - those that can break down and solve problems, not those with encyclopedic knowledge of different design patterns or frameworks.\n\nNow having said that, I think it can be useful to supplement your journey with theory. There are plenty of resources out there for learning the most common design patterns, data structures, and algorithms. I think its important to familiarize yourself with them, know what they are and when to use them, but don't dwell on that stuff too much. You will learn far more actually building stuff.\n\nSo if I were you, I would try to think of something interesting to you and try to build that - maybe a game, website, or an app. It doesn't have to be something unique either; trying to recreate apps or games you enjoy is a fantastic exercise. Or maybe there is some problem you are encountering in your life - can you build something to help solve that problem?\n\nGood luck!",

AI has changed everything. I feel checked out some days just because I prompt Claude instead of coding myself. My company is very AI focused and we have workshops and expectations to configure better tools and skills for Claude usage. \n\nThe comment about knitting hit home for me. People aren’t gonna be programming much longer. I already have Claude pull down my card, make a plan, and even submit PR’s. It will be more management focused as we will be telling an agent to do it for us and verify results and intent. I also did the cs50 course way back, so fun :-) but that’s not what you’d be doing as a software engineer anymore. \n\nIt might be hard to break into tech if you don’t have a degree just because it’s so competitive now. Maybe a boot camp would be a good option for networking and skill building if you really wanted to make this work. Maybe the coding traineeship is similar. Also, learning AI tools to help accelerate workflows.\n\nI do think that furthering your skills is a great idea and you seem to be taking it seriously. Having just been on the job hunt I know it’s a scary place to be. I relied heavily on my network and when I was interested in a role I did a lot of cold emails and messages just to chat about the company to have better resources for an interview. \n\nCS is a saturated field and I don’t regret getting into it, but I am starting to think about something like product management instead as I’m not sure how long my junior or mid level engineering roles will last.",

Your background is actually a great asset and a place where you should look to market yourself. An admin who can build internal tools for an office? That's valuable. An IT guy who can also build a company's website? That's a business. A good copywriter must have broad knowledge. You have three markets you understand. I'd tap into them first.\n\n  \nI say continue to learn to code. I'm currently going through freeCodeCamp and then I'm going to go back to school to get an associate's in cybersecurity. My unique selling proposition is that I will code the website, write the copy on it that converts visitors into leads or sales, and secure the website for them. Instead of a small business needing to hire a developer, a copywriter, and eventually someone to handle security, they will have me. One person, one invoice. I've already built a website for my friend who runs a music lesson studio. As you get skills, try to apply them for other people.\n\nYou may not want to do web development, but the principle can be applied to other areas. Stack skills until you can build something unique that people want. I'd highly recommend learning how to write copy.

And this problem arise when we try to find what do we love,what do we enjoy, and what we are interested in .\nThere are may reason why this thought hit one.\nBut truth is that you don't have to be interested or else other in order to do it,am I right?\nJust like we listen song when feel bored and there is nothing like interesting thing in here,\nJust live every moment, don't ask how because there is not same answer for everyone just find your own\n\nAnd most importantly you were saying that you are learning coding as side hobby so keep it that way \nYou don't have to push yourself because when we try something forcefully then it becomes worse and also try this method while studying or learn coding \n\nTake 1 concept\nAnd study it like kid! Stay curious \nBecause you don't know computer science fully so you have. Many mystery stuff to uncover \nAnd if feel something easy then make it relatable to thing you already know or like \n\nEg. String data type \n\nEww 🤢,what the hell is string?\nHuh\nSo it's basically sentance that we write in coding?\nNah man!! They call this thing an string,lol 😂 \nI know it since childhood \n\n..,...........\nMy personal advice:\nIf you are learning it as hobby then keep it in that way .\nYou don't need to follow any course or strict roadmap to learn it\nWhen curiosity hit just drive in randomly and if stuck then solve it and do it again \nAnd by doing this you don't have to stay consistent because it will come automatically and you will become addicted to it. \n\n\nYour response is much matter because I have gone through same phase,and I am just giving my personal advice, I can help you further if needed and also note that if this don't workout for you then it's good\n because you have other ways to try.\n \n🫡",

The else (res != 0) block near the exit question doesn't work because  else can't take a condition like that. You need to change it to else if (res != 0).  Also, your strcpy calls for the username and password are backwards. strcpy  goes (destination, source) , so right now you're overwriting the user's input with empty variables instead of the other way around. On top of that, your fprintf calls are missing the file pointer. You need  fprintf(fp....) or it won't know where to write. The struct initializer on line 74 won't work either because you can't assign strings to char \\[\\] members that way in C. You have to declare the struct first and then use strcpy to fill in the string fields. Also your do..while loop has the condition flipped. You set programexit = 10  when the user wants to quit, but the loop says while (programexit == 10), which means it keeps going only when they're trying to leave. Should be while (programexit != 10).\n\nAdditionally, the reason your program exits after creating an account instead of going back to the menu is because you have a break sitting right after the \"account set up complete\" message. That's telling the program to leave the entire loop, so it never gets a chance to show the menu again. There is also an issue with your file pointer. You open the file in write mode which overwrites the existing content. If your intent is to add more usersnames and passwords to the file without overwriting, you need to open in append mode 'a'. There are a few more issues to point out, but incorporating the  changes from the first paragraph will at least get it running.\n\nOne piece of advice: It looks like you wrote a lot of code before testing anything. You really need to break it down into smaller pieces, test, then correct. This minimized the surface area you are bug hunting in. Good luck.",

Some jobs treat the first two weeks like orientation and don't give you much in case you're a flake; this might be a situation like that.  If that is not the case and you are certain that this internship has no value to you as it is, then that's a meeting for you to have with your supervisor or their supervisor where you can ask for more opportunities to program and code.   That is, if after a month it’s still no-code, talk to your supervisor about getting real development work.\n\nSecondly, if it's just a week or so since you started and it's a long commute, give your body time to adjust before you start pushing to attempt things at night.  You simply need time to adjust, and that might not happen for another week, no matter how young and healthy you are.  Either way, though it may be frustrating, give yourself some time.  ",

That one project will teach you more than two years of classwork.\n\nFor DSA do not grind 500 leetcode problems. Learn the core patterns, arrays, hashmaps, trees, sliding window, two pointers, binary search. That covers maybe 80% of what you will see in interviews. Two to three months of consistent practice is enough.\n\nThe AI thing is fixable, just start solving problems without it first, struggle for 30 minutes then use it to review your solution not write it. That struggle is where the intuition builds.\n\nProjects that actually matter: something with a real backend, auth, a database, external APIs. Doesnt have to be original just has to be complete and deployed. Recruiters want to see you can ship something real not just push tutorial code.\n\nOne year, one solid project, core DSA patterns, and consistency. That is it.",

You write it to make it work, once it works you re write it to make it less messy, then rewrite to make it easier to read, and so on. How many rewrites? How many does it take for you to look at it and go ”now that’s I’m satisfied about” :) \n\nAs you get more experience, you will get a feel for it…. And start writing less messy code naturally.

Some will say any code chunk that needs to be re-usable. Some will say any distinct \"unit\" of intent. Some will say any time your code becomes unreadable or inconvenient to work with. Others will say whenever the moon is red and mercury is in retrograde. \n\nMy typical approach is \"whatever makes the code self-documenting\"; if I am reading code and the intent of the function becomes unclear or disagrees with its function name, the function is likely either too long, doing too many things, difficult to test, unreadable, or unmaintainable. Not necessarily all 5, but still. \n\nIf I start thinking \"oh, I should add a code comment here\" I first ask if it should be a function, allowing the function name to describe intent instead of a comment. If I start copy-pasting code in many places, I start asking if it should be a function so that the code within that function can be understood once rather than in each location. If my function is 400 lines, I might (not always) think making it a 40 line function that makes descriptive calls to other functions is more readable (sometimes it won't). If I go to test my function and part of it is a pain to cover, moving that difficult-to-cover chunk to its own unit makes testing both functions easier.\n\nWith practice, you'll get a better feel for when something should be its own thing.

Then whoever reads your code reads the function names and doesn't have to read code to understand what you are doing \n\nThe general idea is to have 3 layers inside your file. The API layer where the public functions are and are calling other functions, the private middleware that has mostly calls to other functions in it, and the private low level where it is functions with mostly code. \n\nThis way you have a modular, self documented, testable module.",

        "body": "**Category A - Organizing Code**\n\n**1. To reduce repetition:**\n\nIf you have the same, or a very similar block code more than once, consider making it into a function. This is called the \"DRY\" principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). This centralizes logic that improves both maintainability and testability.\n\n\n**2. Concept extraction:**\n\nExtract code that represents a single step you could describe with a short comment. \n\nExample:\n\n    # Huge block or multiple blocks of code to register a user\n    ...\n    ...\n\n\nAs this code performs and clearly definable task, we can improve the structure and readability by bringing it together in a function:\n\n    def register_user(user):\n        ...\n\nBut then we look at what that function does, we see that it does multiple things:\n\n\n    # big block of validation logic\n    # big block of password hashing\n    # big block of database insert\n    # big block of email sending\n\nHere we have 4 blocks of code, each of which could be written as functions, which makes the logic more readable than one huge block of code.\n\n\n    def register_user(user)\n        validate_user(user)\n        hash_password(user)\n        db_insert(user)\n        notify_admin()\n\n---\n\n**Category B - Treating Functions as Values:**\n\n\nThis is conceptually different from the other two, and mostly applies to more advanced code, so I'll only mention it briefly for completeness.\n\nSometimes we need to treat functions as first class values, where the value represents a behaviour. A common example is when binding behaviours to button presses we may pass a function object as an argument.\n\nHere's a Tkinter example:\n\n    \n    button = tk.Button(root, text=\"Click Me\", command=function_to_run)\n\n\nIn this example, the function isn't extracted for readability, it's because the API requires a callable.\n\n\nOther examples include closures, decorators, async tasks and more.\n\n---\n\nA final note about \"not overdoing it\".\n\nFunctions are mostly about reducing complexity - they are a means rather than a goal. Avoid extracting trivial one-line wrappers that add no clarity or reuse, (unless required, for example by an API).\n\nBad Example:\n\n    def print_result(result):\n        print(result)\n\nThis adds an extra layer of indirection without improving readability, reducing duplication, or creating a meaningful abstraction.\n\nHowever there can be cases where wrapping a one-liner is justified. for example:\n\nSuppose you have this one-liner scattered in your code:\n\n    if user.age >= 18 and user.email_verified:\n        ...\n\nthen we can wrap the condition into a function:\n\n    def is_eligible(user):\n        return user.age >= 18 and user.email_verified\n\nthen use it in each place that it is needed:\n\n    if is_eligible(user):\n        ...\n\nThis is a good application of \"DRY\".",

        "body": "My opinion:  AI is for when you need code yesterday.  It’s a Bandaid until you can get proper stitches.  It’s a way to improve efficiency.  And no matter how hard you study or what you accomplish, one person can’t know every language or navigate legacy code (in a single day) you have to maintain.  AI gets a lot of hate, but…just being honest, you either stay on top of it or lose your job.  You WILL learn the fundamentals and more because it’s the smart way to go.  AI isn’t something you need to become a slave to.  It’s something you use so you don’t get stuck.  \n\nI’m still very much a beginner.  I’m pretty solid with Python, but I’m not good with flask or SQLite, which is something I need at the moment.  So I need a lot of help in that area along with building a web UI.  My main problem with using AI is that AI isn’t really good for niche, edge-case applications.  So I spend more time prototyping so I can capture the logic of what I want to do at every step along the way before writing the prompt.  The flask route seems really straightforward to me, but I have to connect overything over HTML, JS, and CSS.  \n\nFor me, AI has really democratized programming and allowed me to do things I couldn’t do before.  I can get stuff done and still learn as I go.  AI hasn’t been all that helpful in troubleshooting.  My personal rule is AI has three chances to get something right.  If I can’t get what I need after three prompts, it’s tome to break down the logic and code in smaller steps.",

Where AI can be useful is bouncing ideas or questions off it. If you don't understand something, then you can use an LLM to help you gain that knowledge. Maybe you wrote a thing and it all kind of fell apart and you're not sure why - an LLM can give you some guidance.\n\nDon't become dependant on the models. If you find yourself asking the same questions over and over, that's a sign you're not retaining the knowledge. Treat the models like an interactive version of Stack Overflow that won't be snarky and lock your questions.\n\nAs long as you are internalising the knowledge through actual practice writing code, then LLMs are just another tool you can use. Don't ever ask them to implement features for you. Use them as tools to get instant feedback on the code you write and your understanding of concepts. Also remember they can be stupid and wrong! That's also an important step in learning - when you realise you understand something better than an LLM, or some bozo on the internet 😺",

They know how to market themselves and how to fit in well in a new job. Getting a job is a simple process to them.\n\nThe weaker engineers who want to get a job, cruise, hope for an easy paycheck, can't contribute to technical discussions well, and feel entitled to a job because they have 8 years on the job? They will not survive without reflection and adjustments.\n\nBut now the average senior engineers are in a new market. During the COVID mass hirings they were golden, they were in the \"good\" half by default. You could get the job done and that was great. Unfortunately, the bar has been raised where that's no longer the case. You *need* to be a good engineer or by default you are a poor one.\n\nAt my work, I have seen the engineers I loved working with get a new, higher paying role just because it fell on their plate in a LinkedIn message and they decided to go through the process, nail it in 3 weeks, and put in their 2 weeks notice shortly after. Similarly, I have seen the engineers I detest working with, constantly argue and are not fun to be around, make the same mistakes constantly, etc. complain about how the market is dead and they can't find a new position anywhere.\n\nWho you are and where you fall in these categories is really up to you. I think if you are a senior engineer, you have the resources all available to be a good hire. It just requires a lot of effort - if you don't understand it, it won't work out.",

AI only works for the simplest of tasks.\n\nI don't see why \"YOU MUST URGENTLY LEARN AI CODING!\" is a thing.

Others expect developers to make more choices about what to build and do the building. Those companies also tend to pay more because they expect more from developers. \n\nIt does seem to be loosely correlated with how structured their processes are because if different people are making decisions than doing the implementation, process will generally be necessary to facilitate the coordination. \n\nThe most obvious marker of this in my experience is the number of PMs or BAs or whatever they call them.

Im a senior security engineer/GRC. I don't work from home, but i start at 08:30 and finish at 16:00 except for friday that i finish at 15:30 instead. So work-life balance is actually pretty good. I mostly don't carry work with me at home and i have full afternoon/night with my two toddlers. Really quality time i would say.\n\nHere enter a big-4 company. They offered me a job at a Senior Associate 3 level (whatever that is) for 2600 per month x14 tho, with ticket restaurant benefit and iPhone + unlimited data/calls etc and a hybrid working model 1 office 9 home (so 1 every two weeks).\n\n  \nIt was really tempting offer and it was a career upgrade for sure but big-4 companies have these flexible 9-to-9 work schedules haha, working weekends and they told me they encourage the employees to close the laptop at 18:30 if possible. I rejected the offer. Mental health and time with family are way more valuable than grinding for managers.\n\n  \nThat is my take. I might be a loser but it is what it is\n\n",

We continue down the path we are currently on; LLM capabilities are overhyped there is a gradual increase in skepticism from investors when it comes to AI. Yeah Claude opus 4.6 went exponential on this 50% task completion whatever chart, it hasn’t changed how I use AI and it’s not going to noticeably improve my productivity. My productivity has gone up maybe 30% because I can accomplish boring, boilerplate tasks near instantly. That has not changed in like 2 years, and I’m trying my hardest to automate my job away but the technology is just underwhelming at anything outside of unit tests. Finance bros realize billions have been thrown in a money pit, bubble pops, recession. FAANG scoops up all of the failed AI companies, drives cost down with scale and in ~10 years we get a permanent 30% buff to productivity with consumer grade AI. \n\n2. I’m completely wrong, AI goes exponential, we all lose our jobs. Then what? You’re smoking fine crack if you think that means utopia. Wealth gap increases exponentially, daily life implodes for 99.99% of humans. Societal collapse, anarchy, who knows? Yes I’m paranoid but genuinely how else do you think it’s gonna go? No middle class = no revenue for corporations = no revenue for blue collar workers = economy ceases to exist\n\nScenario 1 is most likely. I’m friends with a lot of people in finance. Just hearing them talk about AI and what they think it is… mind boggling. Smart guys all of them but makes total sense how OpenAI exists as a corporation. In this scenario, maybe I lose my job maybe I don’t. It’ll probably be as bad as 2008, but I don’t think much worse. I’ll bounce back. \n\nIf Scenario 2, nothing matters expect my immediate needs. So who cares? \n\nPoint is, why worry about what’s outside of your control? What, you’re all gonna pivot to plumbing because it’s so damn easy? You’re pushing 40 and haven’t bent your knees in 15 years, give me a break.",

What makes you believe that your student intuition is more correct than people that actually do this stuff for a living?\n\nBunch of us are experiencing in real time what it looks like to coach juniors in the age of LLM agents, having salary and promo and career growth discussions with them, and having difficult conversations about slop output and responsibility. We're also using Claude and Cursor and whatever is cool this month, and we maintain large codebases with equally large amounts of technical debt and tribal knowledge, and we'd love it if AI actually could make a dent on our endless JIRA backlogs that nobody ever has time for.\n\nIf you want to take a stab at making accurate future predictions, you should consider the fact that things pretty much always follow some boring middle-of-the-road scenario.",

What is stopping it from having the ability to check its own work and factor in countless variables that even humans struggle to think of? \n\n\nCouple of things about that\n\n\n1. We're approaching a plateau of what LLMs are capable of. They might be able to refine training data or build guard rails around existing tech to make it better, but throwing compute at the existing models is not showing the same \"line goes up and to the right\" growth from brute forcing the power. This plateau has some of the smaller companies without other sources of revenue like OpenAI absolutely shitting their pants. They do not have a business strategy beyond \"keep brute forcing it and hope it works out\"\n\n\n2. LLMs are great at common tasks with lots of examples, but really struggle in unique situations. Think \"big enterprise monolith unique to x company\". And these systems are hard for humans to understand. You can ask the LLM to do an impossible task. A human might come back and say \"hey boss this isn't possible with what we have, here's what we could do instead\". The LLM will charge ahead, delete important files, rewrite unrelated things, fail to complete the task but report a success anyway, because that's what it's been told to do. I've had this happen. My buddy at Amazon has seen two post mortems that were caused by Claude deleting AWS clusters from production.\n\n\n3. LLMs exacerbate the most important part of engineering, communication. Same Amazon friend is witnessing this first hand. A decision needs to be made about some upcoming work. He builds a design document that takes him 2 days to write and passes it to his manager. His manager has a bunch of questions, so he spends an extra day writing clarifications. His boss then uses AI to generate a shitty summary of his document and passes it to the director. The director has questions which the manager doesn't know because they didn't actually take the time to understand, so my friend has to meet with his manager and write more clarifications wich get summarized by AI etc. etc. you see where this has going. It's been a week and a half talking about work that could be completed in a day or two. You see this everywhere but LLMs are giving people an undue sense of understanding. It convinces you that you can do more by offloading your critical thinking to the chat bot. And you see this everywhere, in education, in engineering, in design, more content is being generated than ever, but for what purpose? It muddies the decision making chain and paralyzes people who just stop making their own cohesive thoughts to make decisions \n\n\nI think 3 is the most dangerous. Same Amazon org fired a bunch of engineers in the last layoffs and kept all the management. The director of the org is using AI to summarize hype pieces saying engineers shouldn't be writing any code themselves anymore and sending it out to all of his staff, em-dashes and emojis and all.\n\n\nSo yeah. LLMs are increasing the amount of code that is being generated, but it's muddying the most important part of software engineering: building the *right* software, not the *most* software.",

Maybe... But here's the thing about being a SWE - the entire career has always been about adapting quickly: from punchcards to assembly to Cobol to C to C++ to Java and JavaScript to Python to C#, Typescript, and Rust. Or whatever languages, you get the drift. And that's just the languages, there are insane numbers of frameworks and tech stacks to learn as well.\n\nSo what I would recommend is: don't doom about it, adapt. Like geneerations of SWEs before you. The learning curve has always been quick. Figure out the areas where Codex and CC are deficient, and focus on upskilling in those areas. Maybe that means not being a SWE at all, that could be true. But just recognize that this isn't actually different from what other people have experienced in the past. A college degree is a lot about learning how to learn, not about specific skills.",

Will they guarantee you a job? No. Did they let me increase my Linkedin network? Yes. That network did, in the future, give me opportunities and connections into roles/jobs. Interestingly, I never took a role from that yet but the opportunity is there and there are some high value opportunities from startups there that I know were not posted on job boards like Indeed.\n\nHackathons can also be a good learning experience especially if you are a student to see technologies (although they will, by nature, be hacky lmao) that are not used in school.\n\nNow, did I join every possible hackathon I could? No, not really. But you should definitely join some. You need to learn to prioritize what things to do with your time but trying most activities a few times at least gives you a better idea of how each provides value to you.\n\nPersonally? Internships are still the highest value thing you can do while in school with interviewing for internships as the second highest value thing. Third highest value thing you can do is building your resume/network so that you can get interviews for internships. Great thing about these 3 goals is they can transition from internships to first job easily and directly.",

That tells me a lot about your problem solving ability. You mentioned you were applying to cloud , devops etc. I shouldn’t have to explain this but you should have a master resume with all your bullets under your work experience related to all 3 of those the you will select the best ones for say devops and make a pdf of that resume for devops jobs, the you’ll do that for the other types of jobs you’re applying to. Then you’ll constantly be looking at the descriptions and try to iterate your various resumes with bullets of real experience that match what you’re seeing repeated in the various postings. Check the percentage of responses you’re getting and types ie phone screen etc. If it’s below 10% you’re doing something drastically wrong and need to analyze. Additional tip, if you want to position well esp in the AI world show your work tied to business outcomes meaning you understand how you impact cost and revenue. It’s going to be increasingly valuable to understand GTM and strategic thinking in tech jobs because of AI. It is important to think of any job as you’re a little business unit and all these AI agents or whatever are your workers in your little business that you’re in charge of.",

Right now, everyone knows it is not as valuable as it is valued at, which is leading to the intense speculative bubble we're seeing. It is the belief in what it will do later that keeps the bubble so strong; if several PhD level papers come out showing we're not even close... that will probably kill the bubble.\n\nAnd of course, that probably won't happen for a while. The folks who would do such research are also largely funded by the people who need the bubble to continue.\n\nThis is normal for an immature technology. What is NOT normal, is thinking the technology is going to replace everyone, without actually proving it can, and everyone hedging their bets on this happening anyways.\n\nCompanies like Apple are probably going to be the big winners at the end of this. They're not firing their teams and replacing them with unproven AI. And at this point in time, it is looking more and more like AI usage just shifts the bottleneck further down the line rather than eliminates it (as far as automated programming goes).\n\nSince the changes it makes can be breaking and it has no accountability, a lot of devs are being forced into code review for thousands upon thousands of changes. It is likely to lead to unstable software, with limited ability to diagnose and maintain, even if companies increase headcount. You just cannot fit the context of the changes into your head fast enough to tell when the AI is doing something dumb.\n\nAs such, the workflow we're accustomed to is not very accommodating to AI autonomous changes... until it can actually take over dev jobs, which is still a long time away.\n\nSite Reliability Engineers and Cybersecurity developers are going to feast.",

Aggressively filter candidates by stuff that seems reasonable (for juniors, pick only top schools and people with relevant previous experience). If I can get some automated technical first round I do it but it’s almost useless in our ChatGPT era. 1st round of talking just to gauge if the candidate is acceptable (might drop half here, depends how much I filtered before). Real live technical round and final interviews. \n\nI’ll fast track any referrals from people I trust before wasting my time with interviews because at the end of the day I just need someone above my bar. It’s not worth doing this much work to end (generally) with people on the same level as my referrals.\n\nAs a candidate, your best bet is working together with recruiters.",

Getting reliable accuracy for complex tasks is still a huge challenge. Hallucination is real. The cost per inference for anything truly 'intelligent' at scale, hitting real latency targets? It's significant; we spend a lot of time on cost optimization.  \n  \nMany 'middle-man' jobs involve nuanced decision-making, exception handling, and human interaction. Current agentic models just aren't good enough there, even with good retrieval architecture. They fail on edge cases constantly. Yes, automation will impact some jobs – it always has.

Basic management looks like this: a 20% increase in efficiency means we can cut back the developer team by 20%.\n\nUnfortunately for us, they're largely correct. We aren't all some super special genius talents that are irreplaceable. Anyone who has been in the industry long enough knows how much low skill busy work there is and has watched it slowly be replaced. First it moved to junior devs, then offshoring, and now AI.\n\nIt doesn't seem like much initially, but when 4 devs can do the work of 5 that's potentially 20% of all of us that are out of a job...and it's only getting more efficient.\n\nThere's also the related issue of junior dev positions evaporating at a rapid pace, which will fuck the industry super hard unless AI really pans out in the next decade or so. Junior devs were always a net negative for at least a year and after that still mostly only handled busy work. Now that AI can rip through that it simply doesn't make economic sense for most companies to have junior devs on payroll, especially with retention rates so low.\n\nWe live in a society that is capable of rapid technological advancement, but setup so that advancement almost exclusively benefits the wealthy.

You then add in that all this free money to people caused housing prices to spike, which then nosedived leaving banks with assets worth much less then the loans on it. You also had pension funds buy in on the banking bets, so when they collapsed the retirement savings of many also collapsed. And lastly you had insurance companies actually insuring these bets, then also collapsing. None of this is similar to the AI Hype. \n\nThe 2000 Dot Com Bubble was lead by a whole new market appearing from nowhere. Before 95 most people had never heard of the internet and few had home computers. With cheap internet via AOL and cheaper computers people starting buying computer and going online en mass. With it came a lot of opportunities. You had companies like yahoo go from nobody to household names overnight. Everyone wanted in on it. You had people standing infront of college trying to find freshman CS majors begging them to work for them. You had a ton of money pouring in trying to start the next yahoo. It crashed and burned when people figured out that it wasn't profitable to sent dog food via mail. That you can't have 1000 clone sites that nobody goes to. Then the federal reserve did the unthinkable and raised their rates. This caused the 'free' money investors used to prop up the companies to dissapear. Anyone who wasn't already profitable no longer had money to borrow on cheap rates and went bankrupt. This again isn't like the AI Hype. Interest rates are already high. Only big tech companies are trying to make AI. This is more pushing AI as a productivity tool instead of opening new untapped markets of consumers. \n\nThe AI Hype resembles much more the hype around 'Cloud' and 'Blockchain' and next 'Everything is a Service'. 2000 crash was about vaporware. 2008 was more about rot that killed the banks. AI needs massive upfront costs. ",

Because there's *very reasonable* questions hidden behind all 3 of those bullet points.\n\n* I'm a SWE... budgets aren't my department. I can tell you how much infrastructure costs, I can tell you the tradeoffs in infrastructure costs if we sacrifice X, Y, and Z. All I do is present facts. It's the manager's job to choose which of the facts they like. And employee salaries is a manager's job, not mine. I could tell you how many man hours something will take, it's up to the manager to budget.\n* This is a very valid question. I have a side hustle that has a decent amount of DAU, and my infrastructure costs for a serverless architecture with a database are \\~$60/month and it's lightning fast. I'm obviously not operating on a massive enterprise scale, but I have more users than a lot of shitty startups, and I rely on uptime for my money so it's very stable. So.... why is $50/month not enough? Is your scale too high? Is the code just inefficient? Too much tech debt? Is the architecture itself bad? *Explain it*. Lack of money does not always mean slow. The fact your manager doesn't know *why* your shit is slow is a sign there's a lack of communication between engineering and management. This is a red flag from *both* ends, the fact your manager never thought to ask until now, and the fact this was an issue engineering's never communicated upwards.\n* \"If your timeline is a day, we'd need to sacrifice X, Y, and Z to do a quick MVP. I can do that if you'd like. But to do this feature properly, I need X days because of A, B, and C. Up to you.\". Again, this is a very valid question, it boils down to \"why would this feature take longer to build than I think it would?\". That's a pretty common question between management/product and engineers. It's our job to answer it.\n\nSo none of those questions on their own would make me consider leaving.... their *responses* to my answers might, but the questions themselves are fair to ask.\n\nEdit:\n\nMissed the 4th, cause it wasn't a bullet, but to this:\n\n>Coding is easy it is just binary which is literally 0 and 1 so ship the code fast or i will ship you from employed to homeless.\n\nGo ahead. Fire me. See what happens to your timelines. Any half competent manager knows it takes time and money to replace a SWE. We're all replaceable, at a cost. So if speed is their concern, replacing me is the worst possible option.\n\nAnd if my manager's threatening to fire me, I'll let him. That relationship has already soured, and has nothing to do with the other 3 fair questions. I'll start looking on the side. I wouldn't quit. I'd continue putting in my 8 hours a day, no more, no less. I'd continue giving accurate estimates based on facts.",

But just know that every field has its own set of pros and cons - everybody thinks the grass is greener on the other side when looking through rose-tinted glasses. But in this life you have to pick your poison, you have to pick something you find interesting and worthwhile to devote your time to.\n\nFeedback on your resume:\n\n1. Firstly, CV (curriculum vitae) literally means a *brief account of a person's education, qualifications, and previous experience*. Adding that Profile/About Me section at the top, which just summarizes the rest of your resume, is in essence, just a summary of a summary. Remove it and find more meat to pack into other areas of your resume. Break down your bullet points and elaborate on them.\n\n2. Your resume just makes you seem like a glorified unit-test monkey, but the whole point of being a tester is to try and break things, find issues, and raise them. What bugs, hidden issues, etc. did your work help uncover? Did it prevent a catastrophic release? \"Increasing manual test coverage by 30%\" is a meaningless metric - why is this important? 30% of what? How big of a codebase? What is the actual impact of your work and how were you important or useful?\n\n3. You duplicate a link to your LinkedIn at the top and at the bottom. Just leave it at the top where the rest of your contact information is.\n\n4. Whitespace. Consider reducing the header and footer margins. \n\nLastly, I don't think your problem is building out a portfolio of projects. My GitHub has been a desert ever since I graduated college as well. I also don't think your issue is that your resume doesn't scream \"experienced developer\". You clearly have experience and have done work that the business valued enough to keep you for 3 years. To me, your resume screams, I'm not a very important person at work, don't know/care about impact, and have been doing the exact same shit for 5 years and don't push myself. Your problem is you just stopped caring, or burned out.",

Better late than never, I guess?\n\nMasters might be ok if you're ok with essentially resetting back to new grad status but for a more SWE-oriented focus. The \"dunno what to study\" part indicates you kinda need to do some soul searching to figure out how you see yourself in 5 years as a productive member of society.

It's being able to say \"I reduced page load time by 40%\" instead of \"I refactored the rendering pipeline.\" One gets you a nod, the other gets you a promotion conversation.\n\n  \nYour \"medium skills\" framing is actually more useful than you think. There's a whole layer between \"can you code\" and \"can you lead\" that determines whether you get stuck at mid-level or not. Writing a clear technical design doc. Knowing when to escalate vs. when to just handle it. Scoping work accurately instead of being the person who says \"two days\" and delivers in two weeks. Understanding that your estimate is a commitment other people plan around.\n\n  \nThe other one I'd add: making your decisions visible. Don't just pick a solution, document why you picked it and what you considered. When something breaks at 2am, the person debugging it will thank you. When your manager needs to justify your promotion, they'll have receipts. Most engineers do good work that nobody ever sees because they never learned to make it legible to the people making decisions about their career.",

Promotions from Associate to mid and mid to Senior require only a \"budget confirmation\" in business justification, there is a maximum amount we can spend on promotions each year. In my experience, we've never exceeded that budget so these promotions always pass their business justification.\n\nStarting with senior to staff, then staff to principal and principal to senior principal the business justification becomes stricter.  Staff is defined as a role that works \"across teams\", usually within an org.  Principal is inter-org work and sr. principal is company level work.  We must justify why we need individuals operating in those roles.  For Staff it's not too bad, we produce a list of they type of work and project work that requires tech/engineering focus aligning teams (usually building something global/working directly with internal customer teams etc etc).\n\nPrincipal and Sr. Principal things get much harder.  There's really not that much work at that level. My org of 100 has one principal, who focuses on cross-org database work, and one principal who is working torwards sr. Principal by focusing on aligning our entire orgs tech with other org tech leads.  I really have no need for more than that.\n\nI have about 10 Staff engineers however, some recently promoted into that role from Senior. (We do a lot of inter-team work/support). They are all told if they want to make principal, it is /unlikely/ they will get the role within our current org (we'd either have to double in size, not likely, or one of the two principals would have to leave and require a backfill).\n\nFor those staff engineers that want to \"grow\" by title change I encourage my managers to do several things. First, keep a constant eye on opening roles in the company, anything principal they should consider having their staff report apply to it and be considered. Likewise there are some other career paths, such as engineering manager (if they want to stop focusing on being an Individual contributor) or even other leadership roles (technical program manager etc). And lastly, yes, it is not a crime if my managers support their staff engineers in their next career step outside the company (referrals, helping be a career mentor, assessing other jobs etc). \n\nAll of this is to say, yes, at some point, a \"promotion\" must consider business need, and that business need should get harder the more senior the role is.  Managers should focus on the realities and be aware that sometimes growing people means having them leave the team or company, but it should happen at more senior levels.\n\nIf your company doesn't have good definitions of what various levels of engineers should be doing for the company, I'd start there.",

Now, early career, you can generally show \"yes, we need person at L+1, we expect our L to grow into that role\", but major career transitions (Senior, or Staff) generally require a business need.\n\nIn many companies, this is actually hidden by the modern practice of retrospective promotion, where you promote people after they demonstrate a sustained performance of L+1. Since there was L+1 work for them to do to demonstrate that, it is a lot easier to demonstrate a need. \n\nBut it is also normal for people to be in a position where there are no career growth opportunities for them on their current team, or even at their current company. After all, if the company has a CTO, and you are ready to take on a CTO role, you are probably going to have to leave. A good manager helps employees realize that and make that transition.\n\nThink about it this way, if you tried to open up a new headcount for a Senior or Staff level role, would you be able to justify it with the work your team has to do? If you could, you can make the case for a promotion. If you can't, then people looking to go to Senior or Staff need to leave your team anyway, because even if you did promote them, their reviews would inherently be awful because they would have no ability to demonstrate performance at level.

Is there a need for someone to increase the scope of work they’re during and provide further technical value to a line of business? If so, make that argument and push for a promotion. If not, that’s just an honest assessment of the business’ needs. The way I see it, if a team’s responsibilities evolve then the needs of the team change and it’s up to the manager to facilitate that change.\n\nThink of it this way:\nYou have a business and all you sell are apples and the market only has a demand for 100 apples a year.

That's just not the kind of place to be if you or your reports are primarily focused on professional growth.\n\nWhat you describe is the norm for most jobs outside of growth tech companies.

Well that's easy but the hard part is always the refinement and the details. That's what they want you to figure out. When automating tasks, how do you get the best and most consistent results? Which models are the best? How to best set it up? Which tasks are best candidates to automate? How much money/effort can be saved this way? How can you still include a human element or some kind of safety mechanism or backstop so that the new process does not bite you if something goes wrong?

I think learning kotlin and building apps is a great way to boost your resume and show you know how to build real systems. \n\nThe industry wants to move towards Kotlin Multiplatform to share business logic between iOS/android. I would recommend building your apps in KMP and not neglecting iOS if you're building on your own and not for a company.\n\nThat said, at least when I graduated tech companies preferred to hire a leetcode grinder with no android experience rather than an experienced android developer who couldn't leetcode. \n\nMy intro to android development was applying to amazon, passing the leetcode rounds, and getting thrown on an android team with no prior android experience. Unless Android is truly your passion, I wouldn't commit to only applying to android roles. This career is a lot about luck and taking opportunities where they come. \n\nFrom my experience leetcode, networking, and career fairs with the goal of an internship are likely going to be a better use of time than diving deep into mobile dev. Use mobile dev as project experience to get those internships, but don't force your career in one direction.",

Recruiters are looking at your job titles, company names, and whether your skills section matches what they're hiring for. The photo gets a half-second glance at most.\n\nThe threshold is basically: does it look like you took it seriously? A clear, well-lit phone photo with a plain background clears that bar easily. The £350-500 photographer is overkill for this purpose.\n\nWhere photos matter more: sales, client-facing roles, executive level, anything where you're the product being sold. For IC engineering roles, much less so.\n\nOn AI headshots — the \"subtle issues I couldn't put my finger on\" feeling is real and worth trusting. The uncanny valley effect in AI photos is noticeable to people who look at a lot of LinkedIn profiles (recruiters). A slightly awkward but clearly real photo is better than a polished one that reads as fake. If you want a decent update without the cost, find a plain wall, good natural light from a window, and ask someone to take 20 shots on a phone. You'll get something usable.",

The prior year bonus forms the basis for the current year.  The bonus pool is then distributed across the teams according to baseline and then further adjusted by the compensation manager(s).

On-site interviews with multiple members of team, normally 3-4 people, normally about an hour each. Each person would focus on a specific topic, and these could be anything from potential peers to even the hiring manager's boss. You might at this stage also do some sort of take-home.\n\n4.

Alot of the regulars on this forum are un-employed graduates lol.\n\nI do consulting work, graduated in mathematics from the British version of community college. (open-uni)\n\nPersonally i wouldn't recommend it. Largely out of the fact you don't really need a CS degree to go into software eng, any STEM degree will do.  Alot of universities are terrible at teaching CS and CS doesn't have thatttt much to do with day to day software engineering work....\n\nbut if you enjoy the subject , go for it. The industry does have its issues, but every industry does.\n\nyou should try harvard's CS50 to get a taster for what its like, and you should 100% learn how to program before you spend money on a CS degree.",
