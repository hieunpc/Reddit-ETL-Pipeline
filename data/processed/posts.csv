Onsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership The recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. This new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. System Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.Data Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. Business Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approachesLeadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. Questions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.Next day morning Recruiter’s cold email came in that team has not decided to move forward.

1qxifq4,"Is classic data modeling (SCDs, stable business meaning, dimensional rigor) becoming less and less relevant?",Likewise231,dataengineering,"I’ve been in FAANG for about 5 years now, across multiple teams and orgs (new data teams, SDE-heavy teams, BI-heavy teams, large and small setups), and one thing that’s consistently surprised me is how little classic data modeling I’ve actually seen applied in practice.When I joined as a junior/intern, I expected things like proper dimensional modeling, careful handling of changing business meaning, SCD Type 2 being a common pattern, and shared dimensions that teams actually align on — but in reality most teams seem extremely execution-focused, with the job dominated by pipelines, orchestration, data quality, alerts, lineage, governance, security, and infra, while modeling and design feel like maybe 5–10% of the work at most.Even at senior levels, I’ve often found that concepts like “ensuring the business meaning of a column doesn’t silently change” or why SCD2 exists aren’t universally understood or consistently applied. In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).My logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations.

Here's a quick map:* **LLM = The Logic Engine.** This is the component that processes the data.* **Prompt = The Input.** This is literally the query or the parameter you are feeding into the engine.* **Embeddings = The Feature.** This is classic feature engineering. You are taking unstructured text and turning it into a vector (a list of numbers) so the system can perform math on it.* **Vector Database = The Storage.** That's the indexing and storage layer for those feature vectors.* **RAG = The Context.** Retrieval step. You’re pulling relevant data to give the logic engine the context it needs to answer correctly.* **Agent = The System.** This is the orchestration layer. It’s what wraps the engine, the storage, and the inputs into a functional workflow.2Don't let the ""AI"" label intimidate you. The infrastructure challenges, are the same ones we’ve been dealing with for years.

1qvoj0i,Financial engineering at its finest,SignalMine594,dataengineering,"I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. Earlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...On the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.The first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.Then I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.A huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. * That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservationObviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…The other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.Earnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)Please check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?",43,0.94,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qvoj0i/financial_engineering_at_its_finest/,2026-02-04 13:27:12,2026-02-08 02:39:28

1quxzvb,Are Python UDFs in Spark still less efficient than UDFs written in Scala or Java?,Lastrevio,dataengineering,"I'm reading ""Spark: The Definitive"" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: ""When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. If the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.Starting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!"" I heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",32,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1quxzvb/are_python_udfs_in_spark_still_less_efficient/,2026-02-03 17:20:05,2026-02-08 02:39:28

1qtdnvi,What are the scenarios where we DON'T need to build a dimensional model?,Ulfrauga,dataengineering,"As title. **When** ***shouldn't*** **we go through the efforts of building a dimensional model?** To me, it's a bit of a grey area. But how do I pick out the black and white? When I'm giving feedback, questioning and making suggestions about the aspects of the design as developed - and it's not a dim model - I'll tend to default to ""should be a dim model"". I'm concerned that's a rigid and incorrect stance. I'm vaguely aware that a dim model is not always the way to go, but *when is that?*Background: I have 7 years in DE, 3 years before that in SW. I've learned a bunch, but often fall back on what are considered best practices if I lack the depth or breadth of experience. When, and when *not* to use a dim model is one of these areas.Most our use cases are A) Reports in Power BI. Occasionally, B) Returning specific, flat information. For B, it could *still* come from a dim model. This leads me to think that a dim model is a go-to, with doing otherwise is the exception.Problem of the day: There's a repeating theme at work. Models put together by a colleague are never strict dims/facts. It's *relational*, so there is a logical star, but it's not as clear-cut as a few facts and their dimensions. Measures and attributes remain mixed. They'll often say that the data and/or model is small: there is a handful of tables; less than hundreds of millions of rows.I get the balance between *ship now* and *do it properly, methodically, follow a pattern*. But, whether there are 5 tables or 50, I am stuck on the thought that your 5-table data source *still* has some business process to be considered. There are *still* measures and attributes to break out.EDIT: Some rephrasing. I was coming across as ""back up my opinion"".

Column-level says ""these 3 specific dashboard fields"", which is actually helpful.**What didn't work****My first attempt: Regex parsing SQL**Wrote a bunch of regex to pull column names from SELECT statements. Worked for simple queries. Completely fell apart with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.Example that broke it: WITH customers AS (   SELECT      c.id as customer_key,     c.email as contact_email   FROM raw.customers c ) SELECT customer_key, contact_email FROM customersMy regex couldn't track that customer\_key came from c.id. I gave up after 2 weeks.**My 2nd attempt: Query INFORMATION\_SCHEMA only**Thought we could just use Snowflake's metadata tables to see column relationships. **Nope**. INFORMATION\_SCHEMA tells you schemas exist, not how data flows through queries.I found success by parsing SQL properly with an actual parser, not regex. I used sqlparse for Python but JSQLParser works if you live in Java world.Query Snowflake's QUERY\_HISTORY view, parse every SELECT/INSERT/CREATE TABLE AS statement, build a graph of column → column relationships.**The architecture** Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY    ↓ Extract SQL (last 7 days of queries)   ↓ SQL Parser (sqlparse)   ↓ Column Mapper (track renames/transforms)   ↓ Graph DB (Neo4j) + Search (Elasticsearch) import sqlparse from snowflake.connector import connect # Pull recent queries queries = snowflake.execute(""""""   SELECT query_text    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY    WHERE query_type IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT')   AND start_time > DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) """""") for query_text in queries:     parsed = sqlparse.parse(query_text)[0]          # Extract SELECT columns     select_cols = extract_columns(parsed)          # Extract FROM tables and resolve schemas     source_tables = extract_tables(parsed)          # Handle SELECT * by querying schema     if has_star_select(select_cols):         select_cols = resolve_star_expressions(source_tables)          # Build edges: source_col -> output_col     for output_col in select_cols:         for input_col in output_col.dependencies:             graph.add_edge(                 from_col=f""{input_col.table}.{input_col.name}"",                 to_col=f""{output_col.table}.{output_col.name}"",                 transform_type=output_col.transform             )**Some issues I ran into****1. SELECT \* resolution**When you see SELECT \* FROM customers JOIN orders, you need to know what columns exist in both tables at query execution time. Can't parse this statically.The solution is to Query INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to get table schemas, then expand \* to the actual column list.**2. Column aliasing chains** SELECT    customer_id as c_id,   c_id as cust_id,  -- references the alias above   cust_id as final_idYou have to track the alias chain through the entire query. The symbol table gets really messy really fast.**3. Subqueries and CTEs**Each level of nesting creates a new namespace. The parser needs to track which customer\_id is which when you have 3 nested CTEs all selecting customer\_id.**4. Window functions and aggregates**SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY customer\_id) means the output column depends on revenue (for the calculation) and customer\_id (for the partition), but differently.Your lineage graph needs different edge types: ""aggregates,"" ""partitions\_by,"" ""direct\_reference.""**Performance at 50K tables**Parsing 7 days of query history (about 500K queries): 2 hours Storage: Neo4j graph (200M edges), Elasticsearch (column name search) Query time: ""Show me everything downstream of this column"" = sub-2 seconds Query time: ""Where is customer\_id used?"" = sub-1 secondTo save yourself a future headache, save the 20% of lineage paths that get queried 80% of the time.**What I’m still struggle with**Cross-warehouse lineage. My data flows Snowflake → Databricks → back to Snowflake. This approach only sees the Snowflake side.Real-time updates. I run lineage extraction every 6 hours. If someone on my team changes a column and immediately asks ""what breaks?"", they get stale data.ML pipelines. Notebooks that do df.select(""customer\_id"") don't show up in Snowflake query logs. That’s a blind spot.What's your current table count? Curious where others hit the breaking point.

It is important to say they aren't looking for team level metrics. There is pressure to have something measurable and consistent across the team.I know this is tough...I don't like it at all. I keep trying to steer it back to the TEAM's performance/delivery/whatever, but here we are. :(One initial idea I had was tracking story points committed vs completed per sprint, but I'm concerned this doesn't map well to reality. Especially because points are team relative, work varies in complexity, and of course there are always interruptions/support work that can get unevenly distributed.I've also suggested tracking cycle time trends per individual (but NOT comparisons...), and defining role specific KPIs, since not every single engineer does the same type of work.Unfortunately leadership wants something more uniform and explicitly individual.So I'm curious to know from DE or even leaders that browse this subreddit:* if your org tracks individual performance KPIs for data engineers and data scientists, what does that actually look like? * what worked well? what backfired?Any real world examples would be appreciated.",22,0.83,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qw09c0/how_do_you_handle_individual_performance_kpis_for/,2026-02-04 20:40:38,2026-02-08 02:39:28

1qunhxb,Switching from Data Science to Data Engineering,seagullbreadloaf,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, I'm currently working in a data science role but was thinking about making the switch to data engineering. I have a background in statistics and have been working as a data scientist in biomedical research in academia for 1.5 years. This is my first job since finishing my Masters in statistics. When I first started the job, I was responsible for cleaning datasets from clinical trials (this was 90% of the work), statistical modeling, creating visual aids like graphs and charts, and presenting and explaining my work to biologists. After 6 months, my manager told me I ""wasn't a good fit"" for the role because I ""lack curiosity"". I wouldn't say he was wrong. I didn't mind the work but it also didn't excite me and I didn't find it that fulfilling.I was transferred to a different team within the same company and my main project became writing programming scripts to automate compression of thousands of files from patient databases, and creating lookup tables containing information on all the files (such as patient identifiers, visit dates, etc.) This involved a lot of identifying and sometimes renaming files that were mislabeled, had missing information, or used different naming conventions, and make sure these edge cases were accounted for in the compression process. We also received multiple batches of files from different sources, and I had to modify the scripts to account for all the nuances between different sources. I noticed I enjoyed these projects much more and that I'm very precise and good at paying close attention to small details. I liked how expectations were more well-defined with this project and was more like ""it either works or it doesn't"", rather than the previous data science role which was much more open-ended. I feel like I do better when expectations are more structured and consistent, rather than exploratory. My new manager also noticed the new role was a much better fit for me.That being said, I'm thinking about pivoting into data engineering for my next role because I feel it may be a better fit for me. I've been looking at job postings for data engineering roles, but I don't have many of the skills required for a lot of these roles. My work so far has mainly been in R since that's what my company uses, and I've had some exposure to SQL and Python. I know Python and SQL are important in data engineering and tech is all about transferable skills, but I feel like I don't yet have the toolbox to switch to data engineering, nor do I have strong software engineering skills. I'm also not sure if I will be a strong candidate considering how competitive the job market is nowadays. My plan for now is to learn the important skills so that I'm able to make the switch.Those of you who switched from data science to data engineering, what was your experience like and how did you navigate that shift? What are the most important data engineering skills/tools I should familiarize myself with to become a competitive candidate and be ready for interviews? What are some good resources you would suggest for learning these skills/tools?

1qxle32,What would you put on your Data Tech Mount Rushmore?,empty_cities,dataengineering,"Mine has evolved a bit over the last year. Today it’s a mix of newer faces alongside a couple of absolute bedrocks in data and analytics. Apache Arrow It's the technology you didn’t even know you loved. It’s how Streamlit improved load speed, how DataFusion moves DataFrames around, and the memory model behind Polars. Now it has its own SQL protocol with Flight SQL and database drivers via ADBC. The idea of Arrow as the standard for data interoperability feels inevitable. DuckDB I was so late to DuckDB that it’s a little embarrassing. At first, I thought it was mostly useful for data apps and lambda functions. Boy was I was wrong. The SQL syntax, the extensions, the ease of use, the seamless switch between in-memory and local persistence…and DuckLake. Like many before me, I fell for what DuckDB can do. It feels like magic. Postgres I used to roll my eyes every time I read “Just use Postgres.” in the comments section. I had it pegged as a transactional database for software apps. After working with DuckLake, Supabase, and most recently ADBC, I get it now. Postgres can do almost anything, including serious analytics. As Mimoune Djouallah put it recently, “PostgreSQL is not an OLTP database, it’s a freaking data platform.” Python Where would analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, data platforms and AI engineering be without Python? Can you honestly imagine a data world where it doesn’t exist? I can’t. For that reason alone it will always have a spot on my Mount Rushmore. 4 EVA.

One client is roughly 10x larger than the others. I’m trying to use `repartition` to shuffle data across nodes and balance the workload, but the execution remains bottlenecked on a single task.# Details:I'm running a simple extraction + load pipeline:`Read from DB -> add columns -> write to data lake.`The data source is a bit peculiar: each client has its own independent database.The large client's data consistently lands on a single node during all phases of the job. While other nodes finish their tasks very quickly, this one ""straggler"" task bottlenecks the entire job.I attempted to redistribute the data to spread the load, but nothing seems to trigger an even shuffle. I’ve tried:* Salting the keys.* Enabling Adaptive Query Execution (AQE).* `repartition(n, ""salt_column"")` , `repartition(n, ""client_id"", ""salt"")`.* `repartition(n)`See picture:https://preview.redd.it/yo94vesrk2ig1.png?width=5030&format=png&auto=webp&s=399be044a1f8a3e9557553b97056141ed342b0b3In very short pseudocode, here is what I'm doing: data = [] for db in db_list: # Reading from 9 independent source DBs data.append( spark.read.format(""jdbc"").option(""db"", ""table"").load() ) df_unioned = union_all(data) df_unioned = df_unioned.sortWithinPartition(client_id) # This is where I'm stuck: df_unioned = df_unioned.repartition(100, ""salt_column"") df_unioned.write.parquet(""path/to/lake"")Looking at the Physical Plan, I've noticed there is no `Exchange` (Shuffle) happening before the write. Despite calling `repartition`, Spark is keeping the `numPartitions=1` from the JDBC scans all the way through the `Union`, resulting in a 'one-partition-per-client' bottleneck during the write phase.Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope :(PS:A couple of extra points, maybe they're useful:\- This data in specific is quite small, just a few gigabytes (i'm testing on a subset of the full data)\- For the record, the repartition DOES happen: if I do \`repartition(100)\`, I will have 100 tiny files in the data lake. What doesn't happen is the shuffle between nodes or even cores.# SolutionIt was AQE + a later query in the job causing this. This later query, which comes after writing out to data lake, does an aggregation on the \`client\_id\`. Apparently, AQE understands this and goes ""instead of doing two shuffles (1 for repartitioning and another one to aggregate) I'm just gonna do zero since the data is already partitioned by \`client\_id\`"".",7,1.0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qxw5oo/struggling_with_partition_skew_spark_repartition/,2026-02-06 22:33:20,2026-02-08 02:39:28

I’d like to start by saying that this is my first time asking a question in this kind of format. If there are any mistakes, I apologize in advance. I should also mention that I have very little experience in the Data Engineering field, and I haven’t worked in an organization that has a standard or mature Data Engineering team. My knowledge mostly comes from what I studied, and for some topics it’s only at a surface level, with little real hands-on experience.I currently work in an organization that does not have sufficient resources to recruit highly skilled Data Engineering personnel, and most of the work is driven by the data analytics team. The current systems were mostly built to solve immediate, short-term problems. Because of this, I have several questions and would like to seek advice from experienced members of this community.My questions are divided into several parts, as follows:* What kind of Data Tech Stack would be most appropriate (Open Source, Cloud Services, or Hybrid)?* For a Data Orchestrator, is a code-based approach (such as Dagster or Airflow) or a GUI-based approach (such as SSIS) better in the long run, especially if the Data Engineering team needs to scale?* What roles should exist within a Data Engineering team (e.g., Lead, Infrastructure, Operational Service), or is it actually unnecessary to divide the team into sub-roles?* How should we choose Data Storage to suit each layer? Is it necessary to use newer technologies (such as Data Warehouse or Data Lakehouse), or should we choose based on the expertise of the organization’s IT department, which is likely more familiar with OLTP databases?* For a Data Dictionary, should it be embedded directly into table names for convenience, documented separately, or handled through a dedicated platform (such as DataHub)?* To comply with PDPA / security audits, should data be masked or encrypted before it reaches the data storage that the Data Engineering team has access to? And which department in the organization is typically responsible for this?* As someone who can be considered a new Data Engineer, could you please recommend skills that I should learn or further develop?Lastly, if there are any parts of my questions where I used incorrect terminology or misunderstood certain concepts, please feel free to point them out and explain. I’m still not fully confident in my understanding of this field.Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to share their opinions and advice. PS.

1qtc0ag,Recommended ETL pattern for reference data?,Spooked_DE,dataengineering,"Hi all,I have inherited a pipeline where some of the inputs are reference data that are uploaded by analysts via CSV files.The current ingestion design for these is quite inflexible. The reference data is tied to a year dimension, but the way things have been set up is that the analyst needs to include the year which the data is for in the filename. So, you need one CSV for every year that there is data for.e.g. we have two CSV files, the first is *some\_data\_2024.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|423||2|1|the second is *some\_data\_2021.csv* which would have contents:|id|foo||:-|:-||1|13||2|10|These would then appear in the final silver table as 4 rows:|year|id|foo||:-|:-|:-||2024|1|423||2024|2|1||2021|1|13||2021|2|10|Which means that to upload many years' worth of data, you have to create and upload many CSV files all named after the year they belong to. I find this approach pretty convoluted. There is also no way to delete a bad record unless you replace it. (It can't be removed entirely).Now the pattern I want to go to is just allow the analysts to upload a singular CSV file with a year column. Whatever is in there will be what is in the final downstream table. In other words, the third table above will be what they upload. If they want to remove a record just reupload that singular CSV without that record. I figure this is much simpler. I will have a staging table that captures the entire upload history and then the final silver table just selecting all records from the latest upload.What do we think?

1qxso5n,Does partitioning your data by a certain column make aggregations on that column faster in Spark?,Lastrevio,dataengineering,"If I run a query like ``df2 = df.groupBy(""Country"").count()``, does running ``.repartition(""Country"")`` before the groupBy make the query faster? AI is giving contradictory answers on this so I decided to ask Reddit.The book written by the creators of Spark (""Spark: The Definitive Guide"") say that there are not too many ways to optimize an aggregation:>For the most part, there are not too many ways that you can optimize specific aggregationsbeyond filtering data before the aggregation having a sufficiently high numberof partitions. However, if you’re using RDDs, controlling exactly how these aggregationsare performed (e.g., using reduceByKey when possible over groupByKey) can bevery helpful and improve the speed and stability of your code.The way this was worded leads me to believe that a repartition (or bucketBy, or partitionBy on the physical storage) will not speed up a groupBy.This, I don't understand however. If I have a country column in a table that can take one of five values, and each country is in a seperate partition, then Spark will simply count the number of records in each partition without having to do a shuffle. This leads me to believe that repartition (or partitionBy, if you want to do it on the hard disk) will almost always speed up a groupby. So why do the authors say that there aren't many ways to optimize an aggregation? Is there something I'm missing?EDIT: To be clear, I'm of course implying that in an actual production environment you would run the .groupBy after the .repartition more than once. Otherwise, if you run a single .groupBy query, you're just moving the shuffle one step above.",5,0.79,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qxso5n/does_partitioning_your_data_by_a_certain_column/,2026-02-06 20:18:46,2026-02-08 02:39:28
1qwjl09,Data Lakehouse - Silver Layer Pattern,dbjan,dataengineering,"Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the ""medallion"" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.First - on all of these projects we were pushed by the ""data architect"" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).Second - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.Are you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?I understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : DAlso I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..What are your views on this?

1qvjogq,From business analyst to data engineering/science.. worth it or too late?,VERY_LUCKY_BAMBOO,dataengineering,"Here's the thing...I'm a senior business analyst now.

Legacy company, cool people, very nice atmosphere, I do well, team is good, boss values my work, no rush, no stress, you get the drift. The job itself however has become very boring. The most pleasant part of the work is unnecessary (front end) so I'm left with same stuff over and over again, pumping quite simple reports wondering if end users actually get something out of them or not.

I am a recent computer science graduate who started working for a large non-profit organization which is reliant upon an old, very complex, ERP system (say... a few hundred tables, hundreds of millions of records). They don't provide an API, integrations are done by directly touching the database. Each one was developed ad-hoc, as the need arose over the last 2 decades. There is some code sharing but not always. 2 integrations which ostensibly provide the same information may have small divergences in exactly how they touch the database. They are written in a mix of C# and SQL stored procedures/functions. Many of these are very complex. Stored procedures call stored procedures and inserting an entity may wind up touching 30+ tables. A lot of the time, it's required. The ERP manages finances, staff, business operations; there is a lot of conditional logic to determine what to insert, update, delete, etc..

The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.That said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.Given that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",2,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qwztq8/snowflake_native_dbt_question/,2026-02-05 22:28:55,2026-02-08 02:39:28

1quz6kq,Looking for feedback on a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language,Beneficial-Flow-2105,dataengineering,"I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.I’m a Software Engineer in infra/DevOps, but I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.The second is a lack of safe access control. There's a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren't well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.Code here: [https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask](https://github.com/stevenwinnick/big-ask)I’d love any feedback on the project, especially from anyone who works or has worked somewhere where this could be useful.

1qtfbhx,Architecting a realtor analytics system,ItsHoney,dataengineering,"Junior Engineer here. I have been tasked with designing a scalable and flexible analytics architecture that shows you realtors performance in different US markets. What we need: Show aggregated realtor performance (volume sold based on listing/buying side) on different filters like at the state level, county level, zip level, MLS level) and a user can set a date range. This performance needs to be further aggregated together at office level so we can bring out stuff top agents per office.I currently use 3 datasets (listings, tax/assessor, office data) to create one giant fact table that contains agent performance in the areas I mentioned above aggregated on the year and the month. So I can query the table to find out how a certain agent performed in a certain zip code compared to some other agent, or I can see an agents most sold areas, average listing price etc. The Challenge1) Right now the main issue we are facing is the speed.The table I made is sitting inside snowflake, and the frontend uses a aws lambda to fetch the data from snowflake. This adds some latency (authentication alone takes 3 seconds) and warehouse startup time + query execution time) and the whole package comes to around 8 seconds. We would ideally want to do this under 2 seconds. We had a senior data engineer who designed a sparse GSI schema for dynamodb where the agent metrics were dimensionalized such that i can query a specific GSI to see how an agent ranks on a leader board for a specific zip code/state/county etc. This architecture presents the problem that we can only compare agents based on 1 dimension. (We trade flexibility over speed). However, we want to be able to filter on multiple filters.I have been trying to design a similar leader board schema but to be used on OpenSearch, but there's a 2nd problem that I also want to keep in mind.2) Adding additional datasets in the future Right now we are using 3 datasets, but in the future we will likely need to connect more data (like mortgage) with this. As such, I want to design an opensearch schema that allows me to aggregate performance metrics, as well as leave space to add more datasets and their metrics in the future. What I am looking for:I would like to have tips from experienced Data Engineers here who have worked on similar projects like this. I would love any tips on pitfalls/things to avoid and what to think about when designing this schema.

I'm pretty confused because I thought error handling with try-catch was fundamental to most modern programming languages. I know it can be misused (like catching exceptions and doing nothing, or using exceptions for control flow), but completely avoiding it seems extreme. Is there some programming philosophy or best practice I'm missing here? Are there alternatives to try-catch that are considered better?

1qv48tq,The way object-oriented programming is taught in curriculums is dogshit,Basic_Vegetable4195,learnprogramming,"I guess this post is a mini-PSA for people who are just starting CS in college, and a way for me to speak out some thoughts I've been having.I don't like object-oriented programming, I think it's often overabstracted and daunting to write code in, but I'm not a super-hater or anything. I think it can be useful in the right contexts and when used well.But if you learn OOP as a course in college, you'd know that professors seem to think that it's God's perfect gift to programmers. My biggest problem is that colleges overemphasize inheritance as a feature.Inheritance can be useful, but when used improperly, it becomes ridiculously difficult and annoying to work with. In software engineering, there is a concept called ""orthogonality"", and it's the idea that different parts of your code should be independent and decoupled. It's common sense, really. If you change one part of your code, it shouldn't fuck up other parts. It makes testing, debugging, and reasoning about your program easier.Inheritance completely shits on that.When you have an inheritance tower two billion subclasses deep, it's almost guaranteed that there will be some unpredictable behavior in your code. OOP can have some very subtle and easy to overlook rules in how inheritance and polymorphism work, so it's very easy to create subtle bugs that are hard to reason about.So yeah. By all means, learn OOP, but please do it well. Don't learn it the way professors have you learn it, focus on composing classes rather than inheritance.",411,0.92,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qv48tq/the_way_objectoriented_programming_is_taught_in/,2026-02-03 21:05:44,2026-02-08 02:39:29

1qvvr3t,I have too many programming interests,Then-Hurry-5197,learnprogramming,"About me: I'm a 20 year old CS sophomore with ADHD. I have a GPA of 4.0 (full). And I'm absolutely obsessed with programming!For the last 2.5 years I've explored many fields of CS and I've absolutely fallen in love with ALL of them:• Frontend design with Flutter.• Game development with the Godot game engine.• Backend development with Django.• low level system design with C and Rust.• programming language and compiler design with Haskell. Every 6 weeks or so I bounce between my interests and create a project in one of them, and honestly it's been great so far. My peers criticize me and tell me to just choose 1 thing and get good at it. But I didn't listen. I was having too much fun and making steady progress in all my interests.But last week when I wanted to create a bigger game I realized something... I'm missing so many fundamentals of game development despite me learning it for the last 2.5 years !I still didn't know any 3D modeling. Didn't understand Shaders. Barley knew anything about 3D dev in general. Didn't know how to create 2D assets.And this was a pretty bad feeling. I wanted to create something big after 2.5 years of learning; But couldn't do much because I didn't have enough experience.And yeah I realized this pretty much applies to all my interests:• The most advanced flutter app I made is a Basic calculator.• Every game I've made is a 2d arcade game with stock assets.• I haven't even learned Authentication with Django yet.• I don't know how to program in any system language. Just watching random videos about C and C++• I've only created 2 new Programming languages and they're both toy languages with limited use cases.• I'm still not experienced enough with Haskell to create anything I can think of.Honestly I'm having a crisis right now. I feel like I should just focus on backend to get hired and game-dev as my main non-work hobby. But I also love the other stuff so much and don't wanna abandon them !I love all of them so much and I wish I can do everything at the same time.

Its some poorly made AI system that gives you a basic ass task like ""Print hello world 10 times"" despite being at chapters like HashMaps etc.\- There are numerous lessons where they do not actually explain to you what the desired output needs to be (given, you can see that by clicking the ""expected output"" toggle - but you should be able to see exactly what you need to do from the challenge description. \- This last point goes hand in hand with the issue that the output needs to be exact. They had one extra space at the end of their output, despite not showing that because you're tasked with printing the result of each itteration on a new line anyway? Instantly lose the ""first try"" challenge.\- Courses aren't even finished.

Guess what: Section 3 ""Object oriented Programming"" is ""Coming Soon"":trade_mark:.

I got lucky and was able to use a discount code during November to get 30% off monthly subscriptions so it was ""only"" 14.95 a month. Still: I do not feel like that value is really justified. The website has a lot of AI-Slop and wannabe intelligent assistance systems that either fail, timeout (I now know this is a firebase website because the website is printing firebase errors everywhere on every fuc\*\*\* interaction) and lots of lessons are very, very poorly worded.This could've been a 8.5/10 rating but as it stands, I'd say coddy is at best a 4/10 and you should probably look elsewhere.To their credit: They recently updated their Quizz section which made it less buggy and a lot more interactive.",18,0.95,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qxl2ai/coddytech_is_utter_garbage/,2026-02-06 15:43:48,2026-02-08 02:39:29

My usual approach is to first try to solve the problem on my own and then - even if I succeed - watch a YouTube video with deeper explanation to gain better understanding of the problem. Recently, I worked on [LeetCode 778: Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water/). It was a bit different from the problems I had solved before - I hadn't worked on this kid of problems yet. Although I managed to solve it successfully using a min-heap strucutre and a graph traversal algorithm. But it was something new for me, I had never used them two together. If you're an advanced programmer, when you hear a min-heap and graph traversal, you probably know what it means - but I didn't. Only when I was watching an explanatation of the optimal solution on YouTube, I realized that I had actually implemented a Dijkstra's algorithm - an algorithm invented by one of the greatest figures in computer science history. So even though this algorithm was created many decades ago, I was very excited that my analytical and problem-solving thinking process naturally led me to the same solution as Dijkstra's solution many decades ago.

Just now, I switched to a class-based version, where characters are just their own class, complete with position, animation, name, etc. So each one is a 'package' with more different types of data, but kinda usable as-is in the Game file.I did this because I got the impression the first way might become too fragmented, but actually I kinda liked the separate dictionary-version too.

If I had some downtime at work, I’d play around with new thingsPerhaps it’s a lot of very demanding, unpleasant working environments… but now I see code and I feel borderline nauseous. In my own personal life, I don’t really get excited about tech or look forward to any of it. Great, new tech released, I’m not even gonna bother checking it out cause it’s either some sort of scam or will enshittify before I can really enjoy it. I’ll just stick with the 4 apps I use on my iPhone 13, and hope that they don’t deprecate my phone anytime soon cause I don’t want a new oneThe people I’ve worked with since about 2020 feel very different than before. It seems like everyone is more interested in business and finance than they are in tech and product. Many people working in tech seem like they don’t care about it. Tech companies have this very “Harvard MBA” feel to them that I can’t describe. Lots of ladder climbing, lots of clamoring for status and visibility.

This doesn’t have to do with any changes in title, either, cause that’s stayed the same for years. Previously it seemed to be viewed as, at worst, a little quirky.

The thing is, I’ve met at least a small handful of people who have expressed the same feelings to me: tech just isn’t \_fun\_ anymore. I also noticed that it even seems like people at these companies don’t even really believe in what they’re selling, really. Like I don’t get the feeling someone like Sam Altman \_actually\_ cares about OpenAI, it just feels like a griftLike when I think of growing up, I remember video games like world of Warcraft and newgrounds and MySpace.

1qxt8b6,AI Doom and layoffs,iwuvpuppies,cscareerquestions,"I made this post to help explain the current state of software development jobs, especially for new and junior developers. I hope this eases some of your worries. It is long, bear with me.Software Engineering, like any other careers is cyclical. Jobs are at the mercy of demand, trends, and capital. We saw an influx during 2010's and especially during and after Covid (early 2020's) when companies started hiring to hoard talent.Lets get to the layoffs. For those who think layoffs are the direct result of AI, you are not completely wrong. But there are more factors at play. The hard reality is the American economy may be in the midst of economic hardship (recession). This takes us to my first point.1. Companies using AI as an excuse to downsize and make the books look good.First reason: Executive Bonuses. Public companies are at the mercy of quarterly reports. One bad quarter could cost some asshole millionaire his/her job. This sadly incentivizes short term gains and hurts the company long term. But who cares as long as they get their bonus right? AI is a goldmine for execs. They buy a Claude or Copilot subscription and start firing devs. They then take the money they were paying those devs back to the board or shareholders and get rewarded with a bonus.Second reason: Optics. Instead of telling shareholders they need to cut costs (signs of weakness), companies can now conveniently say ""AI Efficiency"". “We don’t need as many people” sounds better than “we can’t afford them”. To top that off, the market rewards any mention of AI with a stock bump. Again the millionaire assholes gets their bonus.2. Management is not immune to industry trends. Leadership is not perfect, they will make mistakes. Unfortunately we are often the victims of those mistakes. Executives talk to peers, copy what other companies are doing, then push it internally. Often times, this comes in the form of asking devs to vibe code/prompts/use agents.3. Take a close look at motivations. The same people dooming and glooming software development are often the ones collecting million dollar bonuses for selling the hype and tools.Below is how things will play out:After management finishes downsizing and the quality of the product goes to shit (either from the vibe coding or short staffing), we will see the following:* Companies admiting AI didn’t deliver the expected benefits* Anyone tied to the AI initiative gets fired (after they get their million dollar bonuses of course)* Start hiring engineers again* AI repositioned as “assistive"" rather than substitutiveTime and time again we have seen this with offshoring, outsourcing and any form of automation.My recommendation, if you enjoy coding, keep doing it. After the hype and fad dies down, this job will continue to be in demand.“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and executive bonuses”",271,0.91,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qxt8b6/ai_doom_and_layoffs/,2026-02-06 20:39:42,2026-02-08 02:39:30

For actual development work, it has proved lackluster.He was pushing that coding was dead and AI should be able to do all of it now, so we should all be much faster. He also mentioned software quality in the same discussion, advocating AI should make it easier. He then gave an example of someone he knew in a well known company who was very experienced, IC6 level, and he was bring told that he needs to use AI or go away. Whilst using AI has been useful, I do think the extent of it's usage is being stretched significantly by people who are even developers or were themselves. How does everyone find using AI for their companies so far? When i make a new side project and do simple client side work, it's great and I rarely need to read any code.

I took a large break to heal and moved back in with my parents to reconnect since I moved far away to pursue this role and I figured it would be easy to land a Job near my hometown which is near a big city.BUT its been about 6 months after I started seriously searching and it feels like all of the jobs openings are in Big Tech and I can barely find roles that would I felt would be regular jobs a few years ago. Every small-mid size company has only 1-2 roles open at a time, if at all, and the competition is intense.

Why is he going through HR instead of coming to me?I gave my reports ratings that I sincerely believe they deserve. My boss is completely non technical and has no idea what makes a good software engineering employee. He's not qualified to rate them. If my employees don't deserve the rating that I gave them, then what do they need to do in order to get the higher rating, since they're already doing those things? I don't know how to respond, because every way forward involves something that has the potential to hurt my career, my employment status, or my integrity.I could lie to my employees and make something up as to why they didn't deserve better. That's likely the best thing for my employment status and career, at least at this company. But it makes me absolutely sick.I could tell my employees that I rated them higher but that my boss, who they have daily contact with, didn't think they deserved it. That doesn't feel like a good idea.I could refuse to change the rating. That's also not going to go well for me.My decision as of right now is that I'm going to set up a . meeting with HR and tell them that I'm not going to change their ratings without some convincing justification.I feel like if my boss wants the ratings changed, then my reports should be moved under him, and he needs to own their ratings. I'm unhappy about it in any case, but I'm more comfortable if he owns what he's done and the software engineers know it was him.

1qyhsyp,"Stuck in a ""Senior Loop""",ShoddyWorkmanshipTed,cscareerquestions,"I was promoted to Senior Engineer originally about 11/12 years ago. After a few years I left the company as I felt like promotion above that was impossible. I was essentially doing the work of other tech leads in the company, but there was always a vague reason promotion to get the title I was already doing wasnt coming. It was always ""next cycle"". I left and went to another company. Hired as a Senior, within about a year or two I'm basically acting tech lead again in terms of responsibilities. But again, every cycle I was told I'd be promoted in the *next* cycle and it never happened. After frustration, I left and started the cycle again at my current company. I'm now approaching my 4th anniversary and the same cycle has played out again, and I'm sensing the same excuses coming as to why no promotion will happen again this year.I'm very frustrated. I'm working at a higher level than my title suggests and have been for a long while now. No offense to the people around me but I now report up through people with much less experience.If I leave, I can't get past a screening for a ""lead"", ""staff"", ""principal"" roles because they want a few years at that title already. If I accept another Senior position, I'm basically back to ""Day 1"" and have to grind to reach the ever elusive carrot or promotion in a few years and I'm worn out of trying hard, having responsibility pushed on me, but never actually getting the reward. What do people at this level do. I'm good at my job from a technical perspective and I seem to be well trusted in terms of people skills, managing a team, but the political side of forcing promotions seems to not be something I'm good at.

1qweuys,I don't enjoy CS anymore,ShakesR12,cscareerquestions,"I am currently in my last year of a Computer Science degree at a T10 public university and will be graduating this June after finishing the degree in three years. I am also minoring in Statistics and Management and have applied for a Master's program as a backup.Academically, I have done well with a 3.7 GPA and I have never really struggled to understand CS concepts. With a few hours of focused studying, I can usually grasp everything and do well on exams. The issue has not been that the material is too hard. It is more about motivation and how I feel about the path I am on.After freshman year, where I honestly did not do much career wise, reality hit me in my second year. I felt like I had to catch up. I took on multiple research projects to make up for my lack of industry experience, built personal projects, constantly took 20 units a quarter along with some community college classes, and spent a lot of time grinding LeetCode. I really pushed myself because I thought that if I did everything right, the results would come.But even after all that effort, I did not see the outcomes I expected in terms of internships or job offers. That gap between effort and results has been mentally exhausting. Over time, the constant grind with no clear payoff has worn me down, and I have lost the excitement I used to have for CS.I have realized that I do not hate problem solving. I still like thinking through ideas and solutions. I especially enjoy working with numbers and seeing patterns, which is why my Statistics and Management minor has felt more interesting recently. What I do not enjoy is the actual process of coding. Sitting and building things line by line feels draining, even though thinking about the solution at a higher level feels engaging.Right now I am not excited about more studying, more interview prep, or more side projects. I want to work and get real experience instead of staying in this cycle of preparation. Applying for a Master's was partly strategic because I have not landed a job yet, not purely because I am excited to keep studying.At this point, I am trying to figure out if this loss of passion is just temporary burnout from overworking myself, or if my interests are actually shifting toward something more analytical or business focused rather than pure software engineering.I know I am just ranting and will probably just get flamed in the comments (please be nice)",73,0.88,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qweuys/i_dont_enjoy_cs_anymore/,2026-02-05 07:27:03,2026-02-08 02:39:30

I am 26F and currently have 5 YoE and an engineering degree from an Ivy. In December, a recruiter from Capital One reached out to me. I guess at one point I had applied in the past and was rejected but my name was in their system and they wanted to consider me for a Senior Software Engineer (Principal Associate) role. I kinda thought eh, what the hell why not, but after a little brushing up on Leetcode I managed to pass the online assessment and the Power Day and am now at the team match phase. The recruiter called me yesterday to let me know that while I still passed, they ultimately are going to offer me a Software Engineer (Senior Associate) role, which is the level below what I interviewed for. I'm honestly shocked I even passed so this is still good news, and according to Levels.fyi I would be making \~160k base in NYC which is significantly more than what I make now.Now that I've passed and I'm waiting to hear back about team match, I was looking on Blind and Reddit about working at Capital One and I worry that the culture is really cutthroat. Apparently every 6 months they PIP 15% of employees per team and it's common for new hires to get cut. This is really concerning to me. My entire career I've been more used to a startup environment where there is obviously a chance of layoffs (and have been through one) but they weren't cutting teams every 6 months. Going from having mostly startups on my resume to having somewhere with more name recognition like Capital One might be more beneficial for my career in the long run, plus the compensation is significantly more than what I make currently. However, I worry that I'll be out of a job in 6 months and with this current job market I don't think most people are in a place to take risks.

1qw8kbe,Got laid off from my first job after 5 years and not sure what to do,Hachitora,cscareerquestions,"Right after graduating college in 2020, I wasn't really confident in my coding abilities. Luckily, I got an offer from a company that was willing to teach me a low-code platform to be a developer in (Pega). Things were pretty ok but I eventually changed roles to do manual QA and I'd been doing that for about 3 or 4 years. Due to government lockdowns and budget cuts, I got laid off and now I'm not really sure what I can do. Since I went into manual QA, my pega dev skills aren't really up to snuff, and my regular Java/C++ skills are definitely extremely rusty. I've applied to both Pega dev jobs as well as manual QA jobs, but I'm trying to figure out what else I can do in the meantime.I'm considering going into pharmacy technician jobs since I have connections there, but on the coding side I'm not really sure what I should do to bounce back. Should I try and relearn my pega skills even though there are less jobs up for that? Relearn java/c++ thru bootcamp or otherwise? Try and learn javascript or python for automated testing roles? New language entirely like Cobol or Rust? I'm just feeling very lost and not sure where the best use of my time would be. Edit: just to mention what my current plan is, right now I'm studying for a pharm tech certification so I can get a job to supplement/replace my unemployment checks.

Can anyone relate?",Disastrous_Regular17,cscareerquestions,"Huge gap between ego driven job posting requirement / interview process and the actual job.C level execs started to force only senior level hires, because AI supposedly magically does junior / mid level job by itself without anyone ""driving"" it.

HR and people involved feel good drafting a super demanding job posting requirement and process. I internally cringe when I compare it to what actually is the job.The truth is no one wants to challenge it, my theory is it’s because in terms of optics. When leaders and execs say they hire senior only, it gives the impression that they are raising the bar, that they work on super hard problems, that the org super mature, etc... No one wants to say the truth that sometimes ""well actually what we work on here is not too hard, let's get a coachable hire we can invest in"". Last we tried we got shut down hard.What happens then, we eventually find someone senior enough that can pass the process, then they are underutilized, get frustrated and leave. Or they stay but invent problems and over engineer (and some important basic work does not get done).In the recent job posting I worked on, we had to remove a line about how ""you will get to coach juniors"" because we literally don't have any now.

On the job however, the actual ""game dev"" part is like 40%, maybe 35% of the project. The rest is system configurations on platforms, bash scripting, networking and front-end, and recently robotics too.

And of course, wouldn't you expect it (even though I'd have loved achieving it and being proud of it), I failed every single deadline. Too many moving parts of it and with the typical managers' requests, made me even more burnt out. The ""internship"" is 5 days/40 hours a week, full on site, with no options for days off. And more than once, I had to (not by my choice, but it did sort of help once) go on weekends to catch up.Eventually, about a month ago, I reached a state of burnout where I'm simply not even doing the bare minimum of a job to not get fired anymore, I couldn't be bothered. Even though the job pays so well at this level, the pressure made me terrified of staying any longer at the company.Am I right to feel that way or do I need to ""toughen up""?Edit: I forgot to mention, we have paid access to AI agents so they handle all the heavy duty I barely write code myself anymore.

If you're here simply because you are looking to make a lot of money, you're in the wrong place""This is what the dean of students told Jordan Belfort (The Wolf of Wall Street) and his fellow classmates his first day of dental school. Belfort dropped out.A lot of you all here need to take some inspiration from that. Gatekeepers are annoying I know but the doom and gloom in this field has reached a point where I, as a senior engineer in this field, feel a call to gatekeep a little bit.The COVID era job market is never coming back - at least not any time soon which may as well mean never for those of you trying to break into this field with no passion. And that word is the heart of what I want to get at here; passion.Obviously there are still dentists today. Most of whom became dentists well after Belfort was a student and discouraged from his dreams. Just as there will be software engineers well into the future.But the people that became dentists despite the market drying up did so because they had a true passion for the field. It still pays well sure but there was a golden age that has now passed and this is where CS is now.This post isn't to straight up tell you to give up on a CS career. But, if you have been struggling to find a job for awhile now, you should take a step back and a bit of time to reflect on why you are here.

That said though, I have to give an answer to them within the next day two days. I’m also in the running for another company that’s relatively larger, would teach me a lot, and most importantly would start me at about 15-20k more base than the first company. The issue is I’ve done 3 interviews with them but would still need to do another in-person and I’m almost certain they won’t give me offer before the deadline for the other offer. With how the economy is right now, declining the first offer and hoping the other one comes through is simply off the table, I have to take the guaranteed offer right now no matter what. That said though, if the other company does come through say a week down the line, I would hate to have to decline the materially better offer due to some unfortunate timing. My question is, would it be acceptable to accept my first offer and then potentially rescind my acceptance a week or two later if I do get a better offer from the second company? I would ideally like to not burn any bridges, but the company is smaller so I’m sure it would impact them a little more. Of course, that would also mean it wouldn’t be the end of the world if I can’t work with them anymore since it’s not a big company with a lot of potential job openings anyways. I’m just not familiar with this area, and I’m not sure if this is like unheard of or potentially career-threatening later down the line.

I’m about to join another similar role with decent TC.The role is stable and pays well, but with the market tightening and big-tech backend roles becoming very selective, I’m worried this kind of experience may not translate well outside finance and could box me in long term.My long-term goal is strong backend/systems engineering, optionality to move to big tech/product companies, and eventually build something of my own.Given the current market:Can buy-side, back-office Python roles still be a good stepping stone to big tech or front office quant roles if I focus on fundamentals?Or is it better to try pivoting earlier, even if it means lower pay or more risk?Would love practical advice from people who’ve switched or consciously stayed.Thanks :folded_hands:",7,0.82,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qt8b5b/earlycareer_backend_engineer_highpaying_python/,2026-02-01 19:36:14,2026-02-08 02:39:30

I don’t see myself continuing to write code in the long term.I want to work more with people, at a “zoom-out” level, have more influence on decision-making, work with stakeholders, etc.On one hand, this sounds exactly like product management, but I’m worried about becoming a junior again in today’s tough market, and also about a potential pay cut (or at least not increasing my salary for the next few years).On the other hand, there’s the team lead path, which is appealing because it preserves some technical involvement (at least at the design and architecture level) and usually comes with higher pay.

1qwg7z8,Should I Pack it Up?,logic_prevails,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR: I have \~3 years of SWE experience (including 2 years at Amazon), but I’ve been out of the industry for almost 2 years due to health issues. In today’s market, is it realistic to get back into an SDE role, and how should I approach it?Hi all. I’m looking for honest perspective from people who’ve been in the industry for a while, especially anyone who has hired or returned after a gap.I have a CS degree and about three years of professional experience as a backend engineer. I spent roughly a year at a banking-as-a-service/fintech company, then two years at Amazon working on backend services. After Amazon, I took time off because I had savings and I needed a reset. What I expected to be a shorter break became much longer because I ran into health issues that took time to resolve. I’m doing better now, and I’m ready to re-enter the workforce, but the gap has me worried; not just because it’s almost two years, but because I’m re-entering during a slower market.I’m currently getting back into interview prep (LeetCode, system design, and behavioral). I haven’t applied broadly yet because I wanted to rebuild momentum first. The part that’s making me anxious is whether recruiters and hiring managers will view the gap as a hard stop, even with the Amazon experience. I learned a lot in that role and I feel like the work itself made me a stronger engineer, but I also know the market can be unforgiving about “recent experience,” and I don’t have that right now.I’m not asking for reassurance so much as a realistic read on how this plays out. Is a two-year gap something that can be overcome with strong prep and a straightforward explanation, or does it usually require a different strategy (contracting first, down-leveling, focusing on smaller companies, heavy networking/referrals, etc.)? If you’ve seen people come back successfully after a gap, what actually made the difference?I’m genuinely committed to staying in software and I want to work in the field I trained for, but I’m also trying to be pragmatic about what the next step should look like. Any advice on how to approach applications, how to talk about the gap without oversharing, and what expectations to set would really help.",6,0.67,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qwg7z8/should_i_pack_it_up/,2026-02-05 08:52:33,2026-02-08 02:39:30
1qu9quf,I feel like I just bombed a phone screen,rickysoliman,cscareerquestions,"Just had a screening with a company for a frontend engineer position. This was my first meeting with them and it was over Zoom. She said they are looking for someone very strong in React and who will be up to par with the staff engineers on the team by the first two months. I've used React but all of my professional experience has been with Angular, which she knows from my resume. It was going okay until she started asking me some technical questions which I didn't expect since it was supposed to be a phone screen type meeting. I stumbled on some of the questions and gave responses that I didn't feel good about, and one question I straight up had to say ""I'm sorry I'm struggling to remember right now.""I'm feeling really bad about it. I'm going to send a follow up thank you email, and I'm wondering if it's a good idea to acknowledge the questions I stumbled on?

Unfortunately, this is my first job and have minimal experience working with a team before they were laid off. I would say my resume is impressive in the sense of taking ownership and delivering software that has actually made an impact and benefitted my colleagues in their operations. This particular project has been my baby and I have raised it to be what it is today. It is very complex for a single early-career engineer to control but I have managed. My point is, there is so much I could talk about this project but the standard is to summarize in your resume what you did in your job. That being said, this is still my first job, no internship experience and no meaningful personal projects to accurately show my skills today. I've been working on a personal project for my own cause and desire and figured I would add it to my resume just to fill the page. However, I haven't even started this project since I am still in the planning phase so I have it marked as ""in development."" It's also not an easy one so it will take me a while to even have a minimum viable product. My priority right now is to get a better job. And yes, I also spend some time on leetcode but most of my interviews have not required it so it's currently my second priority.

I want to start applying for a new position given my pay isn't the best. I have updated my resume and have been documenting and keeping note on what I have been working on while at my current role. I guess my main question is what aspect of applying to new roles should I be prioritizing my time towards? Should I be mass applying to any position that fits my experience, brush up on LeetCode, or just do both?I see a lot of people stressing about learning LeetCode and how most places ask some type of DSA problem. When I was searching for my first position, out of 580ish jobs, only 1 out of the 4 second round interviews I had consisted of answering some LeetCode style problem. I know they were LeetCode problems given the fact that I had actually completed them while studying up on LeetCode (Roman Numeral Conversion, Linked List problem). But also, I hear people say on this subreddit that studying LeetCode ALL DAY EVERYDAY is for people who want to break into FAANG or some adjacent company and that most companies won't be too harsh on applicants knowing how to solve LeetCode problems.
