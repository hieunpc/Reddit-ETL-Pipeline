1q6w5sr,"Does your org use a Data Catalog? If not, then why?",kingjokiki,dataengineering,"In almost every company that I've worked at (mid to large enterprises), we faced many issues with ""the source of truth"" due to any number of reasons, such as inconsistent logic applied to reporting, siloed data access and information, and others. If a business user came back with a claim that our reports were inaccurate due to comparisons with other sources, we would potentially spend hours trying to track the lineage of the data and compare any transformations/logic applied to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies happen.I've been building a tool on the side that could help mitigate this by auto-ingesting metadata from different database and BI sources, and tracking lineage and allowing a better way to view everything at a high-level.But as I was building it, I realized that it was similar to a lightweight version of a Data Catalog. That got me wondering why more organizations don't use a Data Catalog to keep their data assets organized and tie in the business definitions to those assets in an attempt to create a source of truth. I have actually never worked within a data team that had a formatlized data catalog; we would just do everything including data dictionaries and business glossaries in excel sheets if there was a strong business request, but obviously those would quickly become stale.**What's been your experience with Data Catalog? If your organization doesn't use one, then why not (apart from the typically high cost)?**My guess is the maintenance factor as it could be a nightmare maintaining updated business context to changing metadata especially in orgs without a specialized data governance steward or similar.

But it's heavier than what I need.If I use Polars now, am I potentially just building up technical debt? Or is it reasonable to trust it for production long-term?

1qaut4d,"Data Engineer by title, not by work. Feeling stuck and unsure what to do next.",mindwrapper13,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I have a little over five years of experience. I started my career as a Software Engineer working on Python-based full stack applications for 2 years and later moved into a Data Engineer role at a new company because there were very few Python backend opportunities at the time.Over the last three and a half years, I’ve realised that I never really got to work as a “proper” data engineer. Most of my work involved data administration, Python automation, some cloud services, cloud data warehouses, basic data modelling, and a few simple Airflow pipelines that pulled data from APIs and loaded it using pandas. I never worked with Spark or large-scale data pipelines.Now that I’m trying to switch jobs, I’m in a confusing spot. Based on my experience, companies expect me to be a Senior Data Engineer, but I don’t have hands-on experience with many of the tools they expect at that level. At the same time, when I get considered for junior roles, the pay is around 50 percent lower than what I make today. It’s also hard not to compare myself to people with fewer years of experience who seem to have worked on far more complex data systems.I’m willing to start now, learn Spark seriously, build strong projects, and put in the effort. I’m just unsure if it’s too late at this stage or if taking a pay cut is the only way to reset my career. Is there a smarter way to transition into real data engineering without completely derailing things?Any honest advice would really help.TL;DR: 5+ YOE with a Data Engineer title but limited real DE experience.

Still, I keep wondering:Am I doing the right thing by going straight to the cloud and tools, or should I consolidate more fundamentals first?Is it normal for this transition to start out ""confusing"" like this?I would also really appreciate recommendations for study materials (books, courses, learning paths, practical projects) or even tips from people who already work as Data Engineers. Honestly, I'm a little lost — that's the reality. I identified quite a bit with Data Engineering precisely because it seems to deal much more with programming, architecture, and pipelines, compared to the more analytical side.For context, today I have contact/knowledge with:• Python• SQL• R• Databricks (creating views to feed BI)• A little bit of Spark• pandasI would really like to hear the experience of those who have already gone through this migration from Data Analytics to Data Engineering, or those who started directly in the area.What would you do differently looking back?Thank you in advance",20,0.86,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q7sc09/migrating_from_data_analytics_to_data_engineering/,2026-01-08 23:52:17,2026-01-14 01:54:53

I’m trying to decide which (if any) of these projects to showcase on my CV/portfolio/LinkedIn, and I’d love if you could take a very quick look and give me some feedback on which are likely to strengthen vs hurt my CV/portfolio. [**data-tech-stats**](https://github.com/simon-milata/data-tech-stats) ([Live Demo](https://dts.simonmilata.com/)) My latest project which I'm still finishing up. The point of this project was to actually deploy something real while keeping the costs close to 0 and to design an actual API. The DE part is getting the data from GitHub, storing it in S3, aggregating and then visualizing it. My worry is that this project might be a bit too simple and generic. [**Study-Time-Tracker-Python**](https://github.com/simon-milata/Study-Time-Tracker-Python) This was my first actual project and the first time using git so the code quality and git usage weren't great. It's also not at all something I would do at work and might seem too amateurish. I do think it's pretty cool tho as it looks pretty nice, is unique and even has a few stars and forks which I think is pretty rare.[**TkinterOS**](https://github.com/simon-milata/TkinterOS) This was my second project which I made cause I saw GodotOS and thought it would be cool to try to recreate it using Tkinter. It includes a bunch of games and an (unfinished) file system. It also has a few stars but the code quality still is still bad. Very unrelated to work too. I know this might feel out of place being posted on a DE sub but these are the only presentable projects I have so far and I'm mostly interested in DE. These projects were mostly made to practice python and make stuff. For my next project I'm planning on learning PySpark and trying Redshift / Databricks. My biggest issue is that I feel like the difficulty of DE is the the scale of the data and regulations which is very hard / very expensive to recreate. I also don't really want to make simple projects which just transform some fake data once. Sorry for the blocks of text I have no idea how to write reddit posts.

1qahyip,Best Bronze Table Pattern for Hourly Rolling-Window CSVs with No CDC?,SoloArtist91,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, I'm running into bit of dilemma with this bronze level table that I'm trying to construct and need some advice. The data for the table is sent hourly by the vendor 16 times in the day as a CSV that has transaction data in a 120 day rolling window. This means each file is about 33k rows by 233 columns, around 50 MB. There is no last modified timestamp, and they overwrite the file with each send. The data is basically a report they run on their DMS with a flexible date range, so occasionally we request a history file so they send us one big file per store that goes across several years.The data itself changes state for about 30 days or so before remaining static, so that means that roughly 3/4s of the data may not be changing from file to file (though there might be outliers).So far I've been saving each file sent in my Azure Data Lake and included the timestamp of the file in the filename. I've been doing this since about April and have accumulated around 3k files.Now I'm looking to start loading this data into Databricks and I'm not sure what's the best approach to load the bronze layer between several approaches I've researched.Option A: The bronze/source table should be append-only so that every file that comes in gets appended. However, this would mean I'd be appending 500kish rows a day, and 192m a year which seems really wasteful considering a lot of the rows would be duplicates.Option B: the bronze table should reflect the vendors table at the current state, so each file should be upserted into the bronze table - existing rows are updated, new rows inserted. The criticisms I've seen of this approach is that it's really inefficient, and this type of incremental loading is best suited for the silver/warehouse layer.Option C: Doing an append only step, then another step that dedupes the table based on a row hash after a load. So I'd load everything in, then keep only the records that have changed based on business rules.For what it's worth, I'm hoping to orchestrate all of this through Dagster and then using DBT for downstream transformations.Does one option make more sense than the others, or is there another approach I'm missing?",9,0.92,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qahyip/best_bronze_table_pattern_for_hourly/,2026-01-12 01:51:22,2026-01-14 01:54:53
1q6uoz2,Advice - Incoming Meta Data Engineering Intern,Fantastic_Law_5558,dataengineering,"Hi everyone! I was recently fortunate enough to land a Data Engineering internship at Meta this summer and wanted to ask for advice on how best to prepare.I’m currently a junior in undergrad with a background primarily in software engineering and ML-oriented work. Through research and projects, I’ve worked on automating ML preprocessing pipelines, data cleaning, and generating structured datasets (e.g., CSV outputs), so I have some exposure to data workflows. That said, I know production-scale data engineering is a very different challenge, and I’d like to be intentional about my preparation.From what I’ve read, Meta’s approach to data engineering is fairly unique compared to many other companies (heavy SQL usage, large-scale analytics), and a lot of internal tooling. Right now, I’m working through the dataexpert .io free bootcamp, which has been helpful, but I’m hoping to supplement it with additional resources or projects that more closely resemble the work I’ll be doing on the job.Ideally, I’d like to build a realistic end-to-end project, something along the lines of:* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)* Extracting data from multiple sources* Building a DAG-based pipeline* Surfacing insights through a dashboard# Questions:1. For those who’ve done Data Engineering at Meta (or similar companies), what skills mattered most day-to-day?2. Are there any tools, paradigms, or core concepts you’d recommend focusing on ahead of time (especially knowing Meta uses a largely internal stack)?3. On the analytical side, what’s the best way to build intuition, should I try setting up my own data warehouse, or focus more on analysis and dashboards using public datasets?4.

On each notebook run - one run each hour - the notebook makes 1000 API requests. In the notebook, all the API responses get combined into a single Dataframe, and the dataframe gets written to a bronze delta lake table (append mode).Next, a gold notebook reads the newly inserted data from the bronze table (using a watermark timestamp column) and writes it to a gold table (also append).On the gold table, I will run optimize or auto compaction, in order to optimize for end user queries. I'll also run vacuum to remove old, unreferenced parquet files.However, on the bronze layer table, is it necessary to run optimize and vacuum there? Or is it just a waste of resources?Initially I'm thinking that it's not necessary to run optimize and vacuum on this bronze layer table, because end users won't query this table. The only thing that's querying this table frequently is the gold notebook, and it only needs to read the newly inserted data (based on the ingestion timestamp column). Or should I run some infrequent optimize and vacuum operations on this bronze layer table?For reference, the bronze table has 40 columns, and each hourly run might return anything from ten thousand to one million rows.Thanks in advance for sharing your advices and experiences.",7,0.89,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qbs00s/is_maintenance_necessary_on_bronze_layer/,2026-01-13 13:58:26,2026-01-14 01:54:53

BigQuery would eat that up out volume.**Why Looker**I think Looker is very cost effective and can plug in lots of stuff. For eg I can have Spreadsheets for some data and join it in Looker to BigQuery.**Why AirByte**A big part of this is deciding on an ETL. When I started we were using Celigo but found them to be pretty inflexible on billing. It's just a good example of lock-in I want to avoid. So I've been testing the Airbyte Shopify->BigQuery connector and it seems to do what i need. While it has the commercial solution, I feel confident I can switch to the community (open source) version later if I wanted to self host an ETL (which i think is a good long-term strategy in this day and age).**Lock-in thoughts**We are a Microsoft/Sharepoint place and while I don't dislike Azure I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft. We happened to already have Looker and GA because our Shopify vendor preferred it, and the business has never questioned this. So essentially I've put a Google Cloud strategy around these tools, and adding BigQuery is a bit of a no brainer. Obviously there is cloud lock-in to Google here, but in the massive event of Google dropping Looker/BigQuery I reckon we would survive as a business since most of our operational stuff is over in Shopify.**Doubts**The Shopify analytics platform is insanely good. If I could add some custom data to it I wouldn't be here writing this post. But I don't think that's in their business strategy to be a generic BI tool.Unexpected costs are always a concern.

On the other hand, you need visibility into the information (metadata) about that data, which is what a data catalog provides. This is usually in one solution package.

I did go through the search by on this page, and found a decent amount of answers - however I honestly need it explained like im 5 and then I have some follow ups.. and then FAQ won’t open for me. So I’ll start with my background and situation -I’m 29 years old, and I am a EHS (environmental health and safety) manager for a FAANG company. It’s a stable career. However I am not very content there. I kind up ended up in this career on accident, and then ran with it. I used to be a computer science major, and spent a year or so learning coding through books and online programs as well. I withdrew from the course, because honestly I siked my self out of it. I convinced myself the market for that field is just too competitive and that it would be a waste of time for me. Reason I felt I didn’t have a chance is because I’m not really in a position to be able to internships as I cannot leave my job to do any (sole provider family of 5) so I felt I was at too big of a disadvantage.Well I finally decided, I do want to pursue tech because that field is what I truly enjoy. This is part where I need help, I’m having a hard time figuring out exactly what role I should pursue/what the natural progression is for these roles? So to breakdown my interest - I am really interested in all things data, I love engineering/coding, and I’m a big excel nerd. I would like to get into power BI as well, just haven’t jumped on. I do a decent amount of data work at my role now, because my company is huge on metrics/data. I use excel daily to deep dive data and analyze trends and what not on there, and I’ve made a lot of tools/trackers as well.So what I’ve kinda narrowed down for the main data roles areData AnalystData ScientistData EngineerBusiness Intelligence AnalystSo do all these roles progress together like advance through them, or are they all entirely separate paths? I wanted to see if someone could explain them to me like I’m 5, and then maybe tell me which kind of degree is recommended for each one? I have a decent understanding of data analyst/BI Analyst- so are those starting points to eventually become data engineers? Im also confused on this, because everything I’ve read online is that it seems none of them are entry level, so how would I start?The two degrees im tossing around right now are from WGU - either Data Analytics or go back to Computer Science. Are there other/better degrees out there I should explore for this field?TLDR - Questions:\- can someone break down the main different data roles simply and how/if they progress together?\- What’s the better option for a degree - Data Analytics, Computer Science, or is there something else I should explore?\- Which degrees are beneficial for each different data role?\- Is it dumb for me to want to leave my stable career to pursue this?\- Do I even have a chance without really being able to any internships?\-What’s the best role for breaking into this field?Sorry guys I know this a lot!

1qbilj6,Is my storage method effective?,UselessKnave4,dataengineering,"Hi all,I’m very new to data engineering as a whole, but I have a basic idea of how I want to lay out my data to minimise storage costs as much as possible, as I’ll be storing historical data for a factory’s efficiency.Basically, I’m receiving a large CSV file every 10 minutes containing name, data, quality, data type, etc. To save space, I was planning to split the data into two tables: one for unchanging data (such as name and data type) and another for changing data, as strings take up more storage.My basic approach was going to be: **CSV → SQL landing table → unchanging & changing data tables**We’re not yet sure how we want to utilise the data, but I essentially need to pull in and store the data before we can start testing and exploring use cases.The data comes into the landing table, we take a snapshot of it, send it to the corresponding tables, and then delete only the snapshot data from the landing table. This reduces the risk of data being lost during processing.The changing data would be stored in a new table every month, and once that data is around five years old it would be deleted (or handled in a similar way).I know this sounds fairly simple, but there will be thousands of data entries in the CSV files every 10 minutes.Do you have any tips or advice? Is it a bad idea to split the unchanging string data into a separate table to save space? Once I know how the business actually wants to use the data, I’ll be back to ask about the best way to really wow them.Thanks in advance.",3,0.81,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qbilj6/is_my_storage_method_effective/,2026-01-13 05:07:26,2026-01-14 01:54:53

1qaamfb,Low retention of bronze layer record versions and lineage divergence,Personal-Quote5226,dataengineering,"In the bronze layer, our business is ok (and desires) the clean up of older versions of records. In fact, we can't guarantee that we'll be able to keep this history forever. We'll always keep active records and can always re-build bronze with active records. However, we do have gold level data and aggregate fact table, and it's possible that some of the records in gold could be from a snapshot in time. Let's say there are 3 records in a gold fact that summarize a total. Record 1: ID=1, ver=5 ,Amount=$100 Record 2: ID=2, ver=5, Amount=$100 Record 3: ID=3, ver=3, Amount=$50There will be a point in time where this gold fact will persist and not be updated even if Record with ID=1 has a change in the amount in bronze layer. This is by design and is a business requirement.Eventually in bronze, record with ID=1 changes to ver=6 and Amount now=$110.This time, we don't want to update the gold fact for this scenario, so it remains as ver=5.Eventually, in bronze, due to retention, we lose the bronze record for ver=5, but we still keep v=6. The gold still has a record of what the value was at the time and a record that it's based on the record being v=5.The business is fine with it; and in fact they prefer it. The like the idea of being able to access the specific version in bronze as it was at the time, but if it's lost due to retention then they are ok with that because they will just trust the number in the gold fact table; they'll know why it doesn't match source by comparing the version value. As a data expert, I struggle with it. We lose row-version lineage back to bronze, but the business is ok with that risk. As data engineers, how do you feel about this scenario? We can compromise on the implementation, and I believe we are still ensuring trust of the data in other ways (for their needs) by keeping the copy of the record (what the value was at the time) in gold for the purposes of financial review and analysis.

1qbyv1w,Protip: don’t use AI when you are learning programming.,mazda7281,learnprogramming,"I’m a senior developer working currently as a Team Leader for big corporation. We are currently recruiting and amount of junior, mid and sometimes even senior developers, who cannot write a simple code by their own without using AI is absolutely ridicoulous.AI can be helpful at work, but when you learn, it can hurt you more than it helps. It gives you answers too fast. You paste the code, it runs, and you feel good for a moment… but you don’t really know why it works. Then later you get a different problem, something small changes, and suddenly you are stuck. And the worst part is: you don’t build the “debug muscle”, and debugging is a big part of programming.I see this with juniors sometimes. They can produce code, but when I ask “why did you do it this way?” they can’t explain. When tests fail, they panic. When an error shows up, they don’t know what to try first. It’s not because they are not smart. It’s because AI took the hard part away, and that hard part is exactly what builds skill and confidence.When you learn, the best thing is to struggle a little. Write the code yourself. Read the error message. Try to understand what the program is doing. Use print logs or a debugger. Read docs. It feels slow and annoying at first, but this is how you become strong. This is how you start to “see” problems.If you really want to use AI, use it like a helper, not like a driver. Ask for a hint, not a full solution. Ask what an error means. Ask to explain one line.

1qb7a1b,What does a Software Architect actually do all day?,Significant_Loss_541,learnprogramming,I used to think it was about drawing fancy diagrams and picking the latest frameworks. Then I learned its actually the opposite.Most of my time goes into subtraction not addition. Removing dependencies that nobody needs. Cutting connections between systems that shouldnt talk. Simplifying whats already there before building something new.The hardest part is saying no to complexity that feels exciting but solves yesterdays problem.Good architecture is invisible. When it works developers dont fight the system they flow with it. When it fails every change becomes a negotiation with technical debt.Heres what a typical week looks like for me.Monday a new requirement arrives that breaks three assumptions from last quarter. Back to the drawing board.Tuesday and Wednesday are deep work days. Sketching out how systems should interact or better yet how they shouldnt. Looking for the natural grain of the problem.Thursday is code reviews and design discussions. This is where theory meets reality. Developers will tell you very quickly if your elegant solution makes their lives harder.Friday is documentation. Not the kind nobody reads but the kind that answers why did we do it this way when Im not around.The real skill isnt knowing every design pattern or framework. Its knowing when NOT to use them.The best code is code you dont write. The best dependency is one you removed. The best architecture feels obvious in hindsight.Will I miss writing code every day? Probably. Theres something satisfying about seeing your function work perfectly at 2 AM.But theres a different satisfaction in seeing a system that ten developers can understand and extend without calling you. In building something that doesnt fall apart when requirements change and they always do.Thats the job. Not preventing change but making it possible.Do you think architects should stay hands on with code or is the distance helpful?

1q6gacy,How do you deal with the feeling after abandoning a project?,SirIll6365,learnprogramming,"Just wrapped up a month-long project using C++, SDL2, and ImGui. I set out to make a simple app that has the very basic features of Lightroom, but I quickly realized that architecture is a completely different beast than programming the logic. It only does the bare minimum of what I originally planned, and I’m struggling with the feeling that I should have pushed harder. But at this point, the passion for this specific codebase is gone, and I just want to move on.I learned a lot about the build process and package management, but the codebase ended up as a bit of a spaghetti mess. I’m at the point where I’ve learned enough to see exactly why my current design is flawed, which makes it feel impossible to keep working on it without a 100% rewrite.I underestimated how hard it would be to design the software. It took me a while to actually set all the dependencies up. Then came writing the pipeline for it to actually be usable. But with each thing I added, I realized another thing had to be fixed or improved. By the time I had implemented the basic features, I'd gone through countless rewrites. Despite my efforts to keep it as decoupled as I could, the codebase was never as clean as I had wanted it to be.I don't exactly regret making this project since I learned a lot from it. However, I feel like I'd feel a lot better right now if I put that effort elsewhere, or if I actually completed all the features I'd planned on implementing. But I just can't bring myself to work on it any longer. If I want it to be well made then I would have to rewrite the whole thing.

We are storing the first half (left), and the second half (right) in arrays.But apparently, all the magic is happening here: `left_sorted = divide(left)` `right_sorted = divide(right)` `return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)` When I print those values, the output is`[3] [7]``[1] [9]``None None``[2] [5]``[8] [6]``[4] None``None None``None None`aaand I'm officially lost here.My brain is trying to run this line by line.

What are my options?,Crapahedron,learnprogramming,"I'm a manual QA who is interested in learning to code with the purposes of moving out of QA and into a jr role (eventually. I know it's a long game.) My unit is going to be downsizing over the next year or two as our automation platforms increase in scope weening out the need for largescale manual testers. This will be the second time I'm going to get downsized out in replacement for devs. I want to avoid going through this cycle a third time, so I'm making it a priority to start learning development so perhaps I can move into something a little more stable longterm. (Let's pretend AI isn't a thing at the moment.) Here's the issue: I don't really own any personal computers. I've always had work issued machines, and I can't use it for personal projects. What I do have is an old thinkpad (I'm talking really old.) I've since swapped the old harddrive out and replaced it with an SSD and doubled the ram so it's at least functional... I then installed Ubuntu on it. With legacy hardware such as this (it's a thinkpad x220 from 2011....that keyboard tho!) what are my actual options? I know I won't be building native iOS apps on this brick.... but what are some domains I could actually consider working towards some subject matter learning? Coming from a windows only work environment, I'm actually very excited to work in a *unix environment proper. Here are things I'm interested in:* Ruby / Rails (ruby is so funky)* Webdev in general (html/css/js + framework of choice)* C development / OS dev / Kernel Dev (out of my league difficulty wise but probably the most doable on legacy linux machine)* infosec / security (I can mangle this laptop, nobody will care.)* stretch option: windows app dev with c# and visual studioI'm very curious about programs like The Odin project for one of the first two points. Looking through it, its interesting that it forces you to use git and pull down and push up your work into a github repo which is FANTASTIC to replicate a real life workflow. I really don't like writing in the browser based editor for freecodecamp (though, it might migrate me to an editor later in the program I dunno)Given that linux is a brand new thing to me, I'm finding it to be an amazing environment to move around in. It's just so fascinating. It would be a good place to learn C because I'm not afraid of blowing up the machine by messing with a kernel file or something. (I have ubuntu on a bootable USB and can full wipe/install in about 20 minutes)AS someone who only has cursory domain knowledge of these areas of interest, there are likely things I'm not fully aware of, or considering when making a decision.

I really love math and I’m pretty good at problem solving, and just systematic thinking in general, but I’m almost paralyzed when it comes to beginning to code because I just don’t know what syntax to write. Even though I know what my code should theoretically look like, I feel like I forget all the syntax to each language. I’m not helpless of course, I can fair pretty well, but I feel like my hands just can’t keep up. Like conceptually, I’m pretty capable of solving the problems. So far, all my suggested (theory) code have all been great and very efficient, but I am so slow at translating them into good code that it almost doesn’t matter.Safe to say I feel way more confident in discrete math, algorithms, and even pseudocode than here because it just feels like a new language I need to learn (which it is lol).So I was wondering if Codecademy could help me sharpen those missing syntax skills or if it’s just a waste of money.

After some research I have noticed that many people have not gone to school for computer science, yet still work as a software engineer.I have already stated Coursea and their computer programming workshop that gives me certification at the end.

1q99oo3,Personal projects to learn distributed systems,Prestigious_Towel_18,learnprogramming,"Hi there! I'll try to be as brief as possible.I started working as a software developer at a small start-up in February 2025 and ended up leading a small project that's more or less a small fleet manager. There are many things that apps like fleetio have that the client does not require so please keep that in mind. Our team is of two people and a PM.I'm the one that leads the meetings and decides on architecture basically. While I know it sounds completely insane that someone with such little experience is doing this, it has been working well so far and the client is really happy.With that in mind I started reading DDIA because as I have no senior to learn from, it's quite difficult to know how to scale things, how, when to scale, etc. it might not even be necessary that we scale out, but it is a topic I'm super interested in so the book is super helpful.My question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?I had a quick idea to spin up an app like Pastebin to generate unique links of text, just for fun!My idea is :Redis for generation of unique links with snowflake IDs and TTL to reduce bloat and guessable IDs.Kafka for event streaming and eventual consistency among replicas (in different AZs/regions)I am thinking of simulating this by having a primary db and a few read only replicas around the world from AWS. I'm also thinking of adding a load balancer just to learn that too.Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?My apologies if I sound ignorant about these concepts, I just don't talk to many senior folk, and the ones I know don't have distributed systems experience.Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.Thank you for any input you may have and I hope you started the year great!",5,0.73,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q99oo3/personal_projects_to_learn_distributed_systems/,2026-01-10 17:17:05,2026-01-14 01:54:54

I genuinely meant that. However, it has been much harder than I anticipated.Yesterday, I had a call with my team lead and another developer, the one who hired me and is essentially involved in everything (his cracked). They told me that my performance has been slow, especially during the last sprint, and that I’m very close to getting fired. They’re not the ones who make that decision, but they were passing the message along.The cracked one basically told me (unofficially): If I want to keep my job, I need to work on my free-time. According to him, there’s no way to both catch up and deliver expected work within the official eight-hour workday. I don’t think he’s being unreasonable or malicious, he is just a developer after all, he just wants to protect me. I’m willing to put in extra time, but the problem is that I’m also a university student. Realistically, I can only manage an extra two to three hours a day.This sprint fucked me up. It’s Saturday today, and I have homework due next week that I won’t be able to complete properly because I’m spending the weekend trying to avoid getting fired.I feel like I was hired at the worst possible time. The team was already behind schedule, management is panicking, and I’m expected to deliver at an unrealistically fast pace.

They call you, discuss with you and write some notes for the hiring manager. And the hiring manager sometimes blindly trusts the notes that the recruiter is giving them.For example: 1. I told a recruiter I have 6 years of experience in Java. Then her immediate question was ""How many years of experience do you have in ExpressJS"". I said I am not that experienced in Javascript/typescript. To which she responded with ""But you said you have 6 years of experience in Java"". This was one of those job postings that are really vague and don't specify which programming language experience they want. ""Need to have at least 5 years of experience in a modern programming language like Java, Golang, Rust or Javascript/Python"". I applied for the job and had the first screening call with the recruiter.2. Another time I had a call with a recruiter who asked me what I was doing. I told them that I am working in ARM there is an open source library called DPDK, people use it to be networking stacks in userspace. I am working on bench-marking some of the functionality of that library on ARM processors. We are trying to change some of the functionality of that library to use Arm Neon SIMD instructions.She let me blabber on for like 15 mins and then she said ""Alright I need you to repeat everything you told me so far. I need to write notes for the hiring manager"". I sighed and then started repeating everything. And then the second time around she is like ""What is a library?"". ""What is ARM?"". ""Does ARM make processors?"". ""What does it mean that you are optimizing code in a library? Are you a Frontend engineer or a backend engineer?"".At that point, I was like let me write those notes for you. And she was like I need to write these notes myself. And then out of politeness I said ""Look I am not a native English speaker. Let me type out some text for you. You can copy that into your notes. I am not that good at verbal communication."" This was around the point in the call where she asked me to explain to her what SIMD instructions are. She declined that offer.And after the call, I got rejected. This was specifically for a job that required people with experience in ARM Neon.Sometimes I wish I could directly talk to the hiring manager or a software engineer in the team.

I look at some of my classmates and even people with internships and hackathon wins haven't found anything.I think getting a CS degree was a horrible life decision on my part and I regret it immensely, and I only did it because I wasn't raised right and didn't know what else to do and wanted an excuse to hide away from the shitty jobs I worked my entire twenties but I'm 30 now and underemployed lol.I don't know what to do anymore. I don't really have much interest in CS. I don't have enough money to get another degree and will not be able to rely on my dad much longer, and it baffles me how few employment opportunities I have even with a bachelors. I'm not even looking for pity or anything I'm just trying to figure out if my situation is legitimately as bleak as it seems. The economy is fucked up right now too.

So its January and I just got off a call with my company where I was told they like me in this role and are giving me the title and a pay raise to go with it. However, the pay raise was only 7k a year, my total pay is now 85k a year for a technical lead position. I have people below me in this position that make more than I do. Not only is the pay way less than I expected, but my company had a job posting for a Technical Lead where the listed salary was 120k, which is still low but 35k more than I was offered. I feel incredibly insulted by the offer they gave me.I have a few thoughts on what I should do:1. I am thinking about messaging them back and asking for either 130k a year or my old role back. The extra work from the role is worth way more than 7k extra a year, so if I can't get more pay I would rather just be in an individual contributor role and not leadership.2. Or take the offer and try and job hop as soon as I can. While the pay sucks the title is good and could help me land a new role somewhere ill actually get paid well.With that said I am not really in a position to lose this job unless I have something else lined up and while I have been looking for a new role already, I haven't had much luck at all with the market being so bad. I would hope the new title would help, but I am unsure with that. So what do you think I should do? Any advice is appreciated.EDIT: I forgot to add that I never really wanted this role either, the only reason I accepted it to begin with is because I thought it would have nice pay and my family and I could purchase a home. Now it just feels like a role I don't like and the pay sucks, this is why I might ask for my old role back.EDIT 2: I have 6 YOE as a developer almost half of which is with this company. My title before this promotion was junior developer so the jump is pretty significant and why I was expecting my pay to have a significant jump as well.EDIT 3: This is my final update, I spoke with my company and got an extra 10k added to my salary. Its still not where I would like to be but it is better at least. I will probably stick it out another year to have a full year with the title then I will bounce to somewhere that will pay me more.

1q7xn8k,I can't do small talk and I feel like I'm falling behind building professional relationships.,ijustneedanametouse,cscareerquestions,"My current team is very close. They banter and make references with each other. Even with the managers they all rib on each other. To some people being able to banter with your boss is great, to me it just feels like unclear boundaries of what is acceptable to talk about, and so I don't feel comfortable saying anything personal. I feel like an outsider to group of friends. Every time I do pitch in it always feels like the conversation just dies. So I always end up being the quietest one in the group, because I have nothing to say. And so people rarely speak to me or know me. I can tell because people usually talk very straight and professional to me, and then very casually to everyone else. Now this wouldn't be a problem, except that the people who are more talkative have better rapport with higher ups, or get recommended more, and so I feel like I get passed over for projects. But I really struggle with casual talk in a professional environment. A lot of stuff in my team is based on ""tribal knowledge"". There are several people who were hired around the same time as me and I feel like they're already ahead of me, they seem to know the managers better, they seem to be more involved in what's going on in the company. Maybe I unintentionally come off as mean or cold. Definitely robotic. But I'm just nervous and never know what to say. If it has nothing to do with the exact specific task at hand my mind just completely blanks. I wouldn't be able to remember what my favorite movie was if asked. I just don't know what to do because this is always a problem for me. I've tried to learn how to ""small talk"" and it just feels really hallow. I've read a lot about it and it seems to line up with autism in the workplace but I've never been officially diagnosed and I wouldn't even know how I would bring that up in jobs.Anyway, just want to hear some advice or if someone has similar experiences.",49,0.93,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q7xn8k/i_cant_do_small_talk_and_i_feel_like_im_falling/,2026-01-09 03:43:23,2026-01-14 01:54:55
1q7n0zn,Is it dumb to quit my job in this economy?,_lebrons_Hairline,cscareerquestions,"To give a little bit of context,I’ve been working at a small to midsize biotech startup for a few years as essentially the only SWE on my team (although kinda junior). Honestly, I’ve had regrets since joining, since the role didn’t match the job description, and I’ve been operating mostly solo with little direction until more recently.Right now I’m at my breaking point. I’m leading a large, org wide project that touches one of our core critical processes, and I’m doing everything: requirements gathering, design, implementation, data migration, refactoring other teams’ code, qa, documentation, project management, and coordinating with multiple stakeholders. Requirements constantly change, and feedback comes only after features are done, and I end up redoing a ton of work. I mention this pretty often to stakeholders but it still doesn't prevent them from mentioning something that should've been mentioned when I was doing the requirements gathering.Despite this, upper management thinks the project is taking too long and questions decisions without being involved, and can be pretty demeaning to the work that I've done so far. I’ve tried looping them into boards and channels, but it seems like they don't care to look at it and they jump straight to accusations. I've been holding weekly meetings to get everyone aligned and to communicate deadlines as well as providing updates in comms. The core team seems pretty aligned and my boss is empathetic and supportive, and they recognize the work that I do but leadership seems to have unrealistic expectations for our team compared to others. I'm not the only one who sees this favoritism; my boss recognizes it as well.I’m also juggling other requests on top of this and have been working nights and weekends for months now. It was manageable before and I was used to it, until a few months ago I dealt with some personal stuff which fueled the burnout and pushed me towards a mental breakdown and some ideation related thoughts. A week later, I tried to resume everything as normally as I could but I’m still burnt out; panic attacks, nausea, crying before work, the whole shebang. I took a two week break hoping it would help, but I came back dreading everything.To make it worse, leadership is tying my promotion to the success of this massive project, even though they’ve admitted it’s complex and high impact. Its a type of project that can affect all processes org wide if not executed well. I’m exhausted and feel stuck in a repeating pattern of dealing with the upper management talk and possibly gossip/backbiting from teams/management outside the core group. It's getting really frustrating having to deal with the barrage of questions coming in on the last minute by teams who weren't even part of the project group and now have stuff to say. I have a feeling many teams outside view our team negatively. My boss understands and relates to my frustration as well. Reviews of the company have been echoing similar sentiments of it being toxic, having poor/nonexistent management and exhibiting large amounts of favoritism.I’ve been seriously considering quitting for a while now and taking a break (even before this project). I have a lot in savings/investments, stupidly low expenses, and could get by for a while without being a SWE (maybe go into retail or something) while managing to save, but I’m scared given how bad the tech market is and don’t see it improving in 2026. So far, I've been trying to suck it up and disengage but its becoming increasingly difficult to do so with the snide comments here and there.Is it worth staying in a situation like this just because of the economy, or am I burning myself out for nothing? Or should I just wait it out and make them fire me, although its unlikely I get severance? I tried to prep for interviews, but I feel so burnt out that I can't even stand to look at code any more or have the energy to prep after working 12 hours. I feel like my mind is in a constant haze.",47,0.81,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q7n0zn/is_it_dumb_to_quit_my_job_in_this_economy/,2026-01-08 20:29:21,2026-01-14 01:54:55

I truly believed this was my future.I joined engineering college with huge dreams. I thought I would figure things out, land a good job, earn well, and finally change my life. I worked hard and got my first internship through a senior—it was unpaid, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to learn.Later, I got another internship that paid ₹15k per month.

1qbw159,"Intern thrown into a CEO-mandated war room for a critical business project, and I'm drowning. How do I survive?",OniiiCh-Chan,cscareerquestions,"Using my old reddit account because my company knows my old one, but anyway... I'm an intern who was hired about 4 months ago at a very advanced and mature tech company for a software engineering role working primarily on web applications. It was a very exciting time for me because I genuinely did enjoy the work.Recently, my manager (who is a director) met up with me and a few other members from the team to break the news that a certain project's progress was unsatisfactory, and that they're organizing a war room as a result of a direct order from the CEO. Management made it clear that this project was very business-critical and was the highest priority for the company at this time, and I was chosen to be part of this war room, which I was equal parts grateful for and anxious about.I know I was put here mostly to accelerate my learning, but the past month and a half have been *humbling*, to put it lightly. I cannot catch up, no matter what I do and how many hours I work, I struggle a lot performing my tasks because they're at a much higher level than I'm used to.For example, the first task I was given was to come up with an architectural back-end backup solution to a NL2SQL system with high accuracy and high speed, with no additional context and no guidance. I spent close to three weeks (which was already a -lot- of time) searching up all the usual tools (RAG, LLMs, LSH, etc...) and even read close to 6-7 academic papers on the subject before I was able to present something ok-ish. And now I'm being asked to build it, even though the rest of the team has already built their own architectural solution, so I'm not even sure where mine fits in (other than the fact that the tech-lead said mine is research-based and so it could be better, or that we could use certain parts of it if they fix current issues we have).Everyone around me seems to have foundational knowledge that I'm missing (which I know is normal) about how the tech we're using works, how the systems interact with each other, how to dockerize, authenticate, how to productionize the codebases, etc... And my entire expertise so far was working on the front-end using React and nothing else. They're all working +12 hours - +16 hours per day, even on weekends, and their pace is so fast that I end up spending more time figuring out what has changed, and while I'm figuring *that* out more stuff is being changed, so on and so forth.I have barely made any contributions and I don't even feel like I'm learning because everyone is way too busy for me to even ask. Just for additional context, the people this project is being presented to are literal minsters or above (without mentioning names, but this project interests a lot of really important people) which is why I'm so hesitant to ask for help because I need a lot of it and they simply just don't have time when it's this important. They offered to help if I have questions, and I did try sometimes, but it feels I always get the quickest briefest answer, and usually I don't understand the answer fully because they assume I have the same level of understanding they do and I hesitate to ask any follow-up questions because of the vibe.I thought it would be a better experience because I thought I would at least be a little more capable, but so far I've been feeling terrible most days. I'll just suck it up and keep on going, but I was wondering what should I do with the remaining time in this war room to make the most of it?",41,0.82,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qbw159/intern_thrown_into_a_ceomandated_war_room_for_a/,2026-01-13 16:33:11,2026-01-14 01:54:55

I had amazing people in my team my seniors have taught me stuff about architecture, decisions, patterns, technologies, every day I was asking less questions and everyone said I was doing fucking amazing and rocking everything, they even let me be on business meetings to discuss business logical decisions and they let me run the project alone for a week. They’re extremely happy with me.Then after one year I started to introspect and look into the present and future and came to some conclusions…My job is fucking easy. I get figma designs, use storybook to pop components and use props to build UIs, then organize stores, hooks, forms, validations, tealium for analytics, A11Y, simple state management and maybe a few edge cases… but it’s a traditional bank not rocket science, SPAs are as simple as they get.

1qbc38w,What's next if you no longer want to code?,FinishTheBucket,cscareerquestions,"I would like to preface this by acknowledging that I'm in a fairly privileged position and I don't want this to sound like I'm not grateful for it. I've been working as a full stack engineer uninterrupted since early 2019. I started at a major US bank, went to a streaming service and now I'm working in ecommerce for a mid-major regional retailer; I don't think I'm anywhere near being a 10X whiz kid dev but I've never had anything less than Above Average ratings on performance reviews and I would say I'm generally perceived as competent at the least. My problem comes in that none of these jobs, tasks or projects have given me anything close to resembling satisfaction. I think I've come to realize that while I like solving problems, building tools for people to use and seeing all the cool things we can do, I don't like basically everything else that makes up our jobs as engineers. I don't find joy in upgrading Node versions or repositioning a button to increase customer retention; optimizing our add to cart functions feels like a waste of time to me when it already works and we see no impact on metrics in the slightest. I have trouble bringing myself to care about code coverage in tests for features that no one actually wants and likely only a handful of folks will ever use. I exercise, I eat enough, I drink water and pay my bills on time but I can't imagine myself doing this for the next thirty years of my life. So what's the ""escape plan""? I've considered going back to school for an MBA but having spoken to many consultants who have taken that path I don't think it's for me. For a while I also looked at going back for a Masters in CS but that felt like a great way to further pigeon hole myself into only being seen as Guy Who Codes. It also seems silly to just move laterally and become a pure 'product/manager' person who comes up with or supervises the new features that bum me out so much to build. Speaking to folks older than me, the common advice is go speak with a career counselor but the two experiences I've had with them reminded me far too much of those quizzes you had to take in middle school that suggested career paths. This forum has helped me out a lot in the past by giving good feedback, tough love, and even just hearing that others are in the same boat so I come to y'all hat in hand wondering - am I crazy for feeling like this? How does one take these skills into some other direction? Is the best advice here to just suck it up and double down on my hobbies, finding joy outside of work?

Since then it's been 2 years of me searching for entry level positions to try and start over but I rarely get interviews (once every \~300 apps). Anyways, I see very negative opinions on Wipro and I'm worried that the reason why I rarely get interviews is because of my association with them.

1qbb5z0,Some Tips For New Grads and Job Search in General,AccomplishedSea8675,cscareerquestions,"Strategy for Applying and How to get More Responses:* Do apply to any and all big companies. This includes Big Tech (tech companies such as Google, Datadog, OpenAI, FAANG etc.) but also includes big non-tech companies (think Walmart, Target, Ford, Epic to a certain extent). However, be prepared to never get responses from these. The conversion rate of responses from these is a lot lower than other companies. This is due to both the amount of people applying, you applying later than other people (they may just only look at the first X number of applications), but also the amount of company leadership, direction, and planning changes that are typical with these big companies (these are expected). You may not get a response and that may mean nothing with your resume or applications. Which leads us to...* Apply to startups and / or small businesses. There are a lot of startups out there that may benefit from your specific experience or skills. Where do you find these though? ycombinator, workatastartup, builtinnyc, wellfound are good places to start. More than applying, here is where you might need to ""network"". Look at the founders, look at the people working there. Referrals here are a lot more helpful than in Big Tech companies, because things at smaller companies are a lot more personal and less automated. This is how I found my early-stage startup job. So you might want to look at founders / early employees; see if you have any connections on LinkedIn or went to the same school. See if you have any secondary connections. Reach out to people. Even if not, you can cold message on LinkedIn. You may not get a lot of responses. That's ok / expected. * Startups are less cyclical in their hiring, meaning they may hire at random times / year round / for the right person / after fundraises. My experiences:* Have gone through extensive job searches 3X. This helped a ton. Each cycle required 300-700 apps each. Got a random job in 1, an early stage startup the 2nd time, Big Tech the 3rd time.* Anecdotal evidence: Applying with or without a cover letter does not seem to matter in my case, at least it didn't in my experience. The places I got interviews I didn't use a cover letter.* For startups, things are a lot more informal... even cold reached out to someone on LinkedIn (alum from my school) once to ask about their experience at their startup, and it turned into an interview lol (for which I got to the final round). They didn't even have a position open, but were willing to hire for the right engineer.* Have gotten Amazon, Datadog offers (and currently work at Datadog)",14,0.82,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qbb5z0/some_tips_for_new_grads_and_job_search_in_general/,2026-01-12 23:36:16,2026-01-14 01:54:55

Very pro WLB, whenever we work late lets us take time back , reasonable deadlines, lets us take few hours here and there for doctors apt without PTO, etc.* Amazon is also doing layoffs again at the end of January, I could technically just stall the financial firm offer once I get it and use it as a backup plan.

Very unsure about this as and I personally feel I lack the social chops for this. I don't think I'd like to manage people in general..* Role sounds more design/architect heavy with some automation. Definitely going to wear a lot more hats vs being silo'd at Amazon.* Probably better for my mental health and social isolation to actually go to a office and be with coworkers (I've been kinda fucked since Covid working at Amazon)Basically, it seems that staying at Amazon would mean a lot more uncertainty in terms of layoffs, forced relocation, but likely more money long-term.The immediate 100k\~ sign on bonus would be tempting as well in this crappy economy and I need more savings (my savings has kinda been a little low due to unexpected events).Wanted to get y'alls opinion. Just feeling very unsure - gut feeling I have now is that socially and mental health the financial firm might be better for my personal growth as a person, but Amazon might be more comfortable and better money.

1q6853b,"NYC vs LA for first full-time role (same company, same pay) + negotiation questions",pineapplepiedoo,cscareerquestions,"**Update: I decided on NYC. Thanks for all the input!Update2: was able to negotiate for slightly higher base!**Hi all! I recently received a full-time offer at a company where I previously interned, but in a different org. The role is best described as analytics engineering (data pipelines, dashboards, some modeling).Offer details:* Base: \~$105k (about 75% of the band)* Bonus: 10%* Role is listed as 0–2 YOE* No master’s required (I do have one)* Same pay regardless of location* Office options: West Hollywood (LA) or Midtown Manhattan (NYC)I need to choose a location fairly quickly and want to make a decision that makes sense for both lifestyle and long-term growth.# About me / context* Single, 25F* Early-career, no full-time experience yet* Strong academic background (T10 undergrad + top specialized MS; more math/data science, lighter formal CS)* Exploring whether to pivot further into AI engineering or SWE — I’ve built a couple of agentic systems recently and really enjoyed it, though I also recognize I may have only scratched the surface* Very arts-oriented and tend to feed off the energy of my surroundings* Concerts, performing arts, and creative scenes matter a lot to me outside of work* Love warm weather and the beach (would go multiple times a week)I’ve lived full-time in LA (\~1.5 years) and part-time in the NYC metro area (frequent trips into the city). Toward the end of my time in LA, I started making friends and building more of a social life, but it still doesn’t fully feel like “home.” In contrast, I have longer-term roots in NYC (school, family, and other involvements over the past decade), even though I haven’t lived there full-time before.# How I’m thinking about NYC vs LAAfter looking closely at housing, one clear difference is space vs density:* In NYC, I’d ideally want to live in downtown Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn, which is meaningfully more expensive for the space you get. I’d absolutely need a roommate.* In LA, I could live very close to work in West Hollywood, with more space for the same money. I’d still want a roommate, but it feels less constrained.This doesn’t feel like a good-vs-bad lifestyle decision — more like a tradeoff:* NYC: less space, more density and stimulation, amazing energy, easier access to arts and ambitious people, diversity in industries* LA: more space, easier day-to-day life, amazing weather, and beach access, but sometimes feels slower or understimulatingOne thing I’m genuinely unsure about is whether NYC actually provides more motivation and momentum early in a career, or whether that’s more about finding the right community in either city. I don’t yet have a strong network in either place, so I’m aware my perception may be biased by who I’ve met so far.For future context only (not a third option right now): I’ve also spent a lot of time in San Francisco and could see myself there down the line, especially if I pivot further into tech — so future flexibility is something I’m thinking about — but this decision is strictly NYC vs LA.# Negotiation contextI’m also in the process for two other roles:* One might pay similarly, the other potentially more* Neither is likely to wrap up within the next \~1.5 weeks, and I may need to sign this offer before thenThis current offer is the best fit in terms of work itself, but I’m unsure how to think about negotiation given:* I’m already \~75% into the band* I don’t have full-time experience* I do have a master’s, which is more than the role formally requires# My questions1. Given everything above — my career stage, personality, priorities, and the work itself — which city would you choose for me: NYC or LA? Why?2. For people who’ve lived in both, how did each city actually affect your motivation, growth, and day-to-day energy early in your career?3. Negotiation: * Would you negotiate at all in this situation, given I can’t risk losing the offer? * If yes, when is the right time: after receiving the written offer, or only if another offer comes in (even after signing)?Thanks so much — really appreciate any insight.

1qafxa7,"Do Agents Turn us into ""Tactical Tornadoes?""",ewheck,cscareerquestions,"I'm reading John Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design* and Chapter 3's discussion of the ""tactical tornado"" led me to think about how we use LLMs and agents in our profession. The relevant section of the book goes as follows:>Most programmers approach software development with a mindset I call tactical programming. In the tactical approach, your main focus is to get something working, such as a new feature or a bug fix. At first glance this seems totally reasonable: what could be more important than writing code that works? However, tactical programming makes it nearly impossible to produce a good system design.>The problem with tactical programming is that it is short-sighted. If you’re programming tactically, you’re trying to finish a task as quickly as possible. \[...\]>Almost every software development organization has at least one developer who takes tactical programming to the extreme: a *tactical tornado*. The tactical tornado is a prolific programmer who pumps out code far faster than others but works in a totally tactical fashion. When it comes to implementing a quick feature, nobody gets it done faster than the tactical tornado. In some organizations, management treats tactical tornadoes as heroes. However, tactical tornadoes leave behind a wake of destruction. They are rarely considered heroes by the engineers who must work with their code in the future. Typically, other engineers must clean up the messes left behind by the tactical tornado, which makes it appear that those engineers (who are the real heroes) are making slower progress than the tactical tornado.I do not work at a company that has widely adopted the usage of agents (a handful of people in my department have access to Devin), but I have noticed most pro-agent discourse revolves around how you can improve the speed of development and ship faster. From the passage I quoted, it seems like speed of development is not considered a universal good by all and focusing on it can have drawbacks.Since I do not have the experience to comment on this, my question for those who have heavily adopted the usage of agents themselves (or work on teams where many others have) is have you seen any of these negative outcomes whatsoever? Have you experienced any increase in system complexity that may have been easier to avoid had you iterated more slowly?Ousterhout's alternative to tactical programming is strategic programming:>The first step towards becoming a good software designer is to realize that **working code isn’t enough**. It’s not acceptable to introduce unnecessary complexities in order to finish your current task faster. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system. Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a developer is to facilitate those future extensions. Thus, you should not think of “working code” as your primary goal, though of course your code must work. Your primary goal must be to produce a great design, which also happens to work. This is *strategic programming*.When I see the power users discuss how they operate with several different instances of Claude working concurrently, I can't help but think that it would be nearly impossible to work with a ""strategic"" mindset at that level. So again, a question for those who have adopted this practice, do you attempt to stay strategic when basically automating the code-writing? As an example of what I'm asking, if you feed an agent a user story to implement, do you also try to ensure the generated code will easily facilitate future extensions to what you are working on apart from the user story itself? If so, what does that process look like for you?",8,0.7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qafxa7/do_agents_turn_us_into_tactical_tornadoes/,2026-01-12 00:22:42,2026-01-14 01:54:55
1q91kus,Am I cooked? Seeking advice,Disastrous-Injury584,cscareerquestions,"So in this past December i’ve completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from a T20 (I think) with a 3.0 GPA (not on my resume)I didn’t have any Swe internships. All I have is around 2 years of IT experience (service desk at school) and some web development experience I got from developing for a friends business. (Which I have included on my resume as work experience) I have some projects, but obviously am working on building better ones that align with jobs I apply for. I will have acquired Sec+ by the end of this month. (Will explain why I’m getting this cert) So I’m just wondering if I am too cooked for this field and should pivot to IT, or keep trying?My current fallback hopes are that with my 2 years of entry IT experience and Sec+ that I can at least land some sort of IT role and pivot to something better after that if I can find something that can sponsor me for a clearance. I want to know if it is a realistic goal for me to land something in software in the defense industry because I live in the DC area and I assume that these jobs will have a lower barrier to entry. With Sec+ and my experience, is this still an attainable goal? Or is the industry just too cooked for hoping that this is even an option anymore?I’ve also started studying for Aws certified cloud practitioner as recommended by my employed friends. Is this worth my time? It does seem like a very easy cert. I do have a decent network (many friends, mutuals and relatives in tech in my area), really thankful for that. I hope to utilize it as much as possible for referrals. I have done tons of resume review and I believe my resume is solid. I am also interested in getting into Tech consulting as that is a big field in this area. Can anyone give me tips for that? Side note - I am a US citizen, born and raised, and should have no problems with getting a security clearance. My questions: Are my goals still realistic?Should I change anything?Am I cooked?Anything else I should know? My plan now is to: 1. Apply aggressively for any entry level IT positions to secure some type of a fallback by June-ish and hopefully have some way of getting sponsored for a security clearance. 2. Also apply to defense software roles for the chance to go straight into my dream field. 3. Keep my skills sharp with Leetcode and projects TLDR: Am I cooked for software jobs? New grad.

What would you do?",QuantumQuack0,cscareerquestions,"So, finally the vacancy I thought I had been waiting years for, has appeared. It's in a certain deep-tech field, on the crossroads of physics, embedded, and networks engineering. The vacancy itself is for embedded software.Problem is... while I have actual experience with the physics (down to the literal same kind of physical system), I _want_ to work on the control/embedded side of things. But I have no C++ experience, and they explicitly ask for that.Professionally, I've only worked in python. I've dabbled a bit in Rust, a tiny bit in C++, and embedded C. I've played around with microcontrollers for a bit, but there aren't really any projects I'd like to do here at home so I didn't stick with it. I'm just afraid that, if they somehow pick me, I will make critical mistakes very early on in the product development (as the <10th employee).The other thing is that, for me, it's _yet another_ startup in this field. I've worked at two similar startups now, where I've started bright-eyed and bushy-tailed only to absolutely f%%%ing hate it after 2-3 years. My first job was a very similar, very young startup, where I worked more on the physics-side of things. Given that it was a young startup and I was full of ideas, I worked myself to death. And in the 3rd year, due to that and the fact that I started disagreeing with the direction, I quit.My current job is at a more mature startup, on paper not a startup anymore now. Much better WLB, but the startup-like shenanigans are also getting to me here. Tons of technical debt, move-fast-and-break-things, poor communication because we've grown fast but not matured... everything is a mess and it's killing me.I don't know if I should apply. I actually know the founders/current employees (not super-close but I was a MSc student under one of them, and worked with 2 others during that time) and I'm honestly pretty good at interviewing, so I think I actually have a chance. But part of me just wants to get out of this startup life and the hype around this field. I feel like work has occupied my life far too much ever since my graduation.I just want to chat with you guys and ask, what would you do? What advice do you have?Edit: I realize the reason for this post may be a bit unclear. For context, I've actually really come to hate my current job and want to leave asap, but don't want to jump from the frying pan into the fire.",7,0.72,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q90qcc/a_vacancy_for_my_dream_job_just_opened_up_but_now/,2026-01-10 10:23:28,2026-01-14 01:54:55
