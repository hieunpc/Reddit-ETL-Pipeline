1rag36f,Red flag! Red flag? White flag!,Street_Importance_74,dataengineering,"I am a Senior Manager in Data Engineering. Conducted a third round assessment of a potential candidate today. This was a design session. Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. It was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know? Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. When I realized, my gut reaction was a ""no"". The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. I started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?I ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing. Good luck to all on both sides of this.",132,0.78,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rag36f/red_flag_red_flag_white_flag/,2026-02-21 03:10:20,2026-02-25 02:21:46
1rbk3ov,New CTO has joined and is ignoring me,anxiouscrimp,dataengineering,"Keen for any thoughts or feedback.Background - I’ve worked at my current employer, a mid-sized luxury retailer. We turn over about £200m annually. I’m the sole BI architect and have been for the last 5 years or so. I’ve been with the company for 11 years. I do everything - requirements, building out the data warehouse, building and maintaining the cubes, some SSRS development. In the last two years I’ve designed and built a new ELT framework for us to move away from SSIS and integrate to all of our various disparate systems - ERP, CRM, GA4, digital marketing platforms etc etc. Then I’ve cleaned all of this data, modelled it and built a PBI semantic model on top to bring everything together. That’s the first (and biggest) phase of replacing our existing estate.Challenge - I had a very good relationship with our previous CTO. Now a new CTO (a contractor) has joined and he seems to be completely ignoring me. We’ve barely had any interaction. He’s worked with GCP in the past and immediately has set up meetings with a google partner. In the first meeting they opened with ‘so we understand that you’ve got a very fractured data estate with no single source of truth’ which is just totally untrue. But this CTO seems to have no interest in engaging with me in the slightest and I’m hearing from other people that he just wants to ‘move us to bigquery’. We’re entirely on Microsoft for everything - not just BI - so this is an enormous piece of work without a clear benefit. In my opinion the issues we have are generally people based - not enough people and certainly not enough people translating data into something actionable or understandable. I’m open to the idea of moving some or part of our estate to GCP - but shouldn’t such a large move like this be considered in the context of ‘what problem are we trying to solve?’I’m feeling pretty upset - I’ve given a lot to this company over the years and this behaviour feels disrespectful and weird. I’m keen to hear from anyone if they’ve seen this behaviour in the past and how to approach it. At the moment my plan is to write a document outlining our current data estate for him to read and then talk him through. Obviously I’ll also update my CV.TLDR: new contract CTO has joined and is ignoring and sidelining me. He seems very intent on moving us to GCP despite not really understanding any of our actual challenges. Why is he doing this? Is this a strategy?",127,0.92,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rbk3ov/new_cto_has_joined_and_is_ignoring_me/,2026-02-22 12:00:41,2026-02-25 02:21:46

Copilot CLI for scaffolding, repetitive edits, quick drafts. It's good. I'm definitely faster.What I don't get is the vibe at work lately.People are running around talking about how many agents they're running, how many tokens they burned, autopilot this, subagents that, some useless additions to READMEs that only add noise. It's like we've entered some weird productivity cosplay where the toolchain is the personality.In practice, for most of my tasks, a good chat + targeted use of Copilot is enough. The hard part of my job is still chaining a bunch of moving pieces together in a way that's actually safe.

Manager delegated the business case writing to me, then won't sign off. One is a \~$20K/year tool well within his budget.

It's probably more of a political question.I was recently very much puzzled. I've been tasked with modernizing data infra to move 200+ data pipes from ec2 with worst possible practices. Made some coordinated decisions and we agreed on dagster+dbt on AWS ecs. Highly scalable and efficient. We decided to slowly move away from redshift to something more modern.Now after 6 months I'm half way through, a lot of things work well. A lot of people also left the company due to restructuring including head of bi, leaving me with virtually no managers and (with help of an analyst) covering what the head was doing previously.Now we got a high-ranked analyst from the larger company, and I got the following from him: ""ok, so I created this SQL script for my dashboard, how do I schedule it in datagrip?"" While there are a lot of different things wrong with this request, I question myself on the viability of dbt with such technicality of main users of dbt in our current tech stack. His proposal was to start using databricks because it's easier for him to schedule jobs there, which I can't blame him for.I haven't worked with databricks.

1rdf9gk,"Dev, test and prod in data engineering. How common and when to use?",No-Buy-3530,dataengineering,"Greetings fellow data engineers!I once again ask you for your respectable opinions. A couple of days ago had a conversation with a software engineering colleague about providing a table that I had created in prod. But he needed it in test. And it occured to me that I have absolutely no idea how to give this to him, and that our entire system is SQL server on prem, SQL server Agent Jobs - all run directly in prod. The concept of test or dev for anything analytics facing is essentially non-existent and has always been this way it seems in the organisation. Now, this made me question my assumptions of why this is. The SQL is versioned and the structure of the data is purely medallion. But no dev/test prod. I inquired AI about this seeming misalignment, and it gave me a long story of how data engineering evolved differently, for legacy systems its common to be directly in prod, but that modern data engineering is evolving in trying to apply these software engineering principles more forcefully. I can absolutely see the use case for it, but in my tenure, simply havent encountered it anywhere. Now, I want my esteemed peers experiences. **How does this look like out there ""in the wild"".

Because right now my pipelines are about as self healing as a broken arm.

That's not self healing, that's just regular healing with extra steps.I get that there's a spectrum here. Some tools do automatic retries with exponential backoff which is fine but that's just basic error handling not healing. Some claim to handle api changes automatically but I'm skeptical about how well that actually works when a vendor restructures their entire api endpoint. The part I care most about is when a saas vendor changes their api schema or deprecates an endpoint. That's what causes 80% of our breaks.

1ra5zg4,Does database normalization actually reduce redundancy in data?,Lastrevio,dataengineering,"For instance, does a star schema actually reduce redundancy in comparison to putting everything in a flat table? Instead of the fact table containing dimension descriptions, it will just contain IDs with the primary key of the dimension table, the dimension table being the table which gives the ID-description mapping for that specific dimension. In other words, a star schema simply replaces the strings with IDs in a fact table. Adding to the fact that you now store the ID-string mapping in a seperate dimension table, you are actually using more storage, not less storage.This leads me to believe that the purpose of database normalization is not to ""reduce redundancy"" or to use storage more efficiently, but to make updates and deletes easier. If a customer changes their email, you update one row instead of a million rows.The only situation in which I can see a star schema being more space-efficient than a flat table, or in which a snowflake schema is more space-efficient than a star schema, are the cases in which the number of rows is so large that storing n integers + 1 string requires less space than storing n strings.

GIS to DE,minimon865,dataengineering,"I‘m gonna try to make this as short as possible.Basically I have a degree in GIS, sometime after that I decided I wanted to do broader data analytics so I got a job as a contractor for Apple, doing very easy analysis in the Maps Dept. It was only a year contract and mid way I applied to grad school for Data Science. At the beginning of my program I also started a Data Engineering Apprenticeship, it went on for almost the whole school year. I completed my first year with great grades. That summer I started a summer internship as a “Systems Engineer“. The role was in the database team and was more of a “Database Admin“ role. This is where the story takes a dumb turn. I’ll never forgive myself for having everything and letting depression ruin me instead.At the beginning of my internship I had 3 family deaths and I spiraled. I stopped trying at work, was barely doing things just to get by. I remember even missing a trip to a data center that my team was going on. I isolated myself. I even got a full time offer in the end and I never responded to the email. I wasn’t talking to anyone. 2nd year started and I started to attend but stopped eventuall. I should have dropped out but I couldn’t even bring myself to type up an email. I just failed and didn’t re-enroll. I moved in with my brother bc I wasn’t taking care of myself. I essentially took a year off, which consist of me getting help. After about a year of the fog dissipating, I finally felt ready to try again. I’m not re-enrolling in school bc I’m pretty sure my GPA tanked, and I realized DS isnt my passion, I REALLY REALLY enjoyed my DE apprenticeship and constantly using SQL in my database role. All that said, I have been job searching for about 8 months now. Which totals to 1 year and 8 months since my last “tech” role. This looks so so bad on paper. What would you guys do if you were me? How would you go about making yourself marketable again? I am applying for very low level roles bc I think that’s they only thing I qualify for right now; data entry w SQL, Data Reporting, Data Specialist, etc. TLDR: I had my career going in a great direction towards DE and let depression ruin everythin.

1raf9oj,Spawn: PostgreSQL migration and testing build system with minijinja (not vibe coded!),Winsaucerer,dataengineering,"Hi! Very excited to share my project **spawn**, a DB migration/build system.For now, it supports PostgreSQL via `psql` to create and apply migrations, as well as write golden file tests (I plan to support other db's down the line). It has some innovations that I think make it very useful relative to other options I've tried.**GitHub:** [https://github.com/saward/spawn](https://github.com/saward/spawn)**Docs:** [https://docs.spawn.dev/](https://docs.spawn.dev/)Shout out to minijinja ([https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/)) which has made a lot of the awesomeness possible!Some features (PostgreSQL via `psql` only for now):* Create SQL (for tests or data insertion) from JSON data sources* Store functions/views/data in separate files for easy organisation and editing* `git diff` shows exactly what changed in a function in new migrations* Easy writing of tests for functions/views/triggers* Env-specific variables, so migrations apply test data to dev/local DB targets only* Generate data from JSON files* Macros for easily generating repeatable SQL, and other cool tricks (e.g., view tear-down and re-create)I started this project around two years ago. I’ve finally been able to get it to an MVP state I’m happy with.I created spawn to solve my own personal pain points. The main one was, how to manage updates for things like views and functions? There's a few challenges (and spawn doesn't solve all), but the main one was creating and reviewing the migration. The typical (without spawn) approach is one of:1. Copy function into new migration and edit. This makes PR reviews hard because all you see is a big blob of new changes.2. Repeatable migrations. This breaks old migrations when building from scratch, if those migrations depend on DDL or DML from repeatable migrations.3. Sqitch rework. Works, but is a bit cumbersome overall with the DAG, and I hit limitations with sqitch's variables support (and needing Perl) for other things I wanted to do.Spawn is my attempt to solve this, along with an easy (single binary) way to write and run tests. You:* Store view or function in its own separate file.* Include it in your migration with a template (e.g., {% include ""functions/hello.sql"" %})* Build migration to see the final SQL, or apply to database.* Pin migration to forever lock it to the component as it is now. This is very similar to 'git commit', allowing the old migration to run the same as when it was first created, even if you later change functions/hello.sql.* Update the function later by editing functions/hello.sql in place and importing it into your new migration. Git diff shows exactly what changed in hello.sql.Please check it out, let me know what you think, and hopefully it's as useful for you as it has been for me.

Where would you even start debugging this?",MitocondrialPoro,dataengineering,"Hej all,I am running in to a metrics consistency problem in what felt like normal, decent architecture. But now it behaves more like a trains here in winter. Mostly works, until suddenly not.Here are the details.Data comes from:* Applications sending events to Kafka* Files landing in S3* A handful of databases (DB2, MySQL, Oracle)* A couple of SaaS systemsFrom there:* NIghtly spark jobs on Databricks create curated tables* Some of these curated tables are pushed into Snowflake* We also have streaming jobs writing to both Databricks and Snowflake* Snowflake is shared across multiple tenants. Same account, separate warehouses, ACLs in place.On architecture diagram this looks reasonable. In reality, documetnation is thin and mostcontrols are manual operational procedures. Management is crurently excited about “AI agents” than investing in proper orchestration or governance tooling, so we are working with what we have.**Problem**: A core metric, let’s call it DXI is calculated in Databricks using one curated table set, and in Snowflake suing another curated table set. Both sets are ultimately derived from the same upstream raw sources. Some pipelines flow through Kafka, others ingest directly from DB2 and land in Databricks before promotion to Snowflake. Sometimes the metric matches closely enough to be acceptable. Other times it diverges enough to raise eyebrows. There is no obvious pattern yet. What makes this awkward is that one of our corporate leaders explicitly suggested calculating the same KPI independently in both systems as a way to validate the architecture. It sounded clever at the time. Now it is escalating because the numbers do not match always and confidence in the architecture is getting shaky. This architecture is around 7 years old. Built and modified by multiple people, many are no longer here. Tribal knowledge mostly evaporated over time. **Question**: Since I have inherited this situation, where should I start? Some options I am struggling with:* Valdiate transformation logic parity line by line across about 350+ pipelines that touch the raw data and see where things could be diverging? This will take me forever, and I am also not very well versed with some of the complex Spark stuff that is going on in Databricks.* The lineage tool we have seems to overly simplify the lineage by skipping steps between curated tables and raw sources and just points it as an arrow. It gives no concept of how this could have happened as there are many pipelines between those systems. This is probably the most frustrating part for me to deal with and I am this close to giving up hope on using it.* I do notice sporadic errors on the nightly runs of pipelines and there seems to be a correlation between those and when the KPI calculation diverges on following days. But the errors seem pretty widely spread out and don’t seem to have a discernible pattern. * In the process of trying to find the culprint, I have actually uncovered data loss due to type conversion on three places, which although not related the KPI directly, gives me the impression that there could be such issues lurking all over the place.I am trying to approach this systematically, not emotionally. At the moment it feels like chasing ghosts across two platforms. Would appreciate any input on how to structure the investigation..",1,0.6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rc1qde/same_pki_same_raw_data_two_platforms_databricks/,2026-02-22 23:50:09,2026-02-25 02:21:46

Posted this over there too but can’t cross post. Silly phone…I need to keep a history of every change sent to every table for audit purposes. if someone asks why a change happened, I need the history. all data is stored as parquet or json in a variant column with the load time and other metadata.we get data from dbs, apis, csvs, you name it. Our audit needs are basically “what did the database say at the moment it was reported”.ingestion is ALL batch jobs at varying cadence . No CDC or realtime, yet.I looked at a few options. first the dbt snapshots, but that isn’t the right fit as there is a risk of it being re-run. streams may be another option but id need to set it up for every table, so not sure the cost here. this would still let me leverage an ingestion framework like dlt or sling (I think?)my final thought (and initial plan) was to build that into our ingestion process where every table effectively gets the same change logic applied to it, which would be more engineering cost/complexity.

1rb6us1,Registering Partition Information to Glue Iceberg Tables,mike_get_lean,dataengineering,"I am creating Glue Iceberg tables using Spark on EMR. After creation, I also write a few records to the table. However, when I do this, Spark does not register any partition information in Glue table metadata.As I understand, when we use hive, during writes, spark updates table metadata in Glue such as partition information by invoking UpdatePartition API. And therefore, when we write new partitions in Hive, we can get EventBridge notifications from Glue for events such as BatchCreatePartition. Also, when we invoke GetPartitions, we can get partition information from Glue Tables.I understand Iceberg works based on metadata and has a feature for hidden partitioning but I am not sure if this is the sole reason Spark is not registering metadata info with Glue table. This is causing various issues such as not being able to detect data changes in tables, not being able to run Glue Data Quality checks on selected partitions, etc. Is there a simple way I can get this partition change and update information directly from Glue?One of the bad ways to do this will be to create S3 notifications, subscribe to those and then run Glue Crawler on those events, which will create another S3 based Glue table with the correct partition information. And then do DQ checks on this new table. I do not like this approach at all because I will need to setup significant automation to achieve this.",1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rb6us1/registering_partition_information_to_glue_iceberg/,2026-02-22 00:08:26,2026-02-25 02:21:46

1r93yk6,The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (2026 MIT Course),josejg,learnprogramming,"We (/u/anishathalye, /u/josejg, and /u/jonhoo) returned to MIT during IAP (January term) 2026 to teach a new iteration of The Missing Semester (https://missing.csail.mit.edu), a class covering topics that are missing from the standard computer science curriculum.Over the years, the three of us helped teach several classes at MIT, and over and over again we saw that students had limited knowledge of tools available to them. Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and IDEs. Common examples include manually renaming a symbol across many source code files, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (https://xkcd.com/1597/).At least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier both during school and after graduation (most jobs do not formally teach these topics either).To help mitigate this, the three of us developed a class, originally called Hacker Tools in 2019 and then renamed to Missing Semester in 2020 (some great past discussion here: https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/eyagda/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_mit/). Over the past several years, we’ve seen the course translated into over a dozen languages, inspire similar courses at other universities, and be adopted by several companies as part of their standard onboarding materials.Based on feedback and discussions here and elsewhere, along with our updated perspective from working in industry for several years, we have developed a new iteration of the course.

1rauvm8,How to Learn JavaScript - From a Dev With 10 Years in JS,nikolaymakhonin,learnprogramming,"I want to share how I think you should learn JavaScript most effectively. My opinion is based only on my own experience, keep that in mind - I've never taught programming to anyone.Treat these tips as a roadmap you can use to understand where to go and how, but go wherever YOU want.These tips work for many other languages too (C++, C#, PHP, Python, Java, ...), except maybe functional languages - I have no experience there.My background: professional developer, around 20 years in different areas, self-taught my whole life, no courses whatsoever. Lots of experience with C++, C#, Java, PHP and JavaScript. Right now my main thing is JavaScript and frontend.---## TheoryI think the fastest way to learn a programming language is to study its building blocks one by one - the pieces programs are made of - while clearly separating the language itself from applying the language to anything: libraries, frameworks, web page manipulation, algorithms, architecture, all that stuff.The order for learning JavaScript should be roughly this:1. Data and how it's stored and processed in a computer2. Simple data types, including arrays3. Arithmetic and logical operations and expressions4. Core language constructs: if, switch/case, for, while, etc.5. Functions6. More complex data types: objects, maps, collections, ...7. Async programming. Async functions.8. OOP and Classes9. Iterators/Generators10. ...When you look for textbooks, the table of contents should roughly match this order. This way you'll at least have a learning plan and a rough idea of where you are - what you already know, what you don't yet. And you can skim the TOC to see what the language can do in general. This obviously doesn't mean you should throw away other textbooks and not read them.Gradually, as you study the language itself, you can also start learning how it's applied. Since there are many different applications and it's unclear what a person will end up doing, I can't give any advice here. The one thing universal for all JavaScript development directions is the language itself in its pure form.After JavaScript you can also learn TypeScript. Many companies require this skill, for example in React development. TypeScript just adds type annotations to JavaScript - increases code readability, simplifies development, catches many errors while you're still writing code. It's much easier to learn than JavaScript itself.Full JavaScript documentation: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)---## PracticeIt makes sense to reinforce what you learn by solving short simple problems. If the problems are too hard and too long, you might not get enough satisfaction from them. They shouldn't be too easy either, or they'll become boring routine.Practice should be sequential just like theory. Free JavaScript problem sets: [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)There are also sites like CodeWars and CodeCombat - they have difficulty levels, but they're not for sequential learning, they're for training programming skills for people who already know the language.The format in these problem sets is the same: you write code in one window, press Test, your code gets checked. At first it can be hard to understand, especially why everything is set up so complicated - might be worth watching some YouTube videos on this, where people explain it in detail including why problem sets are structured this way. This knowledge will be useful in real work too, because this approach to development is used a lot in practice.---## Interest and Motivation**What feeds motivation:**- A sense of beauty in the language, roughly the same as the beauty of pure non-applied math.- Knowledge that will stay relevant for a long time. What you learn about JavaScript and TypeScript probably won't go obsolete in the coming decades. JS is way too firmly stuck in web development, because to this day it's the only language you can directly write browser programs in. And the knowledge you get from learning JS will help you learn other languages easier, since JS has procedural programming, object-oriented, and elements of functional programming. These concepts are very similar across many languages.- Solving small problems- Wanting to run an experiment- Wanting to make a pile of money- Wanting to build your own project (better keep it short and within your abilities)- Motivation goes up when you successfully reach a goal. If goals are long and hard to achieve, motivation drops. If goals are too simple, achieving them turns into boring routine. Stay in the middle with everything: choosing textbooks, courses, problems, projects, experiments, etc.**What kills motivation:**- Contempt. ""JavaScript is shit."" You can find plenty of flaws in JavaScript, no doubt. You can just know about them, keep them in mind, without feeling any negative emotions about it. And it's worth remembering - what matters in evaluating a language isn't a list of its pros and cons, but whether you can solve complex problems quickly and simply using this language in its area. My answer - absolutely yes.- Perfectionism.- Forcing yourself to finish a project, study a boring topic, complete a dull course. Early on you might have tons of unfinished projects and skipped topics you lost interest in, and that's great. It means perfectionism isn't running the show.- Wanting to read a textbook in strict order. Not wanting to try other textbooks or other courses until you finish the current ones. There's no single track for everyone.- Trying to push through a hard topic when your brain has already given up. At first it will be hard, and you need to let your brain rest and digest more often. Rest is a very important part of learning. Rest when you want to, as much as you want, and come back to learning when you feel like it.- Obsessions. If you want to kill your interest in programming for a long time or forever, obsessions are perfect for that. They'll suck all the energy and interest out of you, and when you come to your senses it'll be too late.---## Other Tips- **Marathon.** If you want to learn the language fast and start earning, learning to program shouldn't turn into playing in a sandbox - otherwise you'll spend a bunch of time on fun stuff with pictures, and end up not even reaching beginner level. To learn programming you have to strain your brain, let it rest, then strain it again, getting stronger each time, absorbing more material, same as people build muscle. The brain doesn't restructure and train overnight. Learning programming is a marathon over a very long distance. This marathon doesn't have to be self-torture though - straining your brain can actually be pleasant, and thinking about moving toward your goal is even more pleasant.- **You don't need to learn everything.** There's a lot of information, but not all of it is relevant right now, and of course you don't need to memorize everything down to the last detail. Often it's enough to just remember that a language feature exists - place short bookmarks in your head or in your notes, like markers on a map, so you can recall when needed that this feature exists and study it in more detail. No point loading your brain with things you're not using right now and won't use often in the future. Following this will seriously cut down your learning time and unload your brain. In the end, you'll remember well whatever you use often in practice - and that's the ideal use of your memory.- **Goal and path to goal.** To learn the language fast, you also need to move in the right direction. And to move in the right direction, you need to understand the end goal, the intermediate steps toward it, at least a rough plan. The main goal for a beginner, in my opinion, should be getting a job as an intern or Junior developer, because the real programming learning happens during actual work, especially if there's a mentor at work. Knowing this goal, you can build a rough plan to get there - for example find out what specific skills and knowledge most popular job listings require.- **Mentor.** To move in the right direction you also need to understand what's worth spending time on and what's not. A beginner can't figure this out, because you'd already need a lot of programming experience to know all these nuances. So early on a mentor will be useful - a person who is an experienced programmer themselves and can suggest the right direction, what to do and how, do code review, point out mistakes, answer questions, etc. This is common practice, many companies hire outside mentors to guide beginners.- **English.** English is very important in programming, but not because programming languages themselves are in English, or because many docs and books are in English - that's all small stuff. The main thing is being able to communicate with clients, managers, and other programmers who don't speak your native language. This skill will seriously expand your job search options, and to much higher-paying jobs at that.- **AI as a mentor.** LLM can work as a mentor for beginners but its expertise not enough for middle level. It also gives good suggestions for online services and textbooks.- **Deep understanding of the language.** Being able to read practically any code, understand it, execute it in your head - this really helps with understanding other people's code, debugging, designing. With this skill you get more ideas, you can find better solutions by eliminating impossible ones, and so on. It also helps with learning, since many ideas and algorithms are easier to express as code. A programming language is also, to some degree, a language programmers communicate with each other in. Often in their conversations you'll hear - stop talking, show me the code. Understanding every little thing in code really simplifies design, debugging, keeping code clean and quality, finding best solutions. Worth striving for - seek out things you don't understand and dig into them.- **Patterns.** Most of programming isn't inventing something from scratch, not reinventing wheels, but reusing template code over and over. There are thousands of these patterns and there's no point learning them all. They get remembered on their own as you gain programming experience, read other people's code, and pick up their ideas. Good code patterns for different tasks can be found at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), though even there you sometimes find upvoted garbage code.- **Rubber duck method.** If you can't figure out what the bug is in your program, try going through it step by step, explaining EVERY detail so that even a rubber duck sitting next to you would understand it all. This same method is often used to make sure there are no bugs in a program - I use it every time after writing a chunk of code, reviewing it and executing it in my head.- **Step-by-step debugging.** Step-by-step debugging tools really help you understand your own code, find bugs, make sure your understanding of the code matches reality. During step-by-step debugging you can literally watch code execute step by step and look at variable values on each step. This really helps when learning the language, understanding how everything works inside. You can run step-by-step JavaScript debugging in the browser, in DevTools - just paste code into the console but write the word `debugger` before the code. I use this when I need to make sure there are no obvious algorithm errors in complex code.- **Research skills.** Research is a very important and inseparable part of developing anything. Pick up any task - pretty much any of them requires research, unless you already have experience doing the exact same task. Research is basically finding the best answer to questions like: what tool to use here, how to organize the code, what architecture to apply to this task, what are this tool's capabilities, how to solve this, etc. Research is basically a mini scientific paper, because it's done using the scientific method: gather information, generate ideas, test ideas, pick the best one.- **Self-learning skills.** You need to keep learning the entire time you work as a programmer, constantly raising your level. Even if a programmer manages to land in a niche where there's nothing left to learn - learned everything, just work - most likely that'll be boring low-paying work with higher competition and less interest, because you're doing the same thing all the time. The best and highest-paid specialists are those who can solve any problems, including the hardest and seemingly unsolvable ones. That is the programmer's job after all - solving problems brought by clients, which are often complex or unusual. And you can only become that kind of specialist with self-learning skills and the ability to do independent research.",118,0.84,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rauvm8/how_to_learn_javascript_from_a_dev_with_10_years/,2026-02-21 16:06:53,2026-02-25 02:21:47

1r95fxw,30yo Father with CS Degree returning after 7-year gap,Powerful-Shallot-792,learnprogramming,"​Hi everyone, I need a reality check. I have a Bachelor's in Informatics, but I’ve been away from code for 7 years. I’m currently a father and at 30, I don’t have time to waste anymore. I need a clear path to employment.​Where I am now:​Doing Boot.dev (loving the hands-on style) for about a week ago. Logic, loops, and terminal work are coming back naturally.I'm investing around 6-10 hours a day on this.​Working through Python/Go modules, but questioning if this is the ""safest"" bet for me.​My three questions:​I’ll be honest—I’m not a math pro. I like systems logic, but complex calculus or advanced statistics kind of turns me down a bit (I could still learn and refresh my memory, if necessary)1) Is Python backend development ""math-heavy"" in the real world, or is that only for AI/Data Science? Would Java be a safer ""low-math"" haven for me? 2) Is it worth pivoting to Java now to avoid the high saturation of Python juniors, even if Java feels ""stricter"" and a bit more difficult to get into?3) Should I stick to the Boot.dev course, learn OOP and DSA in that course, and then switch? What do you suggest? They have Linux, SQL and git courses.​My Goal: > I want to reach a Junior Backend role (Chilean corporate or INTERNATIONAL remote) where I can actually grow, as soon as humanly possible. (Of course aiming to work in a position that I like)​Thanks for any career advice. Just trying to build a stable future for my kid.TL;DR: 30yo, Chile. CS Degree in 2018.

1rcgff0,Dockerizing my application made me feel like a senior engineer(LOL),Longjumping_Echo486,learnprogramming,"Hello, this is my first post here. Recently I started learning backend development and decided to build a purely backend focused project to actually understand how things work beyond tutorials.I built a CRUD API for a social media style application with users, posts, and votes tables. Creating the routes with FastAPI felt surprisingly straightforward at first. Authentication, however, was a completely different story. Integrating JWT took me a few days of going through videos, debugging, and trying to understand what was really happening under the hood. Eventually I got it working, which felt like a small breakthrough.For the database, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy as the ORM to define my schemas. I also set up Alembic for migrations, which helped me understand how schema versioning works in real projects. That part made the project feel much more realistic.After finishing the core functionality, I realized that writing endpoints is only half the job. They need to be tested properly. So I created a tests directory and used pytest to cover different scenarios and edge cases. That was another learning curve, especially figuring out test databases and dependency overrides.The biggest hurdle for me was Docker. I had never containerized an application before, and initially it felt overwhelming. But after spending time reading the docs and experimenting, I finally managed to dockerize the app. That moment felt like a genuine win.I know this is still a basic backend project and there is a lot more to learn, like proper deployment and scaling. I am thinking of adding a load simulation using Locust to test with 1000 plus virtual users just to explore performance aspects.It may not be groundbreaking, but it feels like real progress to me. I am excited to keep improving it.Also, if anyone can suggest free platforms where I can deploy this as a college student, I would really appreciate it.Thanks for reading.",12,0.88,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rcgff0/dockerizing_my_application_made_me_feel_like_a/,2026-02-23 12:43:52,2026-02-25 02:21:47

1rdg2fh,"""A Philosophy of Software Design"" vs ""Grokking Simplicity"": how do you decide on their contradicting advice on function design?",Kudor888,learnprogramming,"I would like to ask you to help me clarify a situation regarding two different coding philosophies. Tell me whether they don't in fact contradict and I am missing something, tell me whether these two books are just opinions and nothing science-based, or tell me whether they apply in different contexts, if one is wrong and the other is right, or if there is a way to combine them.""A Philosophy of Software Design"" by John Ousterhout vs ""Grokking Simplicity"" by Eric Normand are highly recommended and praised books regarding how to write code. They both have very solid advice, but in some areas, they strongly contradict each other. I want to follow the advice in both books, because I see their point of view and I agree with them, but I am having a hard time doing it because in one of the most important aspects, function/method design, they have very different views.Even if they talk more in general, for the sake of making the problem simpler and for simpler exemplification, I will reduce their advice to functions. I use ""functions"", but I also refer to ""methods"".**A Philosophy of Software Design** suggests deep functions with simple interfaces. This means functions which hide a lot of complexity behind a simple-to-use interface. Many times in this book it is pointed out that functions with a lot of parameters increase a function's complexity, and thus increase the overall complexity of the program. The book is also against passing objects or data down through many functions, essentially creating parameters in functions whose only purpose is to pass data down. He suggests contexts or global objects for this. Also, small functions or functions which just call another function are recommended against in this book, as they do not result in deep modules, and create extra complexity through the increase in the number of functions and parameters that exist for developers to learn.**Grokking Simplicity** makes it very clear from the start that functions should be split into calculations (pure functions, with no side effects) and actions (functions which interact with the outside world). The main idea the book recommends is reducing as much as possible the number of actions inside a codebase by transforming actions into calculations or extracting calculations from actions. Extracting calculations from actions has the natural consequence of increasing the overall number of functions. Also, in order to create calculations, some implicit inputs need to be converted into explicit inputs, resulting in functions with multiple parameters. Because reading from / writing to a global variable is an implicit input/output, the book also suggests using functions which only pass parameters through many layers.As you can see, the two idioms are very contradictory.",11,0.79,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rdg2fh/a_philosophy_of_software_design_vs_grokking/,2026-02-24 13:20:49,2026-02-25 02:21:47

Basically my stack now is:**Frontend** - React which will be built into the backend and served as a public / static assets.**Backend** - Node.js using TypeScript, currently with all CRUD functionality as REST.**Ingestion Service** - Uses Vertex AI to parse the body of emails with a particular label and body. It does validation in Zod and then is added to the DB. This is kindof a different related service on its own but handles the same data.**Database** - Currently PostgreSQL queried with Sequelize. These will be deployed to two different Cloud Runs (serverless) services on GCP where the ingestion service is scheduled and then there's the app. Haven't decided yet about where the DB is going to be ultimately but maybe CloudSQL makes sense and that integrates well with Looker studio analytics tool.For my use case TypeScript and a relational db makes more sense as there are many related tables and also data integrity of these business deals is important so schema validation needs to work well here.However, the amount of different columns in my tables is now around 30 and there might be more later so querying might become a bit performance expensive especially when there's eventually gonna be thousands of entries, if not tens of thousands.Also as a sidenote, I am later contemplating a chatbot AI like feature in the app which could use some form of NL2Query solution to get requested deal information from inquiries eg. ""How many people are assigned for x particular deals from last month?"" Everything except the frontend is set up and works well already and the amount of users and data is not that large yet.I guess my question is whether rethinking the REST and moving into GraphQL would be better for this use case instead of just keeping things as is and using Elasticsearch if more effective inqueries are needed?Thanks!",7,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rascrr/rest_vs_graphql_for_crud_applications/,2026-02-21 14:23:56,2026-02-25 02:21:47
1r9mz1u,"I am reading ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software second edition"" and I am confused by the adding of XOR gates on the input and output of the ""Add/subtract unit""",MindlessAssistance52,learnprogramming,"Hi,So I am at chapter 21 of the book, and the author has finished building a ""add/subtract unit"" part of the CPU. https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter21/My confusion is about the subtract part of the arithmetic unit. When we start a subtraction, we use the opcode ""10"", which forces a CI of 1 for the two's complement operation. (Which ends up giving something like A + B inverted + 1) This is done for the first pair of bytes for a multibyte number. Afterwards, the next pairs are treated using the Opcode of ""11"".The actual CY In has no effect at this stage (Opcode 10), so the only things we are left with are the first part of the sum and a potential Carry out.Previously, the author built something called a ""triple byte accumulator"" which was a precursor (https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter20/) where when doing a subtraction using two's complement, if you had a carry out generated during the operation, it would end up being used in the middle byte part, and if the middle byte sum ended up producing a carry out as well, it would end up being used in the high byte part of the operation of the 24 bit number.Now, the author, for some unknown reason to me, has introduced two ""XOR gates"" at the input and ouput of the arithmetic unit. He doesn't mention anything about them besides : > This is a little different from the circuits shown in the book in that the values of both CY In and CY Out are inverted for subtraction. (The entry in the lower-right corner of the table on page 322 should be inverted CY)In the book, at the point where I am, nothing is mentioned as to why or what is done with those inverted signals.During addition (Opcodes of 00 or 01), those XOR gates have no effect whatsoever as if they did not exist. When subtraction/""addition in two's complement"" is done, they do invert the Carry out signal of the adder ... but here is the strange thing:if my adder produces a Carry output of 1 , the XOR transforms it to 0 ... and when this tranformed signal is used in the next part of the operation for the next pair of bytes, the XOR gate at the input ""undoes"" the 0 so we end up having a raw bit of 1 ... as if nothing actually happened. The same logic happens if my carry output produces a 0, it is transformed to 1, and when it is fed back to the CY In, the XOR gates undoes the effect and we end up with a 0 again as the input to the adder.Clearly, then, those gates are not affecting the function of the actual ""subtraction"" and everything is functioning as I would expect it to. My question then would be : why exactly is the author adding those two XOR gates?The only reason I could think of is those inverted signals are going to serve some (unknown) use later on, but outside of that I can't really think of anything else.Any help or guidance would be much appreciated...",6,0.88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r9mz1u/i_am_reading_code_the_hidden_language_of_computer/,2026-02-20 05:35:11,2026-02-25 02:21:47

1rdpj61,Websockets Vs MQTT vs HTTP LongPooling,Tito_Gamer14,learnprogramming,"I need to build a complex application, and to give you some context, there are 3 interacting entities: a Type 1 Client, a Server, and a Type 2 Client.The **Type 2 Client** will be web-based, mainly for querying and interacting with data coming from the server. The **Type 1 Client** is offline-first; it first captures and collects data, saves it in a local SQLite DB, and then an asynchronous service within the same Type 1 Client is responsible for sending the data from the local DB to the server.Here’s the thing: there is an application that will be in charge of transmitting a ""real-time"" data stream, but it won't be running all the time. Therefore, the Type 2 Client will be the one responsible for telling the Type 1 Client: ""start the transmission.""The first thing that came to mind was using **WebSockets**—that’s as far as I’ve gotten experimenting on my own. But since we don't know when the connection will be requested, an active channel must be kept open for when the action is required. The Type 1 Client is hidden behind **NAT/CG-NAT**, so it cannot receive an external call; it can only handle connections that it initiates first.This is where I find my dilemma: with WebSockets, I would have an active connection at all times, consuming bandwidth on both the server and the Type 1 Client. With a few clients, it’s not a big deal, but when scaling to 10,000, you start to notice the difference. After doing some research, I found information about the **MQTT protocol**, which is widely used for consuming very few resources and scaling absurdly easily.What I’m looking for are opinions between one and the other.

I’m motivated to go deeper and improve faster, maybe explore other technologies, but I don’t know where to start. There are so many resources out there (YouTube, online courses, bootcamps, books, open source projects, etc.) that I feel overwhelmed and unsure what’s actually worth my time. What would you recommend for a first-year student who wants to seriously improve?And finally, something that’s been on my mind a lot: AI. To be honest, it really scares me.

I worry about investing years into this field if it’s going to be completely transformed.

1r9wwp0,From LSAT prep to Python - does my logic background actually help or am I just coping?,AviaryCork_11,learnprogramming,"So I spent around 8 months grinding LSAT prep last year (hit a 172 on my final attempt), and after deciding not to pursue law for personal reasons I started learning Python about 6 weeks ago. The weird thing is, I keep noticing these parallels between logic games on the LSAT and writing conditional statements. When I'm building if/else chains or tracing through nested loops, it genuinley feels similar to solving a sequencing game where you have to track which constraints apply in what order. My brain seems to latch onto that kind of structured reasoning pretty fast.But I'm also running into walls my LSAT brain completley can't help with. Syntax errors are brutal because I'll understand the logic perfectly and still forget a colon or mess up an indentation and the whole script breaks. LSAT trained me to reason on paper in the abstract, so the hands-on debugging side feels like a totally seperate skill that I haven't even started building yet. Has anyone transitioned from a logic-heavy non-tech background into programming?

1r8gq4v,I am trying to make LOOP language,samaxidervish,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone,I’ve been thinking for quite a while about designing a loop-centric programming language, and during my research I came across the theoretical LOOP language associated with Dennis Ritchie, who has always been one of my biggest inspirations.The project I’m working on is called Gamma Loop. It’s a transpiled language, with the transpiler written entirely in C. The idea behind this choice is to keep the toolchain lightweight, portable, and fast, while still leveraging mature C compilers for optimisation and broad platform support. The goal is not to compete with mainstream languages, but to explore a minimal, loop-driven design that could be useful for specific niche or experimental applications.Conceptually, I’m focusing on making iteration the central abstraction of the language. Rather than treating loops as just another control structure, the idea is to build the language around them as the primary computational mechanism. The syntax is intentionally minimal and structured, and I’m aiming for clarity over feature density.At this stage, I’m mainly interested in feedback from a theoretical and language-design perspective:1.Does a loop-centric paradigm offer meaningful conceptual advantages?2.Would such a design be interesting from a computability or formal methods standpoint?I’d really appreciate any thoughts, criticism, or references.",3,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r8gq4v/i_am_trying_to_make_loop_language/,2026-02-18 21:59:16,2026-02-25 02:21:47

The engineering leadership has explicitly asked engineers to **not write code manually** their stand is to perform every aspect of development via cursor only. Bug analysis, technical design ( hld or lld), code implementation, test case design , tests implementation everything is forced via cursor. The JIRA timelines are set as such that even if you want to go through code manually or want to write code manually you won't be able to and their answer is to use cursor to do analysis and everything. Cursor usage is tracked and people with highest usage are awarded ( literally). I want to understand how to navigate this shift. Skills of understanding or writing code doesn't seem to matter now or learning different tools ( like docker etc etc )or tech stacks seems futile.

My team is already -2 headcount I don't think my manager wants to lose me.

The main benefits would be that I could more easily come back to the company later (no black mark for failing the pip), and/ or more time to find another job.2. Fail the pip and take the severance. This should let me *barely* hit my RSU vest date, and would give me 60 days of severance to find a new job. Including the time spent on pip/ focus, I'd have 4-5 months to interview and find something new.

I’m not asking whether AI is a bubble or not. I’m asking for names of non-fanatical researchers and engineers to listen to or read. Most of the replies just prove my point. Even when I try to ask for resources, I end up being pulled into one side of the debate. \---I’m a newly graduated computer engineer. After a few months without a job, I decided to prepare for a government engineering exam for a stable, well-paid position. If I fail, I’ll return to job hunting. While studying, I still follow tech news and social media, where I see extreme views about AI/LLMs either denying they’re real or claiming there will be no jobs left.Personally, I use it for learning, translating (even after writing this text, I told AI to fix grammar mistakes without changing my text), and of course coding small projects that I don’t really care about, like a habit tracker or my static Jekyll blog. I believe it’s a great tool that will make our jobs easier, and the only bad thing I think we programmers might face is being pushed toward more productivity. I know ai is a new trend too, while interviewing on school I got pushed to add LLM to random apps that have zero usability like LLM powered graduation system etc. So I see myself at center. But both sides of the internet disagree with me, and I’m confused.**The Anti-AI** side claims the AI boom will collapse and disappear, leaving only old AI generated artifacts behind. They reject LLMs entirely. I disagree. if companies can make money from it, it won’t just vanish. They call entire LLM products slop (yes %90 of them are) but they get frustrated even when someone uses AI voice with their own voice. **The Pro-AI** side, on the other hand, says the AI bubble isn’t real and that if I don’t use AI everywhere, I’m doomed. They claim art and desk jobs are already dead. I don’t think that’s true either, at least for now. Many self-proclaimed “prompt engineers” don’t understand what good code actually looks like. It may work today on one machine, but that doesn’t mean it’s reliable everywhere.**TL;DR:** I’ve noticed social media is extremely polarized about AI. One side says it’s fake and will collapse, the other says it will replace all jobs and you’re doomed without it. I personally see AI as a useful tool that improves productivity, but not as something that will either disappear or completely replace human work.So my question is: I believe these two separate groups are in huge echo chambers that only hear what they want, and I just can’t research and learn about AI technologies without entering those chambers of insanity.

1r8vy6s,How to deal with an existential crisis - 5YoE,Rymark,cscareerquestions,"So I tagged this experienced, but my own impostor syndrome makes me question whether that's accurate or not, so I hope my background gives some insight. For context, I'm a ""senior"" software engineer at a unicorn startup building ML accelerators; I personally am on the training framework team. I've been here a little over 6 months at this point. I spent my first 3 years out of college as the first employee at a tiny aerospace startup, then 1.5 years working on automated fruit sorting before getting laid off and being out of a job for 10ish months. When I got this job, I felt so grateful to be employed again. However, now at the six month mark, I'm struggling with something of an existential crisis. For the first time in my career, I don't feel any sort of connection to my work, and I'm working without any sort of drive or passion. My previous jobs, I felt like there were real stakes, not just numbers on an investor's sheet. I like the people I work with quite a bit, but at this company, like many others I'm sure, the LLM bug is *strong*. Frequently when you have a question, someone's answer is ""have you asked Claude?"" It's maddening to me. I cut my teeth on actual research and engineering, so when I had questions, I had to hit the books. Now I'm...supposed to ask a neural network-powered auto-summarizer. Combine these things with the constant drumbeat of people saying ""we're automating ourselves out of a job"" and it really is wearing me down. I genuinely disagree with that sentiment, I know there'll continue to be a need for software engineers. But all of those things put together has me really questioning my place and my career choice, whether or not I'm betraying my own ideals, etc. I started working on my master's at my last job, and I find myself wondering what the point of this degree will even be once it's done, just because of how everything looks and sounds right now. To anyone out there with more experience than me, I'd really appreciate your advice on navigating this. I recognize that the LLM part in particular is a pretty sizable paradigm shift that we're all dealing with, but I have to imagine some of this sounds familiar to some greybeards out there.

1r9xk2m,I genuinely cannot tell if I’m good at my job or not,Dreadsin,cscareerquestions,"I’m a frontend engineer. I’ve been doing frontend for like 10 years now and feel very competent when it comes to actually developing software *on the frontend*. I’ve received lots of positive comments on my frontend code basically anywhere I worked, but it seems to not be that highly valuedHowever, I’ve always felt like I struggled in my career. Although I was ostensibly hired as a frontend engineer, I often find that I’m assigned to sort of ancillary projects. For example, I worked at (big company) and I think I barely even touched the frontend code and spent the majority of my time doing operational stuff and infrastructure. I felt I spent **far** more time being what effectively amounted to a SRE, which I didn’t feel particularly competent atAt this company, I occasionally pointed out that there were some things that were more difficult or tedious than they needed to be. As an example, the i18n had tons of problems; if you didn’t add translations using a **very specific, multi day process**, then the entire site would crash. One day, someone on the team triggered this bug, causing a huge problem. I brought up to my manager that this kind of bug is not normal. I offered to perhaps fix it, and offered multiple “levels” of fixes, with the most minimal being a 2 line change that’s forward-facing so at least it wouldn’t happen *again*He said I had no idea what I was doing, said I was lying on my resume, and told me whatever I learned in the past doesn’t matter here because this company is simply **better** than whatever companies I worked at before. He said he didn’t want to hear me talk about it again. He instructed me to “document the process” of adding a string to the i18n. It almost seemed like the frontend was so flimsy, they didn’t want anyone to touch it unless *absolutely necessary*.On the same note with that i18n, I noticed that the plurals were… all just wrong. People would have strings like “10 user(s) online”. I told them that this doesn’t work in other languages, and they asked me to prove it was actually a problem. I went through the spanish translations and pointed out at least 20, and a couple extra in other languages. I proposed using a built-in \`Intl\` library, and they said I was way overcomplicating things and that I still haven’t proved there’s a problem because they “don’t speak any language other than english” and “didn’t understand what was wrong with the spanish translation”. I didn’t really know how to respond; I showed them in google translate using “el angel” and “los angeles”, but they kept insisting I was making problems where none existedWhenever I talk to anyone at work about anything, it feels like I’m expending “good will tokens”.

1r8ev7k,Have a B.S in CS from back in 2017 and need advice on how to pivot my career.,General3Dots,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone, so lately I have been having a hard time and feel from stagnant in my field (mobile development) which I have been since graduation (9 years). I graduated back in 2017 with a B.S in CS. So I am trying to seek best path forward to pivot my career to either Backend development or preferably machine learning. I have heard alot about online masters degrees like omscs but also heard about how they are only useful if you do internships. Due to financial commitments, I cant just quit my job so I need to work to pay the bills and study in my spare time. What are your advice in regards to ways to pivot my path? Thinking out loud getting a masters degree seems like a good idea but my concerns are : 1. Does it actually make a difference without internships? 2. It requires 3 letters of recommendation and it has been so long I dont think any of my professors even remember me or are even teaching to be able to ask for letters recommendation specially since back then there were not many internships or school projects for me to actually have more meaningful interactions with them. I also have only maybe 1 or 2 manager recommendations I may be able to acquire from work.

1rdcbme,Are Junior engineers going to be able to adapt to the future of AI assisted coding?,Counter-Business,cscareerquestions,"Previously juniors were expected to get assigned a clearly defined ticket and implement the code. They were judged on how fast they can write code not so much their ability to reason through first principles thinking.Now that ai tools are so good, clearly defined prompts can be oneshot with no coding time required. All of a sudden your coding speed is irrelevant. The only things that matter is your ability to break problems down to first principles, review and evaluate the plan and output and to catch issues early.Essentially AI has replaced the role of the junior from 2 years ago. Are juniors going to adapt to this and begin learning systems engineering earlier or are they going to be left behind? A engineer who is unable to plan and design is useless now. If they don’t verify and fix small bugs with the ai then I end up spending more time in code reviewing than if I was to build the feature myself.Seniors now spend less time reviewing boilerplate and more time iterating on system design, which means juniors must be proactive in planning, reasoning, and taking ownership.",17,0.77,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rdcbme/are_junior_engineers_going_to_be_able_to_adapt_to/,2026-02-24 10:07:40,2026-02-25 02:21:48

1rbv6qc,Would you stay a manager at a company who promotes only based on need and not merit?,MaleficentCherry7116,cscareerquestions,"I'm quickly learning that the company I thought I joined is not the company I was told I was joining. Every company I've worked for in my career promoted based on merit, or at the very least, pretended to.I'm a manager of four very hard working junior developers and was told last week that they have no chance of ever getting promoted unless we can show the company a need for a promotion. For example, the software engineers that work for me are underpaid level 2 engineers. No matter how hard they work, they have no chance of getting to the next level unless we can prove to the company that we have some need for a level 3 engineer. I have a couple of engineers who are very ambitious and have made it clear that they want to advance. They're willing to do whatever it takes, but the hard truth is that their chances of advancing have almost nothing to do with their work.As I understood HR,.they would rather have an overqualified junior developer leave and replace them with a new junior developer than promote them and pay more for a more senior developer.Level 2 developers make around $80K at my company, which is located in Austin, Texas. I've seen the recruiter turn down great software developers who asked for $81k. If you couple that with the fact that there's almost no opportunity for wage growth or promotions, it's going to be very tough on me as a manager.There's a lot more going on with this company than this issue, as you may see from my other posts, but my current thinking is that I'm going to stabilize the office as much as I can and then head for the exit.

1ra40q0,CS New Grad Career Pivot From SWE to Data Analyst,iGanti_,cscareerquestions,"I just graduated from a state university in December, 2025. I started my CS degree in August 2021, and did pretty well in my classes until I had a mental health issue and resulted in me failing a bunch of classes. It forced me to use my summers to catch up on those classes so I never got the chance to do any internships. For me at that point I just wanted to graduate and get me degree. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my career but I liked programming ever since HS so I tried to focus on that. I took a bunch of electives around it like Full Stack in C# and doing a capstone where I made my own project with a couple other people. I hated it. I could never get over the OOP hump of just abstraction over abstraction. It never clicked with me. However, since my university's CS department was so behind in today's tech, our project was just a CRUD machine so I just got through it and passed the class. All of my classes were like that more or less. For my Mobile App dev class, our project was a Wordle Clone. For my Databases class, our project was a simple Flask and SQLite CRUD program. Looking back on all of my classes in CS, I never learned anything useful. Yeah, I have strong soft skills like problem solving and recognizing patterns, but I never learned any marketable skills. And I understand a CS degree isn't the same as SWE but what am I supposed to do now? Fast forward two months after graduating and I have no impressive projects or career experience. I tried to teach myself React and Javascript since we were never exposed to that in school and I'm so lost. I keep hearing BUILD, BUILD, BUILD but I don't even know where to begin. All of my theoretical knowledge of SWE is just a soup of classes, data structures, and OOP but I can't apply it. Maybe I'm just used to having professors give me a structed course and steps to learn but I just can't teach myself. I don't even know what I want to learn. Front-end, back-end, app dev, full stack, the list goes on. I decided last month that I wanted to create a full-stack app using React/Typescript/Firebase that connects local musicians together through a social platform allowing them to find others who share the same musical taste as them. For example, if someone who doesn;t know about the local music scene around them they could create an account and list the instrument they play, experience, and what music they like. And then others could find them on this site and message them and arrange a meet. I thought this would be a cool idea and I could show recruiters or whoever. Since I had no experience building anything at that scale with Auth, Email Verification, Rate limiting I used Claude Code to help me design it. Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree but I still had no idea what I was actually coding. I could see a chunks of code and understand it how it does a specific function but going line by line I didn't know what it actually did. But after a couple weeks I got a MVP, rough documentation of the systems, and rigorously debugged and tested it. And it works. Yeah there's some rough spots and the CSS/design isn't the best but it works. The thing is from this project I just learned how to do system design and product management. I created a product and got an output but I never understood the middle part, the actual programming. And now I finally understand that I just hate programming and it isn't for me. So now I'm having a career crisis (I haven't even started my career yet) and scrambling to find out what I need to do. The data world seems interesting so I started to lookup what it means to be a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and AI/ML Engineer. From what I understand, everything past a Data Analyst is heavy programming so I don't want to do that. I know intermediate Python and basic SQL and little bit of Excel so maybe Data Analyst is something I should do? I messed around with Pandas and CSV files and I like how I can see trends from just mounds of data. I also kinda like Stats and Prob in college but idk. I would like to pivot to become a Data Analyst but idek where to begin. Do I get a cert like the IBM Data Analyst or is that a waste of time.

I feel like HR judge me for some bullshit vibe that has nothing to do with how I perform, most of my jobs, I was hired directly by one the founders, but that limits me in company size.

1rbhsp2,Should i go all in on Android app developement ?,Odd_Basket_8045,cscareerquestions,"In my 4th semester, I was introduced to Java for the first time and I genuinely loved OOP. I ended up building an app in Java for both Android and desktop, and that’s when I realized I actually enjoy building software.Being the nerd I am, I started digging into whether Java is enough to build real-world apps and land a dev job. That’s when I found out Kotlin is basically the go-to for Android now, so I switched and started learning it.Fast forward: I’ve built a few apps with Kotlin. I understand a decent amount, but I’m definitely not an expert yet. Still learning, still breaking things, still enjoying the process.What’s messing with my head is this:I’ve used AI agents to implement features in my apps that I haven’t fully learned yet, and they work surprisingly well. Almost too well. It made me wonder—should I really spend years learning all this deeply if tools can already do a lot of the heavy lifting?So I’m a bit confused about direction right now:* Should I double down on Kotlin and Android dev?* Does Kotlin/Android actually have a solid future career-wise?* Is it realistic to aim for a job with this path?* Or am I setting myself up to learn skills that’ll be half-automated by the time I’m job-ready?I enjoy building apps a lot, and I like understanding how things work under the hood. I just don’t want to end up grinding for years on something that doesn’t have a future.Btw here is one of my projects i recently worked on ,let me know what level i am on ![\->Project](https://github.com/AleemKanyu/AquaLevel/releases/tag/v1.5.0)",5,0.67,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rbhsp2/should_i_go_all_in_on_android_app_developement/,2026-02-22 09:45:15,2026-02-25 02:21:48

Anyone notice something interesting about our work culture and cognitive load among myself and coworkers. On days when you have most context switching like back to back meetings, debugging interruptions, essays getting written back and forth in PR reviews, Slack constantly going off, switching between tickets, then food delivery almost seems inevitable. Not random days or weekends but I mean specific weekdays and especially afternoon/evening when you’re most burned out and mentally done. I looked back at about a year of my food delivery transactions and grouped them by weekday and time. the highest order day was monday afternoon. Honestly, it’s probably not even hunger it’s just cognitive depletion. By 7 or 8pm after a full day of decisions, opening uber eats or DoorDash removes one more decision from the stack and that seems enough. Seeing it laid out visually made it seem like predictable burnout window instead of poor discipline.

He said a good portion of their summer interns get return offers at the end of their program and they absolutely intend to do the same going forward.I don't mind the work, and I don't mind doing that full-time if I do happen to get a return offer BUT I am still a programmer at heart and I would definitely prefer a job or internship that has me writing code, be it traditional SWE or agentic AI or traditional ML.If I do get the role and I don't have any other offer, I will take it.

1r8z4hq,"Company has asked for feedback on my performance. Is this good, bad, or neutral?",MaleficentCherry7116,cscareerquestions,"I received a chat message and email from HR yesterday that I had been identified as a critical resource on my team and that they were going to send a survey to my supervisors, peers, and subordinates, asking for feedback on my performance. I was told repeatedly in the email that ""This is not negative!"". I was also told that I'm one of three people in the entire company that they've done this for. The ""goal"" according to them is to help ME and to.make things easier for ME. They will take the survey results and create a learning plan for me. Embedded in this email where they kept repeatedly saying ""This is NOT a bad thing!"" was a small snippet that mentioned ""planning for my succession"". What I'm trying to figure out is, how does this help ME? My team needs more resources, and that would help me a lot. The company could pay me more, but I'd take more resources over more money - anything that would help me to not work 80 hours per week. We have a very flat structure and there's no path upwards for me. Besides that, I don't think I'd want to go any higher in the supervisory chain. My next level would be director, but it would likely result in more responsibilities with no more pay.I'm not worried about the feedback of my subordinates or peers. I'm a bit worried about one C level guy who seems to want to hurt me for some reason. And maybe this feedback will help me become a better leader. But I'm not convinced that there's not some ulterior motive, as the company itself is pretty rotten Ex: They fired a guy on Tuesday and HR held an online meeting with our office telling us why people getting fired was a ""good thing"".

1r8i0yl,"I passed the first HR screening for an AI hyped company, but...",Affectionate-Laugh98,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR: Interview went ok but got AI hype red flags. Technical interview coming up - what to expect for C#/SQL ""Senior"" questions? Main concern: they want references but my ""previous company"" was actually a personal project I ran with some US friends, not registered. What do I do?Context from [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r6n544/should_i_stick_to_backend_only_is_full_stack/): 10 years hobbyist .NET dev, first professional job attempt.The Interview:HR said ""We're looking for a C#, SQL developer"" (no seniority mentioned, but I'm assuming maybe Senior? for 2.5k USD remote LATAM I really doubt it).The guy was really persistent about AI adoption, at some point he just told me: ""We contacted you because all our deployments are on Azure and you have solid .NET background, but in the end after some time the language won't matter, AI will code everything in any lang, so we don't really worry about it... so are you currently using AI? how are you implementing it? do you know RAG?""Obviously I said yes even though I had no idea what RAG was. Now buying Udemy course to catch up. They have their own local models apparently.When I heard ""the language won't matter"" I saw a huge red flag, almost cancelled right there, but I need the job so I just went ""ok, alright, you're right"". I truly doubt anybody can debug ""any language"" without understanding it deeply.I'm taking this because it's my first option, but this caused me some noise tbh. I think this company fell into AI hype hard and doesn't understand it, trying to implement AI where is not needed (migrations, etc). But I can adapt.Good stuff: HR mentioned quarterly performance reviews (""how do you feel, what to improve, etc"") which sounds decent despite bad Glassdoor reviews.Next steps he told me:* Psychometric tests (personality, english, basic logic) - done* Technical interview (no leetcode, no coding, just some ""advanced"" questions to determine my level) - this scares me tbh.* Reference check to validate CV historyQuestions:1. What kind of technical questions for C#/SQL should I expect? Company does software solutions/migrations for other companies, they have about 500 employees, Azure + .NET stack. They said basics of Azure is fine, not in-depth knowledge needed. How to prep? I feel like I don't know sh!t but also feel like impostor syndrome talking.2. About my references: They want contact from ""*previous company*"". But as I said in my previous post, this wasn't a company officially registered, it was a personal project I ran with some friends in the US for 7+ years. Even during the interview I said it but the guy didn't care or didn't listen carefully. My take is to be truly honest here in the next contact I get from them, I don't want to get the job lying, if I'm not a good fit, they should consider this and just don't hire me. Or if they hire me, maybe is because they don't care.Anyways, the problem is they're assuming I worked in a small company but it was never legally registered, not even as LLC. My friend did register an LLC but that was a year ago, not related to me at all. If they dig they'll see the LLC registration date doesn't match my 8 years timeline. So I guess I can't use that.They said it's ""*to comply with regulations and just a formality*"" to confirm I worked there the time I said.Best I can do is give them number of my co-owners (they financed it, not tech guys, but can confirm project existed 7+ years). Profits were low, was side project for them, main income for me, now the project is closing as I was the only one maintaining it and basically is not even an extra income now.I can't just not talk about this because this project is where I learned almost everything I know now today. Yet I fail when it comes to Distributed Systems, I never used Kafka, nor RabbitMQ in my life, didn't even needed, I know the concepts but only that...So, how deep do US companies dig on references? Just phone call/email or more in-depth? How do they check my background? I was in Venezuela for all those years, I have like 2 years in this new country (LATAM anyways), banking system is crap there in Venezuela so I used mostly Binance to hold money. But I know for sure this is not formal and looks terrible.Really lost here. If you think I should avoid this company to dodge legal troubles, let me know.EDIT: I'm trying to sell myself as a Mid Level, not Senior per se (although I don't mention it at all) because as I haven't worked in teams ever, I know I'm not a real senior. The project is 100% real, is online and I can talk about it all day long, I designed every single part of it and it's running smoothly so far, but almost no clients because it's very niche and scalating it would require a lot of money that I current don't have.",6,0.72,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r8i0yl/i_passed_the_first_hr_screening_for_an_ai_hyped/,2026-02-18 22:49:07,2026-02-25 02:21:48

1rbgl6v,"Team Lead promotion, but still old salary",ezio313,cscareerquestions,"I’m an engineer at a small startup and recently stepped into a Team Lead role after our MVP release. I’ve already been doing the job for the past couple of months.On Feb 3, I had a one on one with the CEO. We discussed my new contract and salary package, and he said it would take effect this month. He told me he’d send the contract soon.I followed up on Feb 10. He said he’d come back to me that same week. It’s now Feb 22, still no contract, no numbers, nothing concrete.Payroll is at the end of this month, and I’m worried this gets pushed to March and I lose a full month of the adjusted salary while still doing the role. And how do I push for it to apply to this payroll without creating tension?Would appreciate honest advice.",4,0.83,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rbgl6v/team_lead_promotion_but_still_old_salary/,2026-02-22 08:30:48,2026-02-25 02:21:48

1r9f7vl,Germany - Salary expectations for iOS developer with over 5 years of experience?,Stompyx,cscareerquestions,"Hi there!Im planning to relocate to Germany this year and Ive been applying to jobs there the last couple weeks. Lots of companies ask upfront what are my yearly salary expectations and upon googling a bit, I found mixed results for my experience tbh, so I figured Id ask on reddit where theres always real people willing to share real data.Im currently an iOS dev with a little bit over 5years of experience.For whatever reason, the internet suggested from 50k all the way to like 90k so I wonder what a more realistic salary expectation might be.Most offers im getting are from Berlin.Thanks!Pd: I dont think this qualifies as salary sharing (because of the sub rule). Otherwise please let me know!",2,0.6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r9f7vl/germany_salary_expectations_for_ios_developer/,2026-02-19 23:34:38,2026-02-25 02:21:48
1r9deoj,Possible issue with leaving Looking for work flag up too long on Linkedin?,Colt2205,cscareerquestions,I wanted to check with other people on here since I've had my flag up for a while on casually looking and then went to actively applying. Is there a point where you started getting a slowdown on recruiters or is it just the market right now? It seemed like there were offers back a year ago and now it seems like there's not a whole lot of new messages. I figured swapping to active would have brought attention.,3,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r9deoj/possible_issue_with_leaving_looking_for_work_flag/,2026-02-19 22:22:11,2026-02-25 02:21:48
