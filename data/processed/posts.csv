1r73l52,"In 6 years, I've never seen a data lake used properly",wtfzambo,dataengineering,"I started working this job in mid 2019. Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.Being new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.The premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!Fast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.Every single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.Massive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.I don't get it.In none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always ""because that's how it's done today"", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.Choosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...Sure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the ""collecting"" part and completely disregard the ""let's do something useful with this"" part.I understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying ""people will do anything to avoid using a database"".Anyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",444,0.97,230,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r73l52/in_6_years_ive_never_seen_a_data_lake_used/,2026-02-17 11:31:23,2026-02-24 02:12:56

1rag36f,Red flag! Red flag? White flag!,Street_Importance_74,dataengineering,"I am a Senior Manager in Data Engineering. Conducted a third round assessment of a potential candidate today. This was a design session. Candidate had already made it through HR, behavioral and coding. This was the last round. Found my head spinning. It was obvious to me that the candidate was using AI to answer the questions. The CV and work experience were solid. The job role will be heavy use of AI as well. The candidate was still very strong. You could tell the candidate was pulling some from personal experience but relying on AI to give us almost verbatim copy cat answers. How do I know? Because I used AI to help create the damn questions and fine tune the answers. Of course I did. When I realized, my gut reaction was a ""no"". The longer it went on, I wondered if it would be more of a red flag if this candidate wasn't using AI during the assessment. Then I realized I had to have a fundamental shift in how I even think about assessing candidates. Similar to the shift I have had to have on assuming any video I see is fake. I started thinking, if I was asking math problems and the person wasn't using a calculator, what would I think?I ultimately examined the situation, spoke with her other assesers, my mentors, and had to pass on the candidate. But boy did it get me flustered. Stuff is changing so fast and the way we have to think about absolutely everything is fundamentally changing.

1rbk3ov,New CTO has joined and is ignoring me,anxiouscrimp,dataengineering,"Keen for any thoughts or feedback.Background - I’ve worked at my current employer, a mid-sized luxury retailer. We turn over about £200m annually. I’m the sole BI architect and have been for the last 5 years or so. I’ve been with the company for 11 years. I do everything - requirements, building out the data warehouse, building and maintaining the cubes, some SSRS development. In the last two years I’ve designed and built a new ELT framework for us to move away from SSIS and integrate to all of our various disparate systems - ERP, CRM, GA4, digital marketing platforms etc etc. Then I’ve cleaned all of this data, modelled it and built a PBI semantic model on top to bring everything together. That’s the first (and biggest) phase of replacing our existing estate.Challenge - I had a very good relationship with our previous CTO. Now a new CTO (a contractor) has joined and he seems to be completely ignoring me. We’ve barely had any interaction. He’s worked with GCP in the past and immediately has set up meetings with a google partner. In the first meeting they opened with ‘so we understand that you’ve got a very fractured data estate with no single source of truth’ which is just totally untrue. But this CTO seems to have no interest in engaging with me in the slightest and I’m hearing from other people that he just wants to ‘move us to bigquery’. We’re entirely on Microsoft for everything - not just BI - so this is an enormous piece of work without a clear benefit. In my opinion the issues we have are generally people based - not enough people and certainly not enough people translating data into something actionable or understandable. I’m open to the idea of moving some or part of our estate to GCP - but shouldn’t such a large move like this be considered in the context of ‘what problem are we trying to solve?’I’m feeling pretty upset - I’ve given a lot to this company over the years and this behaviour feels disrespectful and weird. I’m keen to hear from anyone if they’ve seen this behaviour in the past and how to approach it. At the moment my plan is to write a document outlining our current data estate for him to read and then talk him through. Obviously I’ll also update my CV.TLDR: new contract CTO has joined and is ignoring and sidelining me. He seems very intent on moving us to GCP despite not really understanding any of our actual challenges. Why is he doing this? Is this a strategy?",116,0.91,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rbk3ov/new_cto_has_joined_and_is_ignoring_me/,2026-02-22 12:00:41,2026-02-24 02:12:56

How do I navigate the title conversation.",Proof_Box_2548,dataengineering,"Senior DE at a large (ish) retail company, pre-IPO. Team of 4, I own the platform architecture and all vendor relationships. My manager has the title but zero technical involvement.The highlight reel:\- Presented a migration to the CTO that saves six figures annually. Built the entire business case, ran the pilot, did the presentation. Manager sat in the room and said nothing. CTO: ""amazing job.""\- I run two vendor negotiations. Manager delegated the business case writing to me, then won't sign off. One is a \~$20K/year tool well within his budget. He still escalates to the CTO for permission.\- A credit card registration (literally 2 minutes) for an approved migration took 10+ days. When I nudged him on a CTO-visible thread, he pulled me aside and made it clear he didn't appreciate being called out in front of leadership. The tone was... not great.\- His weekly updates to leadership? Written by us. He copy-pastes our summaries.\- Forgot to process my contractually agreed bonus. Twice.

Anyone navigated a title conversation that should go through your manager but realistically can't? How did you handle it?2. If you got promoted past your manager, title first or reporting change at the same time?3. When your manager starts getting defensive or hostile because they feel their position threatened, how seriously do you take that?4.

Made some coordinated decisions and we agreed on dagster+dbt on AWS ecs. Highly scalable and efficient. We decided to slowly move away from redshift to something more modern.Now after 6 months I'm half way through, a lot of things work well. A lot of people also left the company due to restructuring including head of bi, leaving me with virtually no managers and (with help of an analyst) covering what the head was doing previously.Now we got a high-ranked analyst from the larger company, and I got the following from him: ""ok, so I created this SQL script for my dashboard, how do I schedule it in datagrip?"" While there are a lot of different things wrong with this request, I question myself on the viability of dbt with such technicality of main users of dbt in our current tech stack.

1r7iybs,"Higher Level Abstractions are a Trap,",expialadocious2010,dataengineering,"So, I'm learning data engineering core principles sort of for the first time. I mean, I've had some experience, like intermediate Python, SQL, building manual ETL pipelines, Docker containers, ML, and Streamlit UI. It's been great, but I wanted to up my game, so now I'm following a really enjoyable data engineering Zoom camp. I love it. But what I'm noticing is these tools, great as they may be, they're all higher level abstractions of like what would be core, straight up, no-frills, writing raw syntax to perform multiple different tasks, and when combined together become your powerful ETL or ELT pipelines. My question is this, these tools are great. They save so much time, and they have these really nice built-in ""SWE-like"" features, like DBT has nice built-in tests and lineage enforcement, etc., and I love it. But what happens if I'm a brand new practitioner, and I'm learning these tools, and I'm using them religiously, and things start to fail or or require debugging? Since I only knew the higher-level abstraction, does that become a risk for me because I never truly learned the core syntax that these higher-level abstractions are solving? And on that same matter, can the same be said about agentic AI and MCP servers? These are just higher-level abstractions of what was already a higher-level abstraction in some of these other tools like DBT or Kestra or DLT, etc. So what does that mean as these levels of higher abstraction become magnified and many people entering the workforce, if there is going to be a future workforce, don't ever truly learn the core principles or core syntax? What does that mean for us all if we're relying on higher abstractions and relying on agents to abstract those higher abstractions even further? What does that mean for our skill set in the long-term? Will we lose our skill set? Will we even be able to debug? What do all these AI labs think about that? Or is that what they're banking on? That everybody must rely on them 100%?",14,0.67,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r7iybs/higher_level_abstractions_are_a_trap/,2026-02-17 21:13:07,2026-02-24 02:12:56
1ra5zg4,Does database normalization actually reduce redundancy in data?,Lastrevio,dataengineering,"For instance, does a star schema actually reduce redundancy in comparison to putting everything in a flat table? Instead of the fact table containing dimension descriptions, it will just contain IDs with the primary key of the dimension table, the dimension table being the table which gives the ID-description mapping for that specific dimension. In other words, a star schema simply replaces the strings with IDs in a fact table. Adding to the fact that you now store the ID-string mapping in a seperate dimension table, you are actually using more storage, not less storage.This leads me to believe that the purpose of database normalization is not to ""reduce redundancy"" or to use storage more efficiently, but to make updates and deletes easier. If a customer changes their email, you update one row instead of a million rows.The only situation in which I can see a star schema being more space-efficient than a flat table, or in which a snowflake schema is more space-efficient than a star schema, are the cases in which the number of rows is so large that storing n integers + 1 string requires less space than storing n strings.

I stopped trying at work, was barely doing things just to get by. I remember even missing a trip to a data center that my team was going on. I isolated myself. I even got a full time offer in the end and I never responded to the email. I wasn’t talking to anyone. 2nd year started and I started to attend but stopped eventuall. I should have dropped out but I couldn’t even bring myself to type up an email. I just failed and didn’t re-enroll. I moved in with my brother bc I wasn’t taking care of myself. I essentially took a year off, which consist of me getting help. After about a year of the fog dissipating, I finally felt ready to try again. I’m not re-enrolling in school bc I’m pretty sure my GPA tanked, and I realized DS isnt my passion, I REALLY REALLY enjoyed my DE apprenticeship and constantly using SQL in my database role. All that said, I have been job searching for about 8 months now. Which totals to 1 year and 8 months since my last “tech” role. This looks so so bad on paper. What would you guys do if you were me? How would you go about making yourself marketable again? I am applying for very low level roles bc I think that’s they only thing I qualify for right now; data entry w SQL, Data Reporting, Data Specialist, etc. TLDR: I had my career going in a great direction towards DE and let depression ruin everythin. Almost 2 years later I am trying to rebuild but I am unmarketable. What would you do to get back in the DE career path?",15,0.95,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r9fcko/need_career_advice_gis_to_de/,2026-02-19 23:40:19,2026-02-24 02:12:56
1rcmam2,Has anyone found a self healing data pipeline tool in 2026 that actually works or is it all marketing,CharacterHand511,dataengineering,"Every vendor in the data space is throwing around ""self healing pipelines"" in their marketing and I'm trying to figure out what that actually means in practice. Because right now my pipelines are about as self healing as a broken arm. We've got airflow orchestrating about 40 dags across various sources and when something breaks, which is weekly at minimum, someone has to manually investigate, figure out what changed, update the code, test it, and redeploy. That's not self healing, that's just regular healing with extra steps.I get that there's a spectrum here. Some tools do automatic retries with exponential backoff which is fine but that's just basic error handling not healing. Some claim to handle api changes automatically but I'm skeptical about how well that actually works when a vendor restructures their entire api endpoint. The part I care most about is when a saas vendor changes their api schema or deprecates an endpoint. That's what causes 80% of our breaks.

I've had the wrong focus for a long time and can talk a lot about that.The thing is that you can be a technical expert in a specific stack, but if you can’t manage a seven-figure budget or explain the financial cost of your architecture, you’re just a technician. One bad architectural choice or an unmonitored cloud bill can turn you from an asset into a massive liability.Real seniority comes from becoming a ""load-bearing operator."" This means owning the unit economics of your data, building for long-term stability instead of cleverness, and prioritizing the company's survival over technical ego.I just promoted a data engineer to senior.

I decided to simplify this and determine bottlenecks from spark job metadata. It's kept intentionally simple and recognizes three crucial patterns - data explosion, large scan and shuffle\_write. It also resolves sql hint, let's you see the query connected to the job without having to click through two pages of horribly designed ui, it also detects slow stages and other goodies.In general, when I debug performance issues with spark jobs myself, I usually have to click through stages trying to find where we are shuffling hard and spilling all around. This simplifies this process. It's not fancy, it's simple terminal app, but it does its jobs.Feature requests and burns are all welcome.

When I say “data” I mean isolated (no cardinality) read-only views.

It has some innovations that I think make it very useful relative to other options I've tried.**GitHub:** [https://github.com/saward/spawn](https://github.com/saward/spawn)**Docs:** [https://docs.spawn.dev/](https://docs.spawn.dev/)Shout out to minijinja ([https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/)) which has made a lot of the awesomeness possible!Some features (PostgreSQL via `psql` only for now):* Create SQL (for tests or data insertion) from JSON data sources* Store functions/views/data in separate files for easy organisation and editing* `git diff` shows exactly what changed in a function in new migrations* Easy writing of tests for functions/views/triggers* Env-specific variables, so migrations apply test data to dev/local DB targets only* Generate data from JSON files* Macros for easily generating repeatable SQL, and other cool tricks (e.g., view tear-down and re-create)I started this project around two years ago. I’ve finally been able to get it to an MVP state I’m happy with.I created spawn to solve my own personal pain points. The main one was, how to manage updates for things like views and functions? There's a few challenges (and spawn doesn't solve all), but the main one was creating and reviewing the migration. The typical (without spawn) approach is one of:1. Copy function into new migration and edit. This makes PR reviews hard because all you see is a big blob of new changes.2. Repeatable migrations. This breaks old migrations when building from scratch, if those migrations depend on DDL or DML from repeatable migrations.3. Sqitch rework. Works, but is a bit cumbersome overall with the DAG, and I hit limitations with sqitch's variables support (and needing Perl) for other things I wanted to do.Spawn is my attempt to solve this, along with an easy (single binary) way to write and run tests. You:* Store view or function in its own separate file.* Include it in your migration with a template (e.g., {% include ""functions/hello.sql"" %})* Build migration to see the final SQL, or apply to database.* Pin migration to forever lock it to the component as it is now. This is very similar to 'git commit', allowing the old migration to run the same as when it was first created, even if you later change functions/hello.sql.* Update the function later by editing functions/hello.sql in place and importing it into your new migration. Git diff shows exactly what changed in hello.sql.Please check it out, let me know what you think, and hopefully it's as useful for you as it has been for me. Thanks!(AI disclosure: around 90% of the non-test code is artisanal code written by me. AI was used more once the core architecture was in place, and for assisting in generating docs)",3,0.81,0,https://i.redd.it/b7ugl76ddrkg1.png,2026-02-21 02:31:36,2026-02-24 02:12:56

Or so they say, you ask one person and it’s one thing you ask another and it’s completely different. That being said, I’ve been stepping up a lot more and the other day my boss asked if I’d be interested in moving down the SWE path.

Our sources include various Marketing APIs, MySQL, and SQL Server On Prem Source Systems. Currently, we use Metadata Driven Ingestion via Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load data directly into a dedicated SQL Server Bronze DB.Option A: Dedicated Bronze Database (SQL Server)The Setup: Ingestion goes straight into SQL tables. Dev and Prod DWH reside on different servers. The Dev environment accesses the Prod Bronze DB via Linked Servers.Workflow: Engineers have write access to Bronze for manual CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements. Silver/Gold are read-only and managed via CI/CD.Option B: ADLS Gen2 Data Lake (Parquet)The Setup: Redirect the ADF metadata pipelines to write data as Parquet files to ADLS before loading into the DWH. Tho, this feels like significant engineering overhead for little benefit. I would need to manage/orchestrate two independent metadata pipelines to feed Dev and Prod Lake containers. But I will still need to somehow create a staging layer or db for both dev and prod so dbt can pick up from there as it cant natively connect to adls storage and ingest the data. So i need to use ADF again to go from the Data in the Lake to both environments seperately. At 100GB, is the Data Lake approach over-engineered? If a source schema breaks the Prod load, it has to be fixed regardless of the storage layer. I just dont see the point of the Data Lake anymore. In case we wanna migrate in the future to Snowflake or smth a data lake would already been setup. Even tho even in that case I would simply create the Data Lake „quickly“ using ADFs copy activity and dump everything from the PROD Bronze DB into that Lake as a starting point.

1rc1qde,"Same PKI, same raw data, two platforms (Databricks, Snowflake)… different results. Where would you even start debugging this?",MitocondrialPoro,dataengineering,"Hej all,I am running in to a metrics consistency problem in what felt like normal, decent architecture. But now it behaves more like a trains here in winter. Mostly works, until suddenly not.Here are the details.Data comes from:* Applications sending events to Kafka* Files landing in S3* A handful of databases (DB2, MySQL, Oracle)* A couple of SaaS systemsFrom there:* NIghtly spark jobs on Databricks create curated tables* Some of these curated tables are pushed into Snowflake* We also have streaming jobs writing to both Databricks and Snowflake* Snowflake is shared across multiple tenants. Same account, separate warehouses, ACLs in place.On architecture diagram this looks reasonable. In reality, documetnation is thin and mostcontrols are manual operational procedures. Management is crurently excited about “AI agents” than investing in proper orchestration or governance tooling, so we are working with what we have.**Problem**: A core metric, let’s call it DXI is calculated in Databricks using one curated table set, and in Snowflake suing another curated table set. Both sets are ultimately derived from the same upstream raw sources. Some pipelines flow through Kafka, others ingest directly from DB2 and land in Databricks before promotion to Snowflake. Sometimes the metric matches closely enough to be acceptable. Other times it diverges enough to raise eyebrows. There is no obvious pattern yet. What makes this awkward is that one of our corporate leaders explicitly suggested calculating the same KPI independently in both systems as a way to validate the architecture. It sounded clever at the time. Now it is escalating because the numbers do not match always and confidence in the architecture is getting shaky. This architecture is around 7 years old. Built and modified by multiple people, many are no longer here. Tribal knowledge mostly evaporated over time. **Question**: Since I have inherited this situation, where should I start? Some options I am struggling with:* Valdiate transformation logic parity line by line across about 350+ pipelines that touch the raw data and see where things could be diverging? This will take me forever, and I am also not very well versed with some of the complex Spark stuff that is going on in Databricks.* The lineage tool we have seems to overly simplify the lineage by skipping steps between curated tables and raw sources and just points it as an arrow. It gives no concept of how this could have happened as there are many pipelines between those systems. This is probably the most frustrating part for me to deal with and I am this close to giving up hope on using it.* I do notice sporadic errors on the nightly runs of pipelines and there seems to be a correlation between those and when the KPI calculation diverges on following days. But the errors seem pretty widely spread out and don’t seem to have a discernible pattern. * In the process of trying to find the culprint, I have actually uncovered data loss due to type conversion on three places, which although not related the KPI directly, gives me the impression that there could be such issues lurking all over the place.I am trying to approach this systematically, not emotionally. At the moment it feels like chasing ghosts across two platforms.

Also, when we invoke GetPartitions, we can get partition information from Glue Tables.I understand Iceberg works based on metadata and has a feature for hidden partitioning but I am not sure if this is the sole reason Spark is not registering metadata info with Glue table. This is causing various issues such as not being able to detect data changes in tables, not being able to run Glue Data Quality checks on selected partitions, etc. Is there a simple way I can get this partition change and update information directly from Glue?One of the bad ways to do this will be to create S3 notifications, subscribe to those and then run Glue Crawler on those events, which will create another S3 based Glue table with the correct partition information. And then do DQ checks on this new table. I do not like this approach at all because I will need to setup significant automation to achieve this.",1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1rb6us1/registering_partition_information_to_glue_iceberg/,2026-02-22 00:08:26,2026-02-24 02:12:56

What I can’t understand is how this works when I switch to using hash keys - which are ultimately very random non-sequential strings. If I try to group my micro partitions by hash key value it will force the partitions to keep getting recreated as I “insert” new hash key values, rather then something like a “date/customer” natural key which would likely just add new micro partitions rather than updating existing partitions. If I add date/customer to the fact as natural keys, don’t expose them to the users, and use them for no other purpose then incremental loading and micro partition organizing— does this actually help?

1r93yk6,The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (2026 MIT Course),josejg,learnprogramming,"We (/u/anishathalye, /u/josejg, and /u/jonhoo) returned to MIT during IAP (January term) 2026 to teach a new iteration of The Missing Semester (https://missing.csail.mit.edu), a class covering topics that are missing from the standard computer science curriculum.Over the years, the three of us helped teach several classes at MIT, and over and over again we saw that students had limited knowledge of tools available to them. Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and IDEs. Common examples include manually renaming a symbol across many source code files, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (https://xkcd.com/1597/).At least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier both during school and after graduation (most jobs do not formally teach these topics either).To help mitigate this, the three of us developed a class, originally called Hacker Tools in 2019 and then renamed to Missing Semester in 2020 (some great past discussion here: https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/eyagda/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_mit/). Over the past several years, we’ve seen the course translated into over a dozen languages, inspire similar courses at other universities, and be adopted by several companies as part of their standard onboarding materials.Based on feedback and discussions here and elsewhere, along with our updated perspective from working in industry for several years, we have developed a new iteration of the course. The 2026 edition covers several new topics such as packaging/shipping code, code quality, agentic coding, and soft skills. Some things never change, though; we’re still using this hacky Python DSL for editing our multi-camera-angle lecture videos: https://github.com/missing-semester/videos.As always, we’d love to hear any feedback from the community to help us improve the course content!—Anish, Jon, and Jose",342,0.98,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r93yk6/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_2026/,2026-02-19 16:35:25,2026-02-24 02:12:57

1rauvm8,How to Learn JavaScript - From a Dev With 10 Years in JS,nikolaymakhonin,learnprogramming,"I want to share how I think you should learn JavaScript most effectively. My opinion is based only on my own experience, keep that in mind - I've never taught programming to anyone.Treat these tips as a roadmap you can use to understand where to go and how, but go wherever YOU want.These tips work for many other languages too (C++, C#, PHP, Python, Java, ...), except maybe functional languages - I have no experience there.My background: professional developer, around 20 years in different areas, self-taught my whole life, no courses whatsoever. Lots of experience with C++, C#, Java, PHP and JavaScript. Right now my main thing is JavaScript and frontend.---## TheoryI think the fastest way to learn a programming language is to study its building blocks one by one - the pieces programs are made of - while clearly separating the language itself from applying the language to anything: libraries, frameworks, web page manipulation, algorithms, architecture, all that stuff.The order for learning JavaScript should be roughly this:1. Data and how it's stored and processed in a computer2. Simple data types, including arrays3. Arithmetic and logical operations and expressions4. Core language constructs: if, switch/case, for, while, etc.5. Functions6. More complex data types: objects, maps, collections, ...7. Async programming. Async functions.8. OOP and Classes9. Iterators/Generators10. ...When you look for textbooks, the table of contents should roughly match this order. This way you'll at least have a learning plan and a rough idea of where you are - what you already know, what you don't yet. And you can skim the TOC to see what the language can do in general. This obviously doesn't mean you should throw away other textbooks and not read them.Gradually, as you study the language itself, you can also start learning how it's applied. Since there are many different applications and it's unclear what a person will end up doing, I can't give any advice here. The one thing universal for all JavaScript development directions is the language itself in its pure form.After JavaScript you can also learn TypeScript. Many companies require this skill, for example in React development. TypeScript just adds type annotations to JavaScript - increases code readability, simplifies development, catches many errors while you're still writing code. It's much easier to learn than JavaScript itself.Full JavaScript documentation: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)---## PracticeIt makes sense to reinforce what you learn by solving short simple problems. If the problems are too hard and too long, you might not get enough satisfaction from them. They shouldn't be too easy either, or they'll become boring routine.Practice should be sequential just like theory. Free JavaScript problem sets: [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)There are also sites like CodeWars and CodeCombat - they have difficulty levels, but they're not for sequential learning, they're for training programming skills for people who already know the language.The format in these problem sets is the same: you write code in one window, press Test, your code gets checked. At first it can be hard to understand, especially why everything is set up so complicated - might be worth watching some YouTube videos on this, where people explain it in detail including why problem sets are structured this way. This knowledge will be useful in real work too, because this approach to development is used a lot in practice.---## Interest and Motivation**What feeds motivation:**- A sense of beauty in the language, roughly the same as the beauty of pure non-applied math.- Knowledge that will stay relevant for a long time. What you learn about JavaScript and TypeScript probably won't go obsolete in the coming decades. JS is way too firmly stuck in web development, because to this day it's the only language you can directly write browser programs in. And the knowledge you get from learning JS will help you learn other languages easier, since JS has procedural programming, object-oriented, and elements of functional programming. These concepts are very similar across many languages.- Solving small problems- Wanting to run an experiment- Wanting to make a pile of money- Wanting to build your own project (better keep it short and within your abilities)- Motivation goes up when you successfully reach a goal. If goals are long and hard to achieve, motivation drops. If goals are too simple, achieving them turns into boring routine. Stay in the middle with everything: choosing textbooks, courses, problems, projects, experiments, etc.**What kills motivation:**- Contempt. ""JavaScript is shit."" You can find plenty of flaws in JavaScript, no doubt. You can just know about them, keep them in mind, without feeling any negative emotions about it. And it's worth remembering - what matters in evaluating a language isn't a list of its pros and cons, but whether you can solve complex problems quickly and simply using this language in its area. My answer - absolutely yes.- Perfectionism.- Forcing yourself to finish a project, study a boring topic, complete a dull course. Early on you might have tons of unfinished projects and skipped topics you lost interest in, and that's great. It means perfectionism isn't running the show.- Wanting to read a textbook in strict order. Not wanting to try other textbooks or other courses until you finish the current ones. There's no single track for everyone.- Trying to push through a hard topic when your brain has already given up. At first it will be hard, and you need to let your brain rest and digest more often. Rest is a very important part of learning. Rest when you want to, as much as you want, and come back to learning when you feel like it.- Obsessions. If you want to kill your interest in programming for a long time or forever, obsessions are perfect for that. They'll suck all the energy and interest out of you, and when you come to your senses it'll be too late.---## Other Tips- **Marathon.** If you want to learn the language fast and start earning, learning to program shouldn't turn into playing in a sandbox - otherwise you'll spend a bunch of time on fun stuff with pictures, and end up not even reaching beginner level. To learn programming you have to strain your brain, let it rest, then strain it again, getting stronger each time, absorbing more material, same as people build muscle. The brain doesn't restructure and train overnight. Learning programming is a marathon over a very long distance. This marathon doesn't have to be self-torture though - straining your brain can actually be pleasant, and thinking about moving toward your goal is even more pleasant.- **You don't need to learn everything.** There's a lot of information, but not all of it is relevant right now, and of course you don't need to memorize everything down to the last detail. Often it's enough to just remember that a language feature exists - place short bookmarks in your head or in your notes, like markers on a map, so you can recall when needed that this feature exists and study it in more detail. No point loading your brain with things you're not using right now and won't use often in the future. Following this will seriously cut down your learning time and unload your brain. In the end, you'll remember well whatever you use often in practice - and that's the ideal use of your memory.- **Goal and path to goal.** To learn the language fast, you also need to move in the right direction. And to move in the right direction, you need to understand the end goal, the intermediate steps toward it, at least a rough plan. The main goal for a beginner, in my opinion, should be getting a job as an intern or Junior developer, because the real programming learning happens during actual work, especially if there's a mentor at work. Knowing this goal, you can build a rough plan to get there - for example find out what specific skills and knowledge most popular job listings require.- **Mentor.** To move in the right direction you also need to understand what's worth spending time on and what's not. A beginner can't figure this out, because you'd already need a lot of programming experience to know all these nuances. So early on a mentor will be useful - a person who is an experienced programmer themselves and can suggest the right direction, what to do and how, do code review, point out mistakes, answer questions, etc. This is common practice, many companies hire outside mentors to guide beginners.- **English.** English is very important in programming, but not because programming languages themselves are in English, or because many docs and books are in English - that's all small stuff. The main thing is being able to communicate with clients, managers, and other programmers who don't speak your native language. This skill will seriously expand your job search options, and to much higher-paying jobs at that.- **AI as a mentor.** LLM can work as a mentor for beginners but its expertise not enough for middle level. It also gives good suggestions for online services and textbooks.- **Deep understanding of the language.** Being able to read practically any code, understand it, execute it in your head - this really helps with understanding other people's code, debugging, designing. With this skill you get more ideas, you can find better solutions by eliminating impossible ones, and so on. It also helps with learning, since many ideas and algorithms are easier to express as code. A programming language is also, to some degree, a language programmers communicate with each other in. Often in their conversations you'll hear - stop talking, show me the code. Understanding every little thing in code really simplifies design, debugging, keeping code clean and quality, finding best solutions. Worth striving for - seek out things you don't understand and dig into them.- **Patterns.** Most of programming isn't inventing something from scratch, not reinventing wheels, but reusing template code over and over. There are thousands of these patterns and there's no point learning them all. They get remembered on their own as you gain programming experience, read other people's code, and pick up their ideas. Good code patterns for different tasks can be found at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), though even there you sometimes find upvoted garbage code.- **Rubber duck method.** If you can't figure out what the bug is in your program, try going through it step by step, explaining EVERY detail so that even a rubber duck sitting next to you would understand it all. This same method is often used to make sure there are no bugs in a program - I use it every time after writing a chunk of code, reviewing it and executing it in my head.- **Step-by-step debugging.** Step-by-step debugging tools really help you understand your own code, find bugs, make sure your understanding of the code matches reality. During step-by-step debugging you can literally watch code execute step by step and look at variable values on each step. This really helps when learning the language, understanding how everything works inside. You can run step-by-step JavaScript debugging in the browser, in DevTools - just paste code into the console but write the word `debugger` before the code. I use this when I need to make sure there are no obvious algorithm errors in complex code.- **Research skills.** Research is a very important and inseparable part of developing anything. Pick up any task - pretty much any of them requires research, unless you already have experience doing the exact same task. Research is basically finding the best answer to questions like: what tool to use here, how to organize the code, what architecture to apply to this task, what are this tool's capabilities, how to solve this, etc. Research is basically a mini scientific paper, because it's done using the scientific method: gather information, generate ideas, test ideas, pick the best one.- **Self-learning skills.** You need to keep learning the entire time you work as a programmer, constantly raising your level. Even if a programmer manages to land in a niche where there's nothing left to learn - learned everything, just work - most likely that'll be boring low-paying work with higher competition and less interest, because you're doing the same thing all the time. The best and highest-paid specialists are those who can solve any problems, including the hardest and seemingly unsolvable ones. That is the programmer's job after all - solving problems brought by clients, which are often complex or unusual. And you can only become that kind of specialist with self-learning skills and the ability to do independent research.",118,0.84,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rauvm8/how_to_learn_javascript_from_a_dev_with_10_years/,2026-02-21 16:06:53,2026-02-24 02:12:57
1r95fxw,30yo Father with CS Degree returning after 7-year gap,Powerful-Shallot-792,learnprogramming,"​Hi everyone, I need a reality check. I have a Bachelor's in Informatics, but I’ve been away from code for 7 years. I’m currently a father and at 30, I don’t have time to waste anymore. I need a clear path to employment.​Where I am now:​Doing Boot.dev (loving the hands-on style) for about a week ago. Logic, loops, and terminal work are coming back naturally.I'm investing around 6-10 hours a day on this.​Working through Python/Go modules, but questioning if this is the ""safest"" bet for me.​My three questions:​I’ll be honest—I’m not a math pro. I like systems logic, but complex calculus or advanced statistics kind of turns me down a bit (I could still learn and refresh my memory, if necessary)1) Is Python backend development ""math-heavy"" in the real world, or is that only for AI/Data Science? Would Java be a safer ""low-math"" haven for me? 2) Is it worth pivoting to Java now to avoid the high saturation of Python juniors, even if Java feels ""stricter"" and a bit more difficult to get into?3) Should I stick to the Boot.dev course, learn OOP and DSA in that course, and then switch? What do you suggest? They have Linux, SQL and git courses.​My Goal: > I want to reach a Junior Backend role (Chilean corporate or INTERNATIONAL remote) where I can actually grow, as soon as humanly possible. (Of course aiming to work in a position that I like)​Thanks for any career advice. Just trying to build a stable future for my kid.TL;DR: 30yo, Chile. CS Degree in 2018.

Helps in the moment but doesn't seem to stick long-term.Anki flashcards: For syntax and common patterns. Jury's still out on whether this is actually useful for programming.

Recently I started learning backend development and decided to build a purely backend focused project to actually understand how things work beyond tutorials.I built a CRUD API for a social media style application with users, posts, and votes tables. Creating the routes with FastAPI felt surprisingly straightforward at first. Authentication, however, was a completely different story. Integrating JWT took me a few days of going through videos, debugging, and trying to understand what was really happening under the hood. Eventually I got it working, which felt like a small breakthrough.For the database, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy as the ORM to define my schemas. I also set up Alembic for migrations, which helped me understand how schema versioning works in real projects. That part made the project feel much more realistic.After finishing the core functionality, I realized that writing endpoints is only half the job. They need to be tested properly. So I created a tests directory and used pytest to cover different scenarios and edge cases. That was another learning curve, especially figuring out test databases and dependency overrides.The biggest hurdle for me was Docker. I had never containerized an application before, and initially it felt overwhelming. But after spending time reading the docs and experimenting, I finally managed to dockerize the app. That moment felt like a genuine win.I know this is still a basic backend project and there is a lot more to learn, like proper deployment and scaling. I am thinking of adding a load simulation using Locust to test with 1000 plus virtual users just to explore performance aspects.It may not be groundbreaking, but it feels like real progress to me.

Basically my stack now is:**Frontend** - React which will be built into the backend and served as a public / static assets.**Backend** - Node.js using TypeScript, currently with all CRUD functionality as REST.**Ingestion Service** - Uses Vertex AI to parse the body of emails with a particular label and body. It does validation in Zod and then is added to the DB. This is kindof a different related service on its own but handles the same data.**Database** - Currently PostgreSQL queried with Sequelize. These will be deployed to two different Cloud Runs (serverless) services on GCP where the ingestion service is scheduled and then there's the app. Haven't decided yet about where the DB is going to be ultimately but maybe CloudSQL makes sense and that integrates well with Looker studio analytics tool.For my use case TypeScript and a relational db makes more sense as there are many related tables and also data integrity of these business deals is important so schema validation needs to work well here.However, the amount of different columns in my tables is now around 30 and there might be more later so querying might become a bit performance expensive especially when there's eventually gonna be thousands of entries, if not tens of thousands.Also as a sidenote, I am later contemplating a chatbot AI like feature in the app which could use some form of NL2Query solution to get requested deal information from inquiries eg. ""How many people are assigned for x particular deals from last month?"" Everything except the frontend is set up and works well already and the amount of users and data is not that large yet.I guess my question is whether rethinking the REST and moving into GraphQL would be better for this use case instead of just keeping things as is and using Elasticsearch if more effective inqueries are needed?Thanks!",6,0.88,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1rascrr/rest_vs_graphql_for_crud_applications/,2026-02-21 14:23:56,2026-02-24 02:12:57
1r9mz1u,"I am reading ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software second edition"" and I am confused by the adding of XOR gates on the input and output of the ""Add/subtract unit""",MindlessAssistance52,learnprogramming,"Hi,So I am at chapter 21 of the book, and the author has finished building a ""add/subtract unit"" part of the CPU. https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter21/My confusion is about the subtract part of the arithmetic unit. When we start a subtraction, we use the opcode ""10"", which forces a CI of 1 for the two's complement operation. (Which ends up giving something like A + B inverted + 1) This is done for the first pair of bytes for a multibyte number. Afterwards, the next pairs are treated using the Opcode of ""11"".The actual CY In has no effect at this stage (Opcode 10), so the only things we are left with are the first part of the sum and a potential Carry out.Previously, the author built something called a ""triple byte accumulator"" which was a precursor (https://codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter20/) where when doing a subtraction using two's complement, if you had a carry out generated during the operation, it would end up being used in the middle byte part, and if the middle byte sum ended up producing a carry out as well, it would end up being used in the high byte part of the operation of the 24 bit number.Now, the author, for some unknown reason to me, has introduced two ""XOR gates"" at the input and ouput of the arithmetic unit. He doesn't mention anything about them besides : > This is a little different from the circuits shown in the book in that the values of both CY In and CY Out are inverted for subtraction. (The entry in the lower-right corner of the table on page 322 should be inverted CY)In the book, at the point where I am, nothing is mentioned as to why or what is done with those inverted signals.During addition (Opcodes of 00 or 01), those XOR gates have no effect whatsoever as if they did not exist. When subtraction/""addition in two's complement"" is done, they do invert the Carry out signal of the adder ... but here is the strange thing:if my adder produces a Carry output of 1 , the XOR transforms it to 0 ... and when this tranformed signal is used in the next part of the operation for the next pair of bytes, the XOR gate at the input ""undoes"" the 0 so we end up having a raw bit of 1 ... as if nothing actually happened. The same logic happens if my carry output produces a 0, it is transformed to 1, and when it is fed back to the CY In, the XOR gates undoes the effect and we end up with a 0 again as the input to the adder.Clearly, then, those gates are not affecting the function of the actual ""subtraction"" and everything is functioning as I would expect it to. My question then would be : why exactly is the author adding those two XOR gates?The only reason I could think of is those inverted signals are going to serve some (unknown) use later on, but outside of that I can't really think of anything else.Any help or guidance would be much appreciated...",6,0.88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r9mz1u/i_am_reading_code_the_hidden_language_of_computer/,2026-02-20 05:35:11,2026-02-24 02:12:57

1r8gq4v,I am trying to make LOOP language,samaxidervish,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone,I’ve been thinking for quite a while about designing a loop-centric programming language, and during my research I came across the theoretical LOOP language associated with Dennis Ritchie, who has always been one of my biggest inspirations.The project I’m working on is called Gamma Loop. It’s a transpiled language, with the transpiler written entirely in C. The idea behind this choice is to keep the toolchain lightweight, portable, and fast, while still leveraging mature C compilers for optimisation and broad platform support. The goal is not to compete with mainstream languages, but to explore a minimal, loop-driven design that could be useful for specific niche or experimental applications.Conceptually, I’m focusing on making iteration the central abstraction of the language. Rather than treating loops as just another control structure, the idea is to build the language around them as the primary computational mechanism. The syntax is intentionally minimal and structured, and I’m aiming for clarity over feature density.At this stage, I’m mainly interested in feedback from a theoretical and language-design perspective:1.Does a loop-centric paradigm offer meaningful conceptual advantages?2.Would such a design be interesting from a computability or formal methods standpoint?I’d really appreciate any thoughts, criticism, or references.",2,0.59,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r8gq4v/i_am_trying_to_make_loop_language/,2026-02-18 21:59:16,2026-02-24 02:12:57

The bug is: during the text animations, any cell that precedes the first character of the text is rendered without any formatting - a leading black bar. This bar will move, lengthen, and shorten as the text animates. I have tried many things to force the default terminal background to match my regular background (#282828) but none of them have stuck. Any block of code in tte.lua that is commented with an XXX is something I have tried that doesn't work. I've looked at the source code for tte and some old nvim-terminal bug fixes but AI isn't helping and I'm grasping at straws now.

But they have basiccally the same hardware design and use the same pin mapping and peripherals as close as possible to one another. So both can use the same ground project and its configuration and picking different peripherals based on needs.

The engineering leadership has explicitly asked engineers to **not write code manually** their stand is to perform every aspect of development via cursor only. Bug analysis, technical design ( hld or lld), code implementation, test case design , tests implementation everything is forced via cursor. The JIRA timelines are set as such that even if you want to go through code manually or want to write code manually you won't be able to and their answer is to use cursor to do analysis and everything.

My team is already -2 headcount I don't think my manager wants to lose me.

I’m not asking whether AI is a bubble or not. I’m asking for names of non-fanatical researchers and engineers to listen to or read. Most of the replies just prove my point. Even when I try to ask for resources, I end up being pulled into one side of the debate. \---I’m a newly graduated computer engineer. After a few months without a job, I decided to prepare for a government engineering exam for a stable, well-paid position. If I fail, I’ll return to job hunting. While studying, I still follow tech news and social media, where I see extreme views about AI/LLMs either denying they’re real or claiming there will be no jobs left.Personally, I use it for learning, translating (even after writing this text, I told AI to fix grammar mistakes without changing my text), and of course coding small projects that I don’t really care about, like a habit tracker or my static Jekyll blog. I believe it’s a great tool that will make our jobs easier, and the only bad thing I think we programmers might face is being pushed toward more productivity. I know ai is a new trend too, while interviewing on school I got pushed to add LLM to random apps that have zero usability like LLM powered graduation system etc. So I see myself at center. But both sides of the internet disagree with me, and I’m confused.**The Anti-AI** side claims the AI boom will collapse and disappear, leaving only old AI generated artifacts behind. They reject LLMs entirely. I disagree. if companies can make money from it, it won’t just vanish. They call entire LLM products slop (yes %90 of them are) but they get frustrated even when someone uses AI voice with their own voice. **The Pro-AI** side, on the other hand, says the AI bubble isn’t real and that if I don’t use AI everywhere, I’m doomed. They claim art and desk jobs are already dead. I don’t think that’s true either, at least for now. Many self-proclaimed “prompt engineers” don’t understand what good code actually looks like. It may work today on one machine, but that doesn’t mean it’s reliable everywhere.**TL;DR:** I’ve noticed social media is extremely polarized about AI. One side says it’s fake and will collapse, the other says it will replace all jobs and you’re doomed without it. I personally see AI as a useful tool that improves productivity, but not as something that will either disappear or completely replace human work.So my question is: I believe these two separate groups are in huge echo chambers that only hear what they want, and I just can’t research and learn about AI technologies without entering those chambers of insanity.

I just worked hard, got good feedback. Then this year I expected to be reindexed closer to my peers — $100k+, which is normal for my level in my comp. Easiest promotion I thought, since compensation system tries to equal salaries for the same Grade + Position.Instead I got bumped to \~$80k. Manager said that’s all he could get from the project budget. Later I talked to another guy who also started as a student. Same numbers. We earn exactly the same. Then it clicked.

For context, I'm a ""senior"" software engineer at a unicorn startup building ML accelerators; I personally am on the training framework team. I've been here a little over 6 months at this point. I spent my first 3 years out of college as the first employee at a tiny aerospace startup, then 1.5 years working on automated fruit sorting before getting laid off and being out of a job for 10ish months. When I got this job, I felt so grateful to be employed again. However, now at the six month mark, I'm struggling with something of an existential crisis. For the first time in my career, I don't feel any sort of connection to my work, and I'm working without any sort of drive or passion. My previous jobs, I felt like there were real stakes, not just numbers on an investor's sheet. I like the people I work with quite a bit, but at this company, like many others I'm sure, the LLM bug is *strong*. Frequently when you have a question, someone's answer is ""have you asked Claude?"" It's maddening to me. I cut my teeth on actual research and engineering, so when I had questions, I had to hit the books. Now I'm...supposed to ask a neural network-powered auto-summarizer. Combine these things with the constant drumbeat of people saying ""we're automating ourselves out of a job"" and it really is wearing me down. I genuinely disagree with that sentiment, I know there'll continue to be a need for software engineers. But all of those things put together has me really questioning my place and my career choice, whether or not I'm betraying my own ideals, etc. I started working on my master's at my last job, and I find myself wondering what the point of this degree will even be once it's done, just because of how everything looks and sounds right now. To anyone out there with more experience than me, I'd really appreciate your advice on navigating this. I recognize that the LLM part in particular is a pretty sizable paradigm shift that we're all dealing with, but I have to imagine some of this sounds familiar to some greybeards out there.

1r9xk2m,I genuinely cannot tell if I’m good at my job or not,Dreadsin,cscareerquestions,"I’m a frontend engineer. I’ve been doing frontend for like 10 years now and feel very competent when it comes to actually developing software *on the frontend*. I’ve received lots of positive comments on my frontend code basically anywhere I worked, but it seems to not be that highly valuedHowever, I’ve always felt like I struggled in my career. Although I was ostensibly hired as a frontend engineer, I often find that I’m assigned to sort of ancillary projects. For example, I worked at (big company) and I think I barely even touched the frontend code and spent the majority of my time doing operational stuff and infrastructure. I felt I spent **far** more time being what effectively amounted to a SRE, which I didn’t feel particularly competent atAt this company, I occasionally pointed out that there were some things that were more difficult or tedious than they needed to be. As an example, the i18n had tons of problems; if you didn’t add translations using a **very specific, multi day process**, then the entire site would crash. One day, someone on the team triggered this bug, causing a huge problem. I brought up to my manager that this kind of bug is not normal. I offered to perhaps fix it, and offered multiple “levels” of fixes, with the most minimal being a 2 line change that’s forward-facing so at least it wouldn’t happen *again*He said I had no idea what I was doing, said I was lying on my resume, and told me whatever I learned in the past doesn’t matter here because this company is simply **better** than whatever companies I worked at before. He said he didn’t want to hear me talk about it again. He instructed me to “document the process” of adding a string to the i18n. It almost seemed like the frontend was so flimsy, they didn’t want anyone to touch it unless *absolutely necessary*.On the same note with that i18n, I noticed that the plurals were… all just wrong. People would have strings like “10 user(s) online”. I told them that this doesn’t work in other languages, and they asked me to prove it was actually a problem. I went through the spanish translations and pointed out at least 20, and a couple extra in other languages. I proposed using a built-in \`Intl\` library, and they said I was way overcomplicating things and that I still haven’t proved there’s a problem because they “don’t speak any language other than english” and “didn’t understand what was wrong with the spanish translation”. I didn’t really know how to respond; I showed them in google translate using “el angel” and “los angeles”, but they kept insisting I was making problems where none existedWhenever I talk to anyone at work about anything, it feels like I’m expending “good will tokens”. Like even just asking a simple yes/no question will take a week of work to earn back. I reeeeeally don’t like talking to anyone I work with, at any company I’ve been at. I can’t tell if I’m doing something wrong that’s pissing people off, so I try to lay low and do nothing wrong. Whatever technical skills I have seem more or less worthless these days, honestly. Sure, give me a ticket and I’ll get it done very quickly with thorough unit/integration/e2e tests before the deadline… but… **something** is gonna go wrong after that and none of that will matterI’m just wondering, is this what it’s like for most people, or is it like… genuinely me that’s the problem?",21,0.92,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r9xk2m/i_genuinely_cannot_tell_if_im_good_at_my_job_or/,2026-02-20 14:58:41,2026-02-24 02:12:59

I am currently in a rotational program where I have completed a few different rotations as a software dev.This rotational program is new and I don’t think it was thought out very well by leadership. I very recently learned that following the end of the rotational program, there are no full-time roles in the rotations that I have done, in fact there are no sfull-stack software roles at all.The only somewhat adjacent role is a Workday or ServiceNow developer role which i have heard can be low-code and susceptible to skill atrophy for full-stack engineers. I also don’t want to pigeonhole myself into working with a specific COTS application for the rest of my career.At my current rotation, I am working in Databaes and AI, and my task lead keeps telling me that since I am young, I need to be extremely visible to the team, asking to take on more work, and just being very hung-ho and the expectations are high for me. However, I don’t see the point in trying to impress ta team that doesn’t even have a full-time role to offer me at the end of the rotational program.I am thinking to spend as much time as realistically possible doing leetcode prep to prepare to leave.

I didn’t have a strong desire to work in defense, but I only managed to get offers from defense companies.By working at this company for a year or so will I be pigeonholing myself? I’m afraid that the more time that passes from when I finished my Masters will make transitioning or leaving the defense industry harder. On top of that, I’m afraid that defense contractor work will be too slow and ultimately prevent me from learning as much at the beginning of my career.Ultimately, I’m starting wonder if I sold myself short choosing this first job and would have been better off searching for a different job.I’d really appreciate any advice or stories from anyone who made a similar or notable switch between different roles.",12,0.71,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r9dhr4/afraid_im_pigeonholing_myself_in_defense/,2026-02-19 22:25:37,2026-02-24 02:12:59
1r71tuk,"1.5 YOE, company is now building product largely using AI. Is this good for me professionally?",MycoX2,cscareerquestions,"Hey,I graduated with a CS degree two years ago, and have been working for 1.5 yrs now in an SME.The first year was fairly typical. There were some web development projects for a client, where I was a junior dev in the team doing fullstack. Although there was some crunch, I got to learn a lot of skills hands-on.The last few months however, the company has begun to lay off most devs. There's 3-4 devs on this product, and what concerns me is that we're now building it pretty much entirely with tools like Claude and Antigravity aiming to get it done fast. Granted, the lead is experienced and knows his fundamentals very well, and he did lot of the development himself before I came onto the project, so the project is likely not a lost cause.I'm mainly concerned about my own career growth. Don't get me wrong, I use Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity a lot when I'm stuck, and try to learn the concepts from there.But I feel like I don't really learn as much about the fundamentals, languages and frameworks used, etc. when I just spit prompts to Antigravity to fix errors, build this or implement X feature - and for that to be the development process. I don't know if it'll be good for my career development in future. I kind of have to vibe-code for now though, since deadlines are tight and I'm expected to be 10x more productive with AI.The working hour expectations are a secondary thing - there's been periods throughout of working on weekends, after hours, maybe public holidays. I think that's a give-or-take thing though, where I've got to set my own boundaries. Besides, my friends in other industries seem to have it worse.Therefore, I'm kind of considering looking for another software dev job where I have the leeway and time to do things more manually and learn skills better. Heck, pivoting and being a BA is something I've been interested in doing for a while now. But how widespread is kind of AI usage in other companies? If many companies are doing this, maybe I shouldn't rush into things.Any advice for me to proceed from here? I've also got a side project going on, if that helps.Thanks!",12,0.68,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r71tuk/15_yoe_company_is_now_building_product_largely/,2026-02-17 09:47:15,2026-02-24 02:12:59
1rbv6qc,Would you stay a manager at a company who promotes only based on need and not merit?,MaleficentCherry7116,cscareerquestions,"I'm quickly learning that the company I thought I joined is not the company I was told I was joining. Every company I've worked for in my career promoted based on merit, or at the very least, pretended to.I'm a manager of four very hard working junior developers and was told last week that they have no chance of ever getting promoted unless we can show the company a need for a promotion. For example, the software engineers that work for me are underpaid level 2 engineers. No matter how hard they work, they have no chance of getting to the next level unless we can prove to the company that we have some need for a level 3 engineer. I have a couple of engineers who are very ambitious and have made it clear that they want to advance. They're willing to do whatever it takes, but the hard truth is that their chances of advancing have almost nothing to do with their work.As I understood HR,.they would rather have an overqualified junior developer leave and replace them with a new junior developer than promote them and pay more for a more senior developer.Level 2 developers make around $80K at my company, which is located in Austin, Texas. I've seen the recruiter turn down great software developers who asked for $81k. If you couple that with the fact that there's almost no opportunity for wage growth or promotions, it's going to be very tough on me as a manager.There's a lot more going on with this company than this issue, as you may see from my other posts, but my current thinking is that I'm going to stabilize the office as much as I can and then head for the exit. I hope that's as soon as possible, but I know the market isn't great.

1ra40q0,CS New Grad Career Pivot From SWE to Data Analyst,iGanti_,cscareerquestions,"I just graduated from a state university in December, 2025. I started my CS degree in August 2021, and did pretty well in my classes until I had a mental health issue and resulted in me failing a bunch of classes. It forced me to use my summers to catch up on those classes so I never got the chance to do any internships. For me at that point I just wanted to graduate and get me degree. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my career but I liked programming ever since HS so I tried to focus on that. I took a bunch of electives around it like Full Stack in C# and doing a capstone where I made my own project with a couple other people. I hated it. I could never get over the OOP hump of just abstraction over abstraction. It never clicked with me. However, since my university's CS department was so behind in today's tech, our project was just a CRUD machine so I just got through it and passed the class. All of my classes were like that more or less. For my Mobile App dev class, our project was a Wordle Clone. For my Databases class, our project was a simple Flask and SQLite CRUD program. Looking back on all of my classes in CS, I never learned anything useful. Yeah, I have strong soft skills like problem solving and recognizing patterns, but I never learned any marketable skills. And I understand a CS degree isn't the same as SWE but what am I supposed to do now? Fast forward two months after graduating and I have no impressive projects or career experience. I tried to teach myself React and Javascript since we were never exposed to that in school and I'm so lost. I keep hearing BUILD, BUILD, BUILD but I don't even know where to begin. All of my theoretical knowledge of SWE is just a soup of classes, data structures, and OOP but I can't apply it. Maybe I'm just used to having professors give me a structed course and steps to learn but I just can't teach myself. I don't even know what I want to learn. Front-end, back-end, app dev, full stack, the list goes on. I decided last month that I wanted to create a full-stack app using React/Typescript/Firebase that connects local musicians together through a social platform allowing them to find others who share the same musical taste as them. For example, if someone who doesn;t know about the local music scene around them they could create an account and list the instrument they play, experience, and what music they like. And then others could find them on this site and message them and arrange a meet. I thought this would be a cool idea and I could show recruiters or whoever. Since I had no experience building anything at that scale with Auth, Email Verification, Rate limiting I used Claude Code to help me design it. Obviously I'm not a vibe coding monkey since I have the theoretical and programmer brain from my CS degree but I still had no idea what I was actually coding. I could see a chunks of code and understand it how it does a specific function but going line by line I didn't know what it actually did. But after a couple weeks I got a MVP, rough documentation of the systems, and rigorously debugged and tested it. And it works. Yeah there's some rough spots and the CSS/design isn't the best but it works. The thing is from this project I just learned how to do system design and product management. I created a product and got an output but I never understood the middle part, the actual programming. And now I finally understand that I just hate programming and it isn't for me. So now I'm having a career crisis (I haven't even started my career yet) and scrambling to find out what I need to do. The data world seems interesting so I started to lookup what it means to be a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and AI/ML Engineer. From what I understand, everything past a Data Analyst is heavy programming so I don't want to do that. I know intermediate Python and basic SQL and little bit of Excel so maybe Data Analyst is something I should do? I messed around with Pandas and CSV files and I like how I can see trends from just mounds of data. I also kinda like Stats and Prob in college but idk. I would like to pivot to become a Data Analyst but idek where to begin. Do I get a cert like the IBM Data Analyst or is that a waste of time.

By second semester I ran into data structures, webdev frontend and intro to AI (it was not just those 3 but those were the CS classes).My college offers core classes, and honestly it has gotten to a point that without them I probably lose it because it seems I am just sick and tired of the major and was incredibly burnt out. Reckon despite the grades I got being pretty good like As and Bs I still just sick of the major. First semester junior was not so bad but now in my second I got Backend Webdev, Programming Languages and Software Architecture and it has gotten to a point where I am really questioning if this major is worth anything.Other things to note, I have 3 minors (math is freebie I technically get that regardless) but I have one in History and Theology for the sake of not losing it. They are not at all a problem for me it is just for a break from code. I also seem over the years been very good at being creative with code like stories and whatnot (Data structures we made a text based RPG and the story plot took me 5 minutes to make) along with webdev having like the vision for it.I just wanna know more or less, based on those out there in job fields already is just having a bachlor's degree worth it anymore. I keep hearing about how bad the job market is and well honestly I just believe I am in it to get the degree and then just get out there doing some form of job instead of just school.

1rbhsp2,Should i go all in on Android app developement ?,Odd_Basket_8045,cscareerquestions,"In my 4th semester, I was introduced to Java for the first time and I genuinely loved OOP. I ended up building an app in Java for both Android and desktop, and that’s when I realized I actually enjoy building software.Being the nerd I am, I started digging into whether Java is enough to build real-world apps and land a dev job. That’s when I found out Kotlin is basically the go-to for Android now, so I switched and started learning it.Fast forward: I’ve built a few apps with Kotlin. I understand a decent amount, but I’m definitely not an expert yet. Still learning, still breaking things, still enjoying the process.What’s messing with my head is this:I’ve used AI agents to implement features in my apps that I haven’t fully learned yet, and they work surprisingly well. Almost too well. It made me wonder—should I really spend years learning all this deeply if tools can already do a lot of the heavy lifting?So I’m a bit confused about direction right now:* Should I double down on Kotlin and Android dev?* Does Kotlin/Android actually have a solid future career-wise?* Is it realistic to aim for a job with this path?* Or am I setting myself up to learn skills that’ll be half-automated by the time I’m job-ready?I enjoy building apps a lot, and I like understanding how things work under the hood. I just don’t want to end up grinding for years on something that doesn’t have a future.Btw here is one of my projects i recently worked on ,let me know what level i am on ![\->Project](https://github.com/AleemKanyu/AquaLevel/releases/tag/v1.5.0)",4,0.63,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rbhsp2/should_i_go_all_in_on_android_app_developement/,2026-02-22 09:45:15,2026-02-24 02:12:59

Anyone notice something interesting about our work culture and cognitive load among myself and coworkers. On days when you have most context switching like back to back meetings, debugging interruptions, essays getting written back and forth in PR reviews, Slack constantly going off, switching between tickets, then food delivery almost seems inevitable. Not random days or weekends but I mean specific weekdays and especially afternoon/evening when you’re most burned out and mentally done. I looked back at about a year of my food delivery transactions and grouped them by weekday and time. the highest order day was monday afternoon. Honestly, it’s probably not even hunger it’s just cognitive depletion. By 7 or 8pm after a full day of decisions, opening uber eats or DoorDash removes one more decision from the stack and that seems enough. Seeing it laid out visually made it seem like predictable burnout window instead of poor discipline.

He said a good portion of their summer interns get return offers at the end of their program and they absolutely intend to do the same going forward.I don't mind the work, and I don't mind doing that full-time if I do happen to get a return offer BUT I am still a programmer at heart and I would definitely prefer a job or internship that has me writing code, be it traditional SWE or agentic AI or traditional ML.If I do get the role and I don't have any other offer, I will take it.

1r8z4hq,"Company has asked for feedback on my performance. Is this good, bad, or neutral?",MaleficentCherry7116,cscareerquestions,"I received a chat message and email from HR yesterday that I had been identified as a critical resource on my team and that they were going to send a survey to my supervisors, peers, and subordinates, asking for feedback on my performance. I was told repeatedly in the email that ""This is not negative!"". I was also told that I'm one of three people in the entire company that they've done this for. The ""goal"" according to them is to help ME and to.make things easier for ME. They will take the survey results and create a learning plan for me. Embedded in this email where they kept repeatedly saying ""This is NOT a bad thing!"" was a small snippet that mentioned ""planning for my succession"". What I'm trying to figure out is, how does this help ME? My team needs more resources, and that would help me a lot. The company could pay me more, but I'd take more resources over more money - anything that would help me to not work 80 hours per week. We have a very flat structure and there's no path upwards for me. Besides that, I don't think I'd want to go any higher in the supervisory chain. My next level would be director, but it would likely result in more responsibilities with no more pay.I'm not worried about the feedback of my subordinates or peers. I'm a bit worried about one C level guy who seems to want to hurt me for some reason. And maybe this feedback will help me become a better leader. But I'm not convinced that there's not some ulterior motive, as the company itself is pretty rotten Ex: They fired a guy on Tuesday and HR held an online meeting with our office telling us why people getting fired was a ""good thing"".

1r8i0yl,"I passed the first HR screening for an AI hyped company, but...",Affectionate-Laugh98,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR: Interview went ok but got AI hype red flags. Technical interview coming up - what to expect for C#/SQL ""Senior"" questions? Main concern: they want references but my ""previous company"" was actually a personal project I ran with some US friends, not registered. What do I do?Context from [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r6n544/should_i_stick_to_backend_only_is_full_stack/): 10 years hobbyist .NET dev, first professional job attempt.The Interview:HR said ""We're looking for a C#, SQL developer"" (no seniority mentioned, but I'm assuming maybe Senior? for 2.5k USD remote LATAM I really doubt it).The guy was really persistent about AI adoption, at some point he just told me: ""We contacted you because all our deployments are on Azure and you have solid .NET background, but in the end after some time the language won't matter, AI will code everything in any lang, so we don't really worry about it... so are you currently using AI? how are you implementing it? do you know RAG?""Obviously I said yes even though I had no idea what RAG was. Now buying Udemy course to catch up. They have their own local models apparently.When I heard ""the language won't matter"" I saw a huge red flag, almost cancelled right there, but I need the job so I just went ""ok, alright, you're right"". I truly doubt anybody can debug ""any language"" without understanding it deeply.I'm taking this because it's my first option, but this caused me some noise tbh. I think this company fell into AI hype hard and doesn't understand it, trying to implement AI where is not needed (migrations, etc). But I can adapt.Good stuff: HR mentioned quarterly performance reviews (""how do you feel, what to improve, etc"") which sounds decent despite bad Glassdoor reviews.Next steps he told me:* Psychometric tests (personality, english, basic logic) - done* Technical interview (no leetcode, no coding, just some ""advanced"" questions to determine my level) - this scares me tbh.* Reference check to validate CV historyQuestions:1. What kind of technical questions for C#/SQL should I expect? Company does software solutions/migrations for other companies, they have about 500 employees, Azure + .NET stack. They said basics of Azure is fine, not in-depth knowledge needed. How to prep? I feel like I don't know sh!t but also feel like impostor syndrome talking.2. About my references: They want contact from ""*previous company*"". But as I said in my previous post, this wasn't a company officially registered, it was a personal project I ran with some friends in the US for 7+ years. Even during the interview I said it but the guy didn't care or didn't listen carefully. My take is to be truly honest here in the next contact I get from them, I don't want to get the job lying, if I'm not a good fit, they should consider this and just don't hire me. Or if they hire me, maybe is because they don't care.Anyways, the problem is they're assuming I worked in a small company but it was never legally registered, not even as LLC. My friend did register an LLC but that was a year ago, not related to me at all. If they dig they'll see the LLC registration date doesn't match my 8 years timeline. So I guess I can't use that.They said it's ""*to comply with regulations and just a formality*"" to confirm I worked there the time I said.Best I can do is give them number of my co-owners (they financed it, not tech guys, but can confirm project existed 7+ years). Profits were low, was side project for them, main income for me, now the project is closing as I was the only one maintaining it and basically is not even an extra income now.I can't just not talk about this because this project is where I learned almost everything I know now today. Yet I fail when it comes to Distributed Systems, I never used Kafka, nor RabbitMQ in my life, didn't even needed, I know the concepts but only that...So, how deep do US companies dig on references? Just phone call/email or more in-depth? How do they check my background? I was in Venezuela for all those years, I have like 2 years in this new country (LATAM anyways), banking system is crap there in Venezuela so I used mostly Binance to hold money. But I know for sure this is not formal and looks terrible.Really lost here. If you think I should avoid this company to dodge legal troubles, let me know.EDIT: I'm trying to sell myself as a Mid Level, not Senior per se (although I don't mention it at all) because as I haven't worked in teams ever, I know I'm not a real senior. The project is 100% real, is online and I can talk about it all day long, I designed every single part of it and it's running smoothly so far, but almost no clients because it's very niche and scalating it would require a lot of money that I current don't have.",3,0.62,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r8i0yl/i_passed_the_first_hr_screening_for_an_ai_hyped/,2026-02-18 22:49:07,2026-02-24 02:12:59

Otherwise please let me know!",3,0.67,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r9f7vl/germany_salary_expectations_for_ios_developer/,2026-02-19 23:34:38,2026-02-24 02:12:59
1r9deoj,Possible issue with leaving Looking for work flag up too long on Linkedin?,Colt2205,cscareerquestions,I wanted to check with other people on here since I've had my flag up for a while on casually looking and then went to actively applying. Is there a point where you started getting a slowdown on recruiters or is it just the market right now? It seemed like there were offers back a year ago and now it seems like there's not a whole lot of new messages. I figured swapping to active would have brought attention.,3,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r9deoj/possible_issue_with_leaving_looking_for_work_flag/,2026-02-19 22:22:11,2026-02-24 02:12:59

1r7mw30,"Bsc in math with a a major in stats and computer science, or a Bsc Computer Science and Informatics",HrrBrr,cscareerquestions,"Hey guys, I’m at a bit of a crossroads and having trouble deciding which degree to commit to.My main priority is choosing the option that will make me the most employable and give me the strongest, most valuable skill set for the workplace long term.At the moment, I’m leaning towards the Mathematics degree. Informatics is currently my least favourite module and, to be honest, it sometimes feels unproductive for me because I often end up going home and teaching myself the material anyway. I also spend a decent amount of time self-teaching programming, and I’ve found that I’m quite capable of picking up the practical coding aspects on my own. Because of that, I feel like I could independently cover a significant portion of what Informatics offers.I genuinely enjoy Statistics, it’s probably my favourite subject at the moment.One of my main concerns, though, is whether companies would care that I did a Mathematics degree instead of a pure Computer Science degree. Would I be seen as less competitive or treated as second-tier compared to CS graduates, or would a strong maths background actually be viewed favourably? I might pursue an honours in CS afterwards. I’m already working on personal projects, certifications, and actively looking into internships.Thank you for your help me",3,0.72,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r7mw30/bsc_in_math_with_a_a_major_in_stats_and_computer/,2026-02-17 23:47:04,2026-02-24 02:12:59
1r7flr1,Leave a new job after 2 weeks for another job?,Phantomat0,cscareerquestions,"Recently got a Software Developer job, this is my 2nd week. I was contacted by a recruiter to apply for another job. I haven’t put my new job on my LinkedIn yet so I assume they think I’m still looking for new opportunities. I told the recruiter I had an offer on the table for 90k, which is what I make now. I was scared to tell them that I had already accepted the offer, and already started working - thought this may make me look like a job hopper. I told them I had an offer and that I’m open to new possibilities. They told me they can offer me something closer to 100k and a 10% bonus, plus it’s hybrid work whereas at my current role it’s in person. Not to mention the new role is for a Fortune 100 company as opposed to a startup.I took the interview kind of as a “let’s see what happens” and turns out they are moving me on to the final round of interviews. Now I’m starting to seriously consider the possibility of a change in employment. The new job is using the same tech stack but it’s more money, bigger company, and hybrid work. How does this look though? I only disclosed to the recruiter that I have an offer currently, but not to the interviewers. Should I tell them at all about my current job, that I just started a job and within 1 week I’m looking for a change?Not sure how to approach this situation, would really appreciate the advice on what to do if the new role makes me an offer and if I should risk moving to a new job within 1 week of just starting my current job. I mean how would I even handle this with my current job, would I need to give them a two week notice? Would they just let me go right away?",3,0.72,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r7flr1/leave_a_new_job_after_2_weeks_for_another_job/,2026-02-17 19:12:52,2026-02-24 02:12:59
