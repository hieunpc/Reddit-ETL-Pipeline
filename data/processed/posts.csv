1pju9s2,"Mid-level, but my Python isn’t",kerokero134340,dataengineering,"I’ve just been promoted to a mid-level data engineer. I work with Python, SQL, Airflow, AWS, and a pretty large data architecture. My SQL skills are the strongest and I handle pipelines well, but my Python feels behind.Context: in previous roles I bounced between backend, data analysis, and SQL-heavy work. Now I’m in a serious data engineering project, and I do have a senior who writes VERY clean, elegant Python. The problem is that I rely on AI a lot. I understand the code I put into production, and I almost always have to refactor AI-generated code, but I wouldn’t be able to write the same solutions from scratch. I get almost no code review, so there’s not much technical feedback either.I don’t want to depend on AI so much. I want to actually level up my Python: structure, problem-solving, design, and being able to write clean solutions myself. I’m open to anything: books, side projects, reading other people’s code, exercises that don’t involve AI, whatever.If you were in my position, what would you do to genuinely improve Python skills as a data engineer? What helped you move from “can understand good code” to “can write good code”?EDIT: Worth to mention that by clean/elegant code I meant that it’s well structured from an engineering perspective. The solution that my senior comes up with, for example, isn’t really what AI usually generates, unless u do some specific prompt/already know some general structure. e.g. He hame up with a very good solution using OOP for data validation in a pipeline, when AI generated spaghetti code for the same thing",150,0.95,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pju9s2/midlevel_but_my_python_isnt/,2025-12-11 10:28:26,2025-12-16 01:47:37

1pj0iyr,Spark uses way too much memory when shuffle happens even for small input,Aggravating_Log9704,dataengineering,"I ran a test on Spark with a small dataset (about 700MB) doing some map vs groupBy + flatMap chains. With just map there was no major memory usage but when shuffle happened memory usage spiked across all workers, sometimes several GB per executor, even though input was small. From what I saw in the Spark UI and monitoring: many nodes had large memory allocation, and after shuffle old shuffle buffers or data did not seem to free up fully before next operations.  The job environment was Spark 1.6.2, standalone cluster with 8 workers having 16GB RAM each. Even with modest load, shuffle caused unexpected memory growth well beyond input size. I used default Spark settings except for basic serializer settings. I did not enable off-heap memory or special spill tuning.I think what might cause this is the way Spark handles shuffle files: each map task writes spill files per reducer, leading to many intermediate files and heavy memory/disk pressure. I want to ask the community* Does this kind of shuffle-triggered memory grab (shuffle spill mem and disk use) cause major performance or stability problems in real workloads* What config tweaks or Spark settings help minimize memory bloat during shuffle spill* Are there tools or libraries you use to monitor or figure out when shuffle is eating more memory than it should",49,0.92,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pj0iyr/spark_uses_way_too_much_memory_when_shuffle/,2025-12-10 11:45:00,2025-12-16 01:47:37

Our repo is mainly with DDLs, airflow dags and SQL scripts (we want to soon start using dbt so we get rid of DDLs, make the airflow dags logic easier and benefit from other dbts features).We have test & prod environment and we currently do the feature branch strategy -> branch off test, code a feature, PR to merge back to test and then we push to prod from test. (test is our like mainline branch)Pain points:•⁠We dont enjoy PRs and code reviews, especially when merge conflicts appear… •⁠sometimes people push right to test or prod for hotfixes etc.. •⁠we do mainline integration less often than we want… there are a lot of jira tickets and PRs waiting to be merged… but noone wants to get into it and i understand why.. when a merge conflict appears, we rather develop some new feature and leave that conflict for later..I read an article from Mattin Fowler about the Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches and while it was an interesting view on version control, I didnt find a solution to pur issues there.My question is: do you guys have similar issues?

Executors use the unified memory manager and spill happens when the in memory shuffle buffer and aggregation hash maps grow beyond execution memory. Spark then writes intermediate data to local disk under spark.local.dir and later merges those files.What is not clear is how much of this behavior is expected due to shuffle mechanics versus a sign of inefficient partitioning or skew.

But the company is finally investing in data modeling, quality, and governance, and now the team has freedom to choose proper tools for the next stage.In the near future, we want more reliable pipelines, a real data warehouse, better observability/testing, and eventually support for analytics and MLOps.

1pjqkne,Am I out of my mind for thinking this?,Spooked_DE,dataengineering,"Hello.I am in charge of a pipeline where one of the sources of data was a SQL server database which was a part of the legacy system. We were given orders to migrate this database into a Databricks schema and shut down the old database for good. The person who was charged with the migration then did not order the columns in their assigned positions in the migrated tables in Databricks. All the columns are instead ordered alphabetically. They created a separate table that provided information on column ordering.That person has since left and there have been some big restructure, and this product is pretty much my responsibility now (nobody else is working on this anymore but it needs to be maintained).Anyway, I am thinking of re-migrating the migrated schema with the correct column order in place. The reason is that certain analysts sometimes need to look at this legacy data occasionally. They used to query the source database but that is no longer accessible. So now, if I want this source data to be visible to them in the correct order, I have to create a view on top of each table. It's a very annoying workflow and introduces needless duplication. I want to fix this but I don't know if this sort of migration is worth the risk.

I’m relatively new to Spark’s distributed paradigm, but I saw that most time was being spent with explosions and joins—mainly shuffling data a lot.In this query, almost every column’s value is a key to the actual value which lies in another table. To make matters worse, most of the ingest data are array types. So the idea here was to1. Never explode2. Never use joinsThe result is a combination of transform/filter/flattens to operate on these array elements and map them with several pandas UDFs (one for each join table) to map values from broadcasted dataframes.This ended up shortening our pipeline more than 50x, from 1.5h to just 5 minutes (the actual transformations take ~1 minutes, the rest is one-time cost setup of ~4 minutes).Now, I’m not really in charge of the data modeling, so whether or not that would be the better problem to tackle here isn’t really relevant (though do tell if it would!).

I am the only data analyst at my company in the healthcare/pharmaceutical industry.We don't have large data volumes. Our data comes from Salesforce, Xero (accounting), SharePoint, Outlook, Excel, and an industry-regulated platform for data uploads. Before using cloud platforms, all my data fed into Power BI where I did my analysis work. This is no longer feasible due to increasingly slow refresh times.I tried setting up an Azure Synapse warehouse (with help from AI tools) but found it complicated. I was unexpectedly charged $50 CAD during my free trial, so I didn't continue with it.I opted for BigQuery due to its simplicity. I've already learned the basics and find it easy to use so far.I'm using Fivetran to automate data pipelines. Each month, my MAR usage is consistently under 20% of their free 500,000 MAR plan, so I'm effectively paying nothing for automated data engineering. With our low data volumes, my monthly Google bills haven't exceeded $15 CAD, which is very reasonable for our needs. We don't require real-time data—automatic refreshes every 6 hours work fine for our stakeholders.That said, it would make sense to explore Microsoft's cloud data warehousing in the future since most of our applications are in the Microsoft ecosystem. I'm currently trying to find a way to ingest Outlook inbox data into BigQuery, but this would be easier in Azure Synapse or Databricks since it's native. Additionally, our BI tool is Power BI anyway.My question: Would it make sense to migrate to the Microsoft cloud data ecosystem (Microsoft Databricks or Azure Synapse) in the future? Or should I stay with BigQuery? We're not planning to switch BI tools—all our stakeholders frequently use Power BI, and it's the most cost-effective option for us.

I also feel like my technical skills will also prevent me to move further ahead and I feel stuck in this position.I’ve recently been offered a role at a different large company, but as a senior data analyst. This is still quite a technical role that requires SQL, Python, cloud data lakes and dashboarding. It will have a focus on data stewardship, visualisation and predictive modeling and forecasting for e-commerce. Salary is quite similar though a bit lower.I would love to hear what people think of this career jump. I see a lot of threads on this forum about how engineering is the better more technical career path, but I have no intention of becoming this technical powerhouse. I see myself move into management and/or strategy roles where I can more efficiently bridge the gap between business and data. I am nonetheless worried that it might seem like a step back?

1pn6hnv,ELI5 MetaData and Parquet Files,EvilDrCoconut,dataengineering,"In the four years I have been DE, I have encountered some issues while testing ETL scripts that I usually chalk up to ghost issues as they oddly self resolve on their own. A recent ghost issue had me realize maybe I don't understand metadata and parquets as much as I thought.The company I am with is big data, using hadoop and parquets for a monthly refresh of our ETL's. In the process of testing a script changes were requested to, I was struggling to get matching data between the dev and prod versions while QC-ing.Prod table A had given me a unique id that wasn't in Dev table B. After some testing, I had three rows from Prod table A with said id not in Dev B. Thinking of a new series of tests, Prod A suddenly reported this id no longer existed. I eventually found the three rows again with a series of strict WHERE filters, but under a different id.Having the result sets and queries both saved on DBeaver and excel, I showed my direct report it, and he came to the conclusion as well, the id had changed. Asking me when the table was created, we then discovered that Prod table's parquet files were just written out while I was testing.We chalked it up meta data and parquet issues, but now it has left me uncertain of my knowledge about metadata and data integrity.",7,0.82,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pn6hnv/eli5_metadata_and_parquet_files/,2025-12-15 12:46:50,2025-12-16 01:47:37

Our downstream SQL streaming table (CREATE STREAMING TABLE ...) immediately failed because we can't pass skipChangeCommits.Question: Is there any hidden SQL syntax to ignore deletes, or is switching to Python the only way to avoid a full refresh here?Auto Loader Partition Inference: After a partial pipeline refresh (clearing one table's state), Auto Loader failed to resolve Hive-style partitions (/dt=.../) that it previously inferred fine. It only worked after we explicitly added partitionColumns.Question: Is implicit partition inference generally considered unsafe for Prod DLT pipelines?

1pi4dtl,Protobuf schema-based fake data generation tool,SnooHabits4703,dataengineering,"I have created an open-source \[protobuf schema-based fake data creation tool\](https://github.com/lazarillo/protoc-gen-fake) that I thought I'd share with the community.It's still in \*very early\* stages; it does fully work and there is some documentation, but I don't have nice CI/CD GitHub Actions set up for it yet, and I'm sure as folks who are not me start using it, they will either submit issues or code improvements, but I think it's good enough to share with an avant garde group willing to give me some constructive feedback.I have used protocol buffers as a binary format / hardened schema for many years of my data eng / machine learning career. I have also worked on lots of brand new platforms, where it's a challenge to create realistic, massive scale fake data that looks believable. There are nice tools out there for generating a fake address or a fake name, etc., and in fact I rely upon the nice Rust \[fake\](https://github.com/cksac/fake-rs) package. But nothing did the ""final step"", IMHO, of taking a schema that has already been defined and using that schema to generate realistic, complex fake data of exactly the structure you may need.At its core, I have used protobuf's \[options\](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#options) as a mechanism to define what sort of fake data you want to generate. The package includes two examples to explain itself, here is the simpler one:\`\`\` syntax = ""proto3""; package examples; import ""gen_fake/fake_field.proto""; message User { option (gen_fake.fake_msg).include = true; string id = 1 [(gen_fake.fake_data).data_type = ""SafeEmail""]; string name = 2 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""FirstName"" language: ""FR_FR"" }]; string family_name = 3 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""LastName"" language: ""PT_BR"" }]; repeated string phone_numbers = 4 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""PhoneNumber"" min_count: 1 max_count: 3 }]; }\`\`\`As you can see, you add the \`gen\_fake.fake\_data\` option type, providing things like the data type, the count of repetitions, and you can supply a language. In the example above, you would get a \`User\` type of data object created with fake data filed in for the UUID, first name, family name, and phone numbers.I'm hoping this can be useful to others. It has been very helpful to me, especially when testing for corner cases like when optional or repeated values are missing, ensuring UTF-8 is being used everywhere and, most importantly, being able to generate the SQL code and whatnot needed for generating downstream derived data before the backend has all the tooling in place to be able to supply the data formats that I need.As an aside, this also helps to encourage the \[data contract\](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/data-contracts) way of working within your organization, a lifesaver tool for robustness and uptime of analytics tools.",4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pi4dtl/protobuf_schemabased_fake_data_generation_tool/,2025-12-09 10:45:55,2025-12-16 01:47:37
1pi3lpb,How do you approach solution design? (And bit of a rant),Ulfrauga,dataengineering,"Maybe a dumb question, maybe not. In your data team, do you conduct solution design reviews? Do you even have a deliberate solution design phase?I might be wrong in my usage of ""solution design""; go ahead and correct me if so. What I mean is more simply - how do you intend to achieve the required output, or meet the requirements?Contrived example: What they want is the classic ""build a report"". Or maybe just the data model to hand over to someone else to build a report with. Raw data is not ingested. So, let's say that simply, you have to ingest, model, and deliver.* But what does the development of that outcome look like?* How do you break down the work?* What objects are you going to create?* Where do you put this information and decision points?* Does a peer review this ""design""?* Who ""sets"" this design?This is where I might be venturing off topic, but it's why I'm asking - how do others in the industry do this stuff, and to what standard? I'm not above thinking I might be looking for problems where there are none, or making drama and pointing fingers. On the other hand, maybe my concerns are valid.I'm the senior in my team (of two ICs). Not the manager, but the tech ""lead"". I've talked quite a lot with my more junior colleague about the benefits of planning stuff out, coming up with a ""design"", and going over it together. Two sets of eyes and all that. IMO it's a fundamental development concept. Applicable to data work as much as baking a wedding cake.I don't see a lot of planning, or pipeline and data model design being done. Maybe it happens on a paper notebook? That's fine to an extent, but it doesn't appear to be transferred to the ticket system, DevOps items, or even a Word doc in SharePoint. We have regular time slots to discuss current work and otherwise chat generally about what we do. It's meant to be pretty informal. This is sometimes when we might do a ""design review"" but it tends to be based on verbal description of what is being done, and a remote view of developmental code. I'll give feedback, but it's 50/50 if it drives any change.We use branching and PRs with reviews. The PR review has become an opportunity for reviewing the overall approach and design as much as code review. But at that point, it's sort of too late to be challenging or making suggestions about the overall design. There's been more than a few occasions where I know we have to deliver - value to the business! - but I'm seeing technical debt in the future. Undocumented, sometimes inconsistent, has the feel of thrown-together.I want to bring it up with my manager, I just need to frame it well.

1pnfwhw,Breaking into the field?,pilfered-words,dataengineering,"Hi guys, I have a kind of difficult situation. Basically: * In 2020, I was working as, essentially, a BI Engineer at a company with a fairly old-fashioned tech stack. (SQL Server, SSRS reports, .NET and a *desktop application*, not even a webapp.) My official job title was just Junior Software Engineer. I did a bunch of data engineering-adjacent things (""make a pipeline to load stuff from this google spreadsheet into new tables in the DB, then make a report about it"" and such)* Then I got sick and had to take medical leave. For several years. For some reason, my job didn't wait for me to come back.* Eventually I got better. I learned Python. I'm really much better at Python now than I ever was at .NET, though I'm better at SQL than at either. * I built a stupid little [test project](https://github.com/manya-t/infinitecraft) doing some data analysis and such. * I started looking for jobs. And continued looking for jobs. And continued looking for jobs.* Oh and btw I don't have a college degree, I'm entirely self-taught.In the long term, I want to break into data engineering, it's... the field that fits how my mind works. In the short term, I need a job, and any job that would take me would rather take a new grad with more legible qualifications and no gap.

I even thought about using flink for this job, but that's maybe over doing it ? Since it's not that complicated of a task? I also wonder if spooldir wouldn't have to read all the file in memory to parse it ? Because my files size could vary from little as 1mb to hundreds of mb.And also, I would love to have your opinion about combining my custom script + spooldir , in a way where my script generates json header files in a file monitored by a spooldir connector?",2,0.75,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pjhb0o/kafka_spooldir_vs_custom_script/,2025-12-10 22:56:12,2025-12-16 01:47:37

1pj042w,Datalakes for AI Assistant - is it feasible?,CalendarNo8792,dataengineering,"Hi, I am new to data engineering and software dev in general.I've been tasked with creating an AI Assistant for a management service company website using opensource models, like from Ollama. In simple terms, the purpose of this assistant is so that both customer clients and operations staff can use this assistant to query anything about the current page they are on and/or about their data stored in the db. Then, the assistant will answer based on the available data of the page and from the database. Basically how perplexity works but this will be custom and for this particular website only.For example, client asks 'which of my contracts are active and pending payment?' Then the assistant will be able to respond with details of relevant contracts and their payment details.For db related queries, i do not want the existing db to be queried. So i though of creating a separate backend for this AI assistant and possibly create a duplicate db which is always synced with the actual db. This is when i looked into datalakes. I could possibly store some documents and files for RAG (such as company policy docs) and it will also store the synced duplicate db. Then the assistant will be using this datalake instead for answering queries and be completely independent of the website.Is this approach feasible? Can someone please suggest the pros and cons of this approach and if any other better approach is possible?

1pjp5q7,"I realized I do like programming, I just hate feeling dumb",Unknown__Redditor__,learnprogramming,"Programming is definitely one of the hardest subjects to MASTER in life. It's certainly the hardest thing for me to grasp. And when I say ""master"", I mean, getting to that point where you're confident in programming apps with little to no lookups. Getting to that point where you can confidently pass live coding interviews.This is the point where I strive to get to, and the only way to do this is by actually learning the material. Hopefully some can relate when I say programming is very much enjoyable when you understand every bit of your code, but it gets frustrating if you have gaps in your knowledge and don't understand certain pieces of your code.When you understand every bit of it, you can literally lay on your bed and figure out the error in your head. If you take shortcuts it's much harder to do so, and you'll end up being at the point where you don't know if you can solve the error no matter how much time you have.I made this post to hopefully motivate you guys to actually learn the material, in which many of you are if you're in this sub.TLDR: If you actually learn the material live coding interviews will be a much smoother process(obviously), and coding will be much more enjoyable since you'll actually feel capable of debugging your app. The only way to get rid of imposter syndrome is by actually proving to yourself that you can do the work, don't take shortcuts.Edit: I also came to the realization that it is highly unlikely to ""master"" programming in the way I depicted it out to be. You won't be able to program everything without looking something up but there's nothing wrong with that.

I'm a first-year CS student.I’ve been learning C through ***C Programming: A Modern Approach*** (up until chapter **15**). I started the book because:1. C was being used in our lessons (my first programming class).2. I heard C is a really good first language for learning programming fundamentals. (mostly from subreddits lol)Now that our classes are switching to Java next semester, studying C feels kind of boring, especially since we don’t use it in class anymore. I want to go into web development / fullstack, where C isn’t really used, and I feel like I’ve already learned the essentials such as loops, types, functions, pointers, arrays, strings, etc.So I’m wondering: does it make sense to keep diving deeper into C at this point? My concern is that studying C more might just make me better at C itself, rather than teaching me concepts that are applicable across most PLs.My plan is to focus on Java for college and eventually frontend and backend development. I’m just not sure if spending more time on C is worth it now, especially since I don’t feel as motivated as I did when it was part of our class.Should I keep going with C, or focus on Java and web development instead?",118,0.95,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pify6g/should_i_continue_learning_c/,2025-12-09 19:01:37,2025-12-16 01:47:39

The other is a tool for the company that analyzes pdf pages and which will have a pipeline translation for the text, using python, and this one I am using mostly AI as I never coded in python before and it was handed to me promptly when I started. Now the stress of this 2nd project plus my lack of skill made me use chatgpt A LOT.

I know that in some fields these programs help people land jobs quickly, but I’m not sure if this model works in IT.* Broadening or diversifying my skill set: learning Three.js to specialize in a niche area, moving toward a full-stack role or even switching to game development, which has always interested me.

I am a current game development student in university, however for some reason my uni's game development department and CS department aren't super cooperative. I have just completed algorithms & data structures class (generally the 3rd CS class you take here) and so far everything we've done has been in java with a bit of python. Our games department does not have any specific programming classes because the assumption is that most of that will be handled by the CS department, however the main engine we use for the game dev classes is UE5 which runs in C++. There is a games scripting class that I've just completed but that's all using blueprints. I've been told that higher level CS classes don't have a specific language requirement, however there is no dedicated class using c++ or even a primer as far as I'm aware, and would like to be able to transition my knowledge from java to C++ so I can start working effectively in building from there in that to sharpen my skillset later on. Advice I'm seeing tends to be either to read a specific book/forum (which tends to be a \*very\* slow method for me, safe to say I'm generally an audiobook person) or to just ""go and start"", which I can grab a compiler and start googling how something formatted in java is formatted in c++, but that doesn't give me as good of an understanding.

1pmo24t,Teaching an old programmer new tricks...,TypingTadpole,learnprogramming,"I confess that I have a standard / frequent question around ""how do I create X type of app"", but there are three twists to the question, I promise! The FAQ helped, but before I go off and running, I want to ""test"" my hypothesis.**First, I'm old**. Not too old to learn (approaching 60), just that I have old programming experience. So I typed programs from computer magazines in BASIC into Commodore VIC-20s and PETs back in the 80s and saved them on cassettes; I learned BASIC and STRUCTURED BASIC in high school in the 80s; I took BASIC/FORTRAN/COBOL courses in university in the 90s. I learned enough to write a menu system in BASIC for running in DOS back in the '80s that allowed me to add/subtract items, write batch files that would launch when the menu closed and then reopen the menu when I was done running whatever program was, compile it and run it in DOS. Used it for years. So I have \*\*\*SOME\*\*\* experience. Just nothing recent. Oh, and I also can debug basic HTML / CSS issues on websites but avoid javascript stuff at least for now. I'd rather run WordPress with free plugins than program my own. I'm more of a user than a developer. The second twist is that I have **two very specific needs** in mind, both of which could perhaps be done with a robust GUI and back-end database instead of programming it. But well, I want something a bit more customizable to my specific issues to solve. So, like the videos recommend, I have specific problems to solve that will keep me interested! The first is harder and I have more passion for it; the second is easier and maybe where I should start, even though I'm not as excited about it.And the third twist is that I am **NOT trying to build a revenue stream**. I'm open to having a small revenue stream tied to it enough to buy myself a coffee if someone wants the extra ""bits"", but just looking to use the apps myself, $$ is not my goal. If others in my immediate community find it useful, I'd be open to sharing the apps everywhere for free and with no advertising. Maybe some ""extras"" available in a pro version for $1 or something.The first need would be a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts like a **field recorder** as if someone was doing a survey or recording a business transaction BUT without local wifi/internet access. So, like you were out in the woods, say, doing biology research and you wanted to record which birds you saw, and the date/time/interesting details. BUT you also want to be able to record the equipment you were using and the place/location with sort of default ""profiles"". Like, ""Profile 1"" says you're using equipment X, Y, Z; Profile 2 says you're using X, A, B; Profile 3 says Y, Z, B, etc. But I want to load the default profiles in as starter info. There are existing database apps that do this, but I have some unique usage links that I'll need to pull from unique style databases too, which the database apps didn't have the power to do. Ultimately, I need the initial recording apps (mostly dumping info into a set of fields in a database) and then once I'm back in civilization, uploading them to a more powerful PC app that would be almost the same software in PC form, with some extra printing, formatting, layout features. I confess I have no idea where that info is saved on the phone, or the PC, or the inbetween bits (common upload to cloud when there's a connection? Like synching photos?). Just that I want the data to eventually be in the PC for more processing. It's not very complicated for operations (input screen, load profiles, enter data, save data, load previous records, etc.), and the graphics needs are not very sophisticated (very functionally focused). If it was the early 90s, I'd be tempted to even use COBOL. The app will do no calculations or advanced graphics; it's almost entirely a text-based database entry and retrieval function with some flex on forms.The second need is similar but even simpler in design. It's like **a quiz game.** Questions, with 4 possible answers, timed. It could be used as a game or as a flashcard-type study aid. I have a specific purpose in mind, but the functionality is basically that of a trivia game -- load small database (say 25 Qs about topic 1), go through the Qs, have options for hints or retries, get score at end, equivalent of a global leader board (so some internet required). But all single player, not live games with others, no live online element. And the extra twist for this one is I would love to be able to do it in iOS, Android, AND a version for my website for those who DO have access. The mobile apps would work differently, and I don't NEED a website version, but I'll keep my options open. The FAQ tells me to use Kotlin or Java (for Android); Objective-C or Swift (for iOS); C#, VB or JS for Windows Phone; or use PhoneGap / Titanium in HTML/CSS/JS.

1plrpk3,Creating a Two dimensional Collection that takes Enums as index,Hellinfernel,learnprogramming,"Hi! For context, I am currently working on a little Latain learning side project and I am trying to setup a specific subclass for that. The background is that latin has a lot of suffixes that occur under a combination of properties that the given word has. The two properties that are currently of interest for me are the Numerus (an Enum) and the Casus (another Enum).My first instinct was to create a two dimensional array for that, but I quickly realised that this will lead to confusion problems if I don't know at any given point in time in which order the suffixes are actually placed into the array, because they aren't linked to the values of the Enum directly.To circumvent this, I quickly figured out that I actually wanted to use the values of the Enum directly and map specific values in a table like fashion to them, basically like:(Singular, Nominative, ""us"")(Singular, Accusative, ""um"")Etc.So I wrote this class here:https://github.com/Hellinfernel/Latin-Learing-Program/blob/main/latin%2FBiEnumMap.java#L19Now the thing is I still don't have any idea if my approach here is even technically doable because I don't know how to get an collection of all the values of an given Enum class.I tried EnumSet and Enum directly, but none of that seemed to really function and I couldn't find a function in the docs that fulfilled my requirements, and I feel like I am either completely and utterly blind or am just not searching in the right place.I am pretty sure my code has other problems as well, but for now I just would like to know the following:How do I get a list of all values of a given Enum class to use them as an index for a map?",3,0.72,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1plrpk3/creating_a_two_dimensional_collection_that_takes/,2025-12-13 18:02:53,2025-12-16 01:47:39

1plaqc8,[Python] TypeError with floats using gmpy2 library,cton999,learnprogramming,"Hello, I am new to and testing out the gmpy2 library to eventually use in other python code, but I have ran into some type of TypeError problem.>**1. What is the problem?**gmpy2.is\_integer() is saying that floats that are equivalent to a whole number (i.e. 2.0) are integers, but when using gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) with ""whole number"" floats, it raises a TypeError where only integers or rational arguments are allowed.>**1. What is your code supposed to do?**Currently, I'm just testing simple mathematics operations and learning the gmpy2 library. My code is supposed to check what the type of input is for 2 numbers you select (through gmpy2.is\_integer() ), and do either gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) for integers, or do gmpy2.div(x, y) for floats.>**2. What is your code doing instead?**See: ""1. What is the problem?"">**3. What inputs, if any, cause the problem?**Floats and gmpy2.mpfr() created floats that are equivalent to whole numbers, like 2.0.>**4. Is there an error message of some kind? If so, include it.**Yes: TypeError: qdiv() requires 1 or 2 integer or rational arguments>**2. What have you tried?**I can easily use the normal python isinstance(x, float), convert ""whole number"" floats to integers, or just use gmpy2.div(x, y) or some other division, but that is not the problem. The problem is with gmpy2.is\_integer() and/or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).For the code, I have tried using the first number as a float, the second number for a float, both numbers as floats, and those three combinations as gmpy2.mpfr() floats as well.>**1. What have you already tried to debug your own problem? Where do you suspect the problem is? What uncertainties do you have?**Printing gmpy2.is\_integer(x) and gmpy2.is\_integer(y) both return True when both x and y are ""whole number"" floats, and then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) raises the TypeError, so I'd say the problem would be when I use gmpy2.is\_integer() or gmpy2.qdiv(x, y).>**2. What precisely are you confused by?**I am confused that gmpy2.is\_integer() is saying that ""whole number"" floats are integers, but then gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) says I'm not using integers.>**3. Have you tried googling for answers? If so, what search queries have you tried? What pages have you read? What do you find confusing about them?**I have like 20 tabs open that are gmpy2 docs, and various searches with different ways to ask about my problem. For example: ""gmpy2 is\_integer"", ""gmpy2 qdiv"", ""gmpy2 qdiv with whole number floats"", and ""Why does gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" mpfr floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?"". For the last search, I got exactly 2 results, both of which are just gmpy2 documentation.On the gmpy2 docs, is\_integer() → bool. Return True if x is an integer; False otherwise, and gmpy2.qdiv(*x*, *y=1*, */*) → mpz| mpq. Return x/y as mpz if possible, or as mpq if x is not exactly divisible by y.I am aware that gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True is a float checked is equivalent to a whole number. I am also aware that gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) only works on integer and rational arguments.So what I'm confused about is why gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them.>**DO** be sure to actually ask a question.Why does gmpy2.is\_integer() returns True for ""whole number"" floats if gmpy2.qdiv(x, y) cannot use them?>Anyways, here's the actual code import gmpy2 def test(x, y):     rlist = []     z = gmpy2.mul(x, y)     rlist.append(z)     h = gmpy2.add(x, y)     rlist.append(h)     if gmpy2.is_integer(x) and gmpy2.is_integer(y) is True:         print (gmpy2.is_integer(x))         print (gmpy2.is_integer(y))         j = gmpy2.qdiv(x, y)         rlist.append(j)     else:         i = gmpy2.div(x, y)         rlist.append(i)     return rlist print (test(4, 2.0))",4,0.83,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1plaqc8/python_typeerror_with_floats_using_gmpy2_library/,2025-12-13 02:51:55,2025-12-16 01:47:39

No matter how much I sleep, exercise, meditate, or whatever, it keeps happening.The work itself isn’t helping. It’s mostly infra, bugs,security standards - barely any coding and zero creativity. My team is nice but almost everyone is remote, and the office is full of people from unrelated teams. Plus people barely talk to each other. I haven’t formed any real friendships here; everything feels formal or “networking-like.” Nothing like the tight on-site friendships I had before.My therapist says there’s probably something else causing this anxiety (also generally I’m someone with big self-imposed expectations of myself).

1pjcwpi,Just got fired from my job of almost 10 years for performance issues. Unsure where to go.,shamanshaman123,cscareerquestions,"I was a software eng at a somewhat big company for 9 years and 8 months until about 2 hours ago. For the last 2 years, I've honestly been kind of circling the drain and struggling to keep up with the other devs. I managed a senior promotion about 5 years into the job, but was promoted based on my fullstack work, which involved a lot of frontend; almost immediately after getting promoted, I was shunted into mostly backend, which I was able to maintain for about 2 years (although just barely, IMO) since we worked in Node.js.2 years ago, my team switched to Java, which I had very little experience in. I deeply struggled to keep up with the team, which at this point were experienced Java developers. The struggle overtook me, and I made dozens of mistakes, some small, some big. Admittedly, I didn't do anything outside of work; I tried to maintain WLB and stick to working during working-hours only, and didn't do any other prep or studying or projects outside of work hours. After many conversations about performance with my manager, they decided to let me go without a PIP or anything; just fired.Despite working in backend for 4 years now I feel like my backend skills are garbage. But since I had no opportunities during work to do any frontend work, my frontend skills have also decayed significantly to the point that I'm fairly sure I can't pass an interview based on it. On top of all that, the job I had was my first software job out of college, so I don't have experience with other companies to work with. I feel at least a little screwed (this is about as optimistic a take I can give), and extremely directionless; backend clearly isn't a good fit for me, and my frontend skills are junior-level at best. I have no idea how to present myself for interviews, or what to prepare for; I'm considering taking a frontend bootcamp to try and modernize my skills to _hopefully_ be able to get a frontend role, but I'm terrified that I can't maintain a senior skill level. It's frustrating because I know I have at least some experience to draw on; I couldn't have kept this job for so long without at least doing something right at some point. But it all feels so murky.If anyone has been in a similar position or has any advice, I would gladly take it. I don't mind if it's harsh; I'm not in a position to complain. I've been given 2 months severance and have some savings, but I have multiple bills to pay so I cannot just relax and take it slow.

I feel like everything I see online is how bad the job market is for SWE's, and the only hopeful posts are ones about how the job itself is changing. I personally would rather not work in the field if the job truly becomes something akin to managing a team of AI agents. If I'm building something I want to actually build the thing. The degree I'm currently pursuing is in Data Science and the curriculum is still basically the same thing as a normal CS degree except a bit more math. I did this with the hope that the data science job market would be a bit better, but even now I'm hearing that the market is becoming over flooded. One might also think that MLE would be the way to go since that's what's taking over jobs right? But similar to DS I hear that those jobs are changing rapidly and are flooded with applicants. There's not as much need to custom train a model from scratch so most just use API's for the big names. It seems like the only jobs holding up are more Sys Admin and general cyber security roles. Personally, that realm isn't my thing and I'd much rather be programming something even if it's just a couple lines of SQL and Python. Is programming really just dead? At least in the way that it once was? I'm only 18 also, so I'm sure my view is just a bit too narrow. I'm sure that a lot of sectors are feeling this as well. I think just with AI being the new big thing and Computer Science jobs being so adjacent to this new advancement that we catch a lot of the heat because of it.For context on who I am, I'm an undergrad student at a T100. My high school offered free CompTIA certs, so I have the A+, Network+, and Security +. I've been programming since high school, and I did a software dev competition where I placed 5th nationally. I also worked essentially a help desk job my senior year of hs as well.If anyone has SWE adjacent jobs please let me know! Either just ones in general or ones that fit my experience.

1pkjnl3,Strategy to upskill due to AI,phonyToughCrayBrave,cscareerquestions,Assume that you are working as a CRUD software engineer and most of what you are doing is coding in a framework (Django/Rails/Spring/React) etc. You aren't the technical lead. You are self taught or went to a bootcamp or maybe you have a CS degree but you didn't go to the best school and never got anywhere near FAANG. You haven't looked at leetcode in years.We know that productivity is increasing due to AI. We know that AI will likely keep getting better.What is your plan to survive in this career path?

Is it over?,Zealousideal_Code760,cscareerquestions,"Title is TLDRHey everyone, I just completed the final exam for my degree 50 minutes ago, but I’m honestly at a loss. For the past 3 years, I’ve been doing everything people say you’re “supposed” to do to break into tech (not just SWE positions, i'd be happy with anything) and nothing has worked.stuff I’ve tried: • Attended tons of networking events •Joined CS-related extracurriculars in my school • Reached out directly to recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn • Asked my network for referrals • Had my resume reviewed by recruiters + people working in the industry • Rebuilt my resume multiple times for different niches (IT, Cloud, SWE, Data, etc.) • Built different personal projects tailored to those fields • Applied to hundreds of roles consistently (from 2022-2025)Despite all that, I’m graduating with no internship experience, and I keep hearing that this will make my job search even harder than it already is.So I’m wondering: • Has anyone else been in this situation and managed to turn things around? What worked for you? • Are there fields adjacent to CS where companies are willing to hire fresh grads without experience? • are certain tech markets better that i could pivot to? like tech sales, QA, IT support, cybersecurity, bizops, etc.? • Is it worth doing certifications (AWS, Security+, CCNA, etc.) at this stage? • Would contract work, freelancing, or even a non-tech job but in a tech company help me get a foot in the door? (this is probably my most likely path, i work for a city but my current role is part time and unrelated to tech.

With this I get analytics that show different metrics of applicants to jobs. To no ones surprise, even very basic entry level developer roles are getting 1000+ applicants as soon as they are posted. As an example, one role I saw, showed 85% of applicants had masters degrees, and 73% were senior-level applicants, while the rest of the figures (bachelor's, mid-level, entry-level) were in the teens.Given these metrics, recruiters and hiring managers, how is your process with choosing candidates in this situation? if it is an entry-level position, do you prioritize who is more experienced in years or do you opt to choose best fit based on the posting level?

1phwxkl,Why are the biggest job-board websites so bad lol,Sorryusernmetaken,cscareerquestions,"I recently started looking for an entry-level job. Compared to job sites in my country, LinkedIn and Indeed are awful: the filters don’t work, I can’t tell how much experience a job requires without scrolling, and half the time they force me to enter previous job titles even if I’ve never worked before. I get emails with vague subject lines, so I have to open each one to understand what they’re about. Indeed often doesn’t show the posting dates of jobs. LinkedIn is bloated with random buttons, Facebook posts I don’t care about, and spam bots constantly message me.When I look at supposedly ""entry-level"" or ""intern"" job descriptions, I often find stuff that’s obviously AI-generated:Seeking a Junior .NET Developer with 5+ years in development and production support, specializing in .NET Core 8/C# and Visual Studio. Mandatory skills include expert troubleshooting, deep proficiency with New Relic (NRQL) and CloudWatch Logs Insights for advanced observability. Experience with Postman is required, while familiarity with AWS services (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, etc.) and networking fundamentals is a strong asset.Often these descriptions contain grammar mistakes. Then, when I go to the company’s website I’m greeted with pure horror: basic HTML/CSS, looking like it was scraped in 2006. I go to the ""Careers"" tab on their website and it throws me 404.

Been working here for around 5 years.When I first got employed, I was immediately told I’d have to replace a developer that resigned. My job is to develop and maintain some minor web apps.I was fresh out of school (and pandemic) so it would’ve been my first job. I was also told I’d have had help from said resigned developer in form of emails (spoiler: I couldn’t ask him anything). The code was a mess, half of the stuff wasnt working and there was no documentation so I basically had to learn/guess what stuff did (nobody in the company knew what my apps did)Time skip to today. Stuff is better as I fixed most of things and everything works now. I even implemented some new stuff.Tomorrow I have a big deploy planned, and as every other time I do, I got anxiety. Because of that, I wanted to look of other people had my problem. And they do, and the discussions helped me a lot. But everyone talked about how it is a team’s effort. And I was there like “Wait, what team?”I’m all alone following my stuff. I do all the coding, testing and maintainance.

1plvgdj,Capital One TDP vs AT&T TDP - New Grad Software Engineer Offer Guidance,mrgenius17,cscareerquestions,"Hello Community,Fortunate enough to have received two Entry Level Software Engineer offers from these companies. Looking for your guidance on which will be better to start my career with.Long Term Goals (at least as of now):Work at a bigger, more respectable Company. Either Big Tech or Fin-Tech (like Bloomberg).Get an MBA from a respectable institution (like Top 20), since my undergrad is a no-name school. Intuition behind getting an MBA is I like software, but I also like the business side of things. MBA obviously also helps with getting a promotion to the business side of things. I will probably pursue the MBA part-time while working full-time.Capital One TDP, McLean, VA (DC Metro Area):Base: 130k, One Time Bonuses (Sign-on + Relocation): 30k, Target Bonus (3600)Pros and Cons will of course be a bit team-dependent, I know a Senior Engineer there who 'might' be able to help with team-matching when the time comes. Team has not been assigned yet; they will match us later.TDP Rotations are 1 year and then 6 months, for a total of 18 months. I do not know about the conversion rate from TDP to full-time.Pros:Bigger Name and a more tech-focused company.TCDC Metro Area(?): Plenty of companies in the DC Metro Area to switch to in case things goes sideways. Amazon, Google, Gov Contracting, Consulting.Hybrid Schedule: 3 days in office, 2 days remoteCons:Stack Ranking and PIP Culture: Around 10% of the staff is laid off every 6 months.Performance Review Method: Performance is evaluated every 6 months, and historical performance does not matter in the next cycle.Worth mentioning: Everyone is judged on a scale of 1-5, and as long as you can stay at 3 or above, you are fine.DC Cost of Living is very high, so not sure how far the higher TC will go.I will have to switch sooner or later (unless there's a miracle and I find a great team environment there).AT&T TDP, Atlanta, GA:Base: 90k, One-Time Bonus (Sign-on): 5k, Target Bonus: 10k.TDP rotations are 1 years each for 2 years. Getting placed full-time in a team after TDP is pretty much guaranteed.This is an intern return offer, so I have pretty good rapport with the managers there. I believe I will have a say in the team matching so I end up with a team whose work seems interesting to me.Pros:Chill work environment, very low chances of PIP/layoff.When I interned there, everyone including the managers were really nice.Good rapport with TDP management means getting placed on a good (or at least interesting) team.Chill work environment means I can coast there while getting a Masters in CS from Georgia Tech (part-time) that might help with employability in the future. Georgia Tech name is pretty strong in tech so that would work in my favor.Atlanta also has a lot of companies there to switch to like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Blackrock.Cons:5 days in-office (haven't worked remote in my life so I don't really mind this)Lower TC (?): Atlanta's cost of living is much lesser.Legacy Organization (?): This might play a part when trying to switch.Please help me navigate this. Are there any factors I am not considering or giving enough importance to?My primary thoughts were the TC difference is pretty huge to not be considering Capital One, although in a high CoL area. More tech-focused company. But that comes at the cost of being on your toes all the time, in an unstable market.Would you rather be in the DC Metro Area or in Atlanta?

1pkntlv,Looking to make a list of non-toxic tech companies,parleG_OP,cscareerquestions,"With all the doom and gloom in the tech industry right now, I wanted to hear from this community. What companies do you think are actually good places to work? I’m not talking about top-tier compensation or perks like free food or rides. I mean places where the work feels meaningful, you’re treated with basic respect, you can spend time with your family, and you’re not at risk of getting laid off at the snap of a finger.It feels like in the last 15 years, getting a high paying tech job has become part of people’s identities. The tradeoff is that a lot of us have lost touch with what it means to live a full life, where work is part of life instead of the whole thing. Hobbies, friends, family time, just being a human being. All of that gets pushed aside for the grind.I made the mistake of opening TeamBlind today and that place is a mess. Everything is about who has it worse, who has it better, or people endlessly hyping trillion-dollar companies like it’s their entire reason for being.I don’t expect big tech to magically grow a heart. At the end of the day, these are businesses. So in the spirit of keeping it real, I’d love for people to share workplaces where the culture is actually decent. I’m tired of seeing the 200th post about how terrible Amazon’s culture is. If someone wants a better life, they probably won’t find it in the belly of the beast.To be clear, this isn’t about discouraging anyone from aiming for MAANG if that’s what they want. Go for it. I just want to build a thread where people can say, here are the companies where you can have a career without sacrificing your entire life chasing something you never quite catch.

1pjlsx3,Can I please get feedback on my Patreon Senior SRE experience?,Icy-Dog-4079,cscareerquestions,"I was rejected but I’d love to see if I can get some honest feedback. I know it’s a lot but I need help because I’m not getting offers!Please take a look.It’s a Senior SRE role.# Patreon SRE – Live Debugging Round (Kubernetes)## Context* Goal of the round:Get a simple web app working end-to-end in Kubernetes and then discuss how to detect and prevent similar production issues.* Environment:Pre-created k8s cluster, multiple YAMLs (base / simple-webapp, test-connection client), some helper scripts.Interviewer explicitly said I could use kubectl and Google; she would also give commands when needed.* There were two main components: 1. Simple web app (server) 2. test-connection pod (client that calls the web app)---## Step 1 – Getting Oriented* At first I wasn’t in the correct namespace; the interviewer told me that and then switched me into the right namespace.* I said I wanted to understand the layout:* Look at the YAMLs and scripts to see what’s deployed.* I used kubectl get pods and kubectl describe to see which pods existed and what their statuses were.---## Step 2 – First Failure: ImagePullBackOff on the Web App* One of the simple-webapp pods was in ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull.* I described my reasoning:* This usually means the image name, registry, or tag is wrong or doesn’t exist.* I used kubectl describe pod to see the exact error; the message complained about pulling the image.* We inspected the deployment YAML and I noticed the image had a tag that clearly looked wrong (something like ...:bad-tag).* I said my hypothesis: the tag is invalid or not present in the registry.* The interviewer said for this exercise I could just use the latest tag, and explicitly told me to change it to :latest.* I asked if she was definitively telling me to use latest or just nudging me to research; she confirmed “use latest.”* I edited the YAML to use the latest tag and then, with her reminder, ran something like:* kubectl apply -f base.yaml (or equivalent)* After reapplying, the web app pod came up successfully with no more ImagePullBackOff.---## Step 3 – Second Failure: test-connection Pod Timeouts* Next, we focused on the test-connection pod that was meant to send HTTP requests to the web app.* I ran kubectl get pods and saw it was going into CrashLoopBackOff.* I used kubectl logs :* The logs showed repeated connection failures / HTTP timeouts when trying to reach the simple web app.* I wasn’t sure if the bug was on the client or server side, so I checked both:* Looked at simple-webapp logs: it wasn’t receiving requests.* Looked again at test-connection logs: client couldn’t establish a connection at all (not even 4xx/5xx — just timeouts).---## Step 4 – Finding the Port Mismatch (Service Bug)* The interviewer suggested, “Maybe something is off with the Service,” and told me to check that YAML.* I opened the simple-webapp Service definition in the base YAML.* I noticed the Service port was set to 81.* The interviewer asked, “What’s the default port for a web service?” and I answered 8080.* I reasoned:* If the app container is listening on 8080 but the Service exposes 81, the test client will send traffic to 81 and never reach the app.* That matches the timeouts we saw in logs.* I changed the Service port 81 → 8080 and re-applied the YAML with kubectl apply.* The interviewer mentioned that status/health might lag a bit, and suggested I re-check the test-connection logs as the quickest validation.* I ran kubectl logs on the test-connection pod again:* This time, I saw valid HTML in the output, meaning the client successfully connected to the web app and got a response.* At that point, both pods were healthy and the end-to-end path (client → Service → web app) was working. Debugging portion complete.---## Step 5 – Postmortem & Observability DiscussionAfter the hands-on debugging, we shifted into more conceptual SRE discussion.1) How to detect this kind of issue without manually digging?I suggested:* Alerts on:* High CrashLoopBackOff / restart counts for pods.* Elevated timeouts / error rate for the client (e.g., synthetic test job).* Latency SLO violations if a probe endpoint starts timing out.* Use a synthetic “test-connection” job (like the one we just fixed) in production and alert if it fails consistently.2) How to prevent such misconfigurations from shipping?I proposed:* CI / linting for Kubernetes YAML:* If someone changes a Service port, require:* A justification in the PR, and/or* Matching updates to client configs, probes, etc.* If related configs not updated, fail CI or block the merge.* Staged / canary rollouts:* Roll new config to a small subset first.* Watch metrics (timeouts, restarts, error rate).* If they degrade, roll back quickly.* Config-level integration tests:* E.g., a test that deploys the Service and then curls it in-cluster, expecting HTTP 200.* If that fails in CI, don’t promote that config.3) General observability practicesI talked about:* Collecting metrics on:* Pod restarts, readiness/liveness probe failures.* HTTP success/error rates and latency from clients.* Shipping these to a monitoring stack (Datadog/Prometheus/Monarch-style).* Defining SLOs and alerting on error budget burn instead of only raw thresholds, to avoid noisy paging.# Patreon SRE System Design## Context* Format: 1:1 system design / infrastructure interview on a shared whiteboard / CodeSignal canvas.* Interviewer focus: “Design a simple web app, mainly from the infrastructure side.” Less about product features, more about backend/infra, scaling, reliability, etc.---## 1) Opening and Problem Framing* The interviewer started with something like: “Let’s design a simple web app. We’ll focus more on the infrastructure side than full product features.”* The prompt felt very underspecified to me. No concrete business case (not “design a rate limiter” or “notification system”) — just “a web app” plus some load numbers later.* I interpreted it as: “Design the infra and backend for a generic CRUD-style web app.”---## 2) My Initial High-Level ArchitectureWhat I said, roughly in order:* I described a basic setup:* A client (browser/mobile) sending HTTP requests.* A backend service layer running in Kubernetes.* An API gateway in front of the services.* Because he emphasized “infra side” and this was an SRE team, I leaned hard into Kubernetes immediately:* Talked about pods as replicas of the application services.* Mentioned nodes and the K8s control plane scheduling pods onto nodes.* Said the scheduler could use resource utilization to decide where to place pods and how many replicas to run.* When he kept asking “what kind of API gateway?”, I said:* Externally we’d expose a REST API gateway (HTTP/JSON).* Internally, we’d route to services over REST/gRPC.* Mentioned Cloudflare as an example of an external load balancer / edge layer.* Also said Kubernetes already gives us routing & LB (Service/Ingress), and we could have a gateway inside the cluster as well.---## 3) Traffic Numbers & Availability vs Consistency* He then gave rough load numbers:* About 3M users, about 1500 requests/min initially.* Later he scaled the hypothetical to 1500 requests/sec.* I said that at that scale I’d still design with availability in mind:* I repeated my general philosophy: I’d rather slightly over-engineer infra than under-engineer and get availability issues.* I stated explicitly that availability sounded more important than strict consistency:* No requirement about transactions, reservations, or financial double-spend.* I said something like: “Since we’re not talking about hard transactions, I’d bias toward availability over strict consistency.”* That was my implicit CAP-theorem call: default to AP unless clearly forced into CP.---## 4) Rate Limiting & Traffic Surges* When he bumped load to 1500 rps, I proposed:* Add a global rate limiter at the API gateway:* Use a sliding window per user + system-wide.* Look back over the last N seconds; if the count exceeds the threshold, we start dropping or deprioritizing those requests.* Optionally, send dropped/overflow events to a Kafka topic for auditing or offline processing.* I described the sliding-window idea in words:* Maintain timestamps of recent requests.* When a new request arrives, prune old timestamps and check if we’re still under the limit.* I framed the limiter as being attached to or just behind the gateway, based on my Google/Monarch mental model: Gateway → Rate Limiter → Services.* The interviewer hinted that rate limiting can happen even further left:* For example, Cloudflare or other edge/WAF/LB can do coarse-grained rate limiting before we even touch our own gateway.* I acknowledged that and said I hadn’t personally configured that pattern but it made sense.* In hindsight:* I was overly locked into “gateway-level” rate limiting.* I didn’t volunteer the “edge rate limiter” pattern until he nudged me.---## 5) Storage Choices & Scaling Writes* He asked where I’d store the app’s data.* I answered in two stages:1. Baseline: start with PostgreSQL (or similar):* Good relational modeling.* Strong indexing & query capabilities.2. Write-heavy scaling:* If writes become too heavy or sharding gets painful, move to a NoSQL store (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB).* I said NoSQL can be easier to horizontally shard and often handles very high write throughput better.* He seemed satisfied with this tradeoff explanation: Postgres first, NoSQL for heavier writes / easier sharding.---## 6) Scaling Reads & Caching* For read scaling, I suggested:* Add a cache in front of the DB, such as Redis or Memcached.* When he asked if this was “a single Redis instance or…?” I said:* Many teams use Redis as a single instance or small cluster.* At larger scale, I’d want a more robust leader / replica cache tier:* A leader handling writes/invalidations.* Replicas serving reads.* Health checks and a failover mechanism if the leader goes down.* I tied this back to availability:* Multiple cache nodes + leader election so the app doesn’t fall over when one node dies.* I also introduced CDC (Change Data Capture) for cache pre-warming:* Listen to the DB’s change stream / binlog.* When hot rows or tables change, proactively refresh those keys in Redis.* This reduces cache misses and makes read performance more stable.* The interviewer hadn’t heard CDC framed that way and said he learned something from it, which felt positive.---## 7) DDoS / Abuse Protection* He asked how I’d handle a DDoS or malicious traffic.* My answer:* Lean on rate limiting and edge protection:* Use Cloudflare/WAF rules to drop/slow bad IPs or UA patterns.* Use the gateway rate limiter as a second line of defense.* The principle: drop bad traffic as far left as possible so it never reaches core services.* This was consistent with the earlier sliding-window limiter description, but I could have been more explicit about multi-layered protection.---## 8) Deployment Safety, CI/CD & Rollouts* He then moved to deployment safety: how to ship 30–40 times per day without breaking things.* I talked about:a) CI + Linters for Config Changes* Have linters / static checks that:* Flag risky changes in infra/config files (ports, service names, critical flags).* If you touch a sensitive config (like a service port), the pipeline forces you to either:* Update all dependent configs, or* Provide an explicit justification in the PR.* If you don’t, CI fails.* The goal is to prevent subtle config mismatches from even reaching staging.b) Canary / Phased Rollouts* Start with a small slice of traffic (e.g., 3%).* If metrics look good, step up: 10% → 20% → 50% → 100%.* At each stage, monitor:* Error rate.* Latency.* Availability.c) Rollback Strategy* Maintain old and new versions side by side (blue/green or canary).* Use dashboards with old-version vs new-version metrics colored differently.* If new-version metrics spike in errors or latency while old-version remains flat, that’s a strong indicator to rollback.* He seemed to like this part; this matches what many SRE orgs do.---## 9) Security (e.g., SQL Injection)* He asked about protecting against SQL injection and bad input.* My answer, in hindsight, was weaker here:* I mentioned:* Use a service / library to validate inputs.* Potentially regex-based sanitization.* I didn’t clearly say:* Prepared statements / parameterized queries everywhere.* Never string-concatenate SQL.* Use least-privilege DB roles.* So while directionally OK, this answer wasn’t as crisp or concrete as it could have been.",30,0.84,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pjlsx3/can_i_please_get_feedback_on_my_patreon_senior/,2025-12-11 02:18:08,2025-12-16 01:47:40

1plsoh5,Too reliant on LinkedIn - alternative?,Meetcode,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Any LinkedIn alternatives for making yourself visible?I have been working as SWE for over 5 years, and LinkedIn has been **extremely** helpful in my career.

1pk5eov,Are there actual passionate people who take the time to learn anymore ? Social media around CS suggests a very different Outlook,EstablishmentProof54,cscareerquestions,"Hey, Quick BG—> 3rd year engineering major (focused around software and embedded systems) I work in software primarily (co-ops) 2x Analyst / SDE Co-ops at mid to large size companies in Canada. I feel like traditional coding//problem solving is almost lost. I remember actually liking computers back in school (mid 2010s) and I’m not sitting on a high horse saying I’m better than anyone who prolly went into the field for money or any other reason because that’s not the viewpoint I’m judging this situation from.I’m seeing the market is almost trashed with students who mostly vibe code or really “cracked” students who are building up companies // are also TAs at the same time // also 2x at Amazon. For one end of the spectrum, every other persons got Claude, cursor, Copilot and putting up something in their Bio like “Building (insert words)ly”. You know I felt like in this field there’s a learning part as well where you take the time to get hands on with code , not quickly build something or use AI straight away. AI is great for learning and speed but the way its used to build projects which the “builders” themselves can’t explain most of the code for is pretty shocking. I feel like a lot of GitHub is just trashed with students uploading vibe coded react and next js projects. The other end is filled with really good students who somehow intern in their first year , have 5x internships by 3rd year and go on to be content creators and founders or whatever. Can’t complain about them as such because they probably do good but the question comes here, Where are the people who actually take the time to learn things , maybe not go so fast (I’m aware people have differences in learning speeds but it’s very absurd with the way it’s going). What I mean is the emphasis on theory and understanding stuff little by little , building up on it and then going onto be a very Good software engineer/ programmer / problem solver. As I said people probably can learn quickly but it almost feels like there’s no time on the software side of things to actually learn things properly (Web dev/ App dev the fields I’ve worked in). However on the other side of my degree which has circuits and embedded systems , it’s not so easy to get in and you can’t fake your way into it either. The barrier to entry is very high but at the same time if you’re good at your job you’re not easy to replace either. It still has the essence of the old comp sci when it was a subject to me in middle school. Everyone at the time I feel (mid 2010s) took the time to learn stuff and didn’t go so fast but the good part of the trade was they were genuinely very good at what they did. I don’t think that’s the case anymore today , and I’m only speaking about this from the entry level viewpoint.

I built an internal tool that helps devs on my team.2. I performed some bug fixes, some that were quite tricky and difficult, some that were pretty straightforward.3. I migrated one of our back-end services from the cloud to an on-prem instance.And that’s pretty much it. Fairly basic React work + Spring Boot work and some AWS as well.I guess I feel really bad because the vast majority of this work I accomplished in maybe a year at most and after that I stagnated hard because I was battling stage 3 cancer for some time and dealt with the aftermath of that (poor mental health) for quite some time.

During the review meeting, after all the positive comments, I was told by the higher up standing in for our manager that I was not eligible to be put up for senior because I am not showing the same code base knowledge as colleagues with 15-20 years experience (who were promoted to senior while at my level.) In my opinion and despite the positive comments, I think I am performing poorly. Even if my performance improves, I have no chance of promotion at this new company. In short, I need a new job. Unfortunately, I think my lack of education and experience building vs maintaining software is harming my ability to study for and perform in interviews. The terminology used by my colleagues seems totally foreign even when I should have heard it before, and I can't seem to remember or apply it to our work when trying to discuss it with others. In general, I feel stupidly inarticulate. I think my memory is terrible. I feel like my brain will sometimes short circuit during team meetings and I suddenly cannot find words or even concepts to describe what I was working on just the day before. I don't think it is anxiety related... I just don't remember. I also feel very slow at my work - in between childcare responsibilities, my own brain wandering, hating every second of the tasks, and getting distracted around the house, I probably put in two focused hours in an eight hour day. This makes me worry and beat myself up because obviously I could do so much better if I could focus. This inability to focus, along with some migraine stuff, bleeds into my ability to study. And studying algorithms doesn't seem to help me explain them better or talk about them in an intelligent way. With all of this, I'm not sure how I am going to get a new job at a senior level position.I need some tips to 1) learn how to learn what I ACTUALLY don't know 2) memory tips for vocabulary, tech trends, algorithms, etc. (flashcards? something else?) 3) learn how to talk about what I do know in a way that demonstrates my intelligence 4) a clear study plan that incorporates all of this so I don't have decision fatigue day after day. I have about one hour per day to spend on this 5) some encouragement. I am the sole provider for a neurodivergent kid and a spouse in school, I worked hard to make this career change as a previous professional musician and was good enough to be immediately hired as a TA and then get a job in the middle of the early covid recession. I cannot quit. I like solving problems.

More personal thoughts:I interned at AWS, but I didn’t really connect with my team, and my project was pretty separate from what they actually worked on. Because of that, I still don’t have a solid grasp on what the full-time role would feel like day to day. I also didn’t love the overall Amazon culture, which makes me a bit hesitant about returning.Location is another factor. I’m from NYC and very used to walkability and easy access to everything. Seattle seems closer to that lifestyle, while San Jose feels much more suburban. I’m trying to figure out how much that should weigh into my decision since I plan to move back to NYC eventually.I’m also unsure which role sets me up better long-term (prestige/growth). I’m curious how hiring managers view early-career experience at AWS vs Adobe and which one tends to offer more mobility down the line.",17,0.78,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pm3p5a/swe_ng_sj_adobe_vs_seattle_amazon/,2025-12-14 03:09:44,2025-12-16 01:47:40

I quit my non technical job in Dec 2024 to focus fully on building my resume and learn web development. I have been applying to roles since January of 25' but it wasn't until August ish that I actually had a decent resume with Full Stack projects, 2 hackathons(including a 3rd place overall), I did a small internship at my school where I used Wordpress. I then also launched a startup solo, I have about 10 non paying users but hopefully it keeps growing. At the same time I have been doing freelance work, from landing pages to SaaS stuff. I have also been networking a lot, been present in almost all cs school events. I got referrals for Microsoft and other local companies(no luck). All while applying to 50 ish jobs per week since April-May.I have only been able to do like 5 phone screenings, a few follow up interviews, 1 technical at a startup and a final non-technical round at a f500 company but for a web marketing role(no leetcode). I have great soft skills and a lot of projects I can talk about so that is really not an issue for me. I have been griding leetcode on and off and I hate it too but what can we do. Now that I graduated this december, I decided that I dont want to keep waiting, so I took a role at the GeekSquad and am studying for my CompTIA Network+. I also won a coding event at my school and got a free voucher for the AZ-500 for next year.I do enjoy development but the market has been terrible for me.

My team is a very siloed. We support 1 main business function but we literally have dozens of applications that do completely different things and have entirely different frame works. There is a dedicated SME for each main application and we have 1 tech lead. I’m not sure what the point of a tech lead is because there is no way one person could understand ALL of my team’s applications.This is why I don’t think agile works for my team.

Our scrum master and project managers have no idea what our work is even on a business/non technical level. They have no idea what our stories mean. Their entire job is planing meetings and asking for updates. I feel silly even giving updates because they have no idea what I’m talking about.

No one on the scrum agile side knows what’s going on, and I don’t blame them because no one on our technical team knows everything about all the apps we support. The agile leadership hates when we roll over and when we don’t have fast “churn” rate for our stories. Did I mention we support a 24/7 operation and have on call rotation?

At work we add objects more manually using RowMappers.I'm not one to lie on my resume, this would be a first for me. It flavored the rest of the screening as I seemed low energy and low confidence in the rest of the questions afterwards. I was also screened after a long workday and commute at 6pm... The recruiter also appears to have assumed I have been working with Spring Boot at my workplace when we just use Spring Framework. While I originally coded in college using SpringBoot, it's been awhile since I coded using that specifically. Some of the screening questions were also geared towards that.Just feeling super dumb and like an imposter as a mid level Java software engineer. At least 20-30% of the questions at some point I said ""I don't know"".In the end the screener said I answered all the questions but appeared to lack confidence. I then gave some truth and said that I'm not always good at talking tech (some of the vocabulary I'm supposed to know goes right past me) but I am better when I can just sit down at the computer and write code. In the end the recruiter said if they like my personality they will find a reason to hire me, which was nice to hear but also felt like it confirmed I didn't do very well in the screening?

How do I break into modern LLM work?,thrwy_86543210,cscareerquestions,"I’m looking for candid guidance on how to make a realistic pivot into modern AI and LLM roles. I’m a senior IC data scientist with over 10 years of experience at large, well-known tech companies. I have a PhD in NLP that predates AlexNet and word2vec, and a CS/SWE background, and I have always worked as a generalist with broad experience across the classical ML and data science stack: ETLs, data pipelines, experimentation, statistics, and lightweight models for product teams.After a year out of industry, I'm job hunting again, but my recruiter callback rate is under 5 percent. I seem overqualified for junior roles and underqualified for senior AI roles, and I honestly no longer know where I fit. I’ve seen plenty of DS-to-RE transition advice, but very little that speaks to someone senior like me. I’d be happy in research engineering, applied LLM work, AI-oriented data science, or agentic / safety / alignment roles, but I’m not sure which of these are actually realistic anymore.Most of my experience is in classical ML, not deep learning or modern LLM tooling. I understand Transformers conceptually and followed Karpathy’s GPT-from-scratch tutorial, but I don’t have professional experience with PyTorch, LLM finetuning, or production LLM systems. These gaps come out in interviews. For example, I was asked to use a tokenizer and realized I didn’t even know which ones are standard today. I could explain BPE, but I had to ask the interviewer to name one, and when they said TikToken I had to ask them to spell it because I had never heard of it. Not my best moment. My side projects also feel too toy-like to signal real capability.What I want to figure out is what skills and projects actually matter for breaking into modern AI and LLM roles and how someone with my background can reposition effectively. My concrete questions are:1. What is the most efficient way for someone with my background to build practical and credible skills for modern AI and LLM roles?2. How should I balance interview preparation with building real projects?3. Which roles are realistic targets for me given my experience and gaps?4. Am I fooling myself by thinking I could do the work if I could get past interviews, or is signaling the real barrier here?",8,0.91,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pi4exh/senior_ds_with_oldschool_nlp_background_how_do_i/,2025-12-09 10:47:47,2025-12-16 01:47:40

1pmzsvu,How much does impact in my current role affect my future?,QuestionBeautiful513,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR: I’ve been resting and vesting at work, and I’ve ducked impactful projects for 4yrs. Will that really affect me much in a job hunt (for junior to mid-level SWE roles in a new field), if I can get solid at coding/system design problems?I’m a mid-level SWE (4 YOE) at a popular company that was bought by a FAANG before I started. I don’t do much and have basically been coasting, doing just enough to meet expectations in perf reviews. This is in part due to a lack of opportunity to lead projects or do high-impact work (when it is available, it is usually given to seniors). But, being honest, I don’t seek those opportunities out either. In fact, I actively avoid them. I don’t really want to work here and got trapped by the golden handcuffs. So I’ve been saving most of my mental capacity for personal studying, as I dream to transition out of web dev to a different field (still early SWE). My New Year’s resolution is to get really good at coding/system design problems and start applying. But I’m worried because I don’t have much to speak to as far as impact/metrics from my current job.

1pk8n5r,deciding between interning at a big-tech company in SF vs a medium-scale startup in NYC next summer,urinehugetrouble,cscareerquestions,"Context:I'm entering my final year of undergrad, and going into my final internship next summer. Throughout university, I've always dreamt of working in NYC full-time, and I was hoping my final internship will lead to a FT RO there. And luckily, I was fortunate enough to get an offer from a mid-size startup (that I believe doesn't have much room for growth) in NYC. By surprise, I also got an offer to intern at a FAANG+ company I believe in, located in SF.Now, I'm really torn as to what to do moving forward.On one hand, I really resonate with the saying ""you're only in your 20s once."" I've always wanted to experience NYC in my 20s and now I have the opportunity to do so, albeit for a short period of time. People say that summers in NYC have a certain charm to them, and I definitely want to experience this first-hand. Since I'm bearish on the company's future, I would probably still have to recruit full-time for new grad even if I do get an RO, but at least the RO would be in a location I really cherish.On the other hand, the FAANG+ company definitely seems like the safer bet - I get more resume value, more long-term career growth, and their full-time TC is a little higher simply due to publicly traded stock. The people around me say it'll give me more leverage to recruit full-time in NYC, but full-time recruiting is definitely difficult, the market is not looking too hot, and NYC is a very competitive location to break into. I also do have Amazon on my resume, so I don't know if this is diminishing returns.Not really sure if I'm thinking straight. Am I sacrificing the potential of long-term growth for the short-term pleasure of living in the city I want? I'm a firm believer in ""the city shapes you,"" and I definitely think NYC lines much more closer with my beliefs in that sense than SF. However, this is an internship, and maybe choosing what's better for my career is more sensible.What are your thoughts? Any advice? Would appreciate any insight into this Some more context:When I received the offer for the FAANG+ company, I lightly requested to move it to Fall since they have Fall cohorts, but they declined (I also didn't have leverage so I did say I would be happy to work in the summer if it's not possible). However this was before the NYC offer came through. Now, I definitely have more leeway to give an ultimatum since I have another offer, but I'm not sure if potentially burning this bridge is worth the upside.",5,0.78,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pk8n5r/deciding_between_interning_at_a_bigtech_company/,2025-12-11 20:52:15,2025-12-16 01:47:40

1pih5zb,Took a 1-year work sabbatical and am about to begin applying after the new year. How can I demonstrate that I am still a competitive candidate?,crustymilk15,cscareerquestions,"**Context**I'm a US-based Product Designer with 5 years of experience (4 of which were in the Telehealth industry), with my last 3 years of employment leading multiple high-impact and well-documented projects. Between all the conversations around AI taking over roles, the government impacting the job market, frequent layoffs, and more—I was feeling burnt out. When the medium-sized company I worked for filed for bankruptcy, I used this as an opportunity to redeem my mental health. For the first 3 months I rested, and for the following 9 months I focused on art. I pursued any hobby I was interested in, joined clubs, and even felt my identity change. While I am proud of my decision, and I feel significantly better, I am now grappling with self-esteem issues when I consider my career journey ahead. Before this could snowball into an issue of its own, I immediately started going to therapy. **Preparation**During this year-long break, I worked daily on my portfolio—writing case studies, networking, staying connected with previous colleagues, and developing my site from scratch. I completed and launched my portfolio with 4 in-depth case studies full of metrics and impact. All of my colleagues who were laid off were re-hired, and have offered me referrals. My resume is up-to-date, and I've developed my portfolio in a way that I can easily release personalized variations for each company I apply for. So not only will my resume be catered to each job application, but so will my website. **Action**I applied to one job that I felt I was 100% qualified for, and also recieved a referral from a close colleague. I catered my resume and also my portfolio, but it was a bit rushed—I launched my portfolio that same week and had to fix a lot of errors. I am still proud that I've applied, but I didn't expect the application to go through given that it was my first application. Today I've been informed that the role has been filled. I haven't applied to any other jobs yet because of holiday planning, but intend to apply to 5 - 10 jobs per week (depending on available jobs) after the New Year. Now that I've finished my portfolio, I am starting work on two career-related side projects to demonstrate my skills further. My goal is to apply for remote full-time roles with a compensation range of $130k - $175k, prioritizing roles in the Telehealth industry. **Questions*** When asked about my career gap, what is the most elegant way I can talk about it?* Am I likely to face descrimination for my 1 year career gap? What can I do to navigate it?* How can I best get into contact with recruiters? Are they still open to communication through LinkedIn, or are they swamped with messages?* Does the job market feel better in FY2025 Q4 than it did in FY2024 or FY2023?* Is a 6-month timeline realistic for job hunting? * Are freelance and contract roles as competitive as full time? * What else can I do to be a more competitive design candidate?
