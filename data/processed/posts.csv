1p1y34k,Data engineers who are not building LLM to SQL. What cool projects are you actually working on?,PolicyDecent,dataengineering,"Scrolling through LinkedIn makes it look like every data engineer on earth is building an autonomous AI analyst, semantic layer magic, or some LLM to SQL thing that will “replace analytics”.But whenever I talk to real data engineers, most of the work still sounds like duct taping pipelines, fixing bad schemas, and begging product teams to stop shipping breaking changes on Fridays.So I am honestly curious. If you are *not* building LLM agents, what cool stuff are you actually working on these days?What is the most interesting thing on your plate right now?A weird ingestion challenge?Internal tools?Something that sped up your team?Some insane BigQuery or Snowflake optimization rabbit hole?I am not looking for PR answers.

1p10z2v,Apache Iceberg and Databricks Delta Lake - benchmarked,niga_chan,dataengineering,"For every other data engineer or someone in higher hierarchy down the road comes to a choiuce of Apache Iceberg or Databricks Delta Lake, so we went ahead and benchmarked both systems. Just sharing our experience here.TL;DR Both formats have their perks: Apache Iceberg offers an open, flexible architecture with surprisingly fast query performance in some cases, while Databricks Delta Lake provides a tightly managed, all-in-one experience where most of the operational overhead is handled for you.Setup & MethodologyWe used the TPC-H 1 TB dataset  which is a dataset of about 8.66 billion rows across 8 tables to compare the two stacks end-to-end: ingestion and analytics.For the Iceberg setup: We ingested data from PostgreSQL into Apache Iceberg tables on S3, orchestrated through OLake’s high-throughput CDC pipeline using AWS Glue as catalog and EMR Spark for query.. Ingestion used 32 parallel threads with chunked, resumable snapshots, ensuring high throughput. On the query side, we tuned Spark similarly to Databricks (raised shuffle partitions to 128 and disabled vectorised reads due to Arrow buffer issues).For the Databricks Delta Lake setup: Data was loaded via the JDBC connector from PostgreSQL into Delta tables in 200k-row batches. Databricks’ managed runtime automatically applied file compaction and optimized writes. Queries were run using the same 22 TPC-H analytics queries for a fair comparison.This setup made sure we were comparing both ingestion performance and analytical query performance under realistic, production-style workloads.What We Found* We used OLake to ingest to Iceberg and was about 2x faster - 12 hours vs 25.7 hours on Databricks thanks to parallel chunked ingestion.* Iceberg ran the full TPC-H suite 18% faster than Databricks.* Cost: Infra cost was 61% lower on Iceberg + OLake (around $21.95 vs $50.71 for the same run).here are the overall result and our ideology on this-Databricks still wins on ease-of-use: you just click and go. Cluster setup, Spark tuning, and governance are all handled automatically. That’s great for teams that want a managed ecosystem and don’t want to deal with infrastructure.But if your team is comfortable managing a Glue/AWS stack and handling a bit more complexity, Iceberg + OLake’s open architecture wins on pure numbers  faster at scale, lower cost, and full engine flexibility (Spark, Trino, Flink) without vendor lock-in.read our article to know more on our steps followed and the overall benchmarks and the numbers around it curious to know what you people think.

1p18o83,"Unpopular opinion: Most ""Data Governance Frameworks"" are just bureaucracy. Here is a model that might actually work (federated/active)",NeverheardofAkro,dataengineering,"Lately I’ve been deep diving into data governance because our ""wild west"" data stack is finally catching up with us. I’ve read a ton of dry whitepapers and vendor guides, and I wanted to share a summary of a framework that actually makes sense for modern engineering teams (vs. the old-school ""lock everything down"" approach).I’m curious if anyone here has successfully moved from a centralized model to a federated one?The Core Problem: Most frameworks treat governance as a ""police function."" They create bottlenecks. The modern approach (often called ""Active Governance"") tries to embed governance into the daily workflow rather than making it a separate compliance task.Here is the breakdown of the framework components that seem essential:1.) The Operating Model (The ""Who"") You basically have three choices. From what I’ve seen, #3 is the only one that scales:- Centralized: One team controls everything. (Bottleneck city).- Decentralized: Every domain does whatever they want. (Chaos).- Federated/Hybrid: A central team sets the ""Standards"" (security, quality metrics), but the individual Domain Teams (Marketing, Finance) own the data and the definitions.2.) The Pillars (The ""What"") If you are building this from scratch, you need to solve for these three:- Transparency: Can people actually find the data? (Catalogs, lineage).- Quality: Is the data trustworthy? (Automated testing, not just manual checks).- Security: Who has access? (RBAC, masking PII).3.) The ""Left-Shift"" Approach This was a key takeaway for me: Governance needs to move ""left."" Instead of fixing data quality in the dashboard (downstream), we need to catch it at the source (upstream).- Legacy way: Data Steward fixes a report manually.- Modern way: The producer is alerted to a schema change or quality drop before the pipeline runs.The Tooling Landscape I've been looking at tools that support this ""Federated"" style. Obviously, you have the big clouds (Purview, etc.), but for the ""active"" metadata part, where the catalog actually talks to your stack (Snowflake, dbt, Slack), tools like Atlan or Castor seem to be pushing this methodology the hardest.Question for the power users of this sub: For those of you who have ""solved"" governance, did you start with the tool or the policy first? And how do you get engineers to care about tagging assets without forcing them?Thanks!",56,0.82,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p18o83/unpopular_opinion_most_data_governance_frameworks/,2025-11-19 14:10:12,2025-11-25 01:42:04

1p2orxy,Is one big table (OBT) actually a data modeling methodology?,raginjason,dataengineering,"When it comes to reporting, I’m a fan of Kimball/star schema. I believe that the process of creating dimensions and facts actually reveals potential issues inside of your data. Discussing and ironing out grain and relationships between various tables helps with all of this. Often the initial assumptions don’t hold up and the modeling process helps flesh these edge cases out. It also gives you a vocabulary that you don’t have to invent inside your organization (dimension, fact, bridge, SCD, junk dimension, degenerate dimension, etc).I personally do not see OBT as much of a data model. It always seemed like “we contorted the data and mashed it together so that we got a huge table with the data we want” without too much rhyme or reason. I would add that an exception I have made is to join a star together and materialize that as OBT so that data science or analysts can hack on it in Excel, but this was done as a delivery mechanism not a modeling methodology. Honestly, OBT has always seemed pretty amateur to me. I’m interested if anyone has a different take on OBT. Is there anyone out there advocating for a structured and disciplined approach to creating datamarts with an OBT philosophy? Did I miss it and there actually is a Kimball-ish person for OBT that approaches it with rigor and professionalism?For some context, I recently modeled a datamart as a star schema and was asked by an incoming leader “why did you model it with star schema?”. To me, it was equivalent to asking “why did you use a database for the datamart?”. Honestly, for a datamart, I don’t think anything other than star schema makes much sense, so anything else was not really an option. I was so shocked at this question that I didn’t have a non-sarcastic answer so I tabled the question. Other options could be: keep it relational, Datavault, or OBT. None of these seem serious to me (ok datavault is a serious approach as I understand it, but such a niche methodology that I wouldn’t seriously entertain it). The person asking this question is younger and I expect he entered the data space post big data/spark, so likely an OBT fan.I’m interested in hearing from people who believe OBT is superior to star schema.

1p2auyi,Anyone else dealing with metadata scattered across multiple catalogs? How are you handling it?,Hefty-Citron2066,dataengineering,"hey folks, curious how others are tackling a problem my team keeps running into.**TL;DR:** We have data spread across Hive, Iceberg tables, Kafka topics, and some PostgreSQL databases. Managing metadata in 4+ different places is becoming a nightmare. Looking at catalog federation solutions and wanted to share what I found.## Our SetupWe're running a pretty typical modern stack but it's gotten messy over time:- Legacy Hive metastore (can't kill it yet, too much depends on it)- Iceberg tables in S3 for newer lakehouse stuff- Kafka with its own schema registry for streaming- A few PostgreSQL catalogs that different teams own- Mix of AWS and GCP (long story, acquisition stuff)The problem is our data engineers waste hours just figuring out where data lives, what the schema is, who owns it, etc. We've tried building internal tooling but it's a constant game of catch-up.## What I've Been Looking AtI spent the last month evaluating options. Here's what I found:### Option 1: Consolidate Everything into Unity CatalogWe're already using Databricks so this seemed obvious. The governance features are genuinely great. But:- It really wants you to move everything into the Databricks ecosystem- Our Kafka stuff doesn't integrate well- External catalog support feels bolted on- Teams with data in GCP pushed back hard on the vendor lock-in### Option 2: Try to Federate with Apache PolarisSnowflake's open source catalog looked promising. Good Iceberg support. But:- No real catalog federation (it's still one catalog, not a catalog of catalogs)- Doesn't handle non-tabular data (Kafka, message queues, etc.)- Still pretty new, limited community### Option 3: Build Something with Apache GravitinoThis one was new to me. It's an Apache project (just graduated to Top-Level Project in May) that does metadata federation. The concept is basically ""catalog of catalogs"" instead of trying to force everything into one system.What caught my attention:- Actually federates across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, JDBC sources without moving data- Handles both tabular and non-tabular data (they have this concept called ""filesets"")- Truly vendor-neutral (backed by Uber, Apple, Intel, Pinterest in the community)- We could query across our Hive metastore and Iceberg tables seamlessly- Has both REST APIs and Iceberg REST API supportThe catch:- You have to self-host (or use Datastrato's managed version)- Newer project so some features are still maturing- Less polished UI compared to commercial options- Community is smaller than Databricks ecosystem## Real Test I RanI set up a quick POC connecting our Hive metastore, one Iceberg catalog, and a test Kafka cluster. Within like 2 hours I had them all federated and could query across them. The metadata layer actually worked - we could see all our tables, topics, and schemas in one place.Then tried the same query that usually requires us to manually copy data between systems. With Gravitino's federation it just worked. Felt like magic tbh.## My TakeFor us, I think Gravitino makes sense because:- We genuinely can't consolidate everything (different teams, different clouds, regulations)- We need to support heterogeneous systems (not just tables)- We're comfortable with open source (we already run a lot of Apache stuff)- Avoiding vendor lock-in is a real priority after our last platform migration disasterBut if you're already 100% Databricks or you have simpler needs, Unity Catalog is probably the easier path.## Question for the GroupIs anyone else using catalog federation approaches? How are you handling metadata sprawl across different systems?Also curious if anyone has tried Gravitino in production. The project looks solid but would love to hear real-world experiences beyond my small POC.",30,0.92,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p2auyi/anyone_else_dealing_with_metadata_scattered/,2025-11-20 18:29:42,2025-11-25 01:42:04

It is very hard to map BigQuery Slots to Snowflake Warehouses effectively.Usability: The BigQuery Web UI feels much more rudimentary compared to Snowsight.Has anyone here been in the same situation?

After a few years of iterations, I have pretty solid tech stack that's fully open-source, easy for students to setup, and mimics what you will do on the job.Dev Environment:- Docker Compose - Containers and configs- VSCode Dev Containers - IDE in container- GitHub CodeSpaces - Browser cloud computeDatabases:- Postgres - Transactional Database- Minio - Data Lake- DuckDB - Analytical DatabaseIngestion + Orchestration + Logs:- Python Scripts - Simplicity over a tool- Data Build Tool - SQL queries on DuckDB- Alembic - Python-based database migrations- Psycopg - Interact with postgres via PythonCI/CD:- GitHub Actions - Simple for students Data:- Data[.]gov - Public real-world datasetsCoding Surface:- Jupyter Notebooks - Quick and iterative- VS Code - Update and implement scriptsThis setup is extremely powerful as you have a full data platform that sets up in minutes, it's filled with real-world data, you can query it right away, and you can see the logs. Plus, since we are using GitHub codespaces, it's essentially free to run in the browser with just a couple clicks! If you don't want to use GitHub Codespces, you can run this locally via Docker Desktop.Bonus for loacal: Since Cursor is based on VSCode, you can use the dev containers in there and then have AI help explain code or concepts (also super helpful for learning).One thing I do want to highlight is that since this is meant for students and not production, security and user management controls are very lax (e.g. ""password"" for passwords db configs). I'm optimizing on student learning experience there, but it's probably a great starting point to learn how to implement those controls.Anything you would add?

1p4yogz,Data Engineering in Rust with Minarrow,peterxsyd,dataengineering,"Hi all,I'd like to share an update on the [Minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow) project - a from-scratch implementation of the *Apache Arrow* memory format in Rust.**What is Minarrow?***Minarrow* focuses on being a fully-fledged and fast alternative to *Apache Arrow* with strong user ergonomics. This helps with cases where you:* are data engineering in Rust within a highly connected, low latency ecosystem *(e.g., websocket feeds, Tokio etc.)*,* need typed arrays that remain Python/analytics ecosystem compatible* are working with real-time data use cases, and need minimal overhead Tabular data structures* are compiling lots, want < 2 second build times and basically value a solid data programming experience in Rust. Therefore, it is a great fit when you are DIY bare bones data engineering, and less so if you are relying on pre-existing tools *(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake).* For example, if you are data streaming in a more low-level manner.**Data Engineering examples:*** Stream data live off a Websocket and save it into ""**.arrow""** or ""**.parquet**"" files.* Capture data in Minarrow, flip to Polars on the fly and calculate metrics in real-time, then push them in chunks to a Datastore as a live persistent service* Run parallelised statistical calculations on 1 billion rows without much compile-time overhead so Rust becomes workable**You also get:*** Strong IDE typing (in Rust)* One hit *\`.to\_arrow()*\` and \`.*to\_polars()*\` in Rust* Enums instead of dynamic dispatch *(a Rust flavour that's used in the official Arrow Rust crates)** extensive SIMD-accelerated kernel functions available, including 60+ univariate distributions via the partner \`SIMD-Kernels\` crate (*fully reconciled to Scipy*). So, for many common cases you can stay in Rust for high performance compute.Essentially addressing a few areas that the main Arrow RS implementation makes different trade-offs. **Are you interested?**For those who work in high performance data and software engineering and value this type of work, please feel free to ask any questions, even if you predominantly work in Python or another language*.* As, Arrow is one of those frameworks that backs a lot of that ecosystem but is not always well understood, due its back-end nature.I'm also happy to explain how you can move data across language boundaries *(e.g., Python Rust)* using the Arrow format, or other tricks like this.Hope you found this interesting.Cheers,Pete",8,0.79,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p4yogz/data_engineering_in_rust_with_minarrow/,2025-11-23 21:34:54,2025-11-25 01:42:04

Below is the post that express my confusion and I need guidance to grow further. I started my career in Jan 2021, now almost have 5 years of experience in Data Engineering.This is my 3rd firm I am currently working with which I joined around April this year at 28+ LPA fixed pay scale. Skills: Snowflake (DW and Intelligence) , DBT, SQL, python, ADF, Synapse, Python, Azure Functions, ETL/ELTI stayed in first firm for almost 1.5 yrs, in second for 2 yrs 10 months. And now with current firm for 7 months. My real learning happened while being in the second firm , up-skill on a lot of things, dealt with clients and what not, basically was in a consulting role. With the current switch, it’s a big MnC in healthcare with better employee policies than the previous firms I had worked with. The problem here is the type of work I am doing is of no use, not even upto the level of the previous employer. Just writing SQL transformations on DBT as ELT is already dealt by FiveTran, low code - no code tool. This is making my learning curve go down and I am really worried about my career as we see AI being involved in every domain and a downward learning curve at this moment in time is not acceptable for me. Even I do learn a few more tools say Databricks, pretty similar to synapse , implementations come up as a problem.

After many iterations, this exploration eventually matured into what I now call Internet Object (IO).Key characteristics that came out of the design process:* schema-first by design (data and metadata clearly separated)* row-like nested structures (reduce repeated keys and structural noise)* predictable layout that is easier to stream or parse incrementally* richer type system for better validation and downstream consumption* human-readable but still structured enough for automation* about 40-50 percent fewer tokens than the equivalent JSON* compatible with JSON concepts, so developers are not learning from scratchThe article below is the first part of a multi-part series.

You mostly care about throughput and cost. We kept seeing GPUs sit idle even with plenty of work queued.**Two big bottlenecks we found**1. **Uneven sequence lengths** made GPUs wait for the longest prompt.2. **Repeated prefixes** (boilerplate, instructions) forced us to recompute the same first tokens for huge portions of the dataset.**What we built**We combined:* **Continuous/streaming batching** (keep GPUs full instead of using fixed batches)* **Prefix-aware grouping and routing** (send prompts with similar prefixes to the same worker so they hit the same cache)We call the combination **dynamic prefix bucketing**.**Results**On a 128-GPU L4 cluster running Qwen3-8B, we saw roughly:* **≈50% faster throughput*** **Much higher prefix-cache hit rates (about 54%)*** Good scaling until model-load overhead became the bottleneckhttps://preview.redd.it/nw7knwg6lh2g1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=76257441bb38b0c7eaf4cbce12e9c5c769d75015https://preview.redd.it/5sr9ovg6lh2g1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=689c014bdd9abebb6b7cf7ccda7cb22c849afde4**Why I’m sharing**Batch inference is becoming more common for data processing, enrichment, and ETL pipelines.

It covers topics like data quality, access, governance, Excel dependency, silos, reporting speed, etc.I’m planning to create an English version later, but at this stage I’m mainly trying to get early feedback before investing more time.This is **not** a sales tool at this stage. I’m genuinely trying to validate whether this solves real pain points.Edit: Forgot the link: [https://oliver-nfnfg7u6.scoreapp.com](https://oliver-nfnfg7u6.scoreapp.com)",2,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p1krpc/looking_for_honest_feedback_on_a_free_data/,2025-11-19 21:40:46,2025-11-25 01:42:04

The second part was a technical screening with two backend developers. They showed various technical terms on the screen, one by one, and asked me to explain them: things like API, REST, microservices, encoding vs. encryption vs. hashing, some CLI commands, DOM, XML/JSON/YAML, and so on.The thing is, I’ve been working with these concepts for over three years. I use them regularly, and I understand them in practice. But I really struggled to \*explain\* them clearly. I couldn’t put into words what I actually know how to do. It made me feel like I completely bombed what should have been simple questions.Since I’m self-taught, I’m wondering if this is just a gap in the theoretical knowledge you’d typically pick up in school.

On top of that, being new means I don't have the experience to be able to accurately tell whether something is hard or easy, which made things even more obviously dumb.And NOW I finally realize that, all I had to do was first cover the base case scenarios (like learning how to build a basic page that navigates around other pages) and then come up with something that I want to build, and start stumbling around 99% of the time trying to figure out how to build it. Obviously that would mean spending more time googling, reading articles, stackoverflow etc. than actually writing code. Duh! It's the first time I do most of the things required.So you think at this point ""okay bro, now you know how people learn by building projects and connecting the dots to make functional software, congrats"".

1p04oy2,Can AI reliably solve captchas now?,Turbopasta,learnprogramming,"I have an idea for a project I want to program, but before I get started I need to know how effective modern captchas are at actually at detecting and stopping bots. If bots can easily pass as humans through all detection methods then my project is a non-starter. I know bots can do things like, be given spending money and then find a person to solve the captcha for them, but I'm just looking at what bots can do by themselves without any outside help.I'm finding some results through research, but none of it is what I would consider conclusive or scientific. Mostly I'm just finding people maybe making up stories, sharing anecdotes, that kinda thing. I'm not seeing a lot of demonstrations of bots beating captchas but then again if they were doing this I doubt I would see somebody uploading themselves doing it on youtube.I have some vague knowledge of how captchas work, and that a big part of why they work at all is because, at least in Google's case, they read a bunch of metadata such as speed, how you move your mouse, etc. But I'm very lacking in specifics and I'm open to learn more about them.From some demonstrations I've seen, it looks like if you show a captcha image test to an AI, it will correctly find the squares with the specific object. But then if the AI or an automated program tried to input those results, it would fail due to not passing the metadata stuff? Is that a correct assumption or can AI bypass these checks now? Wouldn't it be pretty trivial to beat this by just making a robot physically tap a phone screen?I'm not asking if captchas are 100% effective, because I know that's not possible. But even if they're 90% effective, for my purposes that would be good enough. Besides that I'm also open to implementing more ways to verify if someone is a bot, but I'm looking for methods that are quick and practical like how captchas are. Maybe making the user solve multiple captchas instead of just one?",8,0.73,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p04oy2/can_ai_reliably_solve_captchas_now/,2025-11-18 06:25:44,2025-11-25 01:42:05

It was a Full Stack project:.Net C# BackendREACT frontendMVP Design PatternSQL Server ExpressORM (Microsoft Entity Framework Library) for interacting with the databaseThis burnt me out. Due to also working at a company that did not believe in work-life balance, I ended up rushing this project and the dissertation. Granted although not every feature was working perfectly, it did work. And yeah... I passed the module (and burnt out after a final month of finishing work at 5pm and coding or writing dissertation till 2am every day).Initially my tutor was very against me using this technology stack. As none of it was covered by the Open University. As well as pulling this off I was teaching myself C# from scratch, REACT from scratch and ORM from scratch (I shamefully admit, I had to ask chatGPT a few questions regarding that).Anyway, fast forward a year or so, and I am finally building a portfolio, as being in a more inf orientated job really does not suit me.So this week I started learning Flask. I actually have tried the very tutorials I have now completed previously and to be honest it confused the hell out of me. However... after my ordeal with C# and .Net, damn this just seems easy and straight forward. I would even say I am enjoying it.Anyway this weekend, I will be refactoring my Tic Tac Toe project to Flask and touching up the Vanilla HTML/CSS frontend I have already made (albeit zero functionality). And yeah.... I am going to need to start taking GitHub more seriously (ie a Readme file).I know this adds no value to any thing and is not even a question.

I know python and java in terms of syntax, I know all the structures like loops and stuff, but I haven't coded any projects before.

Nothing related to bypassing anything; I just want a clean and reliable pipeline.The options I'm evaluating are: building a pipeline around the .json endpoints with strict rate limiting and retry logic, using something like Apify to handle scheduling and backoff, or creating a hybrid setup that treats external data sources as unreliable and focuses on resilient architecture, caching, and backpressure.From an engineering point of view, which approach tends to produce the most maintainable and fault-tolerant system for long-term public-data collection?I’m not trying to gather private info or circumvent restrictions.

Bit 2 of pixel 0 is in the 2nd word's most significant bit and so on. Pixel 1 is the OR of all the 2nd most significant bits of the 4 word set, kapish? The next 16 bits across are held in the next 4 word set in ram.Why didn't they simply place adjacent nibbles in memory to represent the pixel's palette index? Perhaps the decision was based on how the hardware draws the additional resolution modes where the number of words for the 4 color medium resolution mode is reduced to 2 and the highest resolution, monochrome is just one word. Interesting, they might have been able to support an 8 bit palette color index with 8 words allowing for a blocky 256 colors @ 160 x 100 resolution. So anyway I was happily coding along doing BSET.W D5,(A0)+ to set a specific bit in word 0 thinking I could automatically work word 1 next then move on to word 2 and so on and was puzzled when the compiler said, no my friend, that is not allowed!What? What's not allowed? I pulled up the BSET specs and sure enough, BSET only supports an opcode extension of byte or long. Drat! So now I have to do an ADDQ #2,A0 after each word manipulation.I'm still in awe of the 68000 instruction set though, what a thing of beauty....

1p3lq4x,"1.5 years unemployed, 1.5 years of (professional) experience. I finally got a great job offer. It doesn't feel real. Wanted to share some good news, my story, and what helped",Effective_Clue_1099,cscareerquestions,"Background: Mid 2022 bootcamp grad. Got a job as a mostly frontend developer for 65k. Was there for \~1.5 years, after our big project, they laid off about 1/4 of the company.Just had an 8 round interview process, I thought there wasn't a chance. Got the call, they said it was an easy decision for them and I signed the offer for 115k today. I'm over the moon.So what worked / didn't workApplying:Had 3 referrals, none turned into interviews. I think the value of referrals have gone down dramatically in the last couple of years and that a lot of companies stopped giving referral bonusesI didn't get a single entry / jr level interview. I think the no cs degree hurt for those roles, so many say 1-2 YoE so I thought I was a shoo-in, nahMy success rate fell sharply after 6 months unemployment. Success rate improved dramatically (only for mobile positions) after publishing a personal project (this was about a year into unemployment, I had a single interview in months 6-12 and it didn't go past hiring manager)No interviews from linkedIn job apps, despite targeting same day postingsgot 2 interviews from hiringcafe and an ai auto fill extension (simplify)I went in-person and dropped off a resume to two local companies that I saw had openings. One gave me an interview (50% success rate, you were right Grandpa)The mobile position I got, came from linkedIn. I stumbled across the tech lead of a local company posting about the opening, there was no linkedIn job posting. I messaged him about my app and he said he tried it out, liked it and wanted to interview me.I think the other 2 or 3 came from hackernews, again, where I was talking directly to somebody technical about my app.I tried linkedin premium and messaged a ton of hiring managers / recruiters, nothing came from thoseI had 6 or 7 interviews in the last year and a half, all above my last role. Was definitely unprepared for the first few, feel I went from jr. to mid level while unemployed.But yeah, highest success rate was finding local companies and contacting somebody who was technical (and part of the hiring process) about what I was working on Technical Interviews: I was grinding leetcode for a bit but found it not to be worth while (past getting comfortable with mapping and array, obj, string manipulation). I did have some coding challenges but they weren't leetcode mediums or hards, either can you fetch data, format / display / style it or a leetcode easy to see if you can code (though I didn't interview at major companies). I did have two system designs interviews earlier on that I wasn't prepared for. And one later on that I knew was coming and spent a week cramming for. Did really well in that and moved to final round but didn't get job. My recent interview didn't have a strictly system design round but a lot of topics I had studied did come up in conversation and I'm glad I was able to talk on themAnother thing that was a huge help was I was MUCH less stressed about the recent interview. I thought I wasn't going to get it, was working as a bartender so had money coming in, might as well see where it goes and try to learn something. Most of the interviews I had when I was deep into unemployment, I would get 2-4 hours of sleep the night before because I was so stressed. Somehow, the night before this company's technical, I had planned on doing leetcode all night but I was strangely tired, thought I wasn't going to get the job anyways and didn't want to waste my night off doing coding problems. I ended up conking out hard way earlier than I typically go to bed and had the best nights rest I've had in two years. I truly don't know how it aligned that way but being well rested was way more valuable than a couple more leetcode problemsBehavioral interviews:The 3 companies I interviewed with - post releasing my app - were much more interested in my app than my previous role. They were all for mobile positions.I also started keeping an interview prep journal that had 6 star stories (and what questions they could be used in) as well as all other questions I've been asked in interviews (and had a separate tab for system design notes)I would often get a ""how's your week going"" question at the start of interviews. Early into unemployment, I thought, 'I don't want to waste their time', and just say something like, 'It's been a good week, have been looking forward to this interview.' and let them jump into it from there. After it happened a few times I realize they want to see if they can have an actual, casual conversation with you. So in these last few interviews, I always made a point to spend literally a minute, 2 max, chatting. Just something like an event that weekend I was excited for. The recent interview the guy had mentioned having a kid, the next interview I asked what his kid was dressing as for HalloweenThe other thing that was a big help was the CEO really liked me. I really didn't understand the company's industry, so I spent a couple of hours with ai learning about it, making sure I knew some basic terminology, read articles about the company, and had actual, non fluff questions, about the company and the industry for the CEO. In the middle he mentioned being surprised by the questions65k -> \~27/hour -> 115k Again, absolutely over the moon. Very excited, will be working hard to make sure I continue to grow and never go through such a grueling unemployment periodTl;dr Try talking to technical people directly. Look local. Have some system design knowledge. Build something with users. Be well rested and sociable. Be able to talk about the company, past being a developer.

Look for quota, OTE, or commission structures - that’s sales, not engineering. Check if the role reports to Sales/GTM instead of Engineering.

Depending on how well we do my TC is anywhere from 200k - 240k. I live in a MCOL city.The company I work for is great in terms of work life balance, it is 5 days in the office with on call rotation, but we do have 6 weeks PTO and another 1 week of sick days. We also surprisingly don’t do layoffs, we’ve never had layoffs even when oil hit negative during covid.I currently have 4 years of experience in software and before that I was an electrical engineer with 4 years of experience.

I’m working my way up in the company pretty quick and I have a good relationship with my manager. I believe within 3 years I’ll be at a manger role with my TC somewhere around $350k.In terms of the work I do, it’s a variety of backend work from API development, to ETL’s, managing database schemas/SP’s, and working with real time data. The tech stack on the backend is mostly Python with a little bit of .NET, I’ll be dabbling in GO soon as well for our realtime data calculations from RMQ.

1p3o2eo,I may have just ruined a perfect job. What do I do now?,chunkylubber54,cscareerquestions,"I felt like I had a good thing going for me. I'm making 200k, I have health insurance, my boss is nice, and yet still I may have just completely fucked it up.Basically, here's the situation: I'm on a small team with just me and my boss. We use an in-house office software with a built-in chat and email, but 99% of the time we just use the chat or talk face-to-face.However, the office software sucks. If you don't use it for an hour, it disconnects without any notification. While you're disconnected, chat messages get sent to email, and don't display in chat when you log back on. The home page displays new email notifications, but only some of them, not all of them. I thought it only filtered automated messages, but I was VERY wrong.This week my boss was on a business trip. He was still working in my timezone though so we could talk. I was waiting for some details in the chat, but either I was logged off or he just emailed it directly. Either way, no notification.The day after he sent it, I had a day off I scheduled in advance. While I was out, he forgot I had off and sent me an email. Same thing, no notification.Two days later, I got a message from him. While he'd remembered I had a day off, he was still extremely pissed that I hadn't seen his emails. He said it was the bare minimum act of communicationAdmittedly, it feels like he'd be right at most other companies, but we'd always used other means of communication. Before he left, he even gave me his phone number saying it's how I should contact him if he wasn't online to recieve chat messages, completely overlooking the email.Regardless, my contract is supposed to be renewed soon, and now I'm worried it won't be.

1p2emra,"3 YOE, 2 offers in 3 months",BurritoWithFries,cscareerquestions,"Just in case this would be useful to anyone as a datapoint...**About me:**- US Citizen- Graduated in 2022 from an average state school you may or may not have heard of - 3 YOE at the time of job hunting, all at one SaaS company in SF (+ 2 internships) - Full time experience was all backend development, and I did lead a larger project at my last company so I used that as a talking point in interviews - Located in San Francisco, looked to the entire Bay Area for my search. Wasn't open to relocation outside the Bay but that didn't seem to matter thanks to the AI boom... **Gearing up:**Total time from interview prep to first offer: 3 months (beginning of May 2025 to end of July 2025)Resources used: Paid for neetcode and the design gurus grokking system design course, and studied them meticulously. Already had LC premium and used that for specific companies. Didn't really do mock interviews because I was an interviewer myself at my last company and already had a ton of practice being on the other side of the table. **Applications & Interviews:**NOTE: All numbers are approximate and may be off by 5 or less, especially for interview counts. I didn't meticulously track everything. Number of applications: ~250 sent by me. However, I also got reached out to a lot and pretty much all of my interviews came from recruiters coming to me first, so I can't create a reliable Sankey diagram! I only used 2 referrals from my network and got ghosted by those companies anyway. Mostly targeted full stack roles at mid-late stage startups (Series C+), with the occasional big tech interview if they reached out to me first. Had 35 recruiter screens -> 32 first round interviews -> 14 second round+ interviews. Many of the first rounds were during my first few weeks studying, I used them to get my feet wet and didn't stress too hard over rejections. 14 second+ turned into 2 offers, 5 rejections, and I canceled 5 final rounds & 2 first rounds myself after signing. I had ~100 individual interview blocks total, according to my calendar. (not 100 companies, 100 interviews). **The offer I took:**- Series D unicorn healthcare startup, fully remote in SF Bay Area (with the option to go into the office whenever I want, or not.) Big upgrade over my previous hybrid job!! - Mid level / level below senior - $195,000 base salary ($20k raise over previous job), and some ISOs that I don't consider real money. - Full pivot into full stack from my previous 100% backend role(The other offer was $200,000, upleveled from junior to midlevel and hybrid in SF, but it was SaaS and I was tired of SaaS, plus they told me some stuff about the future direction of the company that I didn't quite like.)**Insights & Tips**1. I got asked a lot less Leetcode and a lot more ""practical"" coding, like writing API endpoints, parsing JSONs, and even writing basic websites from end to end.2. Around 3-4 interviewers encouraged AI use during the coding interviews. 3. LinkedIn pushes recently updated profiles to the top of recruiter searches, so every Sunday I would log in and make some minor change to my profile like adding a period, changing a word, etc. Then I would wake up on Monday with a full inbox. 4. I went back and replied to all the recruiters and startup founders that had emailed me in the past 6 months. Some were still hiring, others weren't. One very kind startup CEO still chatted with me for 30 minutes and offered to pass my resume on to his founder friends, nothing came of it but he gave me good advice anyway. 5. I interviewed on top of my day job by doing interviews 8-10 am, working 10-5, and then interviewing again 5-6. I didn't take a single ""sick day"" which I'm super proud of lol. Companies with an East coast presence were open to interviewing me as early as 7 am.6. As for how I pivoted to full stack with little to no frontend experience, YOLO I guess? The project I led had a small amount of frontend, and when I had fullstack interviews I did React crash courses and followed along. I got to the point where I knew what to look up for frontend, because most interviewers let you Google stuff on the spot if you look like you know what you're talking about, and just need to double check something etc.",158,0.89,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p2emra/3_yoe_2_offers_in_3_months/,2025-11-20 20:48:04,2025-11-25 01:42:06

1p00x6d,My job is killing my motivation to work.,Ok-Cartographer-5544,cscareerquestions,"I work at a big tech company. I make good money. My hours are reasonable. But my work's expectations, feedback, and the nature of the work are crushing my motivation to do anything but the bare minimum.Why? I can put a ton of effort into troubleshooting some failure and fix it, just to get grilled in a meeting on the one little detail that I missed. I can work hard on a project just to get asked by my manager why it isn't done yet.Speaking of my manager, he is an anxious basket case who will randomly walk up during the day and ask me to drop everything that I'm doing to work on something ""urgent"". After finishing the ""urgent"" task, he'll ask me about the work that got postponed and why it's behind schedule. To make it even worse, he'll do it in the most condescending way, asking if I ""need help"", or trying to reassign my work to others. No, I don't need help. I need you to leave me alone so that I can do my work that I was already planning to do.As for the work itself? Very rarely do I get to build or design something interesting. The majority of the time, I'm digging through the shitheap trying to figure out what this service with 20k lines of code and no comments does. Or reading through internal documents that were written by someone with a 3rd grade vocabulary and not updated for the past decade.Very rarely do I heard any kind of positive feedback. Most often it is criticism. You could've done this faster. If I do it faster, it could've been cleaner. This despite the fact that our codebase is filled with garbage code that I had to dig through to get what we have today.I also don't really feel like I'm learning valuable skills. I spend maybe 15% of my time *actually writing code.* The rest of my time is spent digging throug garbage trying to figure out why nothing works.I don't know how to end this post, so here's a link to an article about bananas.

I currently have \~4 YOE and am a US citizen (I know this helps when evaluating risk)1. **Work** \- Both companies have what I think are interesting work. I put embedded-specific details here for those are interested, but they both feel equally cool - [Embedded Software vs Board Support Package : r/embedded](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1p44co2/embedded_software_vs_board_support_package/). Meta would be more high-level / specific product work while Qualcomm is a more general role where the work will touch many of their products across their portfolio. This makes me wonder if working on a niche application like AR glasses would be better/worse for long-term career development2. **Location** \- Meta would have to be in Sunnyvale while Qualcomm is in San Diego. I currently live in SoCal so I would have a preference to stay here, but I can't deny that there seem to be more opportunities in NorCal. Nonetheless taking Meta would require moving / establishing things in a new location3. **Culture** \- I've been hearing bad things about Meta / Reality Labs, but I'm not sure how true they are since I've been relying on anecdotes from Blind (which is admittedly a negative community). I'm sure Qualcomm has its own pitfalls (e.g. offshoring), but I haven't heard of anything to the severity of Meta's current reputation with stacked ranking and PIPs4. **Compensation** \- Both roles are pretty accurate to their grades on levels.fyi. Qualcomm would be a senior engineer role in San Diego while Meta would be E4 role in SunnyvaleAny advice would be appreciated. I know having the brand name of Meta on a resume does wonders for a career, but I want to make sure I have as complete of a picture as I can.Edit: since there was some interest in the comments:* Meta (Sunnyvale) - 193k + 100k RSU/year + 35k sign on* Qualcomm (San Diego) - 147k + 43k RSU/year + 35k sign on",52,0.84,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p44v6y/embedded_software_qualcomm_vs_meta/,2025-11-22 21:33:43,2025-11-25 01:42:06

Compensation is solid and the work is technically interesting. The flip side is the usual big-tech stress: reorganizations, shifting priorities, constant pace, and the general feeling of volatility.I’m considering an offer for a “Principal”-level role in local government IT. The job is stable, unionized, slower paced, and has a predictable schedule. The work looks more enterprise/ERP-focused and nowhere near as chaotic as big tech.My concerns are:Whether I’m actually ready for a Principal role: I’ve operated at a mid-to-senior IC level, but I haven’t formally held a Principal title before. I’m worried about stepping into Principal-level expectations in a new domain and whether I’ll be able to perform at the level the role requires.Getting pigeonholed: Government IT tends to have slower-moving tech and more specialized enterprise systems. I’m concerned that if I spend years there, my skills might narrow and limit future private-sector options.Long-term compensation ceiling: Government positions have fixed salary steps and a hard cap. Once you hit the top step, raises are basically cost-of-living adjustments. In private tech, there’s still room for higher comp and growth.I’m trying to balance a more stable and predictable lifestyle with the risks of taking on a bigger role, potentially narrowing my skillset, and reducing long-term earning potential.If anyone has moved between private tech and government IT, especially mid-career or at a senior level, I’d really appreciate hearing how it affected your career, confidence, and quality of life.",48,0.94,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p5qjnt/midcareer_fork_stay_in_big_tech_or_move_to_local/,2025-11-24 19:27:38,2025-11-25 01:42:06

1p3o0dc,"When is it worth leaving a super comfortable and ""easy"" 4-day WFH job?",NigoDuppy,cscareerquestions,"So I’m trying to figure out when a salary increase actually justifies giving up a very comfortable setup. I officially have a 5-day/week job, but because my manager and I work remotely and are in different countries with different weekends, I’ve effectively been working 4 days a week for the last 1.5 years with a 3-day weekend. The work is simple, mostly Power BI dashboards and Power Automate flows for upper management, with nothing deeply technical or challenging. The problem is that the job is *too* comfortable. I’m not learning much, and I worry that future cost-cutting (I work in corporate) or AI could replace me since the work is so basic.Because I essentially work 4 days (32 hrs/week), my hourly rate is higher than it would be in a typical 5-day (40 hrs/week) job. For example, if I took a job with a 50% salary increase for a 5-day schedule, it would end up being only about a 20% increase in hourly pay after adjusting for the extra day and hours I would work. So I’m stuck asking myself if a 20–25% hourly increase really worth giving up a 4-day WFH lifestyle?I’m a CS graduate, but I ended up in this role because the job posting was labeled as Software Engineer. It turns out the only real engineering work was rewriting a legacy system using the Power Platform. After that, it turned into pure dashboards and Power Automate flows on the business side because my manager believed upper management liked fancy, colorful reports that were tangible and made their lives easier.Before this job, I was studying AWS, Terraform Linux, and getting into Kubernetes, but I haven’t touched any of that in a year, and I feel like I’m falling behind. If I stay in comfort, I risk stagnating, but at the same time I don’t really know where I can go from here, or what percentage increase in salary or hourly rate is worth leaving this job. Also, my company is a large corporate, and one of my goals is to work abroad. I checked their internal positions offering relocation, and almost all of them are either pure engineering or management roles. I don’t think it’s realistic for me to apply to any of these in my current position unless I sharpen my engineering skills, as management is still a pipe dream given that I’m still junior with only about 2 years of total experience.So essentially my questions boil down to:1. What kind of pay increase would make you give up a 4-day WFH job? Is 20% hourly increase enough? That’s already roughly a 50% increase in total salary.2. Should I pivot to a technical path like cloud infra/DevOps, which I plan to study over the next 6 months, or is there a well-paid path using my current skills? Would transitioning to data engineering instead be a better?

Management has signaled these will not be the last, and there will be more next year after a 'discovery' phase where they figure out what can be integrated into the parent company's existing software and what cant. Sometime after that (undisclosed time), there will be an RTO to a different city (I am currently WFH). We are currently mostly working on documentation + support work instead of new features. This has resulted in me going on a job hunt.I have three options:Offer 1: 165k base salary, 15 days of PTO (WFH). Working on a recently started project modernizing a legacy system (like, lots of logic in stored procedures style legacy) to python / AWS, immediate team and manager seem really nice. \~20 engineers total in the tech department.Offer 1 Cons: Company has been owned by private equity for the past 7 years, has 2.7 stars on Glassdoor, mentioning lack of raises, leadership shifting priorities, and layoffs / reorgs, position was a backfill.Offer 2: 145k base salary, 30k equity in company, unlimited PTO (Mostly WFH, in office \~2 times per month). Management seems fun (like, trips to Cancun type stuff), really interesting and exciting IoT style work with golang. Company was a Series A startup a few years ago, but is rapidly growing now with lots of customers and doesn't need funding anymore.Offer 2 Cons: It would just be me and 1 other engineer who is on a contract (my position would be full time) and may or may not convert to full time. The tech side of the company just started and is still a very 'early startup' environment, so I would have to juggle Project Manager + Software Engineer responsibilities. Could be fun, could also be super stressful, especially if the other engineer who seems like would be 'firewall' for the rest of the business leaves after his contract was up.Option 3. Take neither offer and stay at my current company and keep looking and hope i dont get laid off before i find something better. I have been getting a consistent amount of interviews each month.

Basically from the get-go she decided she didn't like me. About 2 weeks into her tenure a change I launched had to be rolled back and from that moment on she's decided I was no good. She was on PTO and then out of town for over a month and basically had no 1-1s with me or most of the team during that period and didn't show up to meetings, but then threatened to hit me with a Below Meets rating for very unclear reasons. I worked my butt off to try to reverse this and just get a Meets, but even since then it's been confusing and nightmarish. Every 1-1 with her has been filled with ""feedback"" and it's gotten to the point where now I'm getting anxiety attacks just at the thought of meeting with her. She never asks me what I'm doing or how I am, just launches straight into feedback on how what I'm doing is wrong or how I'm messing up. It's never technical feedback of course, it's always vague, behavioral feedback. The thing is, I'm a pretty engaged member of the team, I speak out quite a bit and I'm opinionated and try to be helpful, but I can never be clear what she actually wants. The kicker is her feedback is contradictory - a few months ago it was ""be on slack more"" and then recently it was ""you're on slack too much"". Things like that. One time she finally asked me what I was doing. Her feedback was that she had no idea and that I should be better about surfacing my updates - put the updates in JIRA, write them in the standup updates, surface them in our weekly meeting, as that's what she looks at. I then shared my screen and then showed her: I had put my updates in my JIRA tickets for the week, I had written full and clear standup updates, and I had shared my latest project in our weekly meeting when she was out. She then goes ""Oh okay thanks"". She rules on infighting and fear - asking people for feedback on each other, always making it feel like she's trying to build cases against people, etc. I know I could be biased so I thought it was just me. However, a few months into this, I talked with other people on my team and learned she was the EXACT same way with them, albeit arguably a bit harsher with me. I then heard stories about how her last team at the company entirely disbanded cause of her and that she had gone through the same thing of threatening to downrate someone immediately after becoming their manager with another girl. The final straw came recently when the most senior guy on my team recently got fired by her. I was working very closely with him - he was well-respected, been at the company for over 10 years, etc. But after he got fired I found out from him that what he went through was the same as me but worse - she gave him a below meets after 1 meeting with her, kept giving him constant, nitpicky, negative feedback for months with no clear expectations or guidance to improve, and then had HR show up to a meeting with him and threatened PIP or quit. I could give more specific examples but you get the picture. I guess first of all I just wanted to vent. Second, I wanted to know - is there any chance this could still just be me exaggerating this in my head, or is this on her at this point? Like, I'm not slacking at work, I produce work constantly, I even worked until 10pm last Friday night just out of fear. Is this normal? What is one supposed to do in this case? Is this just the state of the industry right now? Ultimately I've decided to try to look internally for new roles and also start interviewing externally, but I know that's going to take several months and I'm really stressed at the thought of having to deal with this and study for and do interviews. Like, just the thought of having to interact with her alone gives me stress and anxiety (I've never felt like this at a job before) and I don't know how to make it through. On top of that, I have kind of a side hustle I wanna dive into, it doesn't make much money right now but I haven't been able to give it my all the last few months cause of this situation, and I'm wondering if I should just go into that now or put that more on hold while I look for a new job.

1p5ajn9,CS bachelor vs. CS Masters without CS bachelors,ButtercreamVanilla,cscareerquestions,"I'm Canadian. I have a BSc in Psychology. This is my first time posting in a CS subreddit so please let me know if this is not the right place for this question.I've been thinking of switching into CS and finally decided to apply to schools with lots of Co-op opportunities. So far I've applied to bachelor's in UToronto (waiting), Waterloo (i may not meet eligibility requirements as a graduate), UBC (waiting; 20-month 2nd degree program) and UOttawa (got in). I prefer getting another bachelors since the schools I've picked comes with a good (rigorous) curriculum and a very good selection of co-op options as well as decent hiring rates post-studies. I want a strong, guided foundation even though I've done a little bit of everything by myself out of curiosity and interest (C++ in university courses, Python in high school, JS, html, CSS, AI/ML, Data Science). However my parents think it would be better to get a CS masters directly instead of ""wasting time"" doing another bachelors. The problem is well-reputed schools in Canada don't seem to offer masters without cs or related undergrad. The schools that do offer this option seems pointless to me because the market is already saturated and I feel like I would just be doing it for the sake of having just any CS related education. Plus they don't seem to offer any of the benefits that bachelors does (Co-op for eg). Clearly I'm biased towards doing a bachelors but I don't want to be close minded. I wanna know if I should consider masters as an actual option right away. My main focus is that my education shouldn't look like a drawback to potential employers, and there should be a better chance of employment. (Also I've read multiple times that strong portfolio and CS-based projects makes you a good candidate and that you don't need formal education but I honestly don't think I can be impressive enough pull that off. I'm willing to put in the work but I also need some structured learning before I can build my portfolio. Plus CS degree is a part of the mandatory requirements for a lot of job listings that I see so I don't want to be ineligible or automatically screened out for good opportunities)So what should I do? CS Masters without Bachelors or CS bachelors. **TLDR**; Are the chances of landing a job with a CS masters without CS bachelors the same as having a CS bachelors? I know landing a job in general would be hard but which offers me a better chance?",21,0.96,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p5ajn9/cs_bachelor_vs_cs_masters_without_cs_bachelors/,2025-11-24 07:12:08,2025-11-25 01:42:06

But I’m honestly feeling really worried about my performance. My manager never addressed any particular issues with my performance when we met 1:1 a few months ago (we never had a 1:1 since), but I was still worried. For every task I’ve been given so far, there’s a point where I don’t know what to do after I try figuring out myself and have to ask for help. I have been asked to give ETAs fore and can my very loose estimations were always less than how long it actually took to finish tasks since I barely know what I’m doing. There had also been an instance where I messed up the deployment for some of my changes, and my teammates had to help me rollback. One of the tasks I had been working on were supposed to be finished before this past week, but I couldn’t since the changes were more involved than I initially realized because of differences in the service between non-prod and prod (whereas it worked in non-prod where I had been testing prior). Teammates also had to step in again for that. I’ll even try reading through docs our team has to try to get a better sense of things, just for things to still not click. I know I’m supposed to properly ramp myself up within 2 more months, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to.

Feeling hopeless and getting nothing, feeling very unproductive",shade_blade,cscareerquestions,"I've been trying to get a job for months but it feels like it's getting worse and worse? No positive response in weeks and it's getting close to the point where my parents are going to force me into some random dead end job for the rest of my life. (I don't count the random calls out of nowhere as they're either scam job training or they hang up after realizing I don't have years of experience). I have no confidence I'll ever be able to get out of jobs like that (if I'm working full time in some random back breaking job I won't have time or energy to interview or do anything else, and upward mobility doesn't exist, and once recruiters see my resume with a dead end job on top they will reject immediately because a guy with actual skills wouldn't be forced into a job like that). I'm also not physically strong or sociable so jobs like that would probably kill me after years in them. And it would mentally destroy me too, what's the point of trying at all in school or in general if I can only get a useless dead end job?I feel so useless, I know I should be spending every day applying to 100+ places and doing useful projects but I'm not very motivated to? I've actively tried to force myself into it, deleting video games off my computer and archiving the folders for most of my useless projects but I kind of relapsed and did more work in those, but I should know those projects are going to absolutely nothing for me useful. I need someone to push me around so I can finally delete them and move onto something that will actually help me. They have no impressive metrics so there is nothing to put in resume bullet points. No recruiter is going to be impressed by an ugly indie rpg prototype or a garbage chess engine that's 100x slower than the stuff you can already get out there. And neither of those projects have a massive CI/CD pipeline or use expensive cloud servers or use Docker or whatever else is on the long list of technologies that are mandatory nowadaysI just don't know what to do? I need to get a good job at some point but it's feeling more and more impossible? This time of the year might be really bad for hiring also, but I feel like I can't wait months to get a job or else it looks like I'm unhireableResume wise it is pretty unimpressive but I'm losing motivation to try to make ""impressive"" things, I haven't been able to come up with any ""useful"" project ideas that justify me paying money for an enterprise level server for something (found somewhere that said that real projects have to use enterprise level things, free servers are for useless toy projects). I can't ""make something I'm interested in"" because the things I'm interested in are all useless, I need to only work on useful things which means I can't pick something that I like to work on, I have to only work on something that will help me and not just play all day. I don't feel like I'm skilled enough to make a project useful and impressive for a specific company since they have their own experienced developers, who am I to think that I can surpass all of them combined?

Has the role name in the offer and everything, but was placed on the QA Automation team. At first, I did not know much, except that it's not liked, so I gave it a couple weeks, got some tasks, and I realized that I don't like this work at all, it isn't fufilling and I miss development work. I tell this information to my boss, about how the role is misleading and how I want to switch and be given tasks, and if it's possible to switch and they said it can happen, but it takes time and that someone did that after working in qa for a couple years. So, this isn't a good situation for me, I don't want to be stuck doing this work forever, then struggle later getting a dev job. Even hearing the word QA is becoming a trigger word for me, because there's that seperation between being qa and being a dev, and I am not considered a dev. It sucks knowing that after 4 years of grinding CS work, and doing full-stack projects, that you spend your time running tests and trying to find bugs, but don't get to fix them. Since i only worked here 2-3 months now, should I include this in my resume when I am applying, or pretend it dosen't exist and just apply without it? Also has many people had this issue happen to them? I know it's not the end of the world, but it makes me anxious knowing each day longer I am here, the more I feel like I am settling and i can do better.

I didn't even answer a single technical question.)Required to be in another state by fall 2026, which means I need to start looking ASAP.

I'm significantly underpaid for my experience and degree (MS in CS + certs) right now, and I'm paranoid that long tenure looks like I'm either stuck or coasting.

I recently got a grad offer for a hedge fund/trading firm (keeping it not very specific), in the ballpark of £115-125K total comp - call them A.

However, I really enjoyed my time with B (can't understate this enough), and I know the hours would be considerably better (at least 1h30m less than A, daily).B is also a much bigger name, and has a couple particularly deep strengths which could enable me to seriously upskill and pivot back to finance if I wanted to. TC grows steadily year-on-year; I think £150-160k TC by year 4.On the other hand, I suspect that As comp would grow similarly fast, and probably skews towards big bonuses in particularly good years.

Currently what's most important to me are:* Exit opportunities/res value if have to rerecruit* Career growth if ft at those companies* Stability and future aspects of the company* WLB (worried about burning out at DoorDash if I get a bad team)Insights?,3,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p4z386/doordash_vs_duolingo_swe_intern/,2025-11-23 21:51:53,2025-11-25 01:42:06
1p48ij5,Preparing for data team's coding round,yeticoder1989,cscareerquestions,"My background is in building backend systems for data teams and have worked in data ingestion and data processing in multiple teams. I have used Apache Spark, Flink, and other big data technologies long time back and currently, in a data ingestion team using Scala/Akka. I recently applied to a software engineer role in data team for similar role. They mentioned about the first round being data coding round and I can use Python/Scala with Spark or Pandas to solve the problem. I'm not sure what to expect in that round and have been revising Spark and Scala. Has anyone done similar rounds and can tell few questions that I can expect ?Should I also brush up my SQL knowledge or data warehouse modelling for this or next rounds ? Don't want to focus on breath and miss out on depth while preparing, so asking for tips.",3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p48ij5/preparing_for_data_teams_coding_round/,2025-11-23 00:17:18,2025-11-25 01:42:06

1p3s1jf,Help Negotiating Microsoft Offer for L62,UniqueGamer1015,cscareerquestions,"Currently at a company where my TC is 143k and I have 7 yoe. Got an offer for L62. Base 171kRSUs 90k over 4 years Sign on 18k.The recruiter mentioned having some wiggle room, which he gave me the numbers as…Base 176kRSUs 100k over 4 yearsSign On 22kI think the base being in the 170k range is good for L62 but I will definitely be pushing to get to 176k base if that is really the max I can go. Though I’m curious if the wiggle room mentioned is as high as I can go or can I negotiate higher? I’m fine if the base goes to 176k but I was hoping for over 100k RSUs and 25k sign on. I don’t have any competing offers which I know would help. Any insight you can provide would be great.
