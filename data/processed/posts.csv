1pcl7on,Taking 165k Offer Over 175k Offer,Dense_Car_591,dataengineering,"Hi all,I made a post a while back agonizing whether or not to take a 175k DE II offer at an allegedly toxic company. Wanted to say thank you to everyone in this community for all the helpful advice, comments, and DMs. I ended up rejecting the 175k offer and opted to complete the final round with the second company mentioned in the previous post. Well, I just got the verbal offer! Culture and WLB is reportedly very strong but the biggest factor was that everyone I talked to from peers to potential manager all seemed like people I could enjoy working with 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. Offer Breakdown: fully remote, 145k base, 10% bonus, 14k stock over 4 years First year TC: 165.1k due to stock vesting structure To try to pay forward all the help from this sub, I wanted to share all the things that worked for me during this job hunt. 1. Targeting DE roles that had near 100% tech stack alignment. So for me: Python, SQL, AWS, Airflow, Databricks, Terraform. Nowadays, both recruiters and HMs seem to really try to find candidates with experience in most, if not all tools they use, especially when comparing to my previous job hunts. Drawback is smaller application shotgun blast radius into the void, esp if you are cold applying like I did. 2. Leetcode, unfortunately. I practiced medium-hard questions for SQL and did light prep for DSA (using Python). List, string, dict, stack and queue, 2-pointer easy-medium was enough to get by for the companies I interviewed at but ymmv. Setting a timer and verbalizing my thought process helped for the real thing. 3. Rereading Kimball’s Data Warehouse Toolkit. I read thru the first 4 chapters then cherry picked a few later chapters for scenario based data modeling topics. Once I finished reading and taking notes, I went to ChatGPT and asked it to simulate acting as an interviewer for a data modeling round. This helped me bounce ideas back and forth, especially for domains I had zero familiarity in. 4. Behavioral Prep. Each quarter at my job, I keep a note of all the projects of value I either led or completed and with details like design, stakeholders involved, stats whether it is cost saved or dataset % adoption within org etc, and business results. This helped me organize 5-6 stories that I would use to answer any behavioral question that came my way without too much hesitation or stuttering. For interviewers who dug deeply into the engineering aspect, reviewing topology diagrams and the codebase helped a lot for that aspect. 5. Last but not least, showing excitement over the role and company. I am not too keen on sucking up to strangers or act like a certain product got me geeking but I think it helps when you can show reasons why the role/company/product has some kind of professional or personal connection to you. That’s all I could think of. Shoutout again to all the nice people on this sub for the helpful comments and DMs from earlier!",186,0.94,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pcl7on/taking_165k_offer_over_175k_offer/,2025-12-02 21:32:25,2025-12-09 01:44:17
1pf455n,The Fabric push is burning me out,SignalMine594,dataengineering,"Just a Friday rant…I’ve worked on a bunch of data platforms over the years, and lately it’s getting harder to stay motivated and just do the job. When Fabric first showed up at my company, I was pumped. It looked cool and felt like it might clean up a lot of the junk I was dealing with. Now it just feels like it’s being shoved into everything, even when it shouldn’t fit, or can’t fit.All the public articles and blogs I see talk about it like it’s already this solid, all-in-one thing, but using it feels nothing like that. I get random errors out of nowhere, and stuff breaks for reasons nobody can explain. It makes me waste hours to debug just to see if I ran into a new bug, an old bug, or “that’s just how it is.” It’s exhausting me, and leadership thinks my team is just incompetent because we can’t get it working reliably (Side note: if your team is hiring, I'm looking to jump).But what’s been getting to me is how the conversation online has shifted. More Fabric folks and partner types jump into threads on Reddit acting like none of these problems are a big deal. Everything seems to be brushed off as “coming soon” or “it’s still new,” even though it’s been around for two years and half the features have GA labels slapped on them. It often feels like we get lectured for expecting basic things to work.I don’t mind a platform having some rough edges. Butt I *do* mind being pushed into something that still doesn’t feel ready, especially by sales teams talking like it’s already perfect, especially when we all know that the product keeps missing simple stuff you need to run something in production. I get that there’s a quota, but I promise I/my company would spend more if there was practical and realistic guidance and not just feel cornered into whatever product uplift they get on broken feature.And since Ignite, the whole AI angle just makes it messier. I keep asking how we’re supposed to do GenAI inside Fabric, there are lots of, “go look at Azure AI Foundry” or “go look at Azure AI Studio.” Or now this IQ stuff that’s like 3 different products, all called IQ. It feels like both everything and nothing at all are in Fabric? It just feels like a weird split between Data and AI at Microsoft, like they’re shipping whatever their org chart looks like instead of a real platform.Honestly, I get why people like Joe Reis lose it online about this stuff. At some point I just want a straight conversation about what actually works and what doesn’t, and how I can do my job well, instead of just getting into petty arguments",185,0.98,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pf455n/the_fabric_push_is_burning_me_out/,2025-12-05 19:24:32,2025-12-09 01:44:17

1pcmtm4,Got a 100% Salary Raise Overnight. Now I Have to Lead Data Engineering. Am I Preparing Right?,ok_pineapple_ok,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I need some advice on a big career shift that just landed on me.I’ve been working at the same company for almost 20 years. Started here at 20, small town, small company, great culture. I’m a traditional data-warehousing person — SQL, ETL, Informatica, DataStage, ODI, PL/SQL, that whole world. My role is Senior Data Engineer, but I talk directly to the CIO because it’s that kind of company. They trust me, I know everyone, and the work-life balance has always been great (never more than 8 hours a day).Recently we acquired another company whose entire data stack is modern cloud: Snowflake, AWS, Git, CI/CD, onboarding systems to the cloud, etc.While I was having lunch, the CIO came to me and basically said:“You’re leading the new cloud data engineering area. Snowflake, AWS, CI/CD. We trust you. You’ll do great. Here’s a 100% salary increase.”No negotiation. Just: This is yours now.He promised the workload won’t be crazy — maybe a few 9–10 hour days in the first six months, then stable again. And he genuinely believes I’m the best person to take this forward.I’m excited but also aware that the tech jump is huge. I want to prepare properly, and the CIO can’t really help with technical questions right now because it’s all new to him too.My plan so far:Learn Snowflake deeply (warehousing concepts + Snowflake specifics)Then study for AWS certifications — maybe Developer Associate or Solutions Architect Associate, so I have a structure to learn. Not necessarily do the certs.Learn modern practices: Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, etc.)My question:Is this the right approach?If you were in my shoes, how would you prepare for leading a modern cloud data engineering function?Any advice from people who moved from traditional ETL into cloud data engineering would be appreciated.",152,0.94,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pcmtm4/got_a_100_salary_raise_overnight_now_i_have_to/,2025-12-02 22:34:58,2025-12-09 01:44:17

I have been with a financial services company for more than 10 years. Over the years, my work has evolved: I started in front-office operations, then moved into complex reconciliations, later handled end-to-end accounting (A to Z) for a sister company, and eventually returned to financial services.My role has never been clearly defined. I am usually brought in to solve problems. I have access to an Oracle database now and I know basic SQL (not advanced). I also have strong Excel and VBA skills. I’ve regularly used these skills to solve operational problems, build logic, help write scripts, and set rules in vendor-provided tools to automate reconciliations. I also helped create Excel templates for reporting.I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, along with SQL courses and basic Python, although I can’t recall everything well now. I’ve done some reconciliation work in BigQuery using SQL (often with ChatGPT support), but in my actual day-to-day job I mostly use standard queries like SELECT, GROUP BY, WHERE, and HAVING—nothing very advanced.My dilemma is this: my company has huge backlogs, but the core problems are not about writing the right query or automating something. The real issues are poor initial setups, incorrect postings, bad historical decisions, and choosing the wrong cheap vendors to cut the cost. We’re trying to “clean the garage,” but the garage is fundamentally broken—missing data, open loops, and structural issues that can’t realistically be fixed.What makes it worse is that old staff are defensive. They won’t allow corrections that might expose their past mistakes because it affects their reputation. The expectation is: you’re here to fix things, but without the authority or data needed to actually fix them.Because I commute around 5 hours a day, I arrive at work already exhausted. I struggle to learn new skills consistently. This has left me stressed, stagnant, and feeling useless—trying to clean deeply broken systems alone, with no real progress in either my career or my technical growth.So I am stuck between these options:1) Stay with the company, learn very slowly, continue firefighting, take blame for issues I didn’t create, remain stressed, and feel that my career and skill set are not progressing.2) Go back to my home country, focus seriously on learning (properly and deeply), work on real projects, join something structured like Zoomcamp or another bootcamp, and try to move into freelance or remote work. I see people around me leveraging new tools, AI, automation, and platforms like n8n—while I feel stuck in a toxic environment with almost no time or energy to grow.

1ph3dsz,Full stack framework for Data Apps,NoConversation2215,dataengineering,"TLDR: Is there a good full-stack framework for building data/analytics apps (ingestion -> semantics -> dashboards -> alerting), the same way transactional apps have opinionated full-stack frameworks?I’ve been a backend dev for years, but lately I’ve been building analytics/data-heavy apps - basically domain-specific observability. Users get dashboards, visualizations, rich semantic models across multiple environments, and can define invariants/alerts when certain conditions are met or violated.We have paying customers and a working product, but the architecture has become more complex and ad-hoc than it needs to be (partly because we optimized for customer feedback over cohesion). And lately we have been feeling as we are dealing with a lot of incidental complexity than our domain itself.With transactional apps, there are plenty of opinionated full-stack frameworks that give you auth, DB/ORM, scaffolding, API structure, frontend patterns, etc.My question:Is there anything comparable for analytics apps — something that gives a unified framework for:- ingestion + pipelines- semantic modelling- supporting heterogeneous storage/query engines- dashboards + visualization- alertingso a small team doesn’t have to stitch everything together ourselves and can focus on domain logic?I know the pieces exist individually:- Pipelines: Airflow / Dagster- Semantics: dbt- Storage/query: warehouses, Delta Lake, etc.- Visualization: Superset- Alerting: Superset or customBut is there an opinionated, end-to-end framework that ties these together?Extra constraint: We often deploy in customer cloud/on-prem, so the stack needs to be lean and maintainable across many isolated installations.TIA.",31,0.92,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ph3dsz/full_stack_framework_for_data_apps/,2025-12-08 04:37:59,2025-12-09 01:44:17

On the other hand, this direction is slightly easier and little more interesting to me and maybe business communication skills will be more valuable in the future than technical skills.The Data Engineer path, however, is more technically demanding, but the long-term benefits seem much greater - better pay, more opportunities, lower risk of being replaced by AI and more technical skill development.Please don’t reply with “just do what you like,” because I’ve spent several years in a dead-end job and at the end of the day, work is work.I’m just a junior with only a few days of experience who already has to make an important decision, so I'm sorry if these questions are stupid.",21,0.78,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pc7mkw/first_week_at_work_and_first_decision_data/,2025-12-02 12:51:21,2025-12-09 01:44:17

These usually require a more extended review compared to a direct reference, and this is where the tool helps you quickly spot them (with the code of the transfo).* **Simple Projections:** Columns that are a direct, untransformed reference of the selected column.**Github Repo:** `Fszta/dbt-column-lineage` **Demo version:** I deployed a live test version -> You can find the link in the repository.I've currently only tested this with Snowflake, DuckDB, and MSSQL.

1pckc1u,The `metadata lake` pattern is growing on me. Here's why.,Hefty-Citron2066,dataengineering,"Been doing data engineering for a while now and wanted to share some thoughts on a pattern I've been seeing more of.**TL;DR:** Instead of trying to consolidate all your data into one platform (which never actually works), there's a growing movement to federate metadata instead. The ""metadata lake"" concept. After being skeptical, I'm starting to think this is the right approach for most orgs.## The pattern that keeps repeatingEvery company I've worked at has gone through the same cycle:1. Start with one data platform (Hadoop, Snowflake, Databricks, whatever)2. A different team needs something the main platform doesn't do well3. They spin up their own thing (separate warehouse, different catalog, etc.)4. Now you have two data platforms5. Leadership says ""we need to consolidate""6. Migration project starts, takes forever, never finishes7. Meanwhile a third platform gets added for ML or streaming8. RepeatSound familiar? I've seen this at three different companies now. The consolidation never actually happens because:- Migrations are expensive and risky- Different tools really are better for different workloads- Teams have opinions and organizational capital to protect their choices- By the time you finish migrating, something new has come along## The alternative: federate the metadataI've been reading about and experimenting with the ""metadata lake"" approach. The idea is:- Accept that you'll have multiple data platforms- Don't try to move the data- Instead, create a unified layer that federates the metadata- Apply governance and discovery at that layerThe key insight is that data is expensive to move but metadata is cheap. You can't easily migrate petabytes of data from Snowflake to Databricks, but you can absolutely sync the schema information, ownership, lineage, and access policies.## Tools in this spaceThe main open source option I've found is Apache Gravitino (https://github.com/apache/gravitino). It's an Apache TLP that does catalog federation. You point it at your existing catalogs (Hive, Iceberg, Kafka schema registry, JDBC sources) and it presents them through unified APIs.What I like about it:- Doesn't require migration, works with what you have- Supports both tabular and non-tabular data (filesets, message topics)- Governance policies apply across all federated catalogs- Vendor neutral, Apache licensed- The team behind it has serious credentials (Apache Spark, Hadoop committers)GitHub: https://github.com/apache/gravitino (2.3k stars)There's also a good article explaining the philosophy: https://medium.com/datastrato/if-youre-not-all-in-on-databricks-why-metadata-freedom-matters-35cc5b15b24e## My POC experienceRan a quick POC federating our Hive metastore, an Iceberg catalog, and Kafka schema registry. Took about 3 hours to set up. The unified view is genuinely useful. I can see tables, topics, and schemas all in one place with consistent APIs.The cross-catalog queries work but I'd still recommend keeping hot path queries within single systems. The value is more in discovery, governance, and breaking down silos than in making cross-system joins performant.## When this makes sense- You have data spread across multiple platforms (most enterprises)- Consolidation has failed or isn't realistic- You need unified governance but can't force everyone onto one tool- You're multi-cloud and want to avoid vendor lock-in- You have both batch and streaming data that need to be discoverable## When it might not- You're a startup that can actually standardize on one platform- Your data volumes are small enough that migration is feasible- You don't have governance or discovery problems yet## Questions for the community1. Has anyone else moved toward this federated metadata approach? What's your experience?2. Are there other tools in this space I should be looking at? I know DataHub and Atlan exist but they feel more like discovery tools than unified metadata layers.3. For those who successfully consolidated onto one platform, how did you actually do it? Genuinely curious if there's a playbook I'm missing.",10,0.92,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pckc1u/the_metadata_lake_pattern_is_growing_on_me_heres/,2025-12-02 20:59:21,2025-12-09 01:44:17
1pcb6u8,Built an ADBC driver for Exasol in Rust with Apache Arrow support,marco_nae,dataengineering,"**Built an ADBC driver for Exasol in Rust with Apache Arrow support**I've been learning Rust for a while now, and after building a few CLI tools, I wanted to tackle something meatier. So I built `exarrow-rs` \- an ADBC-compatible database driver for Exasol that uses Apache Arrow's columnar format.**What is it?**It's essentially a bridge between Exasol databases and the Arrow ecosystem. Instead of row-by-row data transfer (which is slow for analytical queries), it uses Arrow's columnar format to move data efficiently. The driver implements the ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity) standard, which is like ODBC/JDBC but designed around Arrow from the ground up.**The interesting bits:*** Built entirely async on Tokio - the driver communicates with Exasol over WebSockets (using their native WebSocket API)* Type-safe parameter binding using Rust's type system* Comprehensive type mapping between Exasol's SQL types and Arrow types (including fun edge cases like `DECIMAL(p)` → `Decimal256`)* C FFI layer so it works with the ADBC driver manager, meaning you can load it dynamically from other languages**Caveat:**It uses the latest WebSockets API of Exasol since Exasol does not support Arrow natively, yet. So currently, it is converting Json responses into Arrow batches. See [exasol/websocket-api](https://github.com/exasol/websocket-api) for more details on Exasol WebSockets.**The learning experience:**The hardest part was honestly getting the async WebSocket communication right while maintaining ADBC's synchronous-looking API. Also, Arrow's type system is... extensive. Mapping SQL types to Arrow types taught me a lot about both ecosystems.**What is Exasol?**Exasol Analytics Engine is a high-performance, in-memory engine designed for near real-time analytics, data warehousing, and AI/ML workloads.Exasol is obviously an enterprise product, BUT it has a free Docker version which is pretty fast. And they offer a free personal edition for deployment in the Cloud in case you hit the limits of your laptop.**The project**It's MIT licensed and community-maintained. It is not officially maintained by Exasol! Would love feedback, especially from folks who've worked with Arrow or built database drivers before.What gotchas should I watch out for? Any ADBC quirks I should know about?Also happy to answer questions about Rust async patterns, Arrow integration, or Exasol in general!",10,0.92,1,https://github.com/marconae/exarrow-rs,2025-12-02 15:22:19,2025-12-09 01:44:17

Can't tell if market is shit or I'm overvaluing myself,Captain_Strudels,dataengineering,"Went from senior analyst for a decently large tech company to intermediate engineer for an org a bit further along than ""startup"". I'm desperately trying to move my career to something closer to ""software engineer with data skills"" but I can't seem to land the right role. The org I've been with for the past year-ish has been focused on very grimy, hands-on data migrations for individual clients into our system - data entry with extra steps. I'm trying to take on projects that solve bigger problems, like getting involved with fleshing out our warehouse and providing reporting views for all of our customers rather than bespoke reports for individual customers.However the business seems REALLY keen on just keeping me in a little silo and handing off the important projects to our devs. I'm told migrations are the #1 priority, so proper pipeline building is sitting elsewhere as I keep the lights on. The migration work is absolutely soul destroying and mind numbing, but the volume of it keeps me from progressing more meaningful internal projects for my career.Whats more, the business has identified individual customer bespoke report building as an untapped revenue stream and is prepping to shift me much more onto it, so I seem to have even less room to negotiate doing anything else. And my attempts at working closer with the devs was dashed as we recently underwent something of a restructure that silo'd the data team further from them.I feel like my org just needs a cheap grunt to process customer data instead of an engineer, and that's totally cool, but I can't tell if my inability to climb internally or find a better role elsewhere is because I keep landing roles that fundamentally won't progress me or if I'm not learning the right skills in my own time. * I think my SQL skills are great - not like ""I can do the craziest shit in SQL"" amazing, but I've always been one of the better SQL writers in my orgs. I don't think I have much to say here.* I think my Python skills are mediocre but not a complete handicap. This year, since starting my new role, I've made some basic scripts to help me with processing data before pushing into our system, mainly with Polars/Pandas. But frankly this was largely prompted so I could deliver at speed. I'm fine with reading and debugging code on my own. But I've never been in much of a situation where I've needed to write code for the business, and when I review code written by our senior devs, I can tell I have no idea about proper project structuring. In prior analyst roles I mainly worked with R to solve complex data problems, so I'm not that unexposed to more traditional programming languages.* I haven't really had to work with LINQ but I've had exposure. It doesn't seem to come up in job listings so I assume it's more for SWEs who happen to be doing some data work in C#?* re: cloud tech, I'm not sure if I'm bringing anything to the table. Current org uses Azure, last org used GCP, haven't worked with AWS before. But ultimately none of this has affected me beyond using the company's choice of data interface, eg SQL Server, BigQuery, etc. In my current org I am lightly dabbling in Azure-specific key vaults and blob storage, but I don't know if I should suddenly be throwing this on the CV.* I think my GIT is fine? Like I'm not rebasing branches but I'm able to do the basics to contribute to a code base.* Soft skills I don't have the best measure on. I think they're good given my prior senior experience for a well-renowned org. My ""manager"" (part of senior leadership but the org is quite small so touches base once a week to confirm work is on track) suggested I consider trying to become the data team leader. I don't know if this is realistically happening in my time here.But then I look at senior roles and I don't feel I qualify. There's not much which I think is a product of the global market being a bit shit, and particularly where I live has been hit pretty hard. But the few roles there are skills like advanced Python or specific cloud tech exposure. And I'm like ""I could probably lie and learn it on the role"" but I'm worried I'm giving myself too much credit.Is this a common situation to be in? Is there a way out?

1pdfkd0,Who should manage Airflow in small but growing company?,Jaded_Bar_9951,dataengineering,"Hi,I'm 26 and I just graduated in Data Science. Two months ago I started working in a small but growing company as a mix Data Engineer/Data Scientist. Basically, now I'm making order in their data, writing different pipelines to do stuff (I know it's super generic, but it's not the point of the post). To schedule the pipelines, I decided to use Airflow. I'm not a pro, but I'm trying to read stuff and watch as many videos as I can about best practices and so on to do things well. The thing is that my company outsourced the management of the IT infrastructure to another and even smaller company, which made sense in the past because my company was small and they didn't need the control, nor did they have IT figures in the company. Now things are changing, and they have started to build a small IT department to do different stuff. To install Airflow on our servers, I had to pass through this company, which I mean, I understand and it was ok. The IT company knew nothing about Airflow, it was the first time for them and they needed a looooot of time to read everything they could and install it ""safely"". The problem is that now they don't let me do the most basic stuff without passing through them, like make a little change in the config file (lfor example, adding the SMTP server for the emails) or install python packages, not even restart Airflow. Every time I need to open a ticket and wait, wait, wait. It happened in the past that airflow had some problems and I had to tell them how to fix them, because they didn't let me do it. I asked many times the permission to do these basic operations, and they told me that they don't want to allow me to do it because they have the responsibility of the correct functioning of the software, and if I touch it they cant guarantee it. I told them that I know what i'm doing, and there is no risk at all. Furthermore, most of the things that I do are BI stuff, so it's just querying operational databases and make some transformations on the data, the worst thing that can happen is that one day I don't deliver a dataset or a dashboard because airflow blocks, but nothing worse can happen. This situation is very frustrating for me because I feel stuck many times, and it annoys me a lot to wait for the most basic and stupid operations. A colleague of mine told me that I have a lot to do, and in the meantime I can work on other tasks. It made me even angrier because, ok I have a lot of stuff to do, but why I have to wait for nothing?? It's super inefficent. My question is, how does it work in normal/structured companies? who has the responsibility of the configuration/packages/restart of airflow? the data engineers or the ""infrastructure"" team?

My long-term goal over the next 2–4 years is to become a Data Engineer. The question is: should I follow the Data/Product Analyst → Analytics Engineer → Data Engineer path, or skip straight to Analytics Engineer → Data Engineer?**Context:**I’m a CS dropout with 9–10 years of SaaS consulting experience, where roughly half my work involved analysis (SQL, Excel, product analysis). I’ve always gravitated toward data, and that curiosity pushed me into big data engineering. I completed a 6-month live course on PySpark along with several others. I’m also completing my degree online to close the non-degree gap.My Tech Stack:1. SQL2. Python3. PySpark4. AWS5.

I’m comfortable with GitHub.I don’t rely on ChatGPT for coding, I’m old-school about writing my own solutions. I mainly use LLMs to understand bugs faster than digging through StackOverflow.Earlier Guidance from others has made me realize I can’t jump directly into a DE role because I lack production-level experience, so the “right” path should be Data Analyst first, then transition.**The problem:**The DA market is extremely saturated. Every posting gets 10–15K applications, and realistically, I’m not competitive right now on paper. I’ve done the whole drill - no movement. I’ve been jobless for over a year, and I’m desperate at this point.**My concern/dilemma:**Given that my end goal is DE, should I really stick to the DA/PA → AE → DE route, or should I bypass DA entirely and aim for AE → DE? If I do land a DA job, I’ll have to go through another full transition again, whereas AE → DE is almost a direct pipeline.A lot of this dilemma comes from the fact that I’m not even getting any calls for DA roles because the market is congested and full of scams/fake hiring. If I were getting traction, I would’ve followed the original plan.But since I’m getting nowhere, should I aim directly for AE instead? I genuinely like the AE toolset- dbt, Snowflake, data modeling, that’s the direction I want to go.I’m just unsure whether hiring managers would consider me for an AE role purely based on my projects and skills, given that I don’t yet have production experience. What if I face same issue in AE and be back to square one after spending 3-4 month learning and applying. Should I just stick to DA/PA and keep applying.

1pgbhcq,Data lake as a service,ihatevacations,dataengineering,"Hey all, I had an idea for a data lake visualization tool but I don't know if this is a pain point that other engineers have as well. When I used to work on a team that built a data lake on top of AWS technologies (S3, DMS, Redshift, Glue, Athena, Lake Formation, etc) I found it a bit hard to visualize the data flow since everything was a bit scattered, though having the architecture diagram helped a little bit. Aside from visualization, the AWS monthly bill was eye watering and it had a bunch of operational issues. Observability was a bit of a pain too since we had to create alarms for each table and each database in Glue. This is just my experience from working on a data lake that was built from scratch.This might be a stupid idea but I was thinking about possible ways to make it easier to build data lakes and manage everything in an all-in-one platform, from prototyping to testing to observability. Especially for smaller companies that don't have the luxury of spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars per month in infrastructure costs, they can use smaller machines to setup a data lake and expand it as they go. To start off, the idea is to build a visualization tool where you can use your choice of hosting / tools, for example S3 or your own blob storage, and execute scripts to perform transformations on that data and build a data lake from there. It would include ways to automate observability by automatically setting up alarms as you connect different pieces together.Is this a pain point that others face as well?

I have a plan to relearn things, just not sure where to start.",L_im_it,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone,I graduated with a CS degree in 2021, but due to some life circumstances and a tough job market, I haven't held a developer position since then. I've decided to stop worrying about the gap and finally get back into the saddle to break my impostor syndrome.My goal is to build a portfolio of 2–3 solid projects to prove (to myself and employers) that I can still write code. I’m looking for some feedback and/or suggestions on a learning path.As it stands, I have familiarity with the following programming languages and will list my strength/capability with said languages:Python: 8/10 - I can confidently write most things in Python and I think the only thing that I would need to re-visit are some OOP concepts and other small nuances given that most OOP I did during my undergraduate years were done in Java. I've tinkered with (but could never really finish or grasp) Pythonic frameworks like Flask and Django, and that's as far as I've ever went project-wise with the language. Can say without a doubt it's my strongest language. I have some books like *Fluent Python 2nd Edition, Django 4 By Example 4th Edition,* that I bought a year or so ago; was wondering if they're still relevant or have become outdated. What other books or resources would you recommend?Java: 5/10 - It's been a *whileeeeeee* since I wrote anything in Java, but a lot of job descriptions I've seen for listings in my area have things like Java Spring and Spring Boot which have roots in the language, therefore piquing my interest to re-visiting Java. The problem? I can hardly remember the syntax let alone know if it's worth re-learning. Is it worth re-visiting Java just for the job market, or should I double down on Python to get ""job ready"" faster? If I do go the Java route, what is the best ""refresher"" resource for someone who already understands the theory but forgot the syntax?C++: 5/10 - Roughly the same description as above, but will say it was my favorite to play around with and was a bit simpler to understand vs. Java. Was told there was still demand with the language, particularly in Finance and Embedded Systems. ... and other languages that I can say I have ""familiarity"" with, but have hardly done things in: C#, Bash, and JavaScript.Thus, what would you guys recommend I start with topic-wise, anything-wise?

1pceges,Where should i start ?,MoAd340,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I posted here before saying that I’m a Software Engineering graduate who feels completely lost, and many people told me to either try getting an internship or start building small projects to figure out if I even enjoy programming. The problem is that during university I mostly studied just to pass exams, not to really learn, so even though I worked with front-end, Java, C++, and a few other things, I honestly forgot most of it because I never practiced. I also feel like there are a lot of basic concepts I should already know but don’t.Another thing that’s been holding me back is applying to companies. Most places ask for a CV, and I honestly don’t feel confident putting mine out there. It’s not that the things I list are “wrong”—I really did study them—but I don’t master them and barely remember anything. That makes me hesitate to apply for internships or entry-level positions because I feel like I don’t truly deserve the skills I say I have.At the same time, I always felt like things like HTML or even C++ are “easy” and that anyone can learn them, so I’m not sure if I should learn completely different languages like Java or Python, or if I should just stick to one clear track and build from there.Right now I want to restart properly from zero, but I don’t know where to begin. I see a lot of people recommending The Odin Project—would that be a good starting point? I can study around 4–6 hours a day, but I don’t want to waste time on something too basic or something that won’t help me get anywhere. I’m also not sure whether to focus on front-end, back-end, or try both at the same time. And I’m confused about how people even start building small projects—do you follow certain websites for ideas, or specific courses?What’s also discouraging me is AI. It feels like AI can now build a full website in minutes while a beginner needs days. Is this actually true, or am I overthinking it? Should I look into mobile development instead, or try something that fits the market better?Any advice or a clear roadmap for restarting would really mean a lot.

First, some context.A while ago I undertook the arduous task of learning OpenGL. From all the basics of drawing primitives and up to advanced concepts such as compute shaders and volumetric cloud rendering. The entire process was an immense learning curve and honestly felt like I was relearning how to program. The result is a procedurally generated universe where you can explore endless galaxies and solar systems. However, it is still unfinished and I will continue working on it.I found that while learning OpenGL you are bombarded with terminology, and it can be quite difficult to take these concepts and develop your own ideas. So, I was thinking of making a series that introduces you into the concepts needed, and develop an intuitive understanding of graphics programming. Then each concept we learn we can apply that to our custom program.So my question is, would any of you be interested in this? Would you have any recommendations? Or should I scrap this idea? I already have a 'thumbnail' (not a very well thought out one) that I put together if anyone would like to see it. I will provide a link to a google docs if that is allowed.

1pf363w,What do you do when you have a theoretically very complex object generation process that doesnt seem suited for a regular constructor?,Hellinfernel,learnprogramming,"For context, I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.For example, lets take the word ""Servus"", which means (a male) slave. (Dont be scared, its a unfortunately very common word in the roman time period, in which most of the training texts are settled). In the nominative case, its just ""Servus"", while the genitive case has ""servi"", the dative has ""servo"" and the accusative case has ""servum"" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations).But then there are also the plural forms, which are ""Servi"", ""servorum"",""servis"" and ""servos"" respectively.And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.This requires me to somehow construct something that can handle a lot of those cases, the question is just, how.My first instinct was creating a Noun-Class (Java) and then create a constructor that takes the word stem and the grammatical gender and then write methods that return the fitting suffix based on the context that is called. This looks then like this: public String getNominativeSingular() { StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(); stringBuilder.append(stem); String suffix = """"; switch (gender){ case NEUTRUM -> { suffix = ""um""; break; } case MASCULINUM -> { suffix = ""us""; break; } case FEMININUM -> { suffix = ""a""; break; } } stringBuilder.append(suffix); return stringBuilder.toString(); }In a vacuum this approach is fine, but it feels like this might cause more work than actually necessary in the long run.

What i could imagine would be creating a big Array with multiple dimensions that have a size based on the amount of states that the given properties can have.

Please do let me know if this happens to be just a Java thing so I can instead ask on that sub.Something I've noticed particularly recently is that, when trying to make something too far past the kind of things we learn about in class, I end up encountering a problem that challenges how I understand the way Java works.A good example of this is when I found some fairly basic code somewhere (the context & specifics of which I've forgotten) that created a ""new Main"" object. This threw me for a loop, as I've really just seen ""Main"" as a container for code that runs when starting a program, and never considered it as an object. I also then realized I have no clue what the ""(String[] args)"" bit means in the main method.So, why are the ""basics"" of programming languages (or again, maybe just Java) things like printing ""hello world"" before you deeply understand what a class is and why the print command is in one?Post-script: A few other examples of being taught a specific use for something without knowing what it does exactly(Side note: ""for some reason"" here just means I didn't know the reason, not that it's unreasonable)- Printing text, which for some reason requires me to add ""System.out."" beforehand- Creating a Scanner object to read user text input, which for some reason requires me to specify ""(System.in)""- Catching all errors, which for some reason requires me to specify ""(Exception e)""- Fixing a Scanner after inputting a number so it correctly takes text input, which for some reason is as simple as executing the command "".nextLine()""EDIT: The (quite helpful!) responses to this were a lot longer than I expected lol, I believe my questions have been answered.

The visual diagrams leave a lot to be desired. And, as would be expected, the AI bots are unhelpful and repetitive. As I worked my way through their distributed systems course, I found myself checking blog posts, Reddit, and using Claude to explain the concepts more clearly and succinctly. After a few days of this, I essentially stopped using the course altogether, and just used the outline as a primer for learning & quizzing myself inside of Claude. I had purchased an annual plan at $179/yr because the monthly cost was $99/mo (classic marketing tactic that I fell for; my fault, I should've tried the product more and shouldn't have reached for the annual plan).After two weeks I emailed their customer support asking for a partial refund of my annual plan, which was denied ""based on their return policy"".

So I wanted to listen to some opinions who cracked this thing before me. I took some time off from work and would like to dedicate it to solidifying knowledge in some technologies as well as learning others. I had an idea on how to go about it, but while talking with one colleague his words discouraged me from this initial idea.So, one of us thinks that I should pick up a project, design it in broad terms, do some research on what technologies make sense for it, then learn them as I work on the project. The other thinks that I should make a list of topics (design patterns etc) and technologies I would like to learn, find some solid resources, follow them. As I follow the concepts I also do exercises or make up examples to apply the knowledge / tinker with the different info. As knowledge accumulates, I revisit these exercises and see if there are better ways to do those things and why. By the time I have covered a significant amount of the material, I think of a project that would be fitting for the topics and technologies I am studying and work on it. In case the answer to my question is ""whatever works for you"", I don't know what works for me. I have a couple of years of experience, but I always learn things as I go in a very half baked way. That has made me professionally insecure, because my knowledge does not match my hard work or years of experience.My goals are, 3 months of studying. I should learn design patterns and architecture, solidify my python, airflow, spark and postgresql knowledge. Learn kafka and some kubernetes and aws services.

Each piece of domino can rotate freely. All grids must be filled, and must fit the constraints (e.g. 3 cells need to be different, 4 cells add up to 17, etc...) At first the game is interesting, then I tried to dig into the coding details behind it (where I cannot think at all). I have two main questions:1. How is the board generated? (Note: the holes can sometimes be in a loop (like today), or be jammed all together into a irregular piece, or a regular piece, so it can't be simply like a grid) 2. How do you verify that there is only one placement on the board? (i.e. how do you build a constraint solver such that you can verify there is only this solution?)2b. How to quantify the difficulty of a puzzle? (steps needed to solve? How many possible combinations?)\--my thoughts--For my first question, I thought of generating e.g. a 8x8 grid, then deleting all the empty spaces, but how do I ensure that sufficient amount of dominoes stick together and form a clump, instead of discrete dominoes floating inside the grid?For my second question, of course I can write a program to test all the combinations, but factoring in the orientation of the dominoes, there are at least 12! \* 4 (1.9 billion) placements, and it can be displaced (AB , CD) vs (XA, BC, DX), so its much more than that.",3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1phcinf/i_want_to_learn_how_to_build_an_irregular_grid/,2025-12-08 13:34:28,2025-12-09 01:44:18

Ive learnt basic python and C. It feels as if everyone around me at school is unmotivated outside of wanting a degree Ive asked quite a few ppl in my year non of them ever even touched a personal project or an IDE outside of doing homework. Makes me have no one around to bounce back and forth from no inspration like in highschool it feels dead. And the school isnt really asking me to do too much interms of programming either. basically all questions were leetcode easys about whatever topic we had at the time. I wanted some sort of guidance from my school enviorment but never got any. I feel lost with wanting to become better but i dont know how. Solved a bunch of leetcode but it felt pointless since i wasnt job hunting tried a few coding projects they were never too complex where they would take more than a few hours or a day or 2. ( alot of the times its a goofy simulation for a senario or OSRS loot sims if you know the game or a few discord bots). I dont know how to get better and i truly want to be able to build anything.

1pf4onp,Should I cancel my final rounds with Meta?,dandaman1728,cscareerquestions,"Senior software engineer with 9YOE.I got an offer for a fully remote role earlier this week. I negotiated with them with a higher base and told them that I'm in process with Meta (L5). With some back and forth, today they reached out and told me that they're willing to meet my asking base salary, which is higher than their cap for the role. I can tell that they want me and I also told them that I'm willing to stop my process with Meta if they can meet my requirements. They did, and now I'm wondering if I should cancel my final rounds with Meta next week. Regardless I will choose the fully remote role since even if I pass Meta, the 2-3 days hybrid in office requires me to uproot my family and relocate probably, and I do have a 18-month old toddler so work/life balance matters a lot to me now.So for now, I'm thinking what's the point of doing the interviews if I'm not going to take the offer. Plus I've been preparing for this round for months, doing leetcode, system design everyday. I'm tired of all of this. If doing interviews, I think it's just for the sake of gaining experience.

The startup I work at is very promising and we have a certain area of the product growing faster than anticipated. We have issues on the backend and db that are causing scaling issues. We made plans to rewrite critical parts of the code, but my company is terrible at allocating resources and everyone has been working on other things (we’re supposed to be on a code freeze but people are getting massive PRs up to both Fe and be repos).So the CEO and CTO have gotten frustrated with lack of progress and made an insane decision that the CTO will vibe code the frontend and backend alone. He does have the most business context and the original product was poorly written, but this has been worked on for two years and has a lot of custom config that will likely be overlooked in the rewrite and will cause tons of issues for existing customers.My CEO was bragging about how our CTO stays up all night vibe coding and I later found out that they are not even reviewing their frontend code. He expects my team to maintain his code - literally said, “I don’t want to maintain that.” He said it appears to work because his endpoints work (who cares about user interaction).

1ph4ux0,Array Reversal as a Filtering Question,Inner_Butterfly1991,cscareerquestions,"I'm a Tech Lead at a company you've heard of and I have 11 yoe. I'm typically anti-LC in interviews, my style is typically I pick the project they've listed on their resume that seems the most interesting both in terms of level of difficulty and just of interest to me, and drill super deep on it to really tease out if they did what they said they did. And 9/10 times that works. But until you've interviewed lots of people, you don't realize how good some people are at bullshitting. This is why LC exists, and it's why we implemented at least a super basic tech screen. We're a data team so we give them a sample dataset from data we actually work with, and ask them to do some super basic transformations and aggregations. We'll also work with them and are very forgiving, we're not looking for you to get the answer even, but we're looking for the signs that you actually understand the super basics and when given feedback can adjust your approach and at least have the right mindset.So back to the title, it astounded me when there was a post in this sub where someone was super upset that reversing an array without using the reverse function would be a question, as that was too much of memorizing algorithms. If we were talking an LC hard then sure I agree. But to anyone who knows the basics about programming this should be super easy. But given all the pushback I reconsidered, and I tested myself to ensure I could do it. And within 5 minutes I had 3 different solutions. Again I don't do LCs regularly, I've done some in job prep but we're talking about \~10 hours in my life and I'm on my 4th job. I don't think I've ever successfully done a hard, and although I can easily do most easy ones and am around 50/50 at mediums, there was one easy I failed on. I'm definitely not the LC, memorize algorithms type. But again this isn't an algorithm question it's one of the most basic things you can do. I used python but the fundamentals are the same in all languages:1. for i in range(len(array)): array2[len(array) - 1 - i] = array[i] array = array22. j = 0 for i in range(len(array)-1,-1,-1): array2[j] = array[i] j += 1 array = array2And probably the most algorithm answer: i = 0 j = len(array) - 1 while j > i: a = array[i] array[i] = array[j] array[j] = a i += 1 j -= 1And I'd assume in an interview setting it's fine to be running code and refining it, I certainly did when doing especially the last one (I had the while condition j > 0 initially so it was actually re-reversing so ending with the original array). And I get it I have 11 yoe this was talking about a junior level interview. But if there's even an intern on the team, I'm expecting them to be able to figure things out much more complicated than reversing an array, and I don't think that's all that crazy to expect them to be able to do. My analogy I used was saying ""you'll never have to reverse an array at your job"" is similar to if a French to English translator was asked to count to 10 in French, couldn't, and angrily replied ""when am I ever going to be counting to 10 in my job?"" And the answer is you'll be asked to do things so much more difficult, and if you can't count to 10 in the language you're translating from obviously you're not going to be able to perform the job duties.As I mentioned, I've never asked this question in an interview, but I'm asking much harder questions. I'm asking our junior level folks to calculate weighted averages excluding outliers and creating summary statistics by year. I'm then changing the requirements and seeing how they can update their code with the shifting requirements. And I don't think those are even all that hard, they're the bare minimum I'd expect interns to be able to do. We care a lot more about soft skills and perceived willingness to learn, but we need you to be able to do the bare minimum from a technical perspective. Do people really think asking a potential employee whether they can reverse an array is that crazy and means we expect them to memorize algorithms that have nothing to do with the job? This isn't an LC hard, I don't think any of my solutions above are all that crazy or tough to come up with if you understand the basics of arrays and loops. And given how business logic works, it's not even that crazy to be a real world example. What if there are certain values in the array that can't be moved due to government regulation or enterprise requirements so you can only reverse all the other elements while keeping certain values in their place? You can't use a reverse function for that. And that's a hell of a lot tougher of a problem than simple reversal.I don't know I guess it just astounds me that this sub is all about how tough this market is especially for juniors, yet at the same time it's crazy to expect a junior can do something that in my mind is super basic and contrary to the arguments against it does not actually require memorizing any algorithms, just using a little bit of critical thinking about what reversing an array actually is doing (first is last, second is second to last, etc).",172,0.92,158,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ph4ux0/array_reversal_as_a_filtering_question/,2025-12-08 05:57:52,2025-12-09 01:44:19

But the deeper I get into web development, the more it feels like I trained for the wrong thing. Most of the actual work I want to do is building interfaces, working with APIs, handling state, understanding UX, and shipping features. Meanwhile I’m watching people who spent a few months in focused online schools get hired into the exact same frontend roles I’ve been aiming for. Meanwhile I keep seeing people who took a focused bootcamp and they’re getting hired into the exact same frontend roles I’m aiming for. It almost feels unfair they learned precisely what the job requires while I spent years grinding through concepts that rarely show up in web dev interviews. CS feels geared toward systems engineering, embedded work, data infra, and theory heavy roles not the stuff that shows up in most frontend job postings. So now I’m stuck wondering if I took this long academic route for something I could’ve learned way faster. Or maybe the CS background does matter long term and I’m just not seeing the payoff yet. If you did a traditional CS degree but ended up in frontend, how did you make sense of this?",98,0.88,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pgxj2s/did_i_waste_4_years_on_a_cs_degree_if_i_just_want/,2025-12-07 23:53:46,2025-12-09 01:44:19

1pegr29,My job-hunting strategy that landed me the offer I wanted,Comet7777,cscareerquestions,"I was coming from a tech leadership role for a handful of years before sort of burning out and deciding to jump at a startup. Same industry that I know, cool new hook and angle, a ""Head of Product"" title and good investors. This company demanded 10-12 hours daily and would rush projects out and I'm just completely allergic to this way of ""working"". Because they're in pacific time and I'm in central, I was working past dinner time and not eating or spending time with my family. So, after 4 months of being here, something I've never done, I decided to look for something better already.I've always been ""good"" at getting new offers if I wanted them, via by networking or other means. I was sort of slapped to reality and humbled when I saw how awful this market actually is. The pain at work, coupled with two early phone screen rejections made me realize I had to change how I was doing this. The tech job market from 2017-2022 was long gone.Here are the tips that ultimately worked for me:1. Reached out to my network and let them know my situation. I received 4 referrals and a handful of informational interviews with folks. I did this via group chats, messaging connections on LinkedIn, college alumni groups I'm a part of.2. I used LinkedIn Premium. Why use this overpriced service? As soon as I have it and I mark myself as actively looking (oh and hide the damn Premium icon from your profile or your employer will find it odd that you have it) - I start getting tons of recruiters hitting me up. 2 of these led to an initial screen.3. Adjusted my title appropriately. I de-leveled my title for certain Senior Product Manager roles. One question I kept getting was why go from leadership/management to a role like this. The real reason was because my current environment is toxic, my title is inflated there, and the money isn't great, and these ""lower title"" roles were paying on par or sometimes higher for significantly less responsibility. A buddy of mine who was a VP had to practice a similar thing in de-leveling his title when he was laid off. You can play around with your title a bit, but I DO NOT recommend leveling up your title when that isn't factual. It'll come out.4. Apply daily to the latest openings, I'll show you how to best do this below.5. Had a single thread with ChatGPT where it knew my resume, my work history, my specific projects, my answers to previous interview and job application questions. This made answering bespoke custom questions on ATSs very quick.6. A benefit/luxury/advantage - I do have a variety of experience as a software engineer, product manager, tech leadership etc. I'm aware that this greatly expedited this whole process and if I was more junior I likely would have struggled significantly more.**Best Places to Apply.** I would open up my computer and had a browser with the following tabs open:1. LinkedIn job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)2. Indeed job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)3. [Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/) search (an AI aggregator that links you directly to company careers postings)4. [Wellfound.com](http://wellfound.com/) search (specifically for start-up hiring)5. Google search with the following:site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com (""Group Product Manager"" OR ""Principal Product Manager"" OR ""Senior Product Manager"" OR ""Director of Product"" OR ""VP of Product"" OR ""Head of Product"") AND ""remote""This will list ALL job postings that match the description of those job titles I was looking for (and remote!) directly against the ATS without having to rely on crappy job aggregators. Now open up a tab and do the same thing but replace site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com with the following ATSs I could find: \- site:jobs.lever.co \- site:boards.greenhouse.io \- site:ashbyhq.comThen on the google results, go to Tools and select last 24 hours.This means I would have 10'ish tabs open each day and do the search at 9am and later around 2-3pm and then apply right away. This search almost always takes you to a new posting, rather than those annoying ghost openings or jobs that get reposted for months. This also takes you directly to the employer's site.**High-level stats:** \- Total Applications - 350+ \- Referrals made on my behalf - 4 (only one led to a phone screen lol) \- Duration - \~2 months \- Companies scheduling phone screen - 9 (2 ghosted, 2 wanted very niche experience) \- Companies moving to hiring manager round - 5 \- Companies moving to second/third+ round - 5 \- Offer - 1, I cancelled the remaining 4 live opportunities upon accepting offerThe offer came from the place I least expected (Wellfound). An application for a hybrid role in NYC (I'm not in NYC, or close to it) led to the CEO directly reaching out to me. I took his call not thinking much of the opportunity since the description didn't have much to go off of. We both had a ton of fun talking and getting a feel for each other. The rest of the interviewing process with that team felt like talking to friends, it was an easy offer to accept.I could go way more in detail about how I prep for interviews, not sure how helpful that would be for people.

1phivgo,"I was laid off back in march, started a business. Now the business makes more than my current compsci employment",jablokojuyagroko,cscareerquestions,"**PSA: Rewritten with AI because im not a native speaker.**I Hit 5 years of frontend experience back in March. I was extremely stressed at my last job — hated every single day of it after getting placed on a new project that was basically a legacy nightmare.After about 3 years there, I started noticing the headcount slowly shrinking. I didn’t worry too much because I thought my role was “safe.” because I was replacing the ones that were fired before me. So I went ahead and got preapproved for a mortgage after saving for 7 years rent was draining me.The *next day* after getting preapproved, i kid you not, I got fired with no notice (along with half my department). Had to cancel the mortgage and lost a big chunk of money in the process. That one hurt.I was so burnt out that I just gave up for a bit. Moved back with my parents (super grateful for them) and did absolutely nothing for a month — just walked around, saw old friends, and tried to enjoy life again (best months of my recent life btw).During that time, I realized my parents’ business basically had no online presence. So I decided to build everything: marketing campaigns, data tracking, an ecommerce extension — the whole deal. Spent about 4 months grinding on that while also doing \~10 interviews (all rejections) as you can see I was not super focused on interviewing, and I was very picky. The business slowly started gaining traction online.Then in month 5, I finally got a job through LinkedIn.Fast forward almost a year: This new job pays 30% more than my old one… but I still hate it because it’s legacy stuff again, and I’m scared to leave because the market is rough. I get *zero* LinkedIn messages and feel like I’m getting rusty since no one uses this old tech anymore. I did an interview once during this period, and I was brutally destroyed since I forgot all the ""modern"" tech.BUT at the same time, the online business I built for my parents is on track this December to make *more* than my “new” job. And now people are hearing about it — I’m currently in talks with my first official non-family client to build a platform for them.What I’m trying to say is: if things aren’t working out, and you know tech, just try stuff. Throw things at the wall until something sticks, then grab that opportunity and build it out. You’ll learn a ton, and you might get lucky. Honestly, at this point I feel like that’s more promising than job hunting. I only landed my current job because of a friend — without that, I’m not sure I’d have gotten hired again.Try everything, especially if you’re in your 20s. Something will eventually stick. I think that being a dev, knowing online Ads and marketing is a superpower, you can market anything.Worst part is: I still have zero stability. I can’t rent or get a mortgage right now, so I’m stuck living with my parents… but at least things are moving somewhere.And at the same time, this month december im on track to make more via this online business that my ""new"" job where im paid 30% more than my old job. And people have started to hear, and im on talks to onboard my first official non family client to build a platform for them.With this I just want to say that if shit aint working for you, you know tech, try stuff, throw shit into the wall until something sticks and grab that shit by the horns and improve it, you will learn a lot, and might get lucky. At this point I think its better than lookign for a job, I got extremely lucky with the search specifically thanks to af riend, otherwise I think i would have never gotten a job againTry evertyhing, specially if you are young (20s) , something will stick, get some bartender job or whatever shit, and try to see what is a pain point they have and solve it with your coding skills. On the worse said, I have 0 stability now, and I cant rent anything, nor get a mortgage because of it so im stuck at my parents.

I see a lot of questions from juniors and graduates about growing their skills, but I would like to know if anyone has screwed up by spending too much time in a job which didn’t grow your skills that much. I worked for almost 8 years at a company where a lot of the work involved knowledge of the internal systems and maintaining them, not really building new stuff. I ended up touching so many parts - old monolith application, data pipelines for etl workloads, cloud application, and heaps of languages: C++, C#, Perl, node, python, golang and more… yet I don’t feel like I’m good enough in any of them. Between the stress of immigration and family problems, I haven’t been putting enough effort to grow my skills and knowledge in the past. This resulted in me being promoted to a senior and performing like one in that company using my knowledge of their software - but having no particular in-demand skills to land another job. In the past few years I have been realising that I do not want this to be my reality. I started learning more about AWS, working on small personal projects, reading books like DDIA and, yes, grinding leetcode to prepare for the interviews. However, my CV remains unimpressive. It was always my dream to get into a FAANG company. I wanted to work with smart people on cool stuff and feel like I’m actually using my brain instead of changing simple queries on a dashboard.

Previously I've only ever worked at one company for about 5 years (joined fresh out of university) which was a software services + a product company (relatively small product, I was involved in making most of it so I knew a LOT about it). Now I'm at this new company. This is a purely product based company. Absolutely massive codebase. I'm supposed to be a senior. I feel like their expectations are too high. In terms of how quickly I get onboarded and start contributing. Maybe not to the code directly but leading the junior devs there as a small team. (But the juniors know wayyy more than me).I can't even understand what the heck is happening in the code. Dozens if not hundreds of projects (.NET). Various front ends, licensing, devops etc. it's extremely overwhelmingly This is worse than imposter syndrome ...How do i tackle this?

But if you check well established fintech companies like Revolut, Wise, N26, Adyen, etc., they all use Java heavily in their backend systems. In fact, most of them built their core services on Java from day one and continue to scale with it.From what I've seen, only a smaller set of newer or niche fintechs actually use Go as their main language for example, Monzo is the standout case here with a Go-based microservices architecture.Go does have strengths: simplicity, concurrency model, and speed for distributed systems. But Java still dominates in fintech due to ecosystem maturity, hiring pool, JVM performance, reliability, and the fact that so many financial institutions already have huge Java ecosystems.So I'm curious:Is Go really the ""future fintech language,"" or is Java still the backbone of the industry and will remain so?If you work in fintech, what language does your company use and why?",38,0.9,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pdo4kh/java_vs_go_for_fintech_which_one_is_actually_more/,2025-12-04 02:28:43,2025-12-09 01:44:19

1pekwov,Am I violently underpaid or am I unrealistic,Organic-Helicopter54,cscareerquestions,"Hey yall, as end of year reviews come out and as my company hits raise and bonus time of year, I am curious if I am really underpaid, or if I am paid fairly and have unrealistic expectations. I work for a non tech, semi small (around 100 employees) company, that has some pretty big clients. **I currently make 39k a year,** I am going on almost 2 years here and I have not received a raise yet. We work mostly in C# and .net, but have been making some pushes into some python development (more on this). personally I work on a wide range of applications, both client facing and internal. I am remote but company is located in Southern U.S. Since we are a smaller dev team, I have alot of responsibilities that I feel like *most* jr. devs don't have, but I could be wrong. Some of the things I do outside of programming are1. Meeting directly with Clients to scaffold out and discuss task, creating them in Jira, developing the solution, presenting and then directly receiving feedback on the solution (along with the PM and sr. dev) 2. Having a heavy involvement in AWS migration, being the one creating proof of concepts for utilizing alot of different AWS micro services (e.g. currently working on lambda function that work with our applications) 3. Creating internal and client facing documentation and sop's for applications, work flows, and pipelinesI had a rocky start during my first 6 months, but improved alot and got an -A in my end of year review, as compared to a -B one my first.But there are some caveats that I think are important1. I am ""Full-time"" w/ benefits but contracted at 32 hours a week. This because I am also a full time student at a university. They work around my class schedule, but I try my best to make my classes compliment the work day. I would be willing to move to 40 hours a week2. I am also part time Military, I know that they can't hold this against me, but during my first 6 months at this company, I spent probably about 4 of Military service, which could have slowed my progression either way. They also let me work reduced hours while I am fulfilling military commitments and pay me as usual (I can't really afford not to)3. I am sometimes a mediocre developer, however, past work experience makes my true strength my soft skills. I am applauded for how I carry myself in meetings and presentations with clients. So, after all that, I am as underpaid as I think I am? I went into software development for financial stability for my family (I do have children), but I am kind of at a loss. I don't really want to start looking for other jobs, because I am unsure if they would work with my school schedule and be as flexible as this place. I also love the team and the work life balance is pretty good. Is thinking I should at least be around 70-80k unrealistic? I have brought up getting a raise before, but there really hasn't been an actual conversation about it. How do I engage in negotiation? What do yall think is acceptable pay? I think that's everything, thanks guys! **TLDR;** Junior Software dev making production level code being paid 39k, often works directly with clients and new technologies, such as AWS during a huge migration. Am I super underpaid? If I am, what should I ask for and how should I broach that subject",35,0.78,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pekwov/am_i_violently_underpaid_or_am_i_unrealistic/,2025-12-05 03:44:24,2025-12-09 01:44:19

When I later asked my recruiter about return offers and the evaluation process, she mentioned that my manager already discussed my evaluation with me, and that feedback is shared across teams (I was potentially interested in switching teams if I returned). I know it's my fault for not clarifying, but I didn't want to probe further, as it felt like I was only getting vague answers.

1pe15vu,Severe work anxiety and I think it’s affecting my ability to actually be productive,cs_____question1031,cscareerquestions,"So I worked three excessively shitty jobs in a rowFirst was (Forest in Brazil). I found my manager nearly impossible to communicate with, we just did things so differently. My mentor was excessively aggressive, I legit thought he had some sort of personality disorder. I remember in my first week, I asked maybe 3 questions, common ones like where to find certain resources. Each time my mentor would simply send me a link, and on the third one, he made a remark about how I’m asking too many questions. So, I took the hint and didn’t ask questions unless it was absolutely necessary. Then they started complaining I wasn’t asking _enough_ questions. I was so lost. Then I was assigned a job with another new hire and she faced the same problem, told she asks too much questions then when she stopped. They said that she “just went off and did her own thing”. I kinda felt like I was missing something — isn’t the obvious reaction to “you’re asking too many questions” to… ask fewer questions? Obviously it was more than just this, but it’s an example of how communication was very hostile. I just kept a low profile as much as possible. I ended up quitting, but I definitely think something lingered hereNext job was a weirdly incompetent AI company. Management expected ~30 tickets to be completed per week, and those tickets were usually big ones. For context, they expected something similar to ChatGPT to be built in 2 weeks by 2 engineers with 0 bugs. I was let go from here. I asked why, and they seemed to say I should be available 24/7 and I wasn’t (I explicitly said I can’t be contacted 6-8pm because I help at a Muay Thai gym and you can’t have a computer/phone on you while holding pads obviously)Next job started great. I was cautiously optimistic. Around 6 months in, I started to relax and take a deep breath. Then… they hired a new manager. I could not understand for the life of me what this manager was talking about. I thought I was losing my mind a little, honestly. She would constantly say these bromides like “act more like a senior engineer”. If I asked where I was falling short of being a “senior engineer” or what goals I should have, she said it’s not her job to tell me that, nor is it her job to give me work to do. I’d have to fight for hours to figure out what I should be working on. She was just an odd person. I remember she had an exercise where she _insisted_ that everyone eats peanut butter sandwiches. I don’t and never have. I thought this was some sort of weird test, because she was so insistent that everyone does this. I could tell I was being intentionally sabotaged by her, as she would block PRs with frankly obviously stupid and unproductive commentsNow I’m starting a new job and I feel extremely intense anxiety about… everything. Although I’m a frontend engineer, this job has asked me to get up to date on ruby. I’ve never written ruby before. It’s not that I can’t learn it, but it causes me such deep anxiety to feel like I’m asking “stupid” questions. I asked one stupid question and I lost a whole night of sleep over the anxiety of thinking that I’m gonna get fired and start this cycle againIs there anything I can do? I’ve hired a therapist and everything but she mostly says “you should take it easy and be in the present” but that’s easier said than done.

1pdlfpw,Is it worth it pursue a Masters of Engineering in CS?,williamfartsabomb,cscareerquestions,"Hello!I’m currently a conflicted whether or not to pursue a Masters of Engineering in CS at my undergrad (T10). I’m currently expected to graduate with my bachelors in CS in May 2026 but would be able to complete this masters within one semester so I would be able to graduate December 2026. I do have a full-time role in SWE lined up to start in the summer at a small tech company (TC 115k) from my previous summer internship. If I do pursue a Masters, I would likely need to ask the company to convert my full-time offer into an internship for this summer and then delay or risk my full-time offer. I am also considered doing light recruiting for internships regardless if I do do the Master’s. Given all that, would pursuing the extra master’s be worth it?

It inevitably always leads to them talking about AI, how it's the future, and half of the time, their genius idea to build a chatbot/ AI wrapper for .My response is always the same. AI in its current state is cool and useful, but has limitations. We shouldn't expect massive improvements (like AGI) in a short time period, and we shouldn't use AI for every use-case. In most cases, it's better to create a deterministic system instead.Almost every time, I get a mixture of the following:1. But all of these people are saying that AI is the future! (Most of ""those people"" being tech CEOs with a vested interest in selling shovels in the gold rush, and the bandwagoners who follow them).2. But AI is improving so rapidly! (Ignoring the exponential costs of improvement and that improvement is not a foregone conclusion).3. But AI can create a website/ pitch deck/ ! (Missing the fact that these things were always easy, and the value is in creating/ executing the hard things that haven't been built yet).

I was at a state I lost my drive to get to senior and while my skills did grow, I also didn't see a path to senior from it nor did I want to take the extra effort to go to senior. I made a post about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwef8o/anyone\_lose\_their\_drive\_after\_reaching\_mid\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwef8o/anyone_lose_their_drive_after_reaching_mid_level/) Recently I changed teams (literally a week after that post) since an interesting initiative came out and they wanted internal transfers since ramp up time would be faster. It's only been 2+ months or so since then but wow I am seeing a path to senior again and even possibly beyond. My skills have grown tremendously especially as I had to learn a lot of new things, there is immense pressure as the higher ups are taking a much closer look at our team's projects initiatives and I'm communicating with directors in some circumstances despite being just a mid level dev. There's a few cons like tighter deadlines and definitely feeling resource constrained headcount wise and doing much more of some things that I didn't like or were uncomfortable for me in my last role but it's been... fun again. I can see much greater impact (that affects multiple orgs and business units) compared to my last role too. Financial impact of my last role was maybe 50M max and direct impact was much less. Current role had that much in just a single project. The role's importance also makes me feel a lot more secure in it and I'm less scared of being laid off which has been great for my mental health especially as I see other companies laying off people.For my resume, I had maybe 2-3 nice bullet points/stories I could get from my last role. I've gotten that in the last month and I'm pretty sure they sound better and are better stories to tell on interviews.This make me think of how much growth I would have had if I had been in a similar team/role 1-2 years earlier and this isn't even considering how much more visibility I have now. I think I can get promoted in 6 months if I really go for it or a year if I take a bit more time to take things chiller just because of being ""forged"" in this fire that I'll develop senior skills without even really trying...

1pd6w9o,Feeling Completely Stuck in My Career at 26 - Need Honest Advice,Excellent_Beach_9179,cscareerquestions,"This post may be long, but I want to be completely honest so I can get real guidance.I completed my BCA in 2021 and started my career at Cognizant as a Programmer Trainee. I worked there for about 1.1 years, but I left because the project felt dull and I thought I could do better. Looking back now, resigning without a backup was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made.After that, I joined Amazon as an SPS Associate. The work was mostly repetitive support tasks - more like a BPO setup. There was no real growth, and I thought I should get back into a proper IT role while I was still young. So I left Amazon too.To rebuild myself, I joined a 9-month Data Analyst bootcamp. I genuinely put effort into it - completed all modules, built projects, created a portfolio website, made proper LinkedIn project presentation, customized my resume as per each JD, and applied mainly through official career sites. My ATS score was almost always above 95%.Despite all that, I wasn’t able to secure even a single interview. Not one. I applied to more than 2000 jobs. Each rejection hit me harder, and eventually I completely burned out. I stopped studying, started escaping into video games and alcohol, and mentally I was in a very dark place. Every day felt heavier than the last.It’s been around 5-6 months since I stopped my job search. Now I’m sitting with:an almost 1.8-year career gap, no savings, no sense of direction and a lot of self-doubt.My parents are supportive and even willing to invest in further studies if needed. But at this point, I don’t have the courage to spend more money on courses that may or may not lead to anything. The job market feels extremely dry, and I’m scared of making another wrong move.The only safe option I can think of is going back to the BPO world - but then I wonder why I even left a good WFH Amazon job if I have to end up in the same place again. It makes me feel like I’ve messed everything up.Right now, I’m not even fixated on IT. I just want a career with real growth, not something where even after 10-15 years the salary barely crosses 50k. I’m willing to put in 3-5 months of focused effort to learn something valuable but I don’t want to end up in another dead-end situation.If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has genuine advice on what direction I should take next, I would be truly grateful.

A lot of the tools we write are based on other internal tools from other teams that we have to add automation and scalability, basically making it so developers (our customers) don't have to think about how and where this tool is running and testing their code.

They gave us a pip package that makes the most insane assumptions. It assumes that the package is being a run on a machine with a mount to the company wide NFS. This NFS is the most dogshit piece of bullshit to ever exist. It works. It works great. And what that means is that you have thousands of devs just throwing files and scripts in places, and assuming that other scripts exist. And the dependencies chain down, so every thing is tied to everything else. And their pip package needs to be run there. Even worse, one of their scripts that they call from inside their package starts with "" #!/usr/bin/python3.7"" (we are using python 3.13) and assumes that there are certain packages installed in that environment. Now we have been trying to unplug from all this bullshit, but the amount of crappy design and dev culture is just driving me insane.

After a short HR call, one company sent over a take home assignment, which includes:* CRUD REST API (Spring Boot + MySQL) with 5 endpoints, using interfaces generated by a provided OpenAPI spec* Unit tests for components + integration tests for endpoints* Docker setup for MySQL + app* [`run.sh`](http://run.sh) script for one-command startup* Github Actions pipeline with automated testing, build and containerization* Postman collection to test APIs* Documentation for design + running instructions* (Bonus) Observability with OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + GrafanaI'm expected to use AI tools to complete it. I'm not familiar with Java but I've used most of the tools here except the observability stack, and I think it'd take a couple of days because of debugging/orchestrating stuff + not being super familiar with writing CI/CD or Docker scripts. However, I don't use AI to directly write my code (ie Cursor/Claude Code), but mostly to help build small pieces or debug more difficult issues.

I spent the last 2 years there, and it was pretty chill and everyday was almost the same, I already knew what to do and all the processes.I wanted to a switch to my career into something more ""exciting"" with a modern stack. So, I got an offer from a startup, and I've been working here for the last 6 weeks. It's all what I wanted to work with but I'm starting to feel frustrated and I don't know if I'm the problem or if it's the place. There is a new project, that's supposed I'm going to be in charge on the implementation. Deadline for BackEnd is end February and I've started to work on the project on my third week here, even before the product team defined the scope of v1. This was because it was too much and we couldn't wait until the product team finishes approving the scope of v1 to start to work.Once the v1 was approved, I had to come back and change things, because I started to work based on assumptions of my manager and not on what's required. Now the problem is that I feel that I keep working based on assumptions. I spend 3 days working on a module, to find in the next meeting that certain part of it, comes from a another service, or certain information hasn't have to be stored because another service already have it. My manager told me that is expected that I handle all the implementation by myself but I don't feel I have the enough context to do it.So I'm starting to feel frustrated because there are things that I don't know how they expect that I should know being here only for 6 weeks without having the context of the whole backend and micro services we already have. Each time I start to work on something it's just to hear in the next meeting that I did it wrong because I didn't know it has to be done in a different way because X service.I just needed to vent, and know if you've had similar experiences and what should I do in this situation?

1pgn0qh,"Should I start a PhD in Math/ML at 29 to move into industry research, or is it a mistake leaving my stable but unsatisfying job?",ThomasHawl,cscareerquestions,"I’m 28 (almost 29) and I’m really stressed about a major career decision.I have a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics (not specifically applied to CS/ML). Right now I’m working (mostly out of necessity) as an embedded software engineer in the defense sector, in a European country where opportunities in “real” ML/DL research are extremely limited. Roles that are actually about experimenting with models, doing research, or contributing to novel ML ideas basically don’t exist here.Moving abroad seems like the only long-term way to pivot, but ML research roles are very competitive, and junior candidates with experience in unrelated fields are usually not considered. So at the moment I’m stuck in a stable career path (that I actively dislike) that could eventually take me to Northern Europe (Germany, Netherlands, etc.), or even US… but it’s absolutely not the work I want to do.My dream since finishing my Master’s two years ago has been to work in ML/DL research, not MLOps, not ML engineering, but actually creating and experimenting with models in an industrial research setting. I’ve applied to positions like this several times but never got traction.To be totally honest, the “dream dream” would be to work in a place like DeepMind, Meta FAIR, or similar labs. I know that’s extremely unrealistic, but they represent the type of work I want to do: pushing boundaries, experimenting, publishing internally, working on genuinely interesting problems. Every time I scroll LinkedIn and find a job that makes me think “wow, that’s exactly the kind of work I want to do”, it always requires a PhD (or a Master’s plus strong industry research experience). My current job can’t give me that experience at all.A PhD would also be an opportunity to build a stronger CV. I’ve basically only studied in my home country, never had any real abroad experience, and I didn’t do internships during my studies. Through the PhD I could finally have international experience and potentially do industry internships abroad, which is something my current career path will never allow.Of course I want to earn more money in the future, who doesn’t. But the main thing for me is that I really value what I do, at least at this stage of my life. And given how low salaries are in my home country, I don’t think doing a PhD would make me “poorer” long-term.My real concern is whether there is a better path that aligns with both:\--“I want to work on something genuinely cool and intellectually challenging” \--“I want to earn above-average in the long term.”Right now, a PhD seems like the best path for someone with my background and goals, but I’m very open to hearing other perspectives.Now a new opportunity appeared: a PhD abroad at a top-20 university (non-US), fully founded (the stipend is not amazing, but I will not starve, I will finish debt-free, and I am ok with making some sacrifices, the financial aspect is not the thing that will make me go/not go), strongly research-oriented, in mathematics/ML. The topic, the PI, and the school all seem very good, and I would try to push my work toward something more practical/ML-applied if possible, but I really enjoy the math.My concern is not “I don’t know if I’ll like the PhD.” I genuinely think I will. My concern is entirely about what happens after.Here are the fears that are keeping me up at night:1) I’m already 28. I’ll finish the PhD at 32/33. I do not want to do a postdoc (at least for now), and I am not interested in academia in the long run. My goal is to get into industry research (research scientist, ML researcher, quant researcher, etc.). But I’m scared companies will ignore someone who is older, with no prior industry ML experience.2) I’m afraid that the PhD will not actually help me get into ML research roles, and I’ll end up “overqualified and under-experienced”. Maybe the PhD will end up being too theoretical and not give me the applied experience, internships of portfolio needed for industry research roles.3) I currently work in a sector and tech stack completely unrelated to ML. I worry that this PhD is my only path out, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll be worse off than now, older, with no experience, and back at square 0.4) As an alternative to the PhD: would it make more sense to switch into something like data analyst / BI, get into a data-adjacent field, and then “climb up” from there toward ML? Is this realistic, or basically impossible? On the other hand, staying where I am means staying in a field I do not like, with technologies extremely far from ML, and with no realistic opportunities to pivot, and with a career path that I do not like.If anyone has seen similar transitions, or has experience hiring PhDs into ML/AI research roles, I would really appreciate your thoughts. I’m stuck between choosing stability in a field I don’t like, or taking a big risk that may not pay off, and I don’t want to make a life-altering mistake at 29.",3,0.6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pgn0qh/should_i_start_a_phd_in_mathml_at_29_to_move_into/,2025-12-07 16:47:56,2025-12-09 01:44:19
1pg6epg,Can't Decide Between Two Offers.,FK29,cscareerquestions,"Hi, I'm currently a CS student in the U.S set to graduate in a few weeks. Throughout my job search, I was lucky enough to land two offers: 1.) Junior C#/.NET developer for a national bank working on internal software for the company. 2.) Junior Android developer working on an in-vehicle infotainment system. The second offer is coming from a company not based in the U.S but who has a small (<50 people) North American branch they are trying to build up.The pay for the .NET role was higher at first but the Android position has offered to match the rate.Both would be on a contract-to-hire of 6 months and 9 months respectively. The .NET role is 4 days in-person and 1 day remote. The Android role is fully in person.My only consideration is which will bring me closer to my ultimate goal of working as low-level developer working with C++ or adjacent languages. Operating Systems, Game Engines, and Computer Graphics being three areas I am super interested in.The android position might have some embedded programming but it would be for debugging purposes only. It's also not guaranteed. For the most part, I can expect to be working in Java and Kotlin.With the .NET role, it is technically fullstack as I will be expected to work (minimally) on the front-end, I'd also be dealing with a lot of SQL.

Which path is better long term,Ok-Zookeepergame-401,cscareerquestions,"I’m choosing between two roles and want some perspective from people who have actually worked in these fields.One offer is an SRE position. The other is a Security Engineer role. Both companies seem strong, but the work and long term trajectories look very different.On the SRE side, the work is focused on cloud engineering, observability, automation, CI CD, Kubernetes, and reliability. It feels very hands on and technical. A lot of people say SRE experience opens doors at big tech later because it shows you can handle scale and complex systems.On the Security Engineering side, the work is more about hardening, IAM, vulnerability management, detection logic, cloud security, and defense. It feels more structured and predictable. It also seems like a path that can lead to architect level security roles or broader cloud security positions.For people who have been in either role, I’d really appreciate your insight on a few things:• Which role grows your skills faster• Which path tends to pay more over time• Which one provides better job security• Which is more stressful day to day• Which one is easier to move from into big tech• If you switched between these fields, what made you changeAny honest advice from people who have done SRE or security engineering would help a lot.
