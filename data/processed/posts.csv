1q37mpm,Again - Take home assignment,Limp-Complaint5817,dataengineering,"I am a senior engineer, and although this has been discussed before, I experienced it again recently. I was asked to prepare a presentation for a panel with only two days’ notice. I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.Unfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.I was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources.

1q22shj,What does an ideal data modeling practice look like? Especially with an ML focus.,Capable_Mastodon_867,dataengineering,"I was reading through Kimballs warehouse toolkit, and it gives this beautiful picture of a central collection of conformed dimensional models that represent the company as a whole. I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.I'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like ""how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?"" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. The idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.On the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.In the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.There seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",47,0.93,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q22shj/what_does_an_ideal_data_modeling_practice_look/,2026-01-02 16:17:12,2026-01-06 01:50:11

1q1ddky,Non technical boss is confusing me,Huxley_The_Third,dataengineering,"I’m the only developer at my company. I work on a variety of things, but my primary role is building an internal platform that’s being used by our clients. One of the platform’s main functionalities is ingesting analytics data from multiple external sources (basic data like clicks, conversions, warnings data grouped by day), though analytics is not its sole purpose and there are a bunch of other features. At some point , my boss decides he wants to “centralize the company data” and hires some agency out of the blue. They drafted up an outline of their plan, which involved setting up a separate database with a medallion architecture. They then requested that I show them how the APIs we’re pulling data from work, and a week later, they request that I help them pull the analytics from the existing db. they never acknowledged any of the solutions i provided for either of those things nor did they explain the Point of those 2 conflicting ideas. So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again, (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of)",29,0.82,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1ddky/non_technical_boss_is_confusing_me/,2026-01-01 19:56:47,2026-01-06 01:50:11
1q4135w,Slapping a vendor's brand on hosted duckdb,SmallAd3697,dataengineering,"Many of the big data vendors will reuse open source components like python, spark, airflow, postgres, and deltalake. They rebrand it, and host it in their SaaS, and call it ""managed"" and/or ""easy"". They also charge customers 50% more than if the same software were to be hosted on kubernetes or IaaS.I keep thinking that one of these vendors (perhaps databricks first) would develop a managed version of duckdb. It would almost be a no-brainer, since the software is massively useful but is still not widely adopted.Why hasn't this happened yet? Are there licensing restrictions that I'm overlooking?

Is the decision driven by regulatory requirements, analytical value, storage cost, or just gut feel?

If you're using dbt, OpenAPI, GraphQL, or Kafka, it helps coordinate schema changes between producers and consumers.The problem it solves: data teams break each other's stuff all the time because there's no good way to track who depends on what. You change a column, someone's dashboard breaks, nobody knows until it's too late. The same happens with APIs as well. Tessera sits in the middle and makes producers acknowledge breaking changes before they publish. Consumers register their dependencies, get notifications when things change, and can block breaking changes until they're ready.It's open source, MIT licensed, built with Python/FastAPI.

Please be aware of:* merge() is not implemented in this version* DuckDB doesn’t allow mixed types like Pandas does, so you may need to clean messy CSVs before using them.* Currently optimized for reading and analyzing.

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.The idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.I hope some of y'all find it useful.GitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",8,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q0t1zj/graphqlite_graph_database_capabilities_inside/,2026-01-01 01:58:27,2026-01-06 01:50:11

1q036wk,No Data Cleaning,Professional_Peak983,dataengineering,"Hi, just looking for different opinions and perspectives hereI recently joined a company with a medallion architecture but where there is no “data cleansing” layer. The only type of cleaning being done is some deduplication logic (very manual) and some type casting. This means a lot of the data that goes into reports and downstream products aren’t uniform and must be fixed/transformed at the report level.All these tiny problems are handled in scripts when new tables are created in silver or gold layers. So the scripts can get very long, complex, and contain duplicate logic.So..\- at what point do you see it necessary to actually do data cleaning? In my opinion it should already be implemented but I want to hear other perspectives.\- what kind of “cleaning” do you deem absolutely necessary/bare minimum for most use cases?\- i understand and completely onboard with the thought of “don’t fix it if it’s not broken” but when does it reach a breaking point?\- in your opinion, what part of this is up to the data engineer to decide vs. analysts?We are using spark and delta lake to store data.Edit: clarified question 3",5,0.86,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q036wk/no_data_cleaning/,2025-12-31 03:58:38,2026-01-06 01:50:11

1q1fj70,Show r/dataengineering: Orchestera Platform – Run Spark on Kubernetes in your own AWS account with no compute markup,iamspoilt,dataengineering,"First of all, Happy New Year 2026!Hi folks, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and a fellow Data Infrastructure Engineer. I have been working as a Software Engineer for 8+ years now and have been entirely focused on the data infra side of the world for the past few years with a fair share of working with Apache Spark.I have realized that it's very difficult to manage Spark infrastructure on your own using commodity cloud hardware and Kubernetes, and this is one of the prime reasons why users opt-in for offerings such as EMR and Databricks. However, I have personally seen that as companies grow larger, these offerings start to show their limitations (at least in the case of EMR from my personal experience). Besides that, these offerings also charge a premium on compute on top of the charges for using commodity cloud.For a quick comparison, here is the difference in pricing for AWS c8g.24xlarge and c8g.48xlarge instances if you were to run these for an entire month, showing the 25% EMR premium on your total EC2 bill.**Table 1: Single Instance (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$2,794.79|$3,493.49|$698.70||c8g.48xlarge|$5,589.58|$6,986.98|$1,397.40|**Table 2: 50 Instances (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$139,740|$174,675|$34,935||c8g.48xlarge|$279,479|$349,349|$69,870|In light of this, I started working on a platform that allows you to orchestrate Spark clusters on Kubernetes in your own AWS account - with no additional compute markup. The platform is geared towards Data Engineers (Product Data Engineers as I like to call them) who mainly write and maintain ETL and ELT workloads, not manage the Data Infrastcructure needed to support these workloads.Today, I am finally able to share what I have been building: [Orchestera Platform](https://orchestera.com/)Here are some of the salient features of the platform:* Setup and teardown an entire EKS-based Spark cluster in your own AWS account with absolutely no upfront expertise required in Kubernetes* Cluster is configured for reactive auto-scaling based on your workloads: * Automatically scales up to the right number of EC2 instances based on your Spark driver and executor configuration * Automatically scales down to 0 once your workloads complete* Simple integration with AWS services such as S3 and RDS* Simple integration with Iceberg tables on S3. AWS Glue Catalog integration coming soon.* Full support for iterating on Spark pipelines using Jupyter notebooks* Currently only supports AWS Cloud and the us-east-1 regionYou can see some demo examples here:* [Developing Spark applications using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/)* [Using Iceberg tables with Spark](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/iceberg-hello-world/)If you are an AWS user or considering using it for Spark, I would request you to please try this out. No credit card required for using the personal workspace. Also offering 6 months of premium access for serious users in this subreddit.Also very interested to hear from this community and looking for some early feedback.I have aslo written [documentation](https://docs.orchestera.com/) (under active development) to give users a head start in setting up their accounts, orchesterating a new Spark cluster and writing data pipelines.If you want to chat more about this new platform, please come and join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9TXybZcd).",2,0.55,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1fj70/show_rdataengineering_orchestera_platform_run/,2026-01-01 21:23:50,2026-01-06 01:50:11

1pzr3b9,Snowflake to Azure SQL via ADF - too slow,vermillion-23,dataengineering,"Greetings, data engineers & tinkerersAzure help needed here..I've got a metadata-driven ETL pipeline in ADF loading around 60 tables, roughly 150mil rows per day from 3rd party Snowflake instance (pre-defined view as source query). The Snowflake connector for ADF requires staging in Blob storage first.Now, why is it so underwhelmingly slow to write into Azure SQL? This first ETL step ingestion takes nearly 3 hours overnight, just writing it all into SQL bronze tables.Snowflake-Blob step takes about 10% of the runtime, ignoring the queue time, the copy activity from staged Blob to SQL is the killer.I've played around with parallel copies, DIUs, concurrency on the ForEach loop - virtually zero improvement.On the other hand, it's easily writing +10mil rows in a few minutes from Parquet, but this Blob to SQL bit is killing my ETL schedule and makes me feel like a boiling frog, seeing the runtime creep up each day without a plan to fix.Any ideas from you good folks on how to check where the bottleneck lies?

1pzdizd,Stream Huge Datasets,Suspicious-Pick-7961,dataengineering,"Greetings. I am trying to train an OCR system on huge datasets, namely:* [OCR Cyrillic Printed 1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DonkeySmall/OCR-Cyrillic-Printed-1)* [Synthetic Cyrillic Large](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pumb-ai/synthetic-cyrillic-large)* [Cyrillic Handwriting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/cyrillic-handwriting-dataset)They contain millions of images, and are all in different formats - `WebDataset`, `zip` with folders, etc. I will be experimenting with different hyperparameters locally on my M2 Mac, and then training on a [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai) server. The thing is, I don't have enough space to fit even one of these datasets at a time on my personal laptop, and I don't want to use permanent storage on the server. The reason is that I want to rent the server for as short of a time as possible. If I have to instantiate server instances multiple times (e.g. in case of starting all over), I will waste several hours every time to download the datasets. Therefore, I think that streaming the datasets is a flexible option that would solve my problems both locally on my laptop, and on the server. However, two of the datasets are available on Hugging Face, and one - only on Kaggle, where I can't stream it from. Furthermore, I expect to hit rate limits when streaming the datasets from Hugging Face. Having said all of this, I consider just uploading the data to Google Cloud Buckets, and use the `Google Cloud Connector for PyTorch` to efficiently stream the datasets. This way I get a dataset-agnostic way of streaming the data. The interface directly inherits from PyTorch `Dataset`: from dataflux_pytorch import dataflux_iterable_dataset PREFIX = ""simple-demo-dataset"" iterable_dataset = dataflux_iterable_dataset.DataFluxIterableDataset( project_name=PROJECT_ID, bucket_name=BUCKET_NAME, config=dataflux_mapstyle_dataset.Config(prefix=PREFIX) )>The `iterable_dataset` now represents an iterable over data samples.I have two questions: 1. Are my assumptions correct and is it worth uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets (assuming I pick locations close to my working location and my server location, enable hierarchical storage, use prefixes, etc.). Or I should just stream the Hugging Face datasets, download the Kaggle dataset, and call it a day? 2. If uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets is worth it, how do I store the datasets to GCP Buckets in the first place?

1pzkrx1,Tagging data (different file types and directories) for Windows,Aeriessy,dataengineering,"I've pursued this line of research for years now, often coming to resources that don't fit what I'm looking for (like TagSpaces didn't handle terabytes of media files well). I'm a data hoarder/enthusiast looking for a system to tag a variety of file types and directories in Windows (I'm not opposed to learning a different OS). The default ""Properties"" (for the NTFS ?) are easiest to search, but you can't tag all file types or directories.I use XYPlorer as my file explorer and I like it as a general file browser. I liked the flexibility of the tags, but didn't like how running a script in Command Line to bulk rename hundreds of image files would break the tag link since the tags are all recorded in a tag.dat file (which I'm not opposed to writing something to also change it in there, but I also didn't think it was a very flexible tag data storage method. I'm gathering people's experiences in hopes of finding something I can invest time into when it comes to tagging my media and being able to access it. Things I'm looking for:1. Ease of access (I figure I can write a script to handle the tag hierarchy and categories as needed)2. Tag flexibility (like bulk renaming a tag)3. Ease of tag-ability (while I liked Adobe Bridge to edit tags, it didn't flow the best for me)4. Data versatility (if I can access the data for different visuals at some point or export it into an Excel format)5. Kind of an extra would be doing the opposite of point 4 (adding tags from an Excel spreadsheet)Questions I have:1. Is it more efficient for my uses for tags to be in one main file (like how XYPlorer stores it's tags) or sidecar files (which I liked the concept, but not how TagSpaces did it, and I'm worried about a search function scouring all the sidecar files)?2. Are there other solutions that exist now that I haven't experienced?My solution that stands now is to figure out the way XYPlorer can natively batch rename files and just go with all tags being in the plain text file.

I’ve already applied to several companies for DE positions, but I’m unsure whether my current profile aligns well with what companies typically expect at the entry or junior level.I have hands-on experience using Python, SQL, Qdrant, Dataiku, LangChain, LangGraph.I’ve participated in launching a production-level chatbot service, where I worked on data pipelines and automation around AI workflows. One of my main concerns is that while I understand PySpark, Hadoop, and big data concepts at a theoretical level, I haven’t yet used them extensively in a real production environment. I’m actively studying and practicing them on my own, but I’m unsure how realistic it is to land a DE role in Germany without prior professional experience using these tools.# Additionally, I’m not sure how relevant this is in Germany, but, I graduated top of my class from a top university in my home country and I previously worked as an AI problem solver intern (3 months) at an MBB consulting firm.Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

I build production-level automation systems using Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Prefect, and LangChain. Think long-running workflows, orchestration, state, retries, idempotency, failure recovery, data pipelines, ETL-ish stuff, and AI steps inside real backend systems. (what people call ""AI Automation"" & ""AI Agents"")The problem is: whenever I search for AI Automation Engineer, I mostly find people doing no-code / low-code stuff with Make, n8n, Zapier...etc. That’s not bad work, but it’s not what I do or want to be associated with. I’m not selling automations to small businesses; I’m trying to work on enterprise / production-grade systems.When I search for Data Engineer, I mostly see analytics, SQL-heavy roles, or content about dashboards and warehouses. When I search for Automation Engineer, I get QA and testing people. When I search for workflow orchestration, ETL, data pipelines, or even agentic AI, I still end up in the same no-code hype circle somehow.I know people like me exist, because I see them in GitHub issues, Prefect/Airflow discussions. But on X and LinkedIn, I can’t figure out how to consistently find and follow them, or how to get into the same conversations they’re having.So my question is:\- What do people in this space actually call themselves online?\- What keywords do you use to find high-code, production-level automation/orchestration /workflow engineers, not no-code creators or AI hype accounts?\- Where do these people actually hang out (X, LinkedIn, GitHub)?\- How exactly can I find them on X and LI?Right now it feels like my work sits between “data engineering”, “backend engineering”, and “AI”, but none of those labels cleanly point to the same crowd I’m trying to learn from and engage with.If you’re doing similar work, how did you find your circle?P.S: I came from a background where I was creating AI Automation systems using those no-code/low-code tools, then I shifted to do more complex things with ""high-code"", but still the same concepts apply",0,0.31,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q13sez/as_a_developer_where_can_i_find_my_people/,2026-01-01 13:06:04,2026-01-06 01:50:11

It seems like an easy solution but I think that's a very powerful one, since I'm the only one that understand my tables and the business have certain rules about calculating KPIs that needs to be the same all the time, this seems to be the perfect bridge between the two.Also, you can create multiple mcp servers fast for multiple people and know that it would work for sure.What do you think of this tool ?

1q1d18k,How do you stop the urge to _completely_ understand things?,Andrew_7032,learnprogramming,"Most of us growing up in school have learned everything in a sequence. Heck, even everything in life almost follows a sequence. A year starts with day 1 until it hits day 365; a book starts with chapter 1 until it reaches the ending chapter. Almost everything has a sequence. Programming does not have that; you have to have the ability to learn things out of sequence. You can't wait until you have the entirety of JS learned before you move on to something like React. Heck, you will probably never get there in a lifetime, as there will be new additions to the language and deprecations. I have a degree, I have been self-studying, and I am still unemployed. When I start learning a library, it is hard to sort of know what to pick up and then move on and hit the library only when you need it again.This is a barrier, or at least one of the barriers that makes programming a high-paying job. We need to have a different kind of approach to learning to code. I have been trying to adapt my brain's wiring so that I only learn what is important and move on.

1q49n8x,"Any good online courses or books for learning Assembly with zero CS background? x86-64, MIPS, or Z80.",danimalforlife,learnprogramming,"Yes, I know, Assembly isn't used much these days outside of a few cases and reverse engineering, probably easier to learn C or Python, etc. But I want to learn ASM because I've always been intrigued and for some of the stuff I want to do, I need to know how to read it.**Edit:** My goals are to be able to read assembly so I can disassemble, reverse engineer, or edit some games. The Playstation 1 and 2 use MIPS architecture, the Gameboy and GBC use z80, and most modern applications and games use x86-64, which is why I'm torn between the three.I don't have a computer science background and my career isn't anything close to CS unless you count working in excel. I also don't anticipate switching careers. This is purely something I want to do in mh free tkme. I understand basic computer concepts but don't know how to code or program. I've made a few game mods, I can look at code and change a thing or two, and I can locate some stuff in memory to freeze or edit via emulator or CE, but that's probably as close as I've gotten. Anyways, I am wondering if there are any great online courses or books I can follow that are good for people with little to no CS background? I'm torn between x86, MIPS, or z80, but leaning towards x86 since it seems more comprehensive and I would think going from CISC to RISC would be easier than the inverse. I rented the book *Assembly X64 Programming in Easy Steps: Modern Coding for MASM, SSE and AVX* from my library since that was all they had.

1q44o2d,Do i actually like Programming / PC's or is it because of uni?,BrosVGK,learnprogramming,"so for context, when i was in first/second year of middle school, i meet some people who were good with pc's / know how to program. I talked to them a bit about it and it managed to get me into programming and learning about pc's and on and off for a few years, i would try and learn C# because i was curious to try and learn how to make a game, and i was into pc's because i wanted to know how pc's work (hardware wise, not software). Fastforward to graduating high school recently (i graduated in june). When it was time for me to pick my future career i decided i wanted to go to computer science (a bit off topic but i was also into music, specifically playing the guitar and wanting to learn about music theory, and i like to learn to draw) and even though i was into those other hobbies, i picked computer science because i thought i could make some decent money from it, however thats when things went down the hill. When i first started, things weren't too hard, i managed to understand some early stuff. I was learning C++ and general computer theory, and when it came to computer theory i was good at it, because in my mind it was easy. Then when November / December came, everything just didnt make sense. I couldnt even pay attention in classes because i just couldnt understand it and when i try and learning it on my own i still couldnt get it. It got pretty bad because i would cry many nights and being constantly stressed at me not understanding the subjects and that i didnt want to fail my classes. Eventually my school finally had christmas holidays and im still having them as im writing this, but yesterday or before yesterday (it was on jan 2) i got an email from two of my professors (one for programming and another for computer theory) where the computer theory would make a test on things that we learnt for a bit before christmas holidays and from my programming teacher where we would get a midterm on stuff we did from november / december. At that point i just started breaking down because i just dont want to go through that awful experience anymore of being constantly worried and stressed, feeling as if i was on the edge, and one screw up would ruin everything for me. So i guess what im asking is should i even continue my course or should i pick a different career for my life (i was thinking of maritime studies because my dad is an expert in maritime since he worked for 40+ years in it) at this point, im lost and i dont know what to do with my future.thanks for anyone who read the whole essay of a post. But to give a TLDR version: was into computers since middle school, graduated high school, got into compsci for my career, in the beginning understood the material but later i didnt get it, started having panic attacks and stress, dont know what to do.",17,0.88,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q44o2d/do_i_actually_like_programming_pcs_or_is_it/,2026-01-04 23:07:49,2026-01-06 01:50:12

1q0pc66,What does inheritance buy you that composition doesn't—beyond code reuse?,ByteMender,learnprogramming,"From a ""mechanical"" perspective, it seems like anything you can do with inheritance, you can do with composition.Any shared behavior placed in a base class and reused via `extends` can instead be moved into a separate class and reused via delegation. In practice, an inheritance hierarchy can often be transformed into composition by:* Keeping the classes that represent the varying behavior,* Removing `extends`,* Injecting those classes into what used to be the base class,* Delegating calls instead of relying on overridden methods.From this perspective, inheritance looks like **composition + a relationship**.With inheritance:* The base class provides shared behavior,* Subclasses provide variation,* The `is-a` relationship wires them together implicitly at compile time.With composition:* The same variation classes exist,* The same behavior is reused,* But the wiring is explicit and often runtime-configurable.This makes it seem like inheritance adds only:* A fixed, compile-time relationship,* Rather than fundamentally new expressive power.If ""factoring out what varies"" is the justification for the extra classes, then those classes are justified independently of inheritance. That leaves the inheritance *relationship itself* as the only thing left to justify.So the core question becomes:**What does the inheritance relationship actually buy us?**To be clear, I'm not asking ""*when is inheritance convenient?""* or ""*which one should I prefer?""*I’m asking:**In what cases is the inheritance relationship itself semantically justified—not just mechanically possible?** In other words, when is the relationship doing real conceptual work, rather than just wiring behavior together?",6,0.64,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q0pc66/what_does_inheritance_buy_you_that_composition/,2025-12-31 22:39:50,2026-01-06 01:50:12
1q0f3qj,Classes versus dictionaries in c#? And general doubts,Puzzleheaded-Law34,learnprogramming,"Hello! New poster here. I just started to practice some C# and learn its style with a couple simple projects. I guess I have some questions on it as a whole, firstly: for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class? Coming from python I keep defaulting to a dictionary, but there it's extremely simple to initialize one with whatever key value pairs I need, whereas in c# the statement is so complex I wonder if it's because objects with more than just a string-number or string-string pairs are meant to be classes. Also, I read that classes are faster in execution.Secondly, I guess I've been struggling to explain the need for all the explicit type declarations and other things that to a beginner seem more complicated than they need to be. Like, it was very complicated in VS to just figure out how to run the script I created, having to choose a debugger and running console commands to get there. What do you do if you want to test a snippet of one script in isolation? Also, I had a class script in the same namespace as the main one, but its class wasn't being recognized. Eventually I noticed the class script was in a different subfolder of the project, so I moved it and it worked fine. But what's the point of a namespace if the file still needs to be in the same directory...

Runs entirely on Docker Desktop with kind. No cloud costs. \## How it works 1. Run \`./play.sh\` - game starts, breaks something in k8s 2. Open another terminal and debug with kubectl 3. Fix it however you want 4. Run \`validate\` in the game to check 5. Get a debrief explaining what was wrong and why The UI is retro terminal style (kinda like those old NES games). Has hints, progress tracking, and step-by-step guides if you get stuck. \## What you'll debug \- World 1: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, pending pods, labels, ports \- World 2: Deployments, HPA, liveness/readiness probes, rollbacks \- World 3: Services, DNS, Ingress, NetworkPolicies \- World 4: PVs, PVCs, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets \- World 5: RBAC, SecurityContext, node scheduling, resource quotas \## Install \`\`\`bash git clone [https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git](https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git) cd k8squest ./install.sh ./play.sh \`\`\` Needs: Docker Desktop, kubectl, kind, python3 \## Why I made this Reading docs didn't really stick for me. I learn better when things are broken and I have to figure out why. This simulates the actual debugging you do in prod, but locally and with hints.

Because of that, I’m wondering whether deeply learning JavaScript and full-stack development is still worth it in the long run.On top of that, one of my relatives suggested a different path. They believe that learning Python and moving into areas like GenAI, machine learning, or understanding how models and agents work (even at a high level) could make it easier to get a job compared to being “just another full-stack developer,” since the market seems saturated.So now I’m confused about a few things:* Should I continue focusing on full-stack development and deeply learn JavaScript?* Should I start learning Python and pivot toward GenAI / ML?* Is it realistic to rely on AI tools without understanding the fundamentals deeply?* As a fresher, which path is more future-proof?I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through this or are already working in the industry.

1q3tood,Basic videogame multiplayer support,No-Crow1621,learnprogramming,"Hello. I'm programming a videogame from scratch; its multiplayer option is meant to be a really basic arcade-style race against 1 or more players, plus at most, a monthly scoring system (""High Scores"" table). No chat, nothing fancy, the game is the custom client, but the score table shall also be viewable from a web browser.All info it takes is just nick+password so players can identify each other for matches and save their data, and an email for password resetting. Unless people opted for LAN (more on that later); after all, to me this is just another gameplay feature among others which for the most part are just thought and designed as offline.For the game itself I'm dealing in low-level; On the server side I think I'm capable of making things work in PHP/SQL, I've done this before for someone else's weird custom IRC/HTTP client (and yes, IRC side = PHP socket), however I'm absolutely terrible when it comes to security and actual best practices, nor I know where to get started (beyond making user inputs as foolproof as possible, correctly dealing with ""dangerous"" characters and so on).For starters, why is it (usually?) discouraged to write custom server software? Security concerns alone? What about an open connection to send/get data in a custom binary format (while not forgetting for LAN compatibility which will have to be game-to-game p2p)? Definitely not doing straight p2p organizer for server-based play though, as too many people is under NAT lol, so server also has to act as reverse-proxy or bridge as well\*. Streaming binary data back and forth with custom software is just the easiest way to communicate button presses, sync checksums, RNG seeds, object positions, and other variables. Otherwise should I actually try PHP for this, if not outright POST constant keyframes through HTTP? But then what about the overhead?What's the most safe way to deal with the password? Sending it to server as-is (!! doubt it), or encoding it in the game first before sending it? Any algorithm recommendations? What's a ""salt"" for? And most importantly, how could any of it be safe if the game gets reverse-engineered, including the password encoding code? And in that case, would it be best if the server sent a custom encoding code each time (well, a key in this case)?\*That includes a hack to take over a host player's ""host"" effectively turning it into ""joined"", so the whole match doesn't go down if the host player quits",2,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q3tood/basic_videogame_multiplayer_support/,2026-01-04 16:07:12,2026-01-06 01:50:12

To allow passage, a mobile application will be used that will transmit this line via NFC and it will be checked at the checkpoint whether you belong.The first way, but which you need to rely on least of all, is to transfer information to the site directly (via NFC as a trigger that will transmit additional information to the device (in this case, the controller where to send the API), or QR with a ready-made address where to send the data).And the site, in turn, communicates with the checkpoint via WS and transmits which passageway can be entered or not. There just needs to be an emergency method in cases of server unavailability, so that the checkpoint itself can allow/prohibit access, and the application will have a local database with information about people.Thanks in advance for the tips and suggestions!",2,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q3t2tu/nfc_reader_for_transferring_json_to_a_computer/,2026-01-04 15:43:30,2026-01-06 01:50:12

The manager said he'd hire me back if they end up hiring again now (January) and I apply. I'm just wondering, would I really want to go back to a company that treated me that way? I feel like it was sudden, and I was treated rather coldly, being made to leave immediately without even saying goodbye to anyone. It's sad because I liked working there overall.

1q3ilu4,Is living in a tech hub worth it nowadays?,I-already-redd-it-,cscareerquestions,"Silly question that has probably been asked a million times, I know, just having a hard time wrapping my head around it .Obviously they offer some benefit. That in-human connection is invaluable when networking. But the trade offs just seem to get larger each year and the difference between living in a tech hub / not seems to lessen too, opportunity wise.If we look at the primary reason for moving to a tech hub (I.e. Seattle, SF, NYC) it comes down to:- more job opportunities- ability to grow a larger networkWith the advent of online applications & speaking to recruiters virtually, many roles aren’t relegated to those living in a specific city anymore. There may be some preference from certain companies to choose locally, but that’s about it.Networking is a big one, but if you were really dedicated to building a solid network, you could do lots of cold outreach on LinkedIn and attend virtual conferences in the industry. Not saying it would be as effective, but the tradeoff of uprooting your whole life and paying a premium (higher COL) just to network a little more efficiently doesn’t seem to weigh in evenly.From people who have moved for these reasons, curious to hear your opinion.",81,0.89,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3ilu4/is_living_in_a_tech_hub_worth_it_nowadays/,2026-01-04 06:24:34,2026-01-06 01:50:13

1q1g8s3,Not sure I want to transition to manager because of toxic younger coworker,Cheap-Sparrow,cscareerquestions,"I (31m) am the tech lead of a small ""sub team"". We have 3 different groups reporting to the same manager. This manager is not a software engineer. I work at a FAANG company.My coworker (25m) is incredibly toxic. They have had multiple blow ups at others and myself. They won't use jira, they won't make merge requests, and every meeting with them is like walking on eggshells. They are late with all their code and it's very buggy. In order to not go through the MR process this coworker created their own repo and pushes directly to main. When we asked them to combine repos they get very agitated. We asked them to start making MRs for review and they flat out refuse and it causes the meetings to become very tense. My manager doesn't understand why merge requests are important and sees no issue with the coworker's behavior. We recently hired 2 new senior engineers. Within 1 month, both engineers have had issues with this person. They are both actively involved in the behavioral coaching of this person. One new hire told me ""this guy is the single worst behaved engineer I've ever worked with."" He expects me, as tech lead, to deal with this situation. I think that's understandable but I have strict instructions to not get involved.I asked my manager to affirm my position as tech lead so I can get this coworker to make MRs and document their designs. My manager said ""No, if I do that then [coworker] will lose their shit and this is a really delicate situation right now.""This young coworker hates me in particular. Probably because I am in charge? My manager has asked me to stay out of it so he can coach this guy himself. My manager told me ""I've never met someone like this in my entire career. I am completely flummoxed and I have no idea what to do.""During one very public blow up, my manager was slacking me privately saying ""I'm confused why he's mad"" and ""just drop [this requirement]. You're right but we need him to feel like he's saving face"".The approach that we're taking is to let this coworker fail on his own. We aren't supposed to save their code when we find bugs, we aren't supposed to push for improvements. We are supposed to let them fail so they realize they need help. Our project is off track.One of the new engineers told me they are having a ""very hard time"" on the team because of this person. I feel a responsibility to respond to that but I have strict instructions to stay out of it. ***Okay. So here's my question.I'm being positioned to become the manager of this team. I said No a year ago because this engineer would have been my only report. My manager thinks I have the wrong attitude and ""[I] need to work with [coworker] because we can't just give up on everyone under the age of 30"". I think this person probably needs to be PIPed and let go. At my previous company (also faang) this would have resulted in a pip a long time ago, both for the attitude but also the sheer lack of deliverables.I can stay on the IC ladder and climb this way, but then a new manager will be hired. This hurts my chances of moving into management later. It also annoys my boss who wants me to just deal with the engineer by coaching instead of a PIP.* Should I take the manager position and have this person as my report, knowing my hands are tied when dealing with them? Or should I try to stay as an engineer?* Do I have an obligation to work with this person, like my boss is telling me? Or is this situation already beyond what is acceptable in the workplace?",80,0.88,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q1g8s3/not_sure_i_want_to_transition_to_manager_because/,2026-01-01 21:52:48,2026-01-06 01:50:13

1q3ofu3,Staying at a chill job with not much career growth ?,Galaxxius,cscareerquestions,"So I work for a FAANG company as a SWE, 3 YOE, got promoted to mid-level 7 months ago and then switched to a chill team. The work is more boring than I expected coming from a fast-paced, cutting-edge team building brand new services leveraging AI agents to now maintaining legacy services written over a decade ago - very simple services but with high scale (millions of transactions per second).The path to senior engineer here is slim, maybe even non-existent because we already have one on the team and there isn't any real scope in terms of next-level projects for promo. My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them. The pace is slow and the work is quite mundane and nothing to do with AI - it feels like I'm missing the AI wave. So there's minimal career growth here.But apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)But yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.So I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that. I'm also interested in maybe going to a startup, but perhaps that's best to do once I have 5 YOE and can apply for senior instead of chasing promo here which is quite difficult irrespective of team. I could also try switching internally to a team with better work and better promo prospects but not sure if it's worth giving up all the good things here for career growth - vs. just rest and vest... what would you do in this situation ?",77,0.92,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3ofu3/staying_at_a_chill_job_with_not_much_career_growth/,2026-01-04 12:10:41,2026-01-06 01:50:13

1pz9x0l,Not sure where to go next,Guy-Lambo,cscareerquestions,"I was laid off 6 months ago. I've worked as a software eng in the bay area for about 13 years. I'm 38 now so I'm not young anymore but I still have to work since I can't retire.I've always considered myself as average intelligence for a software engineer with a very strong work ethic. This often got me noticed and promoted at the companies I've worked for. Technically, there are usually a few engineers on the team that are better than me.Interviews were never easy back then for me but I always felt like the jobs were given to me since my experience was great. I would typically talk about my projects and then do some whiteboarding problem where it felt like I was working alongside the interviewer. I think I've had probably 8 interviews in my entire life and got a no offer on 3 of them until recently.Ever since my layoffs, I've failed probably 5 interviews in the first or second round. The furthest I got was 5 rounds(they wanted a few more rounds and I could tell they were not super enthusiastic about me). The interviews seem a lot more toxic recently with interviewers asking me questions like ""what value can you bring if AI can do those things?"" With all these things, I stopped looking for a tech job completely and found a part-time retail job.I'm fortunate enough to have a small savings and the part-time retail job is slowing down my burn. I'm trying to break away from tech right now and find any career worth getting into where I can afford a family in the future ($20/hr in retail is very hard to make work for a single person). I have a year or two to figure something out.I spend some of my free time at the library just reading to get ideas on where I can go but I feel so lost. Here are some options I'm thinking about:**1. Grind leetcode, study AI/design, work on interview skills and keep interviewing until I find a tech job.***Pros:* *- Clear objectives* *- Good pay* *- Job is interesting for the most part**Cons:* *- Layoffs still on the table* *- Extremely difficult to get an offer (I dont even know what to study since questions are so random)* *- I really do not want to grind leetcode anymore***2. Change careers***Pros:* *- Fresh start and something that aligns better with my values* *- Maybe better work-life balance than eng (tradeoff with lower pay is fine)**Cons:* *- Have to do some soul-searching to find next career* *- Probably difficult to switch careers* *- Most jobs are probably slower and less mentally stimulating***3. Start a business***Pros:* *- Be your own boss (kinda not really)* *- No leetcode**Cons:* *- Hard grind that requires all your focus and dedication* *- I prefer more stability*With those 3 options, I'm leaning towards changing careers. The starting a business is something I think about a lot but it's not something I can just pull out of nowhere. The thought of going back into tech gives me anxiety through the roof. Unfortunately, I dont know what careers I can change into.

When I was interning, there was another entry developer that stayed on for around two years but left due to no promotion (they said he kinda sucked delivery wise).I am told I do good work and meet expectations, I expect a promotion this year after a year of work post grad. But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. We have little to no documentation. So anytime I am introduced to new tech or systems, my seniors really do hand hold me, to which I am appreciative of. I am not the type that asks the same questions over and over, I just need to see it once throughly and I can replicate what they've taught me.The problem is, after a year of this siloed style of work, I am getting burnt out. I can not stand coding. There have been multiple occasions for multiple projects where I have stayed at work alone and extremely late, staying until 8-10pm, just typing away at my computer. Recently I have been tasked with developing an entire web app alone. It's functionality seems simple but no application meant for production is ever simple. We are understaffed, so there is nobody else to divy up project tasks with. I've asked if we have any plans to get more entry hires on the team and it is always met with a soft no, the company is on a hiring freeze, economy yada yada.I talk with my friends from uni who are all working. Their teams practice agile and scrum philosophies, and their coding tasks are divided up for multipe team members. They love their jobs. Their eyes bulge when I tell them about my work load and my work effort. I always feel unfortunate when I hear about how lucky they have been, but really, it sounds like those types of tech teams are the standard and I am the unlucky one to have landed in an underdeveloped team. Senior developers can afford to ignore a team dynamic like this and still be successful in it.In my eyes, saying that this is too much work is basically telling them I am not up for the job and I might as well quit honestly. I know I can handle it, I mean I am meeting their latest expectation for an entire web application on my own, but I do not want to handle this anymore. It used to make me so happy to run an application and see the results of my hard work in action, but I genuinely can't even stand opening visual studio anymore.With how bad the job market is, I am scared to walk away.

Feel like I'm making a mistake accepting an offer.,agentxtaco,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, looking for some career advice here.I’m an L2 engineer (5 YOE) currently at an e-commerce shop. I generally love my job—I own features from backend to frontend, write my own Terraform, manage GCP resources, the works. It feels fulfilling to ship stuff that people actually see and use.The problem I’m experiencing is trying to get an internal promotion. I’ve been acting at a Senior level for a while. My manager pushed for my promotion last year, but the Director blocked it because they haven’t heard enough about me to deserve it and my manager cited ""people outside the team don't know me"" (I'm fully remote and introverted, don’t get a lot of opportunities to network). Now my manager wants me to rotate to another team for a quarter just to ""prove visibility"" before they consider the promo again. It feels like moving goalposts and political hoop-jumping, and hasn't been sitting well with me since.Recently, a recruiter reached out to me about a job at a late stage health tech startup, I went through the whole interview process not expecting to get it, but I did receive an offer. I negotiated it up and signed, but now I’m having intense buyer's remorse.* **Positives:** Senior title, good pay bump. Marketable tech stack.* **Negatives:** The work sounds like it could be pretty dry, mostly data processing and generating reports. No Greenfield development and I’d be working in a monorepo. I’m worried I’ll lose that spark I get from building new features for the website.* **Some weirdness:** I’d be reporting to a “manager” who is also an IC on the team. He’s never managed before and is new to interviewing. I’m worried he won’t have the clout to advocate for me or help me grow.Has anyone made a jump like this? Is reporting to a fellow IC on my team a massive red flag?I’m afraid I’m leaving a job I enjoy (mostly) for a place where I’ll be bored and stuck, just for money and to chase a title my current company is gatekeeping.",33,0.9,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3a75y/5_yoe_feel_like_im_making_a_mistake_accepting_an/,2026-01-03 23:51:28,2026-01-06 01:50:13

1q1d23l,How do I stop feeling like I will never have a good career or will become jobless?,squalexy,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone!I'm 30, from Portugal, did a cs licence and master's and started working last year in a big 4, so I only have 1 year of experience doing data engineering. My goal has always been to be a versatile software engineer, I've always wanted to work with data, cloud, machine learning, devops (later in my career), qa and so on. But lately, my mind has been plagued with insecurities and I feel worried about my future. I'll try to provide as much context as possible.For starters, I have no idea where AI will take us and I'm starting to feel dependant on it after going through 4+ years without using it in college. The fun part of this field, for me, has always been to think and develop a solution to a problem, but I'm not a fast learner or fast thinker, and by the time I think of something, Copilot is giving me a much better answer in less than a minute. I don't know when and where to draw the line, when do I start to think ""Maybe I'm using too much AI now"" or ""I'm an engineer, I shouldn't be asking AI to help me solve this""?Second, I feel like this field is starting to become a bit of everything, everywhere, all at once. There's constantly a new tech or stack to learn, then there's AI that you either embrace or refuse (with no clear winner here), then you also have to learn stuff from other subfields because they lay off people and you have to do the job of two, and the list goes on. I get home tired from +8h of work, I don't want to look at a screen and think ""Oh let's build a fun project or learn a new stack!"". I do try to get as much cloud certificates (aws, gc etc) as possible, since our company provides us the vouchers, but that's as far as I can motivate me to go.Then, I also feel like I'm trapped in this job because it's a project lottery and the market isn't looking fun for juniors. I'm working on building agents for our company and while this feels very up to date, I'm afraid it's only another hype that will fade with time and not get much use in the future. Somehow, due to the fact that I'm not coding much, I feel like I'll unlearn everything I've worked on for the past few years (and I did forget most of the stuff from college already) and then I won't have the required skills for better jobs in the future.I also really dislike the country I live in because of our extremely high rent prices and very low salaries (a 1bedroom apt is 50% of my salary right now). This makes me want to move to another country, but I don't know if it might be a good fit, if the market is also terrible there or if I even have a shot with all the competition.Bottom line of all of this is: **I never know if what I'm doing will help me grow and prepare me for a better future, and I don't know what's the right path to follow because I'm in constant doubt and uncertainty. I can't get motivated to work because I don't know if what I'm doing is meaningful to my future and I can't focus on one thing at a time.**Have any of you felt like this or have any advice to help me address this?",17,0.8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q1d23l/how_do_i_stop_feeling_like_i_will_never_have_a/,2026-01-01 19:43:49,2026-01-06 01:50:13

I spoke with them because I am also interested in a cybersecurity career as well. While I enjoy writing software more, I feel cybersecurity will be a more secure career in the long term.The truth is that I will take any tech job I can get, for any salary above minimum wage. But I understand that I need to have more specific goals and a plan. So I’m leaning towards committing to cybersecurity, creating a 5 year plans. As for what area in cybersecurity, I don’t know, but I’m thinking DevSecOps or other software security roles.My understanding is that cybersecurity is not an intro role and I need to work on personal project + certifications -> help desk role -> IT role -> more cyber security focused role.There’s so many certifications out there, I was recommend ISC2 to start with by the person I spoke to. I’m a little nervous about how expensive most certifications are, and ISC2 has an annual fee. What have I done so far:I have a portfolio with 3 demos for apps I made , some using ML. For example I made a custom pipeline that predicts if someone will be approved a bank loan based on historical data.

Got laid off in 2017, but just as I was starting to look for a new job, my father unexpectedly passed away, and I had to step away from engineering to help support a family real estate business. I was never really passionate about the business, and frankly had to teach myself everything to make it work. I've been able to keep the business afloat, but just barely, and as I'm looking to get married and have a family soon, I know the income from that business just won't be able to support a family. So I've decided to sell the business and try going back to SWE. The problem is, from what I can tell, the job market is horrible, and it's even worse with an 8 year gap in my resume. My background was primarily as a Java developer, but my last couple years at the trading firm I did a fair amount of work in Spark, so I've decided to lean into the data engineering angle and have been teaching myself modern Spark and cloud computing to brush up on my skills in my free time. I know I will probably have to start back at a level 1 or maybe 2 role given my resume gap, and I've already sent my resume out to a few companies I thought might be a good fit through linkedIn, but have gotten zero calls back.

I started college in 2021, and my financial aid will likely be cut off after this coming spring.

I’m comfortable with technical tools, but my preferred role after graduation is data analyst or a tech role that requires minimal coding, rather than heavy software engineering.Given the financial aid situation, time to graduate, and my career goals, I’m trying to decide whether it makes more sense to:•Push through and finish the CS degree, or•Switch to Business Management + CS minor and continue building technical experience on the sideI’d really appreciate any insight from people who’ve faced a similar decision or are working in data/tech roles.

After dabbling in various areas that tech has to offer through internships and projects, I became interested in building the systems/infrastructure behind the AI/ML models that are in use nowadays. However, I couldn't find much information online on what this role even does because it seems relatively new and highly specialized. I am hoping to gather insight from industry professionals on things like:1. Is AI/ML Infrastructure basically just DevOps/MLOps? Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)? 2. Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too. 3. Is a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality. 4. On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here? 5. What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year...

I didn’t cut it off correctly early enough, and now when I am trying to write code on my own - it takes much more time I feel like I am falling out if industry-needed pace. I can’t say that I am vibe-coding, because I am still very responsible for my code, and I know precisely how something is implemented, and I am not doing “Claude pls code feature” as well, but still like I am feeling that I won’t be able to write code if I don’t have access to AI instruments. So there’s my first question. How normal it is? How do you define an edge between AI slob and speed ups that AI can provide?\- Vector of further development? I am trying to study the stuff beyond my actual responsibilities, and I feel like my next big choice is choice of supplementary skills: doing distribution (sales, marketing, PMF and all that kind of stuff) VS digging deeper into architecture, devops and deeply engineering kinds of topics.Argument of first approach for me are the fact that I can be more independent, but that’s not something I particularly like.Arguments for the second approach are the fact that I love it, but again I love it because I am able to move with fast pace because I have AI.

Obviously he did not let me lol. Looking back I am wondering if I should just keep my mouth shut and not said anything. I know this might vary per company depending on how generic early round interviews and if they keep you in a general pool and then narrowing the team at the end vs a place where each job posting going down separate cycles.

1pzwxgr,CS folks - right after you graduated,immediate_push5464,cscareerquestions,"I am struggling with the unknown and anticipation of job placement in CS.I have about 1.5 years left in my associates program, and I have an unrelated bachelors degree with some other accolades. Being an older student, I can’t really tolerate lounging around after I graduate to find a job at a lazy pace. I have to acquire one quickly or shift gears immediately. That said, I would appreciate some feedback on what getting your first job was like. Some ideas are:\- stats (internship, GPA, other relevant)\- how many applications it took and how long? Did you network or just slam out applications until you got an interview? Or something different?\- interview details (technical, behavioral, networking?)\- what year was this for you?Really looking for some in depth data here to help me realize if I’m cooked or just incredibly anxious and in a great spot.

1q3drdg,How to break into ML engineering or data engineering with just a bachelors?,Personal-Molasses537,cscareerquestions,So I want to break into more machine learning engineer or data engineer roles but I just have a bachelors degree and many of these roles want masters or higher. I took machine learning classes in college and also a databases class in college so I have some exposure but I've never worked directly in these roles yet.
