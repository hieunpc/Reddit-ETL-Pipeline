1q37mpm,Again - Take home assignment,Limp-Complaint5817,dataengineering,"I am a senior engineer, and although this has been discussed before, I experienced it again recently. I was asked to prepare a presentation for a panel with only two days’ notice. I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.Unfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.I was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources.

1q22shj,What does an ideal data modeling practice look like? Especially with an ML focus.,Capable_Mastodon_867,dataengineering,"I was reading through Kimballs warehouse toolkit, and it gives this beautiful picture of a central collection of conformed dimensional models that represent the company as a whole. I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.I'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like ""how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?"" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. The idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.On the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.In the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.There seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",44,0.9,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q22shj/what_does_an_ideal_data_modeling_practice_look/,2026-01-02 16:17:12,2026-01-07 01:49:58

I have always documented the systems I have worked on using the techniques I've learned. I've had colleagues come to me saying they knew I ""would have documented how it works"". From this I know we had a findability issue.On various Redit threads there are people who are adamant that documentation is a waste of time and that people don't read it.What are the reasons people don't read the documentation and are the reasons solvable?

They rebrand it, and host it in their SaaS, and call it ""managed"" and/or ""easy"". They also charge customers 50% more than if the same software were to be hosted on kubernetes or IaaS.I keep thinking that one of these vendors (perhaps databricks first) would develop a managed version of duckdb. It would almost be a no-brainer, since the software is massively useful but is still not widely adopted.Why hasn't this happened yet? Are there licensing restrictions that I'm overlooking?

1q1ddky,Non technical boss is confusing me,Huxley_The_Third,dataengineering,"I’m the only developer at my company. I work on a variety of things, but my primary role is building an internal platform that’s being used by our clients. One of the platform’s main functionalities is ingesting analytics data from multiple external sources (basic data like clicks, conversions, warnings data grouped by day), though analytics is not its sole purpose and there are a bunch of other features. At some point , my boss decides he wants to “centralize the company data” and hires some agency out of the blue. They drafted up an outline of their plan, which involved setting up a separate database with a medallion architecture. They then requested that I show them how the APIs we’re pulling data from work, and a week later, they request that I help them pull the analytics from the existing db. they never acknowledged any of the solutions i provided for either of those things nor did they explain the Point of those 2 conflicting ideas. So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again, (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of)",34,0.87,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1ddky/non_technical_boss_is_confusing_me/,2026-01-01 19:56:47,2026-01-07 01:49:58

If you're using dbt, OpenAPI, GraphQL, or Kafka, it helps coordinate schema changes between producers and consumers.The problem it solves: data teams break each other's stuff all the time because there's no good way to track who depends on what. You change a column, someone's dashboard breaks, nobody knows until it's too late. The same happens with APIs as well. Tessera sits in the middle and makes producers acknowledge breaking changes before they publish. Consumers register their dependencies, get notifications when things change, and can block breaking changes until they're ready.It's open source, MIT licensed, built with Python/FastAPI. If you're dealing with data contracts, schema evolution, or just tired of breaking changes causing incidents, have a look: https://github.com/ashita-ai/tesseraFeedback is encouraged.

1q4ibgz,Logic advice for complex joins - pyspark in databricks,wei5924,dataengineering,"Hello,I am building a databricks notebook that joins roughly 6 tables into a main table. Some joins require some of the main table, whilst other joins will use the whole main table. Each join table has a few keys.My question is what is the best architecture to perform the join without having an out of memory / stack overflow error? Currently I have written a linear script which sequentially goes through each table and does the join. This is slow and confusing to look at. As such other developers cannot make sense of the code (despite me adding comments) and im the main point of contact.Solutions tried:* I had tried to write a function that performs multiple joins using a while loop. However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error. Sometimes i get a driver error and the whole notebook fails to continue to run.* I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted. As such we had to roll back to the linear way i wrote before.* I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact.* Caching after some joins but problem persists. Other information:* Small tables - row count roughly 50-100* main table - as of now row count roughly 50k* join type - left join on main table * All tables are already cleansed and are delta tables * Technologies: databricks, pyspark, ADF, ADLSSide question: I used to be a software engineer and now moved to being a data engineer. Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without? in terms of time complexity and clean code writing? My assumption is the former but after a few months of writing pyspark code i believe the correct answer is the latter? Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?",15,0.79,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q4ibgz/logic_advice_for_complex_joins_pyspark_in/,2026-01-05 10:33:19,2026-01-07 01:49:58

Please be aware of:* merge() is not implemented in this version* DuckDB doesn’t allow mixed types like Pandas does, so you may need to clean messy CSVs before using them.* Currently optimized for reading and analyzing. Writing back to Parquet/CSV works by converting to Pandas first.* Advanced methods (rolling, ewm) will fall back to standard Pandas, which may defeat the memory savings.

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.The idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects.

SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.I hope some of y'all find it useful.GitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",9,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q0t1zj/graphqlite_graph_database_capabilities_inside/,2026-01-01 01:58:27,2026-01-07 01:49:58

I'm looking to make a move over the the DE side of things and wondered if I had a place long-term with my experience, but without a degree.I got into the data team from an administrative role and had/still have no degree, just a lacklustre secondary school education (high school level). The department is a mix of those with stellar academic records, random degrees and people like me who fell into the work - I've found a similar split at most organisations and businesses I've worked with or met at conferences.I've experience working with a ton of different systems and a variety of stakeholders both within the organisation and externally such as software companies, central government departments etc. to tackle complex operational problems.I started my career using basic SQL, Excel and VBA. Currently I'm using advanced SQL (including performance tuning, building pipelines and data warehousing), Python (mainly pandas, numpy and matplotlib), Power BI (with a great understanding of DAX and TMDL, plus I do some platform administration). I've a sound(ish) knowledge of stats, though we don't really using anything too advanced. I'm considered mid-senior atm and paid £47k, which is quite typical for the public sector in the UK \*Americans recoil in horror\*.Outside work I mess around with my home server to expand my wider IT knowledge and explore some more modern tooling and cloud platforms.My organisation are moving to Azure next year and I'm lining myself up for a DE role (there's no bump in pay) as that's where my interest lies.Would it be worth me getting a degree at this point in my career? My employer has offered to put me through a degree apprenticeship (not sure how familiar people are with those outside the UK), with the Open University, a distance-learning university.Recently, I applied for ten BI/DA jobs in other companies (just to test my marketability) and was invited to eight, so I'm not worried at all about the immediate term in my current area of work, I'm just concerned about whether I'd have a place in DE over the long term?

Most of my work so far has been very technical: pipeline development, data handling, tool testing, Docker/Apptainer images, Git, etc. I’ve rarely worked on actual data analysis.I recently changed jobs (about 6 months ago), and this experience made me realize a few things: I don’t really enjoy coding, working on other people’s code often gives me anxiety, and I’d like to move toward a related role that offers better compensation than what’s usually available in public research.Given my background, I’ve been considering a transition into data engineering. I’ve started learning Airflow, ETL/ELT concepts, Spark, and the basics of GCP and AWS. However, I feel like I’m missing structure, mentorship, and especially a community to help me stay motivated and make real progress.At the moment, I don’t enjoy my current tasks, I don’t feel like I’m developing professionally, and the salary isn’t motivating. I still have about 15 months left on my contract, and I’d really like to use this time wisely to prepare a solid transition.If you have experience with a similar transition, or if you work in data engineering, I’d love to hear:* how you made the switch (or would recommend making it),* what helped you most in terms of learning and positioning yourself,* how to connect with people already working in the field.Thanks a lot in advance for your insights.",4,0.65,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1b3z2/bioinformatics_engineer_considering_a_transition/,2026-01-01 18:27:50,2026-01-07 01:49:58

1q036wk,No Data Cleaning,Professional_Peak983,dataengineering,"Hi, just looking for different opinions and perspectives hereI recently joined a company with a medallion architecture but where there is no “data cleansing” layer. The only type of cleaning being done is some deduplication logic (very manual) and some type casting. This means a lot of the data that goes into reports and downstream products aren’t uniform and must be fixed/transformed at the report level.All these tiny problems are handled in scripts when new tables are created in silver or gold layers. So the scripts can get very long, complex, and contain duplicate logic.So..\- at what point do you see it necessary to actually do data cleaning? In my opinion it should already be implemented but I want to hear other perspectives.\- what kind of “cleaning” do you deem absolutely necessary/bare minimum for most use cases?\- i understand and completely onboard with the thought of “don’t fix it if it’s not broken” but when does it reach a breaking point?\- in your opinion, what part of this is up to the data engineer to decide vs. analysts?We are using spark and delta lake to store data.Edit: clarified question 3",5,0.86,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q036wk/no_data_cleaning/,2025-12-31 03:58:38,2026-01-07 01:49:58

1q1fj70,Show r/dataengineering: Orchestera Platform – Run Spark on Kubernetes in your own AWS account with no compute markup,iamspoilt,dataengineering,"First of all, Happy New Year 2026!Hi folks, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and a fellow Data Infrastructure Engineer. I have been working as a Software Engineer for 8+ years now and have been entirely focused on the data infra side of the world for the past few years with a fair share of working with Apache Spark.I have realized that it's very difficult to manage Spark infrastructure on your own using commodity cloud hardware and Kubernetes, and this is one of the prime reasons why users opt-in for offerings such as EMR and Databricks. However, I have personally seen that as companies grow larger, these offerings start to show their limitations (at least in the case of EMR from my personal experience). Besides that, these offerings also charge a premium on compute on top of the charges for using commodity cloud.For a quick comparison, here is the difference in pricing for AWS c8g.24xlarge and c8g.48xlarge instances if you were to run these for an entire month, showing the 25% EMR premium on your total EC2 bill.**Table 1: Single Instance (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$2,794.79|$3,493.49|$698.70||c8g.48xlarge|$5,589.58|$6,986.98|$1,397.40|**Table 2: 50 Instances (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$139,740|$174,675|$34,935||c8g.48xlarge|$279,479|$349,349|$69,870|In light of this, I started working on a platform that allows you to orchestrate Spark clusters on Kubernetes in your own AWS account - with no additional compute markup. The platform is geared towards Data Engineers (Product Data Engineers as I like to call them) who mainly write and maintain ETL and ELT workloads, not manage the Data Infrastcructure needed to support these workloads.Today, I am finally able to share what I have been building: [Orchestera Platform](https://orchestera.com/)Here are some of the salient features of the platform:* Setup and teardown an entire EKS-based Spark cluster in your own AWS account with absolutely no upfront expertise required in Kubernetes* Cluster is configured for reactive auto-scaling based on your workloads: * Automatically scales up to the right number of EC2 instances based on your Spark driver and executor configuration * Automatically scales down to 0 once your workloads complete* Simple integration with AWS services such as S3 and RDS* Simple integration with Iceberg tables on S3. AWS Glue Catalog integration coming soon.* Full support for iterating on Spark pipelines using Jupyter notebooks* Currently only supports AWS Cloud and the us-east-1 regionYou can see some demo examples here:* [Developing Spark applications using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/)* [Using Iceberg tables with Spark](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/iceberg-hello-world/)If you are an AWS user or considering using it for Spark, I would request you to please try this out. No credit card required for using the personal workspace. Also offering 6 months of premium access for serious users in this subreddit.Also very interested to hear from this community and looking for some early feedback.I have aslo written [documentation](https://docs.orchestera.com/) (under active development) to give users a head start in setting up their accounts, orchesterating a new Spark cluster and writing data pipelines.If you want to chat more about this new platform, please come and join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9TXybZcd).",6,0.65,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1fj70/show_rdataengineering_orchestera_platform_run/,2026-01-01 21:23:50,2026-01-07 01:49:58

I built things I cared about, experimented, and actually understood what I was making.Working as a programmer feels completely different. Real-world projects are rarely about clean design or interesting problems. Most of the time it’s legacy code, bad architecture, rushed deadlines, and fixing bugs in systems no one fully understands.Instead of building something meaningful, you’re gluing together hacks to keep a business running.

Coding anything felt like nonstop friction. Forgetting syntax, confused about how to use a given framework, not knowing why something works even when I'm able to get it working, and constantly needing help just to move forward, it felt like this every step for a long time.Recently, something finally clicked. I can sit down, think through a problem, and actually build the solution without feeling like I’m fighting the language or tools the entire time. One of the biggest changes is how I use documentation now. What used to feel unreadable suddenly makes sense, and I almost always prefer reading docs over asking GPT because it’s faster and clearer.I’m still very much a beginner at the end of the day, but programming is finally fun.

1q1d18k,How do you stop the urge to _completely_ understand things?,Andrew_7032,learnprogramming,"Most of us growing up in school have learned everything in a sequence. Heck, even everything in life almost follows a sequence. A year starts with day 1 until it hits day 365; a book starts with chapter 1 until it reaches the ending chapter. Almost everything has a sequence. Programming does not have that; you have to have the ability to learn things out of sequence. You can't wait until you have the entirety of JS learned before you move on to something like React. Heck, you will probably never get there in a lifetime, as there will be new additions to the language and deprecations. I have a degree, I have been self-studying, and I am still unemployed. When I start learning a library, it is hard to sort of know what to pick up and then move on and hit the library only when you need it again.This is a barrier, or at least one of the barriers that makes programming a high-paying job. We need to have a different kind of approach to learning to code. I have been trying to adapt my brain's wiring so that I only learn what is important and move on.

Late 2023 I was dealing with a huge burnout working as a SWE at a bank. So, I decided that I wanted to take a break from the hostile environment and work with other stuff (and enjoy some of my life after uni). The thing is, job market wasn’t so lucky to me. It was (and it still is) hard to even get an interview. So I ended up doing some freelance and gigs all around. But one stuff that was all over my head ever since I finished uni was the famous “imposter syndrome”. And, I got the realisation that I was, in fact, very lucky to land my positions. I always relied on AI to deliver something, didn’t know how to start a project from scratch. So, in November I decided to “start again”. Focusing on getting the basics well and enjoying coding again. And it has been a quite fun journey! In fact, I’m liking studying and trying some stuff. I got a membership on Frontend Masters (mostly because of the algorithm course) and gifted myself with some books for Christmas.

1q44o2d,Do i actually like Programming / PC's or is it because of uni?,BrosVGK,learnprogramming,"so for context, when i was in first/second year of middle school, i meet some people who were good with pc's / know how to program. I talked to them a bit about it and it managed to get me into programming and learning about pc's and on and off for a few years, i would try and learn C# because i was curious to try and learn how to make a game, and i was into pc's because i wanted to know how pc's work (hardware wise, not software). Fastforward to graduating high school recently (i graduated in june). When it was time for me to pick my future career i decided i wanted to go to computer science (a bit off topic but i was also into music, specifically playing the guitar and wanting to learn about music theory, and i like to learn to draw) and even though i was into those other hobbies, i picked computer science because i thought i could make some decent money from it, however thats when things went down the hill. When i first started, things weren't too hard, i managed to understand some early stuff. I was learning C++ and general computer theory, and when it came to computer theory i was good at it, because in my mind it was easy. Then when November / December came, everything just didnt make sense. I couldnt even pay attention in classes because i just couldnt understand it and when i try and learning it on my own i still couldnt get it. It got pretty bad because i would cry many nights and being constantly stressed at me not understanding the subjects and that i didnt want to fail my classes. Eventually my school finally had christmas holidays and im still having them as im writing this, but yesterday or before yesterday (it was on jan 2) i got an email from two of my professors (one for programming and another for computer theory) where the computer theory would make a test on things that we learnt for a bit before christmas holidays and from my programming teacher where we would get a midterm on stuff we did from november / december.

1q5m1uk,FastAPI vs Spring Boot: A Question on Programming Feel,Existing_Steak,learnprogramming,"I am trying to learn programming and have a question about frameworks/programming languages.I have made a simple HTTP-based API in both python (using fastAPI) and java (using Spring Boot).In fastAPI framework, I notice that I mainly write functions which are either passed in as parameters into other functions or called by other functions. To me, this makes sense from my perspective, or at least feels intuitive. I can literally see the programming ""primitives"" I wrote interacting with each other in my source code. For example, I build an endpoint like```python@APIRouter().get(""/blah"")def get_blah(): return ""blah""```then I must tell my main FastAPI() object about the routes using `.include_router()`. Nice. I can also somewhat imagine whats going on in my head, like the `APIRouter` object has some record of all the routes I defined via the decorator and that object is being passed to my `FastAPI()` object.Spring Boot, on the other hand, I notice that I create classes, and some of these classes are never instantiated! At least they're certainly never called in my source code. I can run my application with Gradle and the class I created that was never instantiated actually did something. E.g., I make this class```java@RestControllerpublic class TextController { @GetMapping(""/texts"") public List getTexts() { return service.getTexts(); }}```but I never wrote ""TextController blah = new TextController()"" anywhere?Like, I feel more in control of my FastAPI application than I do with my Spring application?

1q0pc66,What does inheritance buy you that composition doesn't—beyond code reuse?,ByteMender,learnprogramming,"From a ""mechanical"" perspective, it seems like anything you can do with inheritance, you can do with composition.Any shared behavior placed in a base class and reused via `extends` can instead be moved into a separate class and reused via delegation. In practice, an inheritance hierarchy can often be transformed into composition by:* Keeping the classes that represent the varying behavior,* Removing `extends`,* Injecting those classes into what used to be the base class,* Delegating calls instead of relying on overridden methods.From this perspective, inheritance looks like **composition + a relationship**.With inheritance:* The base class provides shared behavior,* Subclasses provide variation,* The `is-a` relationship wires them together implicitly at compile time.With composition:* The same variation classes exist,* The same behavior is reused,* But the wiring is explicit and often runtime-configurable.This makes it seem like inheritance adds only:* A fixed, compile-time relationship,* Rather than fundamentally new expressive power.If ""factoring out what varies"" is the justification for the extra classes, then those classes are justified independently of inheritance. That leaves the inheritance *relationship itself* as the only thing left to justify.So the core question becomes:**What does the inheritance relationship actually buy us?**To be clear, I'm not asking ""*when is inheritance convenient?""* or ""*which one should I prefer?""*I’m asking:**In what cases is the inheritance relationship itself semantically justified—not just mechanically possible?** In other words, when is the relationship doing real conceptual work, rather than just wiring behavior together?",5,0.62,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q0pc66/what_does_inheritance_buy_you_that_composition/,2025-12-31 22:39:50,2026-01-07 01:49:58
1q0f3qj,Classes versus dictionaries in c#? And general doubts,Puzzleheaded-Law34,learnprogramming,"Hello! New poster here. I just started to practice some C# and learn its style with a couple simple projects. I guess I have some questions on it as a whole, firstly: for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class? Coming from python I keep defaulting to a dictionary, but there it's extremely simple to initialize one with whatever key value pairs I need, whereas in c# the statement is so complex I wonder if it's because objects with more than just a string-number or string-string pairs are meant to be classes. Also, I read that classes are faster in execution.Secondly, I guess I've been struggling to explain the need for all the explicit type declarations and other things that to a beginner seem more complicated than they need to be. Like, it was very complicated in VS to just figure out how to run the script I created, having to choose a debugger and running console commands to get there. What do you do if you want to test a snippet of one script in isolation? Also, I had a class script in the same namespace as the main one, but its class wasn't being recognized. Eventually I noticed the class script was in a different subfolder of the project, so I moved it and it worked fine. But what's the point of a namespace if the file still needs to be in the same directory... I imagine all these details are for good reasons, so wanted to ask some experts haha",5,0.86,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q0f3qj/classes_versus_dictionaries_in_c_and_general/,2025-12-31 15:06:24,2026-01-07 01:49:58

1q5onk5,How would you optimize collision detection? (C#),Puzzleheaded-Law34,learnprogramming,"Hello! So I've recently been working on a simple test game with Monogame. After some trial and error, I made a collision detection system based on several parts:\> under Scenes class, I load textures for obstacles in each scene and create a dictionary to map each scene to the obstacle textures to be drawn. Also created a dictionary to map each texture to its position.\> in my Map class, I create a 2d array of zeros to represent terrain; then, a method loops thru the dictionary from Scenes, to place 1's on all array elements corresponding to the texture's width&height on the grid.\> In the map class, I create methods like this for each direction, which are called in the main Update() method later when the arrow key is detected: (EDIT: position and tex1 in CanMoveL() refer to the player)         public bool CanMoveL(Vector2 position, Texture2D tex1)         {             bool check = true;             if (position.X == Xbounds[0]+10)             {                 return false;             }             for (int y = 5; y < tex1.Height-1; y++){                 if (terrain[(int)position.Y+y, (int)position.X +1]==2)                 {                     check = false;                 }             }             return check;         }Note: I know there are built-in detection methods in monogame, but I'm not really interested in refactoring in the best way possible, I just had the objective of figuring it out from scratch in a way that makes sense. But, if you have some ideas on how you would have approached it/whether my method is way too inefficient, I'd be happy to hear them!Mainly, I'm concerned about the loop that looks through each ""row"" of my character's height, seeing if it hits the obstacle when projected. I was thinking of Numpy style slicing but I couldn't figure that out in c#?Secondly, It seems like this method is kinda fragmented, with the scene textures loaded in Scenes, but the actual mapping of them in Maps.

Fix it however you want 4. Run \`validate\` in the game to check 5. Get a debrief explaining what was wrong and why The UI is retro terminal style (kinda like those old NES games). Has hints, progress tracking, and step-by-step guides if you get stuck. \## What you'll debug \- World 1: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, pending pods, labels, ports \- World 2: Deployments, HPA, liveness/readiness probes, rollbacks \- World 3: Services, DNS, Ingress, NetworkPolicies \- World 4: PVs, PVCs, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets \- World 5: RBAC, SecurityContext, node scheduling, resource quotas \## Install \`\`\`bash git clone [https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git](https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git) cd k8squest ./install.sh ./play.sh \`\`\` Needs: Docker Desktop, kubectl, kind, python3 \## Why I made this Reading docs didn't really stick for me.

I'm worried the main three areas (coding, domain knowledge, system design) that made skilled workers more desirable will no longer matter. Now, workers can simply add the domain knowledge to the context window, use well-established system designs, and generate code adhering to standards with existing prompt templates.The knowledge barrier once attracted me to this profession because of the differentation from low skilled labor. I'm considering switching into a different career with more human judgement involved but it feels pointless.

1q5aadj,"Do any other junior engineers feel like they're ""hiding"" right now?",SirArtistic1123,cscareerquestions,"I'll try to be concise and explain what I mean by ""hiding"" as best I can - bear with me folks.I remember starting my career in the summer of 2024, with hopes that I'll progress into senior after 2-3 years, and maybe go to a different company that aligned more towards my interests.I knew AI was a ""threat"" in terms of reducing the number of engineers (do more with less - the mantra of corporate America, etc.), but didn't really take it seriously.Flash forward 18 months later, and I am taking it much more seriously. I don't think AI will eliminate software engineering, but I do think it'll change the number of people who need to it to achieve very good outcomes. With each iteration and vast amounts of training data, the AI models to get better - and honestly, I'm part of the reason, I have to hold my hands up and say I've used GPT a lot since it came out - it synthesizes anything on Google, SO, documentation, etc. so why not use it to get to the bottom of what I need to know way quicker?And I think this is the general consensus - AI will never do away with software engineering, software will always exist, but it will change who does it, and the number of those people.More relevant in 2026 though is offshoring. For better or for worse, I understand the rationale of offshoring labor, particularly junior positions. Companies exist solely to deliver profits to their shareholders, investing a lot of money into an ""unproven"" college graduate is far less appealing than investing that same amount of money into 3-4 new graduates.So as offshoring accelerates, and AI becomes better and better, I'm ""hiding"". I do my due diligence at work, and I learn what good software is.But no matter how many times I implement a strong observability backbone, no matter how many times I write CDK code and deploy to AWS, no matter how many times I implement authentication middleware, etc. - I have the same feeling that I'm on borrowed time.I'm ""hiding"" in the sense that there will be a time in the future, how soon, I don't know, but there will be a time when my leadership thinks, ""We don't need him anymore"" because I cost them too much, and my work can be consolidated into an offshore option or a senior engineer that is producing more with AI. It'll be a simple decision for them, and honestly I'll be the first to say that their intention aligns with the purpose of a business in the first place, which is to churn a higher profit.But until then, I have no choice but to hide, I can upskill and get as good as I want, and believe me I will try to, but there's going to be an inflection point where I can't hide anymore, and by then who knows what the world will look like.But do any other juniors sort of feel this way, this sort of existential dread, but also acknowledgement that that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles?

My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them.

So there's minimal career growth here.But apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)But yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.So I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that.

1q1g8s3,Not sure I want to transition to manager because of toxic younger coworker,Cheap-Sparrow,cscareerquestions,"I (31m) am the tech lead of a small ""sub team"". We have 3 different groups reporting to the same manager. This manager is not a software engineer. I work at a FAANG company.My coworker (25m) is incredibly toxic. They have had multiple blow ups at others and myself. They won't use jira, they won't make merge requests, and every meeting with them is like walking on eggshells. They are late with all their code and it's very buggy. In order to not go through the MR process this coworker created their own repo and pushes directly to main. When we asked them to combine repos they get very agitated. We asked them to start making MRs for review and they flat out refuse and it causes the meetings to become very tense. My manager doesn't understand why merge requests are important and sees no issue with the coworker's behavior. We recently hired 2 new senior engineers. Within 1 month, both engineers have had issues with this person. They are both actively involved in the behavioral coaching of this person. One new hire told me ""this guy is the single worst behaved engineer I've ever worked with."" He expects me, as tech lead, to deal with this situation. I think that's understandable but I have strict instructions to not get involved.I asked my manager to affirm my position as tech lead so I can get this coworker to make MRs and document their designs. My manager said ""No, if I do that then [coworker] will lose their shit and this is a really delicate situation right now.""This young coworker hates me in particular. Probably because I am in charge? My manager has asked me to stay out of it so he can coach this guy himself. My manager told me ""I've never met someone like this in my entire career. I am completely flummoxed and I have no idea what to do.""During one very public blow up, my manager was slacking me privately saying ""I'm confused why he's mad"" and ""just drop [this requirement]. You're right but we need him to feel like he's saving face"".The approach that we're taking is to let this coworker fail on his own. We aren't supposed to save their code when we find bugs, we aren't supposed to push for improvements. We are supposed to let them fail so they realize they need help. Our project is off track.One of the new engineers told me they are having a ""very hard time"" on the team because of this person. I feel a responsibility to respond to that but I have strict instructions to stay out of it. ***Okay. So here's my question.I'm being positioned to become the manager of this team. I said No a year ago because this engineer would have been my only report. My manager thinks I have the wrong attitude and ""[I] need to work with [coworker] because we can't just give up on everyone under the age of 30"". I think this person probably needs to be PIPed and let go. At my previous company (also faang) this would have resulted in a pip a long time ago, both for the attitude but also the sheer lack of deliverables.I can stay on the IC ladder and climb this way, but then a new manager will be hired. This hurts my chances of moving into management later. It also annoys my boss who wants me to just deal with the engineer by coaching instead of a PIP.* Should I take the manager position and have this person as my report, knowing my hands are tied when dealing with them? Or should I try to stay as an engineer?* Do I have an obligation to work with this person, like my boss is telling me? Or is this situation already beyond what is acceptable in the workplace?",85,0.89,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q1g8s3/not_sure_i_want_to_transition_to_manager_because/,2026-01-01 21:52:48,2026-01-07 01:49:59

1q060x6,Feeling overwhelmed as an entry SWE. Looking to vent / for advice.,PokaHatsu,cscareerquestions,"My entire team is filled with senior developers and I am the only recent entry hire. When I was interning, there was another entry developer that stayed on for around two years but left due to no promotion (they said he kinda sucked delivery wise).I am told I do good work and meet expectations, I expect a promotion this year after a year of work post grad. But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. We have little to no documentation. So anytime I am introduced to new tech or systems, my seniors really do hand hold me, to which I am appreciative of. I am not the type that asks the same questions over and over, I just need to see it once throughly and I can replicate what they've taught me.The problem is, after a year of this siloed style of work, I am getting burnt out. I can not stand coding. There have been multiple occasions for multiple projects where I have stayed at work alone and extremely late, staying until 8-10pm, just typing away at my computer. Recently I have been tasked with developing an entire web app alone. It's functionality seems simple but no application meant for production is ever simple. We are understaffed, so there is nobody else to divy up project tasks with. I've asked if we have any plans to get more entry hires on the team and it is always met with a soft no, the company is on a hiring freeze, economy yada yada.I talk with my friends from uni who are all working. Their teams practice agile and scrum philosophies, and their coding tasks are divided up for multipe team members. They love their jobs. Their eyes bulge when I tell them about my work load and my work effort. I always feel unfortunate when I hear about how lucky they have been, but really, it sounds like those types of tech teams are the standard and I am the unlucky one to have landed in an underdeveloped team. Senior developers can afford to ignore a team dynamic like this and still be successful in it.In my eyes, saying that this is too much work is basically telling them I am not up for the job and I might as well quit honestly. I know I can handle it, I mean I am meeting their latest expectation for an entire web application on my own, but I do not want to handle this anymore. It used to make me so happy to run an application and see the results of my hard work in action, but I genuinely can't even stand opening visual studio anymore.With how bad the job market is, I am scared to walk away. But I know if I continue to eat my feelings about this, I might turn impulsive and quit without any plan for my career or cut ties in a bad way.

What can I do?",WistfulHopes,cscareerquestions,"I'm 23 years old, and I've had several part time/contract jobs for indie game development studios, and a wealth of programming projects. However, I have never had a full-time job. Unfortunately, my current part-time job has had struggles with finances, leaving me unable to afford paying bills for myself and my long-distance girlfriend without posting on social media begging for donations, even with both of us having part-time jobs. I've been searching for a job as a programmer for 3 years now, with no luck due to the major crash in both the game development and general software scene.I don't have a degree, but I've taught myself programming over the last 5 years and have what I'd consider pretty decent knowledge for a junior. I have 5 years of C++ and Python and 4 years of C#. I'm also quite experienced in Unreal Engine, and to a lesser degree, Unity. Additionally, I am versed in x86 and ARM assembly, as I spend a lot of time reverse engineering binaries in IDA Pro/Ghidra/Binary Ninja. However, I'm struggling to find jobs that meet my relatively lower-level language experience while hiring a junior dev in terms of workplace experience. Game development and malware analysis are probably where I'd do best, and I could definitely handle general software engineering, but the game development scene is obviously fucked, malware analysis jobs are extremely hard to come by, and my skillset doesn't include web development yet. I'd be fine with learning on the job, but it seems that these days, job postings require experience in almost every aspect to begin with.I'm aware that contacts are usually the best way to get a job in this industry, but all of my job-related contacts exist in the game dev sphere, and no one's hiring for roles that I'd meet in that scene at the moment. I don't have much connection to people in general software engineering or malware analysis. I cannot afford to travel even close distance due to lack of funds and physical disability, so I don't have much of a chance going to in-person developer meetups. My parents seem content to keep me stuck inside their house while having me pay rent monthly, so I cannot rely on them for funding or travel.This has obviously been taking a severe toll on my mental state, as I'm struggling to find work that pays me enough to allow me and my girlfriend to survive, let alone move in together. I'm pretty desperate for a job that pays half-decently, and due to my disability I don't think I could physically handle a minimum wage job, never mind the fact that it probably wouldn't be able to pay the bills where I live, around the Seattle area.

Future Projects are expected to be good (maybe closer to startup in terms of impact) but salary and my title might remain as is for years to come.But honestly, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m a bit underpaid, and on top of that, I’m pretty lonely here. While I have made friends with locals through sports activities, there's not a lot of community for people sharing my background (not from a typical immigrant country) compared to other prairie city I had moved from, and that’s starting to weigh on me.I’m thinking about moving to a different city perhaps BC, Alberta, Ottawa, maybe GTA.

1q1d23l,How do I stop feeling like I will never have a good career or will become jobless?,squalexy,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone!I'm 30, from Portugal, did a cs licence and master's and started working last year in a big 4, so I only have 1 year of experience doing data engineering. My goal has always been to be a versatile software engineer, I've always wanted to work with data, cloud, machine learning, devops (later in my career), qa and so on. But lately, my mind has been plagued with insecurities and I feel worried about my future. I'll try to provide as much context as possible.For starters, I have no idea where AI will take us and I'm starting to feel dependant on it after going through 4+ years without using it in college. The fun part of this field, for me, has always been to think and develop a solution to a problem, but I'm not a fast learner or fast thinker, and by the time I think of something, Copilot is giving me a much better answer in less than a minute. I don't know when and where to draw the line, when do I start to think ""Maybe I'm using too much AI now"" or ""I'm an engineer, I shouldn't be asking AI to help me solve this""?Second, I feel like this field is starting to become a bit of everything, everywhere, all at once. There's constantly a new tech or stack to learn, then there's AI that you either embrace or refuse (with no clear winner here), then you also have to learn stuff from other subfields because they lay off people and you have to do the job of two, and the list goes on. I get home tired from +8h of work, I don't want to look at a screen and think ""Oh let's build a fun project or learn a new stack!"". I do try to get as much cloud certificates (aws, gc etc) as possible, since our company provides us the vouchers, but that's as far as I can motivate me to go.Then, I also feel like I'm trapped in this job because it's a project lottery and the market isn't looking fun for juniors. I'm working on building agents for our company and while this feels very up to date, I'm afraid it's only another hype that will fade with time and not get much use in the future. Somehow, due to the fact that I'm not coding much, I feel like I'll unlearn everything I've worked on for the past few years (and I did forget most of the stuff from college already) and then I won't have the required skills for better jobs in the future.I also really dislike the country I live in because of our extremely high rent prices and very low salaries (a 1bedroom apt is 50% of my salary right now). This makes me want to move to another country, but I don't know if it might be a good fit, if the market is also terrible there or if I even have a shot with all the competition.Bottom line of all of this is: **I never know if what I'm doing will help me grow and prepare me for a better future, and I don't know what's the right path to follow because I'm in constant doubt and uncertainty. I can't get motivated to work because I don't know if what I'm doing is meaningful to my future and I can't focus on one thing at a time.**Have any of you felt like this or have any advice to help me address this?",17,0.79,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q1d23l/how_do_i_stop_feeling_like_i_will_never_have_a/,2026-01-01 19:43:49,2026-01-07 01:49:59

Got laid off in 2017, but just as I was starting to look for a new job, my father unexpectedly passed away, and I had to step away from engineering to help support a family real estate business. I was never really passionate about the business, and frankly had to teach myself everything to make it work. I've been able to keep the business afloat, but just barely, and as I'm looking to get married and have a family soon, I know the income from that business just won't be able to support a family. So I've decided to sell the business and try going back to SWE. The problem is, from what I can tell, the job market is horrible, and it's even worse with an 8 year gap in my resume. My background was primarily as a Java developer, but my last couple years at the trading firm I did a fair amount of work in Spark, so I've decided to lean into the data engineering angle and have been teaching myself modern Spark and cloud computing to brush up on my skills in my free time. I know I will probably have to start back at a level 1 or maybe 2 role given my resume gap, and I've already sent my resume out to a few companies I thought might be a good fit through linkedIn, but have gotten zero calls back.

I spoke with them because I am also interested in a cybersecurity career as well. While I enjoy writing software more, I feel cybersecurity will be a more secure career in the long term.The truth is that I will take any tech job I can get, for any salary above minimum wage. But I understand that I need to have more specific goals and a plan. So I’m leaning towards committing to cybersecurity, creating a 5 year plans. As for what area in cybersecurity, I don’t know, but I’m thinking DevSecOps or other software security roles.My understanding is that cybersecurity is not an intro role and I need to work on personal project + certifications -> help desk role -> IT role -> more cyber security focused role.There’s so many certifications out there, I was recommend ISC2 to start with by the person I spoke to. I’m a little nervous about how expensive most certifications are, and ISC2 has an annual fee. What have I done so far:I have a portfolio with 3 demos for apps I made , some using ML. For example I made a custom pipeline that predicts if someone will be approved a bank loan based on historical data.

After dabbling in various areas that tech has to offer through internships and projects, I became interested in building the systems/infrastructure behind the AI/ML models that are in use nowadays. However, I couldn't find much information online on what this role even does because it seems relatively new and highly specialized. I am hoping to gather insight from industry professionals on things like:1. Is AI/ML Infrastructure basically just DevOps/MLOps? Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)? 2. Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too. 3. Is a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality. 4. On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here? 5.

1q5kyud,Is technical assessment prep the only way to level up?,Nsxd9,cscareerquestions,"Hey all, I work at a place right now that I’ve been at since they were a tiny company (500k-1m) in profit and now do 100X that in the same span. I have a total of 4YOE.I’ve seen this place grow, contributed to its growth, and talked to stakeholders about next steps and actions (ideas) for how we can grow, interview processes, etc. Although the issue is our tech stack is quite…basic? No AWS or containers, a CMS, NextJs, some proxy software, tags/pixel work, and little tools here and there that aren’t really too popular.I’ve been wanting to level up to a better salary, and keep seeing LC. I struggle to get interviews, and when I do I feel like I fail to do LC but personally just don’t have time for that. For many reasons I’m looking at masters to switch fields, I don’t think I’m very good at what I do and just make it work.I’ve showed people my resume and they say it’s not horrible and I should be at least getting interviews due to my experiences at the place. With a lot going on I’m trying to either find a tech related job that’s not coding or level up my salary from another tech job.My question would be, is my only path to a better salary through LC? Is that like 80-90% of the industry/companies? I’m now looking for gigs in tech that’s not entirely coding (junior spots I guess and yes it would be a salary hit but might be better than staying still here), but still open to leveling up in coding positions itself, is all I can do to upgrade there just projects and leetcode?

1q41ui2,Advice for an engineer,TheKotovski,cscareerquestions,"I think I come to the point where I am genuinely confused about what’s going on in my career, so I wanted to ask some advice and perspective of other people on how do I approach my future developmentLittle background/backstory: 18 y.o Living in Eastern Europe, studying at one of the best universities in the country at CS-Decision Making major. Got hired at the end of first year for one of side projects of community member. Fell in love with coding and worked really hard through the summer. Afterwards got an offer into well-established YC-backed company and currently working there as Software Engineer.And honestly - I love every bit of it. But I see two very big problems at the horizon which am not sure how to tackle yet:\- Working with AI is too much. Since I started my serious commitment on a very early stage kind of project - I got used to the principle of speed is the key. And because of that I did a lot of coding with AI (cursor). I didn’t cut it off correctly early enough, and now when I am trying to write code on my own - it takes much more time I feel like I am falling out if industry-needed pace. I can’t say that I am vibe-coding, because I am still very responsible for my code, and I know precisely how something is implemented, and I am not doing “Claude pls code feature” as well, but still like I am feeling that I won’t be able to write code if I don’t have access to AI instruments. So there’s my first question. How normal it is? How do you define an edge between AI slob and speed ups that AI can provide?\- Vector of further development? I am trying to study the stuff beyond my actual responsibilities, and I feel like my next big choice is choice of supplementary skills: doing distribution (sales, marketing, PMF and all that kind of stuff) VS digging deeper into architecture, devops and deeply engineering kinds of topics.Argument of first approach for me are the fact that I can be more independent, but that’s not something I particularly like.Arguments for the second approach are the fact that I love it, but again I love it because I am able to move with fast pace because I have AI. Also, I am not sure how relevant those skills are compared to distribution (e.g Technical guy who can sell is much more desirable part of a startup than just deeply technical guy)Your feedback is very important to me and is truly appropriated",6,0.87,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q41ui2/advice_for_an_engineer/,2026-01-04 21:13:49,2026-01-07 01:49:59

1q3d3ab,Going through multiple hiring cycles at the same company within short period of time,MIY55,cscareerquestions,"am about to start applying to new jobs again after being at my first job out of school for 4 years. My question is this, if you apply for multiple SWE positions at a company and one recruiter gets back to you first and you start the process but fail at say the 2nd round, if another recruiter for the other position you applied to at the same place reaches out could you just start the process again and hope you get a better problem that you can solve. I am asking this because a few years ago I did this scenario where I went through one cycle and got to the 2nd round but did not pass, then that same week another recruiter for the other position I applied to reached out to start. Being the naive new grad I was, I thought I was being a good boy by being honest and telling the recruiter I had already gone through the process recently and if I could still proceed with his cycle. Obviously he did not let me lol. Looking back I am wondering if I should just keep my mouth shut and not said anything. I know this might vary per company depending on how generic early round interviews and if they keep you in a general pool and then narrowing the team at the end vs a place where each job posting going down separate cycles. I know companies have a cooldown period when you can apply again but I’m wondering if you fail early enough in the cycle could you test your chances again in this scenario.I would appreciate hearing peoples’ experiences on this, thanks!",4,0.76,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3d3ab/going_through_multiple_hiring_cycles_at_the_same/,2026-01-04 01:57:39,2026-01-07 01:49:59
1q1uoym,When did you commit to leadership vs technical development?,ArticleHaunting3983,cscareerquestions,"I’m late 20s now, psychology & data science degrees and considering a maths masters.Worked throughout education. Initially started as a IC analyst, later promoted to senior/engineer. I spent the majority of my time at that company in a hybrid technical/leadership role (5 years). Moved to a government department in 2021 as a data scientist, quickly promoted to leading the DS team and worked in senior DS leadership positions since, mostly management responsibilities with some technical data science work. At the moment I wear a lot of hats and am good at everything, but not a specialist in anything. Basically anything remotely linked to data becomes my remit. Plus, a lot of my time gets soaked up in HR issues & firefighting. so I can’t focus as much with being a technical specialist as I am spread thin although I’ve always wanted to progress as a data engineer. I have had a good career with executive level responsibilities and I am wondering if I should just fully pivot into pure leadership now, and maybe make it a goal to get a “head of” or director position in the next few years. I’m hesitant because I still feel fairly young and that I have more to give when it comes to engineering but I’m not sure what the best path is for me. It’s just becoming abundantly clear that I can’t do it all and I probably should narrow my focus.
