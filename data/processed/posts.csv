1pyecpd,Mid Senior Data Engineer struggling in this job market. Looking for honest advice.,This_Bird6184,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I wanted to share my situation and get some honest perspective from this community.I’m a data engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience building and maintaining production pipelines. Most of my work has been around Spark (batch + streaming), Kafka, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS and GCP), and large-scale data systems used by real business teams. I’ve worked on real-time event processing, data migrations, and high-volume pipelines, not just toy projects.Despite that, the current job hunt has been brutal.I’ve been applying consistently for months. I do get callbacks, recruiter screens, and even technical rounds. But I keep getting rejected late in the process or after hiring manager rounds. Sometimes the feedback is vague. Sometimes there’s no feedback at all. Roles get paused. Headcount disappears. Or they suddenly want an exact internal tech match even though the JD said otherwise.What’s making this harder is the pressure outside work. I’m managing rent, education costs, and visa timelines, so the uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I know I’m capable, I know I’ve delivered in real production environments, but this market makes you question everything.I’m trying to understand a few things:•Is this level of rejection normal right now even for experienced data engineers?•Are companies strongly preferring very narrow stack matches over fundamentals?•Is the market simply oversaturated, or am I missing something obvious in how I’m interviewing or positioning myself?•For those who recently landed roles, what actually made the difference?I’m not looking for sympathy. I genuinely want to improve and adapt. If the answer is “wait it out,” I can accept that. If the answer is “your approach is wrong,” I want to fix it.Appreciate any real advice, especially from people actively hiring or who recently went through the same thing.Thanks for reading.",90,0.92,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pyecpd/mid_senior_data_engineer_struggling_in_this_job/,2025-12-29 05:58:33,2025-12-30 01:48:25

1pxu6ts,Are we too deep into Snowflake?,stuckplayingLoL,dataengineering,"My team uses Snowflake for majority of transformations and prepping data for our customers to use. We sort of have a medallion architecture going that is solely within Snowflake. I wonder if we are too vested into Snowflake and would like to understand pros/cons from the community. The majority of the processing and transformations are done in Snowflake. I anticipate we deal with 5TB of data when we add up all the raw sources we pull today.Quick overview of inputs/outputs:EL with minor transformations like appending a timestamp or converting from csv to json. This is done with AWS Fargate running a batch job daily and pulling from the raw sources. Data is written to raw tables within a schema in Snowflake, dedicated to be the 'stage'. But we aren't using internal or external stages.When it hits the raw tables, we call it Bronze. We use Snowflake streams and tasks to ingest and process data into Silver tables. Task has logic to do transformations.From there, we generate Snowflake views scoped to our customers. Generally views are created to meet usecases or limit the access.Majority of our customers are BI users that use either tableau or power bi. We have some app teams that pull from us but not as common as BI teams.I have seen teams not use any snowflake features and just handle all transformations outside of snowflake. But idk if I can truly do a medallion architecture model if not all stages of data sit in Snowflake. Cost is probably an obvious concern. Wonder if alternatives will generate more savings.Thanks in advance and curious to see responses.",39,0.93,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pxu6ts/are_we_too_deep_into_snowflake/,2025-12-28 15:36:35,2025-12-30 01:48:25

As long as the the final metric looks positive it's going through get thumbs up without further review. It's like simply asking the question puts the responsibility back on the business and if we don't ask they can just point fingers. They're the only ones interfacing with management so of course they spin everything as the engineers fault when things go wrong. This is what bothers me the most, if anyone bothered to actually look the failure is painfully obvious. Now I simply push shit out with a smile and no one questions it.

1py90n4,[EU] 4 YoE Data Engineer - Stuck with a 6-month notice period and being outpaced by new-hire salaries. Should I stay for the experience?,Remarkable_Result596,dataengineering,"Hi All,​Looking for a bit of advice on a career struggle. I like my job quite a lot—it has given me learning opportunities that I don’t think would have materialized elsewhere—but I’ve hit some roadblocks.The Context​I’m 26 and based in the EU. I have a Master’s in Economics/Statistics and about 4 years of experience in Data (strictly Data Engineering for the last 2).​My current role has been very rewarding because I’ve had the initiative to really expand my stack. I’m the ""Databricks guy"" (Admin, Unity Catalog, PySpark, ...) within my team, but lately, I’ve been primarily focused on building out a hybrid data architecture. Specifically, I’ve been focusing on the on-premise side:​Infrastructure: Setting up an on-prem Dagster deployment on Kubernetes. Also django based apps, POCing tools like OpenMetadata.​Modern Data Stack (On-prem): Experimenting with DuckDB, Polars, dbt, and dlthub to make our local setup click with our cloud environments (Azure/GCP/Fabric, onprem even).​Upcoming: A project for real-time streaming with Debezium and Kafka. I’d mostly be a consumer here, but it’s a setup I really want to see through. Definitely have a room impact the architecture there and downstream.​The Problem​Even though I value the ""builder"" autonomy, two things are weighing on me:​The Salary Ceiling: I’m somewhat bound by my starting salary. I recently learned that a new hire in a lower position is earning about 10% more than me. It’s not a massive gap, but it’s frustrating given the difference in impact. My manager kind of acknowledges my value but says getting HR to approve a 30-50% ""market adjustment"" is unlikely.​The 6-Month Notice: This is the biggest blocker. I get reach-outs for roles paying 50-100% more and I’ve usually done well in initial stages, but as soon as the 6-month notice period comes up, I’m effectively disqualified. I probably can't move unless I resign first.​The Dilemma​I definitely don’t think I’m an expert in everything and believe there is still a whole lot of unique learning to squeeze out of my current role, and I would love to see this through. I’m torn on whether to:​Keep learning: Stay for another year to ""tie it all together"" and get the streaming/Kafka experience on my CV.​Risk it: Resign without a plan just to free myself from the 6-month notice period and become ""employable"" again.​Do you think it's worth sticking it out for the environment and the upcoming projects, or am I just letting myself be underpaid while my tenure in the market is still fresh?​TL;DR: 4 YoE DE with a heavy focus on on-prem MDS and Databricks. I have great autonomy, but I’m underpaid compared to new hires and ""trapped"" by a 6-month notice period. Should I stay for the learning or quit to find a role that pays market rate?",13,0.82,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1py90n4/eu_4_yoe_data_engineer_stuck_with_a_6month_notice/,2025-12-29 01:42:32,2025-12-30 01:48:25

I’m a senior data engineer and have been heads-down in one role for a while. It’s been about \~5 years since I last seriously was in the market for new opportunities, and I’m back in the market now for similar senior/staff-level roles. The area I feel most out of date on is **system design/data architecture rounds**.For those who’ve gone through recent DE rounds in the last year or two:* In system design rounds, are they expecting a **tool-specific design** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, etc.), or is it better to start with a **vendor-agnostic architecture** and layer tools later?* How deep do you usually go? High-level flow + tradeoffs, or do they expect concrete decisions around storage formats, orchestration patterns, SLAs, backfills, data quality, cost controls, etc.?* Do they prefer to lean more toward “design a data platform” or “design a specific pipeline/use case” in your experience?I’m trying to calibrate how much time to spend refreshing specific tools vs practicing generalized design thinking and tradeoff discussions.

1pwccv7,Who owns data modeling when there’s no BI or DE team? (Our product engineering team needs help),Groove-Theory,dataengineering,"**Long ass post sorry. Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR questions if you don't want the backstory.**# Backstory:Howdy... not entirely sure this is the right subreddit for this (between here and the BI sub) but figured I'd start here.Ok so... I'm a tech lead for our engineers working on our core product in a startup. I am NOT on the data engineering or BI side of things, but my involvement in BI matters is growing, and this is me sanity-checking what I see.Our data stack is I think ok for a startup. We source our data, which is mostly our main Postgres DB plus with a few other third party tracking sources, with 5X into our staging tables in BigQuery. Then we use dbt to bucket our data into dimensions, fact tables, and what are called ""reporting tables"" which are the highest 1-to-1 tables that are used in whatever presentation layer we use (which is Looker). Our ingestion/bootstrap logic all exists in a GitHub repo.This entire system was originally designed and put together by a very experienced senior data engineer when we were in a scaling phase. Unfortunately, they were laid-off some time ago cuz of runway issues before they could completely finish everything. Since that time, our management has continually pushed for additional and additional reporting, but we haven’t replaced that position. And it's getting worse.Today, we have ONE business analyst (not on the eng team) with no tech skills, having learned SQL basics from ChatGPT. They create reports as best as they can, but idk how correct they are in querying stuff from the BI layer (frankly I don't care tbh, not the eng team's concern)Anyway, the business comes to us with a regular set of new reporting requirements for tables, but many of these do not make sense. At all.For example: *""I’d like a list of all cars, but also like a column for how much spaghetti people eat per day, and then a column of every fish in the sea, and we need a dashboard for the fish-spaghetti-car metric per month ""*. That kind of bullshitSince we still have a reduced team post-layoffs, product management has started working on sprint stories for any product improvement we do such as *“Create a reporting table for the spaghetti bullshit above""* despite the underlying data structure being ambiguous or incorrect (and not being a spaghetti company). Which I think is pretty fucking weird that they're telling us what the actual implementation should be.We, as software engineers, are comfortable designing application schemas and writing database queries against Postgres (and the PG layer is well formed imo). We, however, are not professionals in business intelligence, and we are facing more and more questions about dimensional design, report structure, which are questions we feel uncomfortable answering.The most aggravating part of this process is the business will attempt almost anything rather than considering adding another senior BI or data engineering person to the staff. They have attempted to draw general engineering talent into doing business intelligence tasks when that isn’t their technical niche. They have attempted to use short-term or lower-quality consultants. Many times, they have simply pressed onward with what we understand to be an iffy model.Increasingly I spend my time fighting off requests against our team or explaining to others why some of those requests are simply nonsensical (in a polite manner of course) but I feel I'm slowly losing that fight over time, and my head of Product/Eng is not helping me here.I always knew the business was crazy when just dealing with product AC, but I've realized they really go fucking bonkers when you talk to them about anything related to a dashboard.# My questions to ya'll*(skip to here if you didn't want to read my sob story above)*My questions are about whether we have a common concept of ""good"" data modeling and who really is responsible. The engineering department is picking up all of this slack, and BI isn’t really our expertise. So...* When is the time for the BI/data modeling necessarily a full-time endeavor and not something that should be accomplished as part of the product engineering team, if at all? Are there any heuristics that you have observed for smaller startups?* Is there ever value in planning or building ""bad"" or ugly reporting tables to meet current business requirements, or is it almost always harmful?* If leadership wants speed and they do not have data modeling knowledge, what data governance patterns work well for you?* How do you communicate concepts of dimensional modeling to non-technical business audiences in a way that leads to lasting behavior change? (If at all lol)* Finally, if leadership is flatly unwilling to engage experienced BI/DE talent, then what is the least worst alternative you've encountered?I'm way outside my lane here as a non-DE so any advice is greatly appreciated.

1pv9j7y,SevenDB : Reactive and Scalable Determininstically,shashanksati,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I've been building [SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB), for most of this year and I wanted to share what we’re working on and get genuine feedback from people who are interested in databases and distributed systems.*Sevendb is a distributed cache with pub/sub capabilities and configurable fsync.*# What problem we’re trying to solveA lot of modern applications need \*\*live data\*\*:* dashboards that should update instantly* tickers and feeds* systems reacting to rapidly changing stateToday, most systems handle this by **polling-** clients repeatedly asking the database “*has**this changed yet?*”. That wastes CPU, bandwidth, and introduces latency and complexity.Triggers do help a lot here , but as soon as multiple machine and low latency applications enter , they get diceyscaling databases horizontally introduces another set of problems:* nondeterministic behavior under failures* subtle bugs during retries, reconnects, crashes, and leader changes* difficulty reasoning about correctnessSevenDB is our attempt to tackle both of these issues together.# What SevenDB doesAt a high level, SevenDB is:**1. Reactive by design**Instead of clients polling, clients can \*subscribe\* to values or queries.When the underlying data changes, updates are pushed automatically.Think:\* “Tell me whenever this value changes” instead of ""polling every few milliseconds""This reduces wasted work(compute , network and even latency) and makes real-time systems simpler and cheaper to run.**2. Deterministic execution**The same sequence of logical operations always produces the same state.Why this matters:* crash recovery becomes predictable* retries don’t cause weird edge cases* multi-replica behavior stays consistent* bugs become reproducible instead of probabilistic nightmaresWe explicitly test determinism by running randomized workloads hundreds of times across scenarios like:* crash before send / after send* reconnects (OK, stale, invalid)* WAL rotation and pruning\* 3-node replica symmetry with electionsIf behavior diverges, that’s a bug.\*\*3. Raft-based replication\*\*We use Raft for consensus and replication, but layer deterministic execution on top so that replicas don’t just \*agree\*—they behave identically.The goal is to make distributed behavior boring and predictable.# Interesting partWe're an in-memory KV store , One of the fun challenges in SevenDB was making emissions fully deterministic. We do that by pushing them into the state machine itself. No async “surprises,” no node deciding to emit something on its own. If the Raft log commits the command, the state machine produces the exact same emission on every node. Determinism by construction.But this compromises speed significantly , so what we do to get the best of both worlds is:On the durability side: a SET is considered successful only after the Raft cluster commits it—meaning it’s replicated into the in-memory WAL buffers of a quorum. Not necessarily flushed to disk when the client sees “OK.”Why keep it like this? Because we’re taking a deliberate bet that plays extremely well in practice:• **Redundancy buys durability** In Raft mode, our real durability is replication. Once a command is in the memory of a majority, you can lose a minority of nodes and the data is still intact. The chance of most of your cluster dying before a disk flush happens is tiny in realistic deployments.• **Fsync is the throughput killer** Physical disk syncs (fsync) are orders slower than memory or network replication. Forcing the leader to fsync every write would tank performance. I prototyped batching and timed windows, and they helped—but not enough to justify making fsync part of the hot path. (There is a durable flag planned: if a client appends durable to a SET, it will wait for disk flush. Still experimental.)• **Disk issues shouldn’t stall a cluster** If one node's storage is slow or semi-dying, synchronous fsyncs would make the whole system crawl. By relying on quorum-memory replication, the cluster stays healthy as long as most nodes are healthy.So the tradeoff is small: yes, there’s a narrow window where a simultaneous majority crash could lose in-flight commands. But the payoff is huge: predictable performance, high availability, and a deterministic state machine where emissions behave exactly the same on every node.In distributed systems, you often bet on the failure mode you’re willing to accept.

Assuming the Iceberg sink connector is out of the picture. Here are some proposals and I want to hear any tradeoffs between them. S3 Sink connector - lands the data in s3 in parquet files in bronze layer. Then have a secondary glue job that reads new parquet files and writes them to Iceberg tables. This can be done every 2 mins? Can I setup something like a microbatch glue job approach here for this? What I don't like about this is there are two components here and there is a batch/polling approach to check for changes and write to Iceberg. Glue streaming - Glue streaming job that reads the kafka topics then directly writes to Iceberg. A lot more boilerplate code compared to the configuration code above. Also not near real time, job needs to be scheduled. Need to see how to handle failures more visibly. While near real time would be ideal, 2-3 mins delay is ok for landing in bronze. Ordering is important. The same data also will need to be cleaned for insertion in silver tables, transformed and loaded via rest apis to another service (hopefully in another 2-3 mins). Also thinking to handle idempotency in the silver layer or does that need to be handled in bronze?One thing to consider also is compaction optimizations. Our data lands in parquet in \~100 kb size with many small files per hour (\~100-200 files in each hourly partition dir). Should I be setting my partition differently?

The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders.*The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.*This is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules.The app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.Add new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.**Target Audience:**The app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool.**Comparison:**Most other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store.

Felt that I got in by sheer luck. Academically, I’m not smart. I was generally a B-student back in CS college. But I did enjoy SWE mods like networks, distributed systems, or even learning algorithms. Over the past 3 years, my job has been rather chill and I don’t read outside of work. I didn’t learn much while doing frontend for 2 years - my code looks more or less the same because frontend frameworks are very abstracted at my company.Now that I’m in my 3rd year without promotion, I’ve been looking for jobs. I’m terrible at Leetcode, not good at systems design, my problem-solving skills aren’t great either so I’ve been failing interviews here and there. Sometimes I get frontend interviews, which will test JavaScript or React or even HTML/CSS, where each language/framework has a lot of concepts to learn about. I feel that there’s endless to study for and I’m fighting against a bar that is high but I can’t even see where it is.It’s been demoralising. I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. I have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. But it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.As an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.I think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using.

I understand the pressure of been unemployed, undergrad or still learning and wanting to build something that becomes the key to getting out of that situation.I’m fortunate to have a job that combines IT support and some backend work. While it’s not as difficult as other situations, I still want to keep improving to reach better roles. And I’ve been there too. Day after day trying to figure out what to build to improve, and even so I believe the previous advice still applies.So, what is that project that interest me so much and made me change my mind? Just a self-hosting e-book library. Sorry if I disappointed someone (I'm not). I got a Kindle a few weeks ago and since I also like home-labs and self-hosting I looked for an app, but every one feels like artificial and not personal, and as a book lover, I want my library to feel personal, something that I truly own, so I decided to build one.You may think, what can an e-book library teach? Well, is not about the specific case of my app, but more of the concept/problem itself that needs to be implemented or solved that can be applied for many contexts. For example: what if an user have 5000 books? How should I store the covers vs basic metadata (cache vs database)? How can I process all that books in seconds (concurrency & parallelism to improve performance)? How can I avoid the rate limits of an external api? How do I keep the database in sync if the user manually deletes a file? What if I implement an internal ddbb back up tool? Can I pass all the books from kindle to the library directly?And even if I knew about some of that questions before, applying it yourself will always teach you more that just theory.Some people will think that thinking about all that stuff early in the project may be over-engineering, but who cares, is your project you can do whatever you can with it according to your objectives, not someone else ideas. So thanks to everyone who has always given that advice, and for those who are in the situation I mentioned, it’s better to build a project that seems simple on the surface, but where you really dive deep than creating something that looks good on paper but you’re not invested in.",27,0.86,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1px6y5g/stop_thinking_about_what_project_is_the_best_to/,2025-12-27 19:55:28,2025-12-30 01:48:26

I've done this several times to pass arrays of different lengths into general purpose functions (along with their lengths) for software that I've written, but although I thought I had a grasp on the inner workings, I've found I'm unable to fully explain what's going on.Here's my understanding, using a simple example. #include using std::cout; float averageScores(float* scores, int length) {     float sum;         for (int i=0; i<length; i++)     {         sum = sum + scores[i];     }     float average = sum/length;     return average; } int main() {     float testScores [] = {81.2, 90, 91.8, 76.3, 78.4};     int numScores = sizeof(testScores)/sizeof(testScores[0]);     float classAverage = averageScores(testScores, numScores);     cout<<classAverage;     return 0; } Might not be the most efficient way to do this but you get the idea. What I've done is passed an array of test scores into a function that calculates their average. However, to my understanding, when I declare an array variable, it's actually interpreted as something like &testScores\[0\], or the memory location of the first float variable in testScores. First question: the entire array is stored at that memory location, correct? So if the memory location is something like 0x5ffe60, that's where the entire array is stored?Now, in my function I have declared the parameters float\* scores and int length. float\* scores is a pointer. So, this to me seems like creating a pointer to a memory address, similar to the classic example folks usually show when discussing pointers:int x = 6; int \*pX = \&x;Where pX is a pointer to the memory location at which the value of x is stored. So, similarly, it seems that float \*scores = &testScores\[0\].Now, my ultimate question: given that C++ is particular about variable types matching, does this mean that &x and &testScores\[0\] are ""pointer types?"" Like, \* and & are just inverses of the same variable type, and that's why I can write a function that expects a pointer and pass it a memory address.So both \*scores and &testScores\[0\] are float\* numbers? I think I'm missing something because my explanation feels inconsistent. If anyone could clarify what I have right and wrong about this, that would be greatly appreciated.

I originally self tought for one year, it was okay but I was curious about more and enrolled for this and a diploma. It is free, due to my country.So, my problem. My main issue is how we learn stuff and the testing model. In classes like Calculus, electronics, or physics, you can add more, it feels like we just memorize algorithms to solve questions. I can learn the 'why' from external sources, for example books or Prof.Leonard for calculus but at uni, if you solve 100 past years questions or questions from books, you still can get a good grade, without truly knowing the material. This means that you cannot solve a different kind of problem that involves the integral that you learned 1 week ago and passed the exam, because you didn't understand what you doing, just memorize algorithm.I have many friends, even when they got a good grade, they still lack an understanding. I don't want to be same but what's point? Am I right to feel this way or I'm being ignorant?

Content creation doesn't really scratch the same itch.It's like with content creation you make things that people watch but how impactful is that?

I’m looking for some serious advice on how to push myself forward when I feel like I’m stuck at a standstill. To give you some context: I’ve never considered myself a natural at tech. I didn’t do any advanced prep before starting my degree, and honestly, I struggled through my first year. I managed to pass, but looking back, I realize I was just surviving, not actually learning.This year, due to personal circumstances, I had to switch to online classes. It’s been a disaster for my learning style. My professor primarily uploads modules and assessments without live sessions, leaving me to teach myself through YouTube and documentation. Here is the predicament: In trying to teach myself, I realized I’ve forgotten a lot from my first year. Even the most basic concepts have slipped away. I’ve decided to ""start from scratch"" while still trying to keep up with my current 2nd year workload. I’m currently grinding through Java learning strings, characters, loops, and operators while simultaneously staring down a mountain of Networking and SQL coursework including C++ and other programming languages that we’ve studied in my first year that I have to run through again, I feel completely overwhelmed. My progress feels incredibly slow. I see others online who seem to grasp these concepts effortlessly, and I can’t help but feel a deep sense of envy and doubt. I’m questioning if I’m even making progress or if I’m just not cut out for this. I’m not planning on changing my course I genuinely want to be good at this but the anxiety that I’ll never ""get it"" is starting to take over. I know going back to face-to-face classes eventually will help, but I also know that won't fix the fact that I'm currently starting from zero.Has anyone else felt like they were ""starting over"" in the middle of their degree?

1punt23,Strategy for learning digital logic,SadFriendship1255,learnprogramming,"For a few years I have been trying to learn programming, without much success. I've always been curious about how computers and digital electronics in general work. My background isn't technical although I work for a software company where people are nice and usually happy to answer noob questions when they have the time. Over the years, I have learned some basics: Very basic Java and C++, what logic gates are, been messing around with Arduino, breadboards and chips, binary numbers, algebra and a bit of precalculus. But whatever information I have gathered seem pretty trivial and overall I feel like I don't ""get it"".Recently someone recommended that I start from the basics again and just focus on one gate per month before I go any further: write the truth table, the HDL description for that gate, and what the gate is made of (for example an OR gate is two NOT and one NAND gates) every day of the month and then do the same for the next gate the following month, until I have covered all the gates. The goal being that this becomes ""automatic"" for me.I am 38 and want to learn out of interest/hobby although part of me is secretly hoping to either make a bit of money with it in the future or even a new career. But I'm not in a rush and willing to take the time to make sure I understand what I'm doing.What's your take on the recommendation that was given to me?

1pxmowh,C : Passing function pointers as argument,Chief_Miller,learnprogramming,"Hello guys,I'm spending my Christmas week brushing up on my C and I decided to go back to source material : ie Kernighan & Ritchie. Probably one of the best programming book I've read so far. Clear and concise (most of the time...).And even if there are sometimes sometimes some example that require you to spend a few minutes studying the code, you usually have been provided with the tools to understand them.However I'm having trouble understanding one line of their code example for function pointers. Here's the code : #include #include #define MAXLINE 5000 /* max #lines to be sorted */ char *lineptr[MAXLINES] /* pointer to text lines */ int readlines(char *lineptr[], int nlines); void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines); void qsort(void *lineptr[], int left, int right, int (*comp)(void *, void *)); int numcomp(char *, char *); /* sort input lines */ main (int argc, char *argv[]) { int nlines; /* number of input lines read */ int numeric; /* 1 if numeric sort */ if(argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], ""-n"") == 0) numeric = 1; if((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) >= 0){ qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1, (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp)); writelines(lineptr, nlines); return 0; } else { printf(""input too big to sort\n""); return 1; } }and here is the line I'm having trouble with : qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1, (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));I understand that the last argument to qsort is a function pointer allowing you to customize the behaviour of the sorting algorithm. That pointer needs to point to a function that take 2 pointers to void as argument and returns an int. I also understand that this part : **(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp)** is used to chose between the function **numcmp** and **strcmp** depending on if the **numeric** flag is set to 0 or not.The book tells us that using a function name like this (without parentheses) in a expression evaluates to the addresses of the functions, a bit like using & for variable name or using the name of an array. And so far, when passing a pointer as an argument to a function, we've been able to write **function(&variable);** as in **scanf(""%d"", &count);**So what's going on with **(int (\*)(void\*,void\*))** just before ? Is that type casting because the functions **numcmp** and **strcmp** are declared to take pointer to char as arguments? I think it is, but the book say nothing about it and the syntax is cryptic at best. I hope one of you guys could shed some lights on it.Merry Christmas and all the best to you all.",3,0.81,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pxmowh/c_passing_function_pointers_as_argument/,2025-12-28 08:49:13,2025-12-30 01:48:26

Yet business leaders just don’t get it and still cling to that philosophy as “something that works”, so they can save a buck.It’s called hiring a night shift, people. If you’re going to take on customers with 24/7 operations, guess what that means for your overhead? Yup, you’re going to have to pay to staff your company to be able to handle 24/7 operations, not just expect your day shift people to handle it all at night and still come in and work a full shift the next day on fumes. Hire an IRC and set it up. Staff it with good technical people. Expecting day shift people to be machines and handle night shift stuff with barely any extra pay or using “duties as assigned” as your excuse not to pay extra for it, is the fastest way to lose staff and lose your company and end up drowning in lawsuits.If you’re gonna refuse to do that, then you better be prepared to pay out the nose to your day shift folks to expect them to wake up in the middle of the night or interrupt a family moment to fix someone’s stupidity.

With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.A few clarifying points about my labels:* ""Reached out to my network"" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.* ""AI agent applied for me"": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).* ""Withdrew after accepting other offer"": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the ""Declined"" label after ""Offer"".I've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.My offers:Series A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon-------------------|--------------------|------accepted | declined | declined$205k base | $200k base | $188k baseno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonusOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-FriSome quick stats from the Sankey:* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had ""AI"" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.Overall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",119,0.97,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pty6o7/my_latest_job_search_after_getting_laid_off_for/,2025-12-23 16:26:47,2025-12-30 01:48:27

They brought in new execs and started stack ranking everyone. The bottom 10% is getting laid off every year now and no one is helping each other, everyone is out for themselves. I’ve thought about quitting but looking at the job market it seems very difficult right now. My old work friend quit and it’s been 6 months and he hasn’t found a job yet. Honestly I’ve just been waiting about getting laid off now. The only thing that is keeping me there is the lunch friends I made with others not on my team but the rest of the company has gone to shit. I keep thinking I’ll get fired tomorrow. I had an old work friend who got laid off and they just shut off his work laptop. They didn’t even tell him anything. I’ve just been checking my Workphone in case I got fired or not. Should I just quit or should I wait until I get laid off while applying to new companies?

1pypu6b,What jobs do people do after software engineering?,lol_fi,cscareerquestions,"I've been in this career for 6 years but I've been feeling like I'm falling behind my peers and people younger than me. I genuinely do not feel good at this anymore and fear for being able to keep up as AI is coming. I work in an aerospace/defense space and AI is coming a lot slower. I don't feel like I've learned as much as I should, and I recently had a baby and don't feel like I have hours to put in to learn and study outside of work. I feel regretful that others in my field and others are growing in their career and I'm stagnating and feel trapped. I'm 32 so I still have 35 years of career to go, even though it feels hard to start a new path when others have been growing in their path. My sister is getting ready to become a PRN and I feel so jealous! Although the nursing path would probably never have been open to me - she's been working night shifts in the ICU and I couldn't deal with the trauma and night schedule.

1puwtmr,"21M, CS + Data Science major unable to find full-time job, even in the NYC metro area. Am I doomed?",MarathonMarathon,cscareerquestions,"So I'm soon to become one of those ""unemployed CS majors"" everyone keeps talking about once I graduate. I've been struggling to find meaningful employment, and don't have a job lined up. The way things are currently heading, after graduation I'm likely just heading back to my mom's house and maybe working some shitty retail job with 0 upward mobility. This is a future some people (including some friends) from my high school have achieved without attending college, and if that's my future, it means my mom will have wasted 4 years on an expensive degree that ended up being worthless.I'm well aware that it only gets harder and harder to find a full-time job the longer you wait after graduating. Which is why I'm frightened of being jobless or underemployed once that happens, and then having an awkward gap in my resume to have to explain, which only gets more and more awkward the longer I wait.The roles I've been applying to include SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science. While my undergraduate internship grinds have been very hit-or-miss, I have some ""roundabout"" experience (multiple unpaid internships + paid research) on my resume, some of it ongoing (and my performance there has been satisfactory), which I've been told is enough to land me interviews, which I have. It's just that I've been struggling to pass these interviews. I've known people who've managed to hand-wave themselves in through interviews just by talking a bit, but I've somehow failed even one of those when given one (though that was partially my fault since my reference waved me through without even giving me the JD).My clear metric for ""success"" is having enough money to *be able to* move away from home and afford a non-shitty apartment if I wanted to (and in the event I don't, it'll be because the job is in my metro area, aka NYC). If I don't achieve this, I'll have failed. I wouldn't say I'm asking for much, and I feel like this is a quite reasonably low bar to clear, and if I don't clear it, I'm a failure.Now that it's Christmas already and I still don't have any kind of post-college offer in hand, things are not looking up. I've barely applied to any positions between Thanksgiving and Christmas and have secured 0 new interviews therein. I barely even grind Leetcode anymore, since it just makes me disappointed whenever I fail questions that are supposedly ""Easy"" or ""Medium"". If you gave me a Leetcode-style interview or OA right now, I'd probably fail it. I've yet to actually receive such an *interview* (OAs I have, with mixed performance), but I'm well aware that many companies do ask them. A lot of what I've failed so far is behavioral, though I've passed a few.I've received mixed messaging on whether to consider grad school. My parents aren't going to pay for it and I'll have to take out expensive loans if I do go for it. And I know cheap online programs like OMSCS exist, but I don't know if they're right or if it'll be too challenging, and I'm not even sure if it's something I'm seriously invested in either. The whole field just seems like a sinking ship with AI and all, and people seem to be right about there being no need to hire any more juniors.I just want to know what to do, because things seem absolutely grim, and people who've been through 2008 keep calling me entitled and telling me that the job market now isn't nearly as bad as 2008. Keep doing what I'm doing and hope something lands? But if nothing lands, what then? Certmaxx and pivot to IT?

I do ask questions to Claude but just basic syntax questions that I could just google but I never ask it to actually write code for me and copy paste it. I like to think there's still value in learning to code without AI but at this point, it looks like future engineers might not even need to understand coding technologies deeply because AI will keep improving and they'll basically just be AI prompters.What do you guys think?",86,0.87,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pwn4n2/am_i_just_wasting_my_my_free_time_by_avoiding_ai/,2025-12-27 03:11:06,2025-12-30 01:48:27
1pvf6oe,Are traditional engineering degrees safer than CS nowadays?,userh1bcr1lwg3,cscareerquestions,"I’m a first-year CS student, and honestly, the job market has been stressing me out. Between tech layoffs, market saturation, and the rapid rise of AI, it’s hard not to feel anxious about the future of this field.Luckily, I’m still a freshman, so if shifting to another degree would truly offer better job security and a more stable income, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider it.Don’t get me wrong: I genuinely love tech. I can see myself studying and working in this field long-term because of how vast and interesting it is. But we also can’t deny reality: the industry feels oversaturated, entry-level roles are extremely competitive, and the barrier to entry is relatively low. Anyone who self-studies can technically enter the field (even if they don’t have the same depth as someone who studied CS formally), and that definitely affects competition.So my question is this:If you were in college right now, still studying CS and not yet graduated, would you consider shifting to a traditional engineering degree instead?I’m talking about fields like:Electrical EngineeringElectronics EngineeringMechanical EngineeringCivil EngineeringDo these degrees actually offer better long-term job security compared to CS today? Or is the grass just greener on the other side?PS: I know some people will say, “If you’re doubting CS, then it’s not for you,” or that those who truly grind will succeed—or that this is just a way to reduce competition. That’s not my intent. I’m just trying to be realistic and pragmatic. I still see myself pursuing CS, but I want honest perspectives before it’s too late to pivot.Would really appreciate your thoughts.",81,0.9,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pvf6oe/are_traditional_engineering_degrees_safer_than_cs/,2025-12-25 15:05:08,2025-12-30 01:48:27

1ptjnxx,Breaking into tech feels impossible. Why don’t more people try building real products together?,AnteaterAvailable571,cscareerquestions,"I’m trying to break into tech, and given how difficult the job market is right now, I keep wondering why more people aren’t trying to build things together instead of endlessly waiting for opportunities.My background is a bit non-traditional. I have an education and basic proficiency in software engineering, but I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in transportation and diesel mechanic environments. In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers. From the outside, it feels like there are real opportunities for software to improve productivity in industries that aren’t “tech-native.”I have an app idea based on problems I’ve personally dealt with, but it’s too ambitious for me to realistically build alone. In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.What I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often? Why do so many people, especially those trying to break into tech, stick to LeetCode, personal projects, and the job application grind instead of collaborating to build products that solve real problems and potentially create their own jobs?TL;DR:As someone trying to break into tech, I don’t understand why more people keep grinding interviews instead of teaming up to build software that solves real problems in non-tech industries and potentially creates their own jobs?",75,0.72,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ptjnxx/breaking_into_tech_feels_impossible_why_dont_more/,2025-12-23 03:36:51,2025-12-30 01:48:27

When something important or urgent needs to be fixed, we often have to rely on someone else to jump in and provide guidanceAt this point, I honestly find myself wondering whether this is normal in some teams or if I’m just being overly sensitive about it.For additional context, I’m writing this while working today, December 24th.Edit: F*ck this company.

I have been working as a software engineer in a small company where I am one of 6 engineers for a year after graduation. As you might guess, this has its pros and cons. We do not have well-defined responsibilities at the job, so in this 1-year experience, I could work with every part of a software like CICD, BE, FE, AI, etc.BUTThis gives me a feeling of ""knowing a little bit of everything but not mastering anything"", so I decided to start with something with the new year. I enjoy the tasks that I would classify as CICD/DevOps the most. I really enjoy working with k8s, so I primarily have this in my mind to master, but I am not sure if it is the right thing since my experience/title is not mainly DevOps, and in the company, there is not much space to apply those skills on a scale I can write it to my CV, it is basically a couple of microservices. When I checked the jobs I am really interested in, I found that they mostly prefer Go.

1pxnki7,Roadmap and resources for becoming a Machine Learning Engineer,Glad_Orchid6757,cscareerquestions,"I came across a detailed guide shared by people who have cleared ML Engineer interviews at different companies and found it helpful to share. The process varies by company, but the core skills are consistent across big tech and startups.About the ML Engineer Interview Process:ML Engineer interviews typically include 4 to 6 rounds a virtual screen which has coding + ML basics, followed by onsite or virtual loops with coding. Expect 45 to 60 min sessions, often with live coding in a shared doc or whiteboard for design. Companies like Meta and Google emphasize productionizing models, while others focus on specific domains.PREPARATION:● Python is the main language that I use for programming.● Additionally, I am very good at the most common Machine Learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit learn, TensorFlow etc.● The basic machine learning concepts are that I know supervised and unsupervised learning methods.● I can evaluate models using several metrics.● I understand overfitting versus underfitting and the relationship between bias and variance.● I also understand the differences between regression and classification models.My preparation was based on these courses:1.) Coursera AI of Everyone/ Deeplearning AI: Machine Learning Engineering for Production by Andrew Ng Concentrates on turning ML systems into real world applications, covering data pipelines, deployment, monitoring, and scaling necessary for ML Engineer positions, putting an emphasis on the real-world systems.2.) Fast ai: Practical Deep Learning A Hands on, code first method to building state of the art models quickly, very good for gaining practical intuition and confidence in implementing deep learning solutions from scratch.3.) Stanford CS229/CS230: Gives rigorous, university level depth in machine learning theory and deep learning that is excellent for the understanding of derivations and advanced topics that may come up in technical discussions.4.) LogicMojo AI & ML Interview Preparation Course: Focused specifically on machine learning interview preparation, with practice problems, ML system design patterns, and commonly asked interview questions. It helps for project development for interviews.MOVING ONTO THE PRACTICE AFTER THEORY:Practice coding without an IDE use Google Docs or plain editor to simulate interviews. Focus on implementing ML algorithms from scratch or debugging production issues.Great platforms for practice:● LeetCode - ML tagged + general coding● Kaggle competitions for end to end projects● [Interviewing.io](http://Interviewing.io) or Pramp for mocksFAQs Asked:1. Basic machine learning2. Model evaluation & metrics3. Feature engineering & selection4. Recommendation systems.5. Convolutional neural networks for vision, normal language transformation transformers for NLP.6. Scaling ML distributed training, data parallelism7. Production issues8. ML system design9. Coding: Implement linear regression, k-means, decision trees from scratch; PyTorch or TF basicsThis GitHub repo on Machine Learning Interviews is a solid checklist covering fundamentals to production topics.DURING THE INTERVIEW ASK YOURSELF:1. Do you feel confident explaining ML concepts clearly?2. Can you clarify problem requirements and ask good questions?3. Are you capable of delineating the whole Machine Learning system by talking about data, features, models, evaluation, deployment, and trade-offs?4. Is your code neat, effective, and without any error?5. Have you thought about real world constraints?6. Can you draw from past projects and experiences effectively?All the best! ML roles are in high demand and consistent practice on projects, mocks, and designs will get you there. If you are targeting specific companies, tailor to their products.

Looking for advice.",AirlineEasy,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I’m looking for some perspective and advice from people who have been in similar situations.I joined a small startup about three months ago as a *full-stack developer*, although in practice I’m doing almost entirely front-end work. The company has been around for about 7 years, ~20 people total, and only 3 developers:* One backend developer* One senior developer who is currently transitioning into a Customer Success role* And meBefore this job, I did a bootcamp and a lot of self-study, but I’m very aware that I’m still junior. I’m learning every day, but there’s a big gap between where I am technically and the level of responsibility and trust they’re giving me.That said, the company has been incredibly supportive so far:* I asked for Frontend Masters access and they approved it* I asked to understand more about the business beyond pure frontend, and they gave me a project building JavaScript automations in Airtable, touching operations, product, inventory, etc.* I asked for regular time with the senior dev to review things together, and that was also approvedFrom a support and trust point of view, I honestly couldn’t ask for more.The company is very product-focused and mainly B2B. They sell hardware and services to other businesses, but they also have a SaaS product. Around 80% of customers actively use it and pay for it, yet there’s no clear long-term SaaS strategy or roadmap. It feels more like “it exists and works” than “this is a core growth engine.”Here’s where my internal conflict starts:* On one hand, I know I’m still junior and should probably focus on fundamentals, shipping solid frontend work, and not overthinking things.* On the other hand, I see a real opportunity here to grow the SaaS side of the business, help shape a more structured software team, and eventually take on more responsibility if things go well.* I’m interested in full-stack and system complexity, not just UI work, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself or become “the guy with ideas but weak execution.”So my questions are mainly:* Is this a good environment for a junior dev to grow, or is the lack of senior technical leadership risky?* How would you balance learning deeply vs stepping up when the company clearly gives you room?* Should I focus narrowly on becoming a very solid frontend engineer first, or is it reasonable to also invest energy in understanding the business and SaaS side early on?* Any red flags or opportunities you see from the outside?I’m genuinely grateful for the chance I’ve been given, but I want to be intentional about how I grow and avoid making preventable mistakes.Thanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read or respond.",6,0.76,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pukjxr/junior_dev_in_a_small_startup_learning_fast_lots/,2025-12-24 10:42:26,2025-12-30 01:48:27

1pu15ox,How much do majors matter in the CS job market?,allalongthewest,cscareerquestions,"I’m going to college next year and have been having multiple changes of heart regarding my future career prospects and my major. For context, I learned how to program when I was 8, and now I would consider myself a pretty well-accomplished programmer with many great projects to boast. I’m excellent at Rust, C++, C, and JavaScript, and proficient with Java, Python, and other C-like languages. Since ages 8–15 I built multiplayer games, full-stack websites, physics engines, and ECS frameworks, with some projects having thousands of GitHub stars.By 15, I discovered I really liked systems programming and learned theoretical CS topics like OS theory, compiler theory, networking, and embedded programming through open courseware. At 16, I made a dynamic memory allocator that rivals the speed of tcmalloc and jemalloc using a decentralized approach with journals, embedded metadata, and slabs. At 17, I built an ahead-of-time compiler for a Rust-like language with a complete frontend, a robust type checker handling traits and generics, a MIR system with monomorphization, and an LLVM backend generating cross-platform IR.Very recently, I’ve had an intense desire to learn math. I’ve already studied Calc 1–3, linear algebra (Axler is great btw), real analysis (baby rudin, abbott, fitzpatrick), abstract algebra (d&f, aluffi), and category theory, and this interest sharpened after reading Ahlfors' Complex Analysis starting in September, to the point that I'm now seriously considering majoring in it.My mind has been flipping between studying math, CS, double majoring, or minoring in one. Given my extensive programming experience and familiarity with upper-level CS, I feel I’d rather spend college learning something I’m less proficient in (math). Double majoring in Math&CS might make it difficult to take all the math courses I want due to CS requirements, and I dislike entry CS courses like DSA that I likely can’t test out of.I don’t currently have job prospects (they keep changing), but I want to keep SWE jobs as an option after graduation, and I will 100% continue programming and building projects throughout college. If it helps in your consideration, I've been admitted to MIT and will likely commit there, and I might pursue a PhD afterward. My main question is whether majoring in math without a CS major/minor would be bad for SWE jobs given my experience and projects.Edit: I'll be majoring in pure math, not applied math that's nonsense.",7,0.63,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pu15ox/how_much_do_majors_matter_in_the_cs_job_market/,2025-12-23 18:23:59,2025-12-30 01:48:27

1pwhfz9,how to deal with a needy manager,kovanroad,cscareerquestions,"I'm currently working with a manager who is very senior in our organization, very experienced, intelligent, etc., but he has a few traits that can be challenging. I'd like try o figure out ways to deal with these / overcome rather than give up / leave, for now.I myself am a senior, experienced engineer, we both have decades of experience, relatively successful careers.The challenge with working with him, though, is that its like \_he\_ has a difficult time working autonomously. As examples... he'll write a library for some good in principle idea of his, generally with an ambitious and elaborate implementation, a few ok unit tests, etc... then ask me to integrate some applications with that library. Fair enough. After I do that, he'll look at the integrated application+library combo, say it's not working as expected... and that its basically my job to diagnose/troubleshoot the whole combination. If I ask, well, has this library functionality been tested, has it \_ever worked\_, generally the answer is no. Now, sure, it is \_possible\_ for me to take over and figure out what's wrong with his library, but it's kind of inefficient, since its all fresh in his head, and I'm coming at it from it uninitiated, so maybe it's a few days work just to figure out how it's \_supposed\_ to work., etc.Other examples are, there are tasks assigned to me, I do them, send a PR, he approves the PR, I put the PR in a weekly status update, the ticket gets updated and closed... then a few weeks later, he'll be like ""what happened with ticket 1234? did that get ever get done? was it lost, i don't see it when running the app"". I do some basic looking around... turns out the app has been rolled back to an older version by someone else in the team. It's frustrating, though, because that would be pretty trivial for him to look into via either email, the ticket system, looking at the app version, asking other people in the team, etc etc... but he chats straight to me like drop everything, work got lost, etc.. which can be disruptive.Overall, I feel like, if I had junior-ish developer reporting to me that started out like this, that would be ok, but I'd be focusing strongly on getting them up to speed, self-sufficient, and past this stage over the first year or two, and if they didn't, I'd consider that to be a problem. Along the way, I'd be asking questions like ""What have you tried so far to diagnose this?"", ""Do you have everything you need to solve this kind of issue yourself in future, etc."".Overall, it just feels like he is intelligent, but also kind of ""needy"", lacking in attention to detail, and ultimately that's going to stop us both from being able to do our best work, but it's kind of difficult dealing with this as the report rather than the manager in this situation.

It was as though there was a big valley between: (intro to/ intermediate /advanced xyz programming language + intro to object oriented programming course structure then getting into a specific software programming discipline such as ""intro to app development"" and being overwhelmed with the sheer amount of libraries and how exactly these tools are designed in order to implement anything. I had no idea how to reach the point to even just read the documentation and code from scratch without having to read half of the entire class attributes while still confused.) I felt insecure about this learning style and decided I would focus more on trying to study mathematics and computer science topics before college, an effort that just amounted to doing a bunch of practice problems and khan academy constantly as per my math teachers instruction.I wanted to be able to design programs and dissect pre-existing designs, to be able to understand research on algorithms if not to design my own, to explore future applications of CS research or at least to be a software engineer that could make something without relying on a tutorial with code to copy. In college I had to split my focus between biology, chemistry, anatomy, anthropology, discrete math, calculus, linear algebra, bioanthropology.. as you can see, a lot of topics required by my CS degree before I could even think about programming, yet pre-existing programming knowledge was expected and in our CS classes our assignments would consist of fairly complicated 'real world projects' to implement the concepts we were learning but we never talked about any code in class. Most professors were laissez faire in defining how students should learn to program. ""Just code"" which made it hard to see why I was doing so poorly compared to other students.My cohort consisted of: people who had parents who were in STEM/programmers or very STEM oriented schools so they had learnt programming & CS a structured environment for so long they couldn't really define their curriculum beyond ""I just learnt it"" compared to me who just struggled on youtube & stackoverflow without any help.people who were using GPT & friends for all assignments and somehow getting away with it, but I didn't want to risk it and I had no friends either way. People who seemed to make ""just think of things you'd like to make, watch tutorials and ask questions"" work, but I still don't understand the specifics of how they learnt to dissect program design from tutorials without flailing around in the documentation taking notes on a dozen functions and variables that still don't tie together conceptually, especially while dealing with schoolwork at the same time.As professionals, how are students supposed to manage learning software engineering and computer science + other coursework independently?",7,0.9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pu5qcz/how_should_students_manage_professionalrealworld/,2025-12-23 21:32:23,2025-12-30 01:48:27

This made me realize that I might be missing something important , maybe deeper end to end ML understanding, stronger real world projects, or better interview preparation. Because of this, I am thinking about joining a structured AI/ML course that focuses on hands on projects, system level thinking, and interview readiness, along with some form of career or placement support. I keep hearing about Great Learning, LogicMojo, upGrad, IIIT Bangalore, and Scaler, but I am looking for honest, experience based feedback, not marketing claims. If you have taken any of these, what actually helped you and what would you focus on if your goal was to get interview ready in the next few months?",4,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pwvnbx/best_ai_course_for_placements_great_learning/,2025-12-27 11:25:59,2025-12-30 01:48:27

I want to eventually transition into a full software developer role, but I don't know what I should start studying next. I'm not very good with UI/UX, so preferably I'd like to go into backend development.What I know:Python (libraries: Selenium, Pandas, FreeSimpleGUI)Cisco Networking and Information Security (Was going to get a CCNA but I landed this job and it paid better than network jobs in my area) What I used to know:C++ and C# (Was taught in college, totally forgot most of it but I still got the fundamentals down).HTML, CSS and SQL.My projects:Web scraping information from the company website & collecting that info in Excel.Extracting data from Word documents and PDF files then sorting and counting specific items, strings, data, that pop up.Any advice would be appreciated.

1punxo5,Trying to move from PM to Engineering,Celery_Full,cscareerquestions,"I’m currently a PM in my first tech job post-grad and have been at the company for about 6 months. My long-term goal is to move into engineering.I’ve been pretty upfront about this internally and have reached out to engineers to learn and help where I can. I’m now doing some actual engineering work and the feedback has been good people have told me I have strong technical skills.The issue is there’s been no title change, no formal transition, and no real timeline. Another opportunity came up to work even closer with engineering, but again, no official role change. While I appreciate the trust and recognition, it’s starting to feel like I’m adding engineering value without actually being moved into an engineering role.For those who’ve been here before:•Is this just how internal transitions usually go?•When do you stop “being patient” and start protecting yourself?•Should I keep taking the risk internally or start looking elsewhere for an actual engineering role?Would love to hear thoughts from people who’ve made a similar move or seen this play out.TL;DR: PM 6 months into first tech job, trying to move into engineering. Doing engineering work with good feedback but no title change or clear path. Not sure if I should keep waiting internally or look elsewhere.",3,0.64,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1punxo5/trying_to_move_from_pm_to_engineering/,2025-12-24 13:55:53,2025-12-30 01:48:27
