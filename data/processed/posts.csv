1qhcekr,Any data engineers here with ADHD? What do you struggle with the most?,psgpyc,dataengineering,"I’m a data/analytics engineer with ADHD and I’m honestly trying to figure out if other people deal with the same stuff.My biggest problems\- I keep forgetting config details.

Even when it’s like 5 “easy” things, I freeze and can’t decide what to start with.\- I ask for validation way too much. Like I’ll finish something and still feel the urge to ask “is this right?” even when nothing is on fire. Feels kinda toddler-ish. \- If I stop using a tool for even a week, I forget it. Then I’m digging through old PRs and docs like I never learned it in the first place.\- Switching context messes me up hard.

1qdv3wh,Getting off of Fabric.,FirefighterFormal638,dataengineering,"Just as the title says. Fabric has been a pretty rough experience.I am a team of one in a company that has little data problems. Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.A little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.The core issues:* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview featuresThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.Coming from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.I'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.DE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.

1qexmyu,"""semantic join"" problems",kotrfa,dataengineering,"I know this subreddit kinda hates LLM solutions, but I think there is an undeniable and underappreciated fact about this. If you search on various forums like SO, reddit, community forums of various data platforms etc. for terms like (would link them, but can't here):1. fuzzy matching2. string distance3. CRM contact matching4. software list matching5. cross-referencing \[spreadsheets\]6. ...and so on, you find hundreds or thousands of posts dealing with seemingly easy issues where you have the classic example of not having your join keys exactly matching, and having to do some preprocessing or softening of the keys on which to match. This problem is usually trivial for humans, but very hard to generically solve. Solutions range from stuff like fuzzy string matching, levenshtein distance, word2vec/embedding to custom ML approaches. I personally have spent hundreds of hours over the course of my career putting together horrendous regexes (with various degrees of success). I do think there is still use for these techniques in some relatively specific cases, such as when we are talking about big data and stuff, but for all those CRMs systems that need to match customers to companies that are under 100k rows of rows and so on, it's IMHO solved for negligible cost (like dollars compared to hundreds or thousands of hours of human labour). There are different shades of ""matching"" - I think most of the readers imagine something like a pure ""join"" with matching keys, a pretty rare case in the world of messy spreadsheets or outside of RDBMs. Then there are some trivial cases of transformation like capitalization of strings where you can pretty easily get to a canonical form and match on that. Then there are those cases that you still can get quite far with some kind of ""statistic"" distance. And finally there are scenarios where you need some kind of ""semantic distance"". The latter, IMHO the hardest, is something like matching list of S&P500 companies, where you can't really get the results correct unless you do some kind of (web)search. Example is e.g. a ticker change for Facebook in 2022 from FB to META. I believe today LLMs opened the door to solving all of those.For example, a classic issue companies have is matching all the used software by anyone in the company to licenses or whitelisted providers. This can be now done by something like this python-pseudocode: software = pd.read_csv(""software.csv"", columns=[""name""]) suppliers = set(pd.read_csv(""suppliers.csv"", columns=[""company""])) def find_sw_supplier(software_name: str, suppliers: set[str]) -> str | None: return call_llm_agent( f""Find the supplier of {software_name}, try to match it to the name of a company from the following list: {suppliers}. If you can't find a match, return None."", tools=[WebSearch], ) for software_name in software[""name""]: supplier = find_sw_supplier(software_name, suppliers) df.loc[idx, ""supplier""] = supplierIt is a bit tricky to run at scale, and can get pricey, but depending on a task it can be drawn down quite significantly depending on the usecase. For example, for our usecases we were able to trim down the cost and latency in our pipelines by doing some routing (like only sending to LLMs what isn't solved by local approaches like regexes) and by batching LLMs calls together and ultimately fit it into something like (disclosure: this is our implementation): from everyrow.ops import merge result = await merge( task=""Match trial sponsors with parent companies"", left_table=trial_data, right_table=pharma_companies, merge_on_left=""sponsor"", merge_on_right=""company"", )and given these cases are basically embarrassingly parallel (in the stupidest way, you throw every row on all the options), the latency mostly boils down to the available throughput and longest-llm-agent-with-search, in our case we are running virtually arbitrary (publicly web-searchable) problems under 5 minutes and 2-5$/1k of rows to merge (trivial cases are of course for 0, most of the cost is eaten by LLMs generations and web search through things like serper and stuff). This is of course one of the few classes of problems that are possible now and weren't before. I don't know, but I find it fascinating - in my 10-year career, I haven't experienced such a shift. And unless I am blind, it seems like this still hasn't been picked up by some of the industries (judging based on the questions from the various sales forums and stuff). Are people just building this in-house and it's just not visible, or am I overestimating how common this pain point is?",20,0.92,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qexmyu/semantic_join_problems/,2026-01-17 00:29:22,2026-01-22 01:54:59

1qge6bu,My manager is not taking any technical decisions,theatropos1994,dataengineering,"hello. After 6 years of working in data analytics with NGOs, I transitioned last year to a data engineering role. I was hired for the position because I have decent python/ SQL while every other technical person uses R or Excel. My manager, who worked in big companies, worked with big 4 consulting, and taught data engineering at university, is the lead of our data unit. we are expected to centralize survey data across multiple countries and different Humanitarian contexts. The problem is my manager is not taking the lead on any work related to this objective, strategy or implementation. He spent 9 months doing nothing but small contributions to an internal R package, correcting data tests for new hires, and organizing meetings. while I found myself doing tool discovery and teaching myself DE from the ground up. for now I have managed to. write a data ingestion pipeline with dlt, orchestrated with GitHub actions running via docker on azure. But I am getting frustrated as I am not getting the technical guidance, not the strategic Vision for the project. I feel like our progress is too small, and eventually someone from the senior team (who are not data engineering knowledgeable) will notice and fire us. I asked him multiple times to push back on menial small tasks , and he does for a while then goes back to the same shtick. The one time I managed to engage him in the implementation of the pipeline, he fixated on dlt getting 'seemingly' stuck at the load phase, took 3 weeks experimenting.. only for me to take on the same task and write a report in two days about how the issue is that our postgres instance runs out of IOPS quickly during initial loads and the slowness has nothing with dlt or my implementation.

Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.What is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?Fivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them ""benefit"" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.Will Fivetran survive this one?

Due to memory and compute limits (I’m currently using Google Colab), I can’t load the entire dataset into memory at once.What I’ve done so far:- Randomly sampled ~1 lakh (100k) rows- Performed EDA on the sample to understand distributions, correlations, and basic patternsHowever, I’m concerned that sampling may lose important data context, especially:- Outliers or rare events- Long-tail behavior- Rare categories that may not appear in the sampleSo I’m considering an alternative approach using pandas chunking:- Read the data with chunksize=1_000_000- Define separate functions for:- preprocessing- EDA/statistics- feature engineeringApply these functions to each chunkStore the processed chunks in a listConcatenate everything at the end into a final DataFrameMy questions:1. Is this chunk-based approach actually safe and scalable for ~30M rows in pandas?2. Which types of preprocessing / feature engineering are not safe to do chunk-wise due to missing global context?3. If sampling can lose data context, what’s the recommended way to analyze and process such large datasets while still capturing outliers and rare patterns?4.

1qj7daf,I am so bad at off the cuff questions about process,NotEAcop,dataengineering,"1 year on from a disastrous tech assessment ended up landing me the job, a recruiter reached out and offered me a chat for what is basically my dream roll. AWS Data Engineer to develop an ingestion and analytics pipelines from IoT devices. Pretty much owning the provisioning and pipeline process from the ground up supporting a team of data scientists and analysts. Every other chat I've been to in my past 3 jobs has been me battling with imposter syndrome. But today, I got this, I know this shiz. I've been shoehorning AWS into my workflow wherever I can, I built a simulated corporate VPC and production ML workloads, learned the CDK syntax, built an S3 lake house.But I go to the chat and its really light on actual AWS stuff. They are more interested in my thought process and problem solving. Very refreshing, enjoyable even. So why am I falling over on the world's simplest pipelines. 10 million customer dataset, approx 10k product catalogue, product data in one table, transaction data captured from a streaming source daily. One of the bullet points is ""The marketing team are interested in tracking the number of times an item is bought for the first time each day"" explain how you would build this pipeline.Already covered flattening the nested JSON data into a columner silver layer. I read how many times an item is bought the first time each day as ""how do you track first occurance of an item bought that day""The other person in the chat had to correct my thinking and say no, what they mean is how do you track when the customer first purchased an item overall. But then Im reeling from the screw up. I talk about creating a staging table with the 1st occurance each day and then adding the output of this to a final table in the gold layer. She says so where would the intermediate table live, I say it wouldn't be a real table its an in memory transformation step (meaning Id use filter pushdown and schema inference of the parquet in silver to pull the distinct customerid, productid, min(timestamp) and merge into gold where customerid productid doesn't exist. she said that would be unworkable with data of this size to have an in memory table, and rather than explain I didnt mean that I would dump 100 million rows into EC2 RAM, I kind of just said ah yeah, it makes sense to realise this in its own bucket. But im already in a twist by this point. Then on the drive home I'm thinking that was so dumb, if I had read the question properly its so obvious that I should have just explained that I'd create a look up table with the pertinent columns, customerid, productid, firstpurchase date. the pipeline is new data, first purchase per customer of that days data, merge into where not exists (maybe a overwrite if new firstpurchasedate < current firstpurchasedate to handle late arrival). So this is eating away at me and I think screw it, im just going to email the other chat person and explain what I meant or how I would actually approach it. So i did. it was a long boring email (similar to this post). But rather than make me feel better about the screw up Im now just in full cringe mode about emailing the chatter. its not the done thing. Recruiter didn't even call for a debrief. fml chat = view of the int",5,0.79,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qj7daf/i_am_so_bad_at_off_the_cuff_questions_about/,2026-01-21 19:19:40,2026-01-22 01:54:59
1qifo47,How do teams handle environments and schema changes across multiple data teams?,TheOnlinePolak,dataengineering,"I work at a company with a fairly mature data stack, but we still struggle with environment management and upstream dependency changes.Our data engineering team builds foundational warehouse tables from upstream business systems using a standard dev/test/prod setup. That part works as expected: they iterate in dev, validate in test with stakeholders, and deploy to prod.My team sits downstream as analytics engineers. We build data marts and models for reporting, and we also have our own dev/test/prod environments. The problem is that our environments point directly at the upstream teams’ dev/test/prod assets. In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing. That is expected behavior, but it makes downstream development painful.As a result:* We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.* People often develop against prod data just to get stability (which goes against CI/CD)* Dev ends up running on full datasets, which is slow and expensive.* Issues only fully surface in prod.I’m considering proposing the following:* **Dev:** Use a small, representative slice of upstream data (e.g., ≤10k rows per table) that we own as stable dev views/tables.* **Test:** A direct copy of prod to validate that everything truly works, including edge cases.* **Prod:** Point to upstream prod as usual.Does this approach make sense? How do teams typically handle downstream dev/test when upstream data is constantly changing?Related question: schema changes. Upstream tables aren’t versioned, and schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?",5,0.86,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qifo47/how_do_teams_handle_environments_and_schema/,2026-01-20 22:25:30,2026-01-22 01:54:59

1qh4esu,Cloudflare Pipelines + Iceberg on R2 + Example Open Source Project,dutchclifton,dataengineering,"Afternoon folks, long time lurker, first time poster. I have spent some time recently getting up to speed with different ways to work with data in/out of Apache Iceberg and exploring different analytics tools / visualisation options. I use Cloudflare a lot for my side projects, and have recently seen the 'Beta' data platform products incl. the idea of https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/. So, I decided to give it a go and see if I can build a real end to end data pipeline (the example is product analytics in this case but you could use it for other purposes of course). I hope the link to my own project is OK, but it's MIT / open source: https://github.com/cliftonc/icelight.My reflections / how it works:\- Its definitely a beta, as I had to re-create the pipelines once or twice to get it all to actually sync through to R2 ... but it really works! \- There is a bit of work to get it all wired up, hence why I created the above project to try and automate it. \- You can run analytics tools (in this example DuckDB - https://duckdb.org/) in containers now and use these to analyse data on R2. \- Workers are what you use to bind it all together, and they work great. \- I think (given zero egress fees in R2) you could run this at very low cost overall (perhaps even inside the free tier if you don't have a lot of data or workload). No infrastructure at all to manage, just 2 workers and a container (if you want DuckDB). \- I ran into quite a few issues with DuckDB as I didn't fully appreciate that its single process constraints - I had always assumed it was actually a real server - but actually it seems to now work very well with a bit of tweaking, and the fact it is near Postgres capable but running on parquet files on R2 is nothing short of amazing. \- I have it flushing every minute at the moment to R2, not sure what this means longer term but will send a lot more data at it over coming weeks and see how it goes. Happy to talk more about it if anyone is interested in this, esp. given Cloudflare is very early into the data engineering world.

1qel3sz,Seeking advice,Zealousideal-Lab5074,dataengineering,"Hello everyone, I’m a 2025 graduate in Big Data Analytics and currently looking for my first job. It’s been about 5.5 months since my internship ended, and during this time I’ve been doing a lot of reflection on my academic journey. The program was supposed to prepare us for roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist, but honestly, I have mixed feelings about how effective it really was.Over three years, we covered a huge range of topics: statistics, machine learning, big data, databases, networking, cybersecurity, embedded systems, image processing, mobile development, Java EE/ spring bot, SaaS development, ETL, data warehousing, Kafka, spark, and more. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, it often felt scattered and a bit inefficient.We kept jumping between multiple languages (C, java, python, javascript) without enough time to truly master any of them. Many technical modules stayed very theoretical, with little connection to real-world use cases: real datasets, real production pipelines, proper data engineering workflows, or even how to debug a broken pipeline beyond adding print statements. Some courses were rushed, some poorly structured, and others lacked continuity or practical guidance.I know university is meant to build foundations, not necessarily teach the latest trendy tools. Still, I feel the curriculum could have been more focused and better aligned with what data roles actually require today, such as:* strong SQL and solid database design* Strong python for data processing and pipelines * Real ETL and data modeling projects * Distributed systems with clear, practical applications* A clear separation between web development tracks and data tracks* Better guidance on choosing ML algorithms depending on the use caseInstead, everything was mixed together: web dev, mobile dev, low-level systems, data science, big data, and business, without a clear specialization path.Now I’m trying to fill the gaps by self-studying and building real projects, mainly with a data engineering focus. For context, here are the main projects I worked on during my internships:1. Machine test results dashboard * A web application to visualize machine test results. * Stack: Django REST Framework, MongoDB, React.It was a 2-person project over 2 months. I was responsible for defining what should be displayed (failure rate, failure rate by machine/section, etc.) and implementing the calculation logic while making sure the results were accurate. I also helped with the frontend even though it was my first time using JavaScript. A lot of it was assisted by chatgpt and claude, then reviewed and corrected with my teammate.2. Unix server resource monitoring system A server monitoring platform providing:* Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network via websockets * Historical analysis with time-series visualization* ML-based anomaly detection using Isolation Forest* Server management (CRUD, grouping, health tracking)* Scalable architecture with Kafka streaming and redis cachingStack: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, redis, Kafka, Angular 15, all containerized with Docker.I admit the stack is more “web-heavy” than “pure data engineering,” but it was chosen to match the company’s ecosystem and increase hiring chances (especially Angular, since most of their tech team were web developers). Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to a position.Now I’d really need advice from people already working in data engineering:* What core skills should I prioritize first? * How deep should I go into SQL, Python, and system design?* What kinds of projects best show readiness for a junior data engineer role(and where can i get the data like the millions of rows of data aside from web scraping)?* How do you personally bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations?* What are your thoughts on certifications like those on Coursera?* And for the love of god … how do you convince HR that even if you’ve never used their exact stack, you have the fundamentals and can become operational quickly?Any advice, feedback, or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.\---\*\*TL;DR\*\* My data program covered a lot but felt too scattered and too theoretical to fully prepare for real data engineering roles. I’m now self-learning, building projects, and looking for guidance on what skills to prioritize and how to position myself as a solid junior data engineer.",2,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qel3sz/seeking_advice/,2026-01-16 16:45:23,2026-01-22 01:54:59
1qejnn6,Messy Data Problems: How to get Stakeholders on Board,BuissnessRake,dataengineering,"Hello! This is my first post in this sub. I’ve seen a lot of strong practical advice here and would like to get multiple perspectives on how to approach a messy data cleanup and modeling problem.Until recently, I worked mostly at startups, so I never dealt with serious legacy data issues. I just joined a midsized private company as an “Analyst.” During the hiring process, after hearing about their challenges, I told them it sounded like they really needed a data engineer or more specifically an analytics engineer. They said nope we just need an analyst, which i thought was odd. FYI: They already have an ERP system, but the data is fragmented, difficult to retrieve, and widely acknowledged across the company as dirty and hard to work with.Once I joined, I got access to the tools I needed fairly quickly by befriending IT. However, once I started digging into the ERP backend, I found some fundamental problems. For example, there are duplicated primary keys in header tables. While this can be handled downstream, it highlights that even basic principles like first normal form were not followed. I understand ERPs are often denormalized, but this still feels extreme.Some historical context that likely contributed to this:* In the past, someone was directly injecting data via SQL* The company later migrated to a cloud ERP* Business processes have changed multiple times since thenAs a result, naming conventions, supplier numbers, product numbers, and similar identifiers have all changed over time, often for the same logical entity. Sales data is especially messy. Some calculated fields do not align with what is defined in the ERP’s data dictionary, and overall there is very little shared understanding or trust in the data across the company.Constraints I am working under:* I have read-only access to the ERP and cannot write data back, which is appropriate since it is the raw source* of-course the ERP is not a read-optimized database, so querying it directly is painful* There are over 20,000 tables in total, but after filtering out audit, temp, deprecated, and empty tables, I am down to roughly 500 tables* Total row count across those tables is likely 40 to 50 million rows, though normalization makes that hard to reason about* I am the first and only data-focused hireThe business context also matters. There are no real long-term data goals right now. Most work is short-term:* One-week automations of existing manual processes* One to two month dashboard and reporting projectsStakeholders primarily want reports, dashboards, and automated spreadsheets. There is very little demand for deeper analysis, which makes sense given how unreliable the underlying data currently is. Most teams rely heavily on Excel and tribal knowledge, and there is effectively zero SQL experience among stakeholders.My initial instinct was to stand up a SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance and start building cleaned, documented models or data marts by domain. However, I am not convinced that:1. I will get buy-in for that approach2. It is the right choice given maintainability and the short-term nature of most deliverablesAs a fallback, I may end up pulling subsets of tables directly into Power BI and doing partial cleaning and reshaping using Power Query transformations just to get something usable in front of stakeholders.So my core question is: **How would you approach cleaning, organizing, documenting, and storing this kind of historically inconsistent ERP data while still delivering short-term reports and dashboards that stakeholders are expecting?**If I am misunderstanding anything about ERPs, analytics engineering, or data modeling in this context, I would appreciate being corrected.",4,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qejnn6/messy_data_problems_how_to_get_stakeholders_on/,2026-01-16 15:53:40,2026-01-22 01:54:59

1qhyv0a,Load data from S3 to Postgres,kekekepepepe,dataengineering,"Hello,Goal: I need to reliably and quickly load files from S3 to a Postgres RDS instance.Background: 1. I have an ETL pipeline where data is produced to sent to S3 landing directory and stored under customer\_id directories with a timestamp prefix. 2. A Glue job (yes I know you hate it) is scheduled every hour, discovers the timestamp directories, writes them to a manifest and fans out transform workers per directory (customer\_id/system/11-11-2011-08-19-19/ for example). transform workers make the transformation and upload to s3://staging/customer\_id/... 3. Another Glue job scans this directory every 15 minutes, picks up staged transformations and writes them to the database Details: 1. The files are currently with Parquet format. 2. Size varies. ranges from 1KB to 10-15MB where medial is around 100KB 3. Number of files is at the range of 30-120 at most.State: 1. Currently doing delete-overwrite because it's fast and convenient, but I want something faster, more reliable (this is currently not in a transaction and can cause some sort of an inconsistent state) and more convenient. 2. No need for columnar database, overall data size is around 100GB and Postgres handles it easily.I am currently considering two different approached: 1. Spark -> staging table -> transactional swap Pros: the simpler of the two, not changing data format, no dependencies Cons: Lower throughput than the other solution.2. CSV to S3 --> aws\_s3.table\_import\_from\_s3 Pros: Faster and safer. Cons: Requires switching from Parquet to CSV at least in the transformation phase (and even then I will have a mix of Parquet and CSV, which is not the end of the world, but still), requires IAM access (barely worth mentioning).

1qf0y19,Lack of Network Connectivity in Fabric!,SmallAd3697,dataengineering,"I have built data engineering solutions (with spark) in HDInsight, Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Fabric.Sometimes building a solution will go smoothly; and other times I cannot even connect to my remote resources. In Fabric the connectivity can be very frustrating. They have a home-grown networking technology that lets spark notebooks connect to Azure resources. The interface is called ""Managed Private Endpoints"" (MPE). It is quite different than connecting via normal service endpoints (within a VNET). This home-grown technology used to be very unreliable and buggy; but about a year ago it finally became about as reliable as normal TCP/IP (albeit there is still a non-zero SLA for this technology, that you can find in their docs.)The main complaint I have with MPE's is that Microsoft is required to make them available on a ""onesie-twosie"" basis for each and every distinct azure resource that you want to connect to! The virtualized networking software seems like it must be written in resource-dependent way.Microsoft had asked Synapse customers to move to Fabric a couple years ago, before introducing many of the critical MPE's. The missing MPE's have been a show-stopper, since we had previously relied on them in Synapse. About a month ago they FINALLY introduce a way to use an MPE to connect our spark workloads to our private REST APIs (HTTP with FQDN host names). That is a step forward, although the timing leaves a lot to be desired.There are other MPE's that are still not available. Is anyone aware why network connectivity doesn't get prioritized at Microsoft? It seems like such a critical requirement for data engineers to connect to our data!! If I had to make guess, these delays are probably for non-technical reasons. In this SaaS platform Microsoft is accustomed to making a large profit on their so-called ""gateways"" that move data to ADF and Dataflows (putting it into Fabric storage). Those data-movement activities will burn thru a ton of our CU credits ... whereas making a direct connection to MPE resources is going to have a much lower cost to customers. As always, it is frustrating to use a SaaS where the vendor puts their own interests far above those of the customer. Is there another explanation for the lack of MPE network connectivity into our azure tenant?",4,0.83,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qf0y19/lack_of_network_connectivity_in_fabric/,2026-01-17 02:38:16,2026-01-22 01:54:59

He felt productive every day, but the moment a task changed even a little, he froze like nothing really stuckWhat helped him was joining a free course where there were no answers, you either figured it out or you stayed stuck, It was frustrating, he hated it at first BUT that’s when things started to click!Now with AI tools like Blackbox around, it’s even easier to skip the hard part, you get a working answer in seconds. The lie is thinking that speed equals learningReal learning is sitting with confusion. Breaking things. Being wrong. Not knowing what to type next.

I’m trying to learn on my own by building basic C++ programs but I still feel really slow and stupid the whole time. Learning new concepts takes forever because 90% of the time I don’t understand what’s being said and I have nobody to ask about it.

1qj5cna,I’ve spent years learning to code but still can’t build anything. What am I missing?,Odd-Skill-2992,learnprogramming,"I’m exhausted. I feel like I’ve wasted 2 years of my life and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. No projects. No apps. Nothing I can point to and say “I built that”.I started with Java. Everyone said Java is solid, Java teaches you programming properly. At first it felt okay. I was learning syntax, classes, OOP, all that. I thought I was making progress. Then I tried to actually *understand* what I was doing instead of just following along, and everything suddenly felt… stupid. Like I was memorizing rules without really knowing why they exist. So I dropped it.Then everyone said Python. “Beginner-friendly.” “Best first language.” I tried it. At first I liked how simple it was. Then the indentation thing started driving me crazy. One wrong space and everything breaks. I tried to understand *why* the language works this way and it just felt dumb to me. People acted like it was elegant, but I couldn’t see it. So I left Python too.Then I moved to C++. People said if you learn C++, you’ll *really* understand programming. Memory, performance, how things actually work. That sounded right to me. I bought books. Good ones. I actually read them. I made progress. I understood classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction. I was happy for the first time. I genuinely liked C++. I thought “this is it, this is my language.”Then I tried to build something.Suddenly I needed CMake. What even is CMake? Why do I need another language just to compile my code? I tried to understand build systems and immediately felt stupid. Then I thought okay, let me make a GUI. People said use Qt. Then came signals, slots, layouts, moc, Qt Creator magic. Everyone talks about this stuff like it’s obvious, but it’s not. I felt completely overwhelmed and dumb again.Then someone said you *must* know Git. That’s how real programmers work. Fine. I bought three Git books. Pro Git and others. I read maybe 10% total. I can run commands. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`. But if you ask me what’s *actually happening*, I don’t know. I tried to understand it properly and once again felt stupid, so I stopped.Then I heard about DSA. “You can’t program without data structures and algorithms.” Okay. Bought like 5–7 books. CLRS, Grokking Algorithms, all the famous ones. Read maybe 70 pages combined. Tried to actually understand the ideas. Got overwhelmed. Closed the books. I haven’t even done more than one LeetCode problem because I don’t properly understand linked lists yet.Then Linux. “Real programmers use Linux.” “Best environment.” “You’ll understand systems better.” I was genuinely interested. I installed it. And then I spent hours doing things that take seconds on Windows. Fighting the terminal, permissions, basic setup. Everyone says it’s better, but no one explains *why*. I tried to understand and just felt stupid again, so I went back to Windows.Then web dev. People say it’s practical, that it’s the fastest way to build real things and get jobs. I tried. I still don’t properly know HTML. The most basic thing. I start learning, feel stupid almost immediately, and quit.There’s a clear pattern here and I hate it.I start something. I enjoy the beginning. I like learning the basics. I buy books, collect resources, watch tutorials. But the moment I try to *actually understand* and *use* what I’m learning, everything feels overwhelming and stupid and I quit. Every single time.Now I have a bookshelf full of unfinished books just mocking me. I know syntax in multiple languages. I can read code and understand examples. But I can’t build anything. When I try to start a project, my brain just freezes. I don’t understand how things connect.What does CMake actually do? How do build systems work? How does Git really work beyond memorizing commands? How do people know how to structure projects?I watch tutorials where people set up environments in 5 minutes and I’m completely lost in 30 seconds. Everyone else seems to just *get it*. They go from tutorials to building real apps like it’s nothing. Meanwhile I’m stuck rereading the same concepts from multiple resources, buying more books, starting new tutorials, and producing nothing.When I look at other people’s code, I don’t think “this is hard.” I think “how did they even know to do it this way?” How did they know which tools to use? How did they know this structure? There feels like some invisible step between learning syntax and building real things that nobody ever explains.Or maybe everyone else just understands it naturally and I don’t.I’m tired of starting over. I’m tired of collecting half-read books. I’m tired of quitting when things get hard. I’m tired of feeling like I don’t even know what I don’t know.Every time I started something new — Java, Python, C++, Linux — I had hope. I genuinely thought “this is it, this time it’ll click.” And every time I end up back here: nothing built, confused, demotivated, and feeling stupid.Has anyone else been stuck like this for years? How did you actually break out of it? Am I missing something fundamental? Is this normal, or am I just not cut out for programming?I’m genuinely lost and I don’t know what to do anymore.",58,0.81,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qj5cna/ive_spent_years_learning_to_code_but_still_cant/,2026-01-21 18:08:12,2026-01-22 01:55:01

1qe02v8,how I'm retaining syntax and concepts (instead of constantly googling the same things),seizethemeans4535345,learnprogramming,"Been teaching myself javascript for about 6 months now and I kept running into this problem where I'd learn something, use it in a project, then completely forget it.I realized my issue was that I was just passively reading tutorials and documentation without actively testing my knowledge.One thing that helped was connecting new concepts to stuff I already knew. Like when learning promises, I'd link it back to callback functions and explain how they solve callback hell. Building a web of connected knowledge instead of isolated facts.I also keep a running list of common mistakes I make in a separate doc. Like forgetting to return in array methods or mixing up async/await syntax. Reviewing my actual errors is way more useful than rereading correct examples. Stack overflow obviously helps when I'm stuck but I try to understand WHY something works instead of just copying the solution.My current setup is a mix of tools that work together pretty well. I use vscode obviously for coding, github for version control and tracking my projects. For learning and retention, I keep my notes in remnote cause it automatically makes flashcards and quizzes from my notes.

And you don't have to search around trying to find repos or youtube videos giving you personal project ideas. There is already is massive library of built ideas you can look at, the chrome extension web store!! For example:* Security (input sanitation, rate limiting, actual useful cache management). * Cloudflare, which can be useful for several of the above (they have many great COMPLETELY FREE products available).* Performance and the value of keeping your bundle size small.* Also non-tech skills like competitive research, marketing, consistent branding, etc.* Bonus points if you use a framework like [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) to make your extension available on Firefox.* Setting clear acceptance criteria / deliverables and completing them within a timeline. * Added bonus: chrome/cloudflare give you a bunch of data/analytics about usage for free, which can be extremely gratifying to see real people logging in and using your tool.I've been there, building personal projects to bolster your resume can be a hard and sometimes exhausting task.

1qd6me9,Looking for algorithm ideas to solve engineering routing problem (battery connections): extremely constrained grouping + routing problem,Green_Bee1235,learnprogramming,"Hi all — I’m looking for help thinking about a problem that’s well outside what I normally work on. I don’t have a strong background in search / constraint solving / routing algorithms, so explanations at a conceptual or introductory level are very welcome.This link should show the geometry of the problem and some attempts I made with explanations of why I rejected them, but hopefully the problem makes sense without it.

I don't **KNOW** that there exists a solution with the constraints I've set forth but i think there probably should be. If anyone can show that there cannot exist a solution for some reason and suggest alternate constraints that most closely match what I have while having a solution that would be appreciated too.# What I’m asking for* Is this a known class of problem (or combination of problems)? I've looked at a number of approaches but none of them seem to fully encapsulate the problem.* Are there standard algorithmic approaches or heuristics for problems like this?* Is this usually approached with backtracking, graph search, maze-routing ideas, constraint programming, or something else?* Are there examples of similar problems (even outside batteries) that might be good references?I’m not (necessarily) looking for a turnkey solution (though if i was provided with a simple answer I would not be upset) I’m trying to understand **how people normally reason about and structure problems like this** so I can move in a productive direction.This kind of combinatorial / routing problem is *not* what I usually work on, so I may not know the right terminology or standard methods.

1qigchc,Lost my job as a Senior Software Engineer. Dejected and not sure what to do next,philosograppler,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I haven’t posted on this subreddit before, but I’m at a point where I really need some outside perspective on what to do next.I’m based in NYC and I’ve been working as a software engineer for about six years. I originally got into this field because I wanted to learn to code so I could build my own ideas and maybe start something one day, but I haven’t really acted on that goal the way I thought I would.For most of my career I was at a large Fortune 500 company. I was there for five years and then lost my job due to restructuring that turned into mass layoffs. Right after that I traveled a bit and then started job searching. It felt endless. Once I got interview-ready again it still took about six months to land another role.I thought I finally found the perfect fit. It was a hybrid role at a startup events company where I’d be a Senior SWE working across web and mobile. I joined a newly formed AI R&D team as the first hire. Since the team was brand new there was no PM, no designer, and no scrum master, so it was mostly just me working directly with my manager, who had also just been promoted into management.From the beginning things felt messy. Deadlines were vague and product goals kept shifting from sprint to sprint. Then the CEO fired the cofounder, suddenly changed the company from hybrid to mandatory five days a week in-office, and later fired one of the two engineering managers.Not long after that I was let go for “performance reasons,” despite never being put on a PIP. When I try to be honest with myself about what they might be referring to, I can only point to two things. One was the CEO being upset that I was late to an all-hands meeting, but I didn’t even know it was happening because my manager forgot to put it on my calendar when I first joined, so I arrived about 30 minutes late. The other was a deadline to switch our product over to a different API endpoint that supported local testing. My manager wrote the backend for it, but the environment I needed to test in was constantly tied up by other engineers, so I moved onto another priority and that pushed the API switch back.A big part of the frustration is that I was building on top of backend code my manager had basically stitched together quickly, and it didn’t follow basic REST principles. The delay on the API work wasn’t only about me moving slowly. There was technical debt and there were delays and blockers that were out of my control too. I’m not saying I did everything perfectly, but when they let me go and I asked what specifically was wrong, the only answer I got was “poor code quality.” I can’t shake the feeling that once our team started missing deadlines, my manager needed someone to blame, and I ended up being the easiest target for the CEO.I was only there for five months, and getting let go like that has really messed with my confidence and mental health. Now I don’t know what the right move is. Part of me wants to jump back into applying immediately. Another part of me wants to finally take this as a push to work on my own startup ideas. Right after this happened, I swore I’d do everything I could to make sure I could work for myself eventually, but I’m not fully confident I can actually bring one of my ideas to life.On top of that, I have ADHD, and I’ve always had this constant background feeling of underperforming or that I’ve forgotten something important. This whole situation has made that a lot worse, and it’s hard not to spiral into those thoughts.If you’ve been through something like this, how did you decide what to do next? Would you focus on getting back into a stable job first, or would you take a risk and try to build something for yourself?",265,0.93,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qigchc/lost_my_job_as_a_senior_software_engineer/,2026-01-20 22:51:31,2026-01-22 01:55:02

I’m literally sitting alone in a room in a different plant, with no one from my area around.My manager and the rest of the team are in another facility.

1qi2tzm,How’s working remote at Netflix as an SDE?,wildmastrubator69,cscareerquestions,"I have 3.5 years of experience and a masters degree in CS. I currently work as an SDE for a big financial services firm. I’ve been one of their top performers but the pay growth has plateaued. I also have an annoying commute situation where it takes me a 1-1.5 hours to get to the office and I have to attend some meetings very early in the morning before that. They also make you pay the very expensive parking downtown. They also lay off 5% of their workforce every year and I’ve seen multiple people on my team let go. I would’ve been okay with everything but recently, one of the higher ups said that they’re tracking how many hours we work in the office, the time we come to the office, the time we leave the office, and there’ll be consequences for everything - which is kind of unreasonable considering that we attend meetings with other regions very early in the morning, work on releases very late at night and respond to incidents and downtimes during the weekends from home. We’ve made this job our life but they make it harder every day and don’t pay us much either.Anyways, I luckily got an interview call from Netflix. It’s a remote role, my pay is going up significantly and everything looks perfect on the surface. So, if someone worked/works over there, how is it really like working remotely as an SDE at Netflix? What’s the catch? Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day? How’s the pay growth like in general on the base salary every year as there’s no bonus? How well do they honor the unlimited paid time off policy? How many vacation days do y’all take every year? How’s the parental leave policy and do they honor it well (my partner and I are planning to have a baby next year)? What do you think about the health insurance they offer?

1qexren,Being asked to tech lead c-suite vibe coded project,conconxweewee1,cscareerquestions,"This past week I was asked to tech lead a project that was completely vibe coded by senior VPs and c suite at my company, and I kind of have no idea what’s going on.One of the high ups that I report up through, got me on a one on one call and spent a good amount of time glazing me before explaining that the him and a lot of other executives at the company have spent the past couple months vibe coding what he described as “the most important product at the company right now”.He then proceeded to say that he really wants me to tech lead this product and get it into production. I think I was kind of still warm and fuzzy from being glazed so much that I just kind of immediately said yes (also in my experience when someone higher up, asked you to do something you say yes, that’s just kind of the way I’ve gotten as far as I have in my career, it sucks, but it’s paid off for me). He also mentioned that by accepting this, I was not allowed to hand code anything, I had to “fully embrace, vibe coding“ whatever that means. I also managed two other teams, that work on five other products and when I asked this individual “ what’s gonna happen there?” he basically was like “ you’ll pretty much be able to do this on the side!” :flushed_face:Basically, since then, I have pulled down the code and it’s a absolute mess, aside from the fact that the performance is utterly atrocious and it’s extremely slow and unintuitive, the code is literally a trash fire pile of AI generated slop. Absolutely no organization, insane architectural decisions that for the sake of anonymity, I won’t go into. And overall, just like an insane volume of code that it would take a human being a very very very, very, very, very, very long time to read through and understand even half of it.All the while I’ve been trying to make heads or tails of the code base the executives keep pushing 1 million commits a day, they are like rejoicing in their slack channel. They are so over the moon that finally they can just build whatever they want. Ironically they don’t see the pattern that every time they push something they report a bug or report something else being broken, but I’m also not banking on them noticing that pattern.They keep making remarks about how companies that aren’t doing exactly what they’re doing right now are going to fail. They keep making remarks that they finally solved the puzzle. It’s becoming clear that they do not value software engineers and they’ve got it all figured out, from their perspective.I’m not really sure what to do here, I have a product manager that has been tapped to product manage this and we had a call today where we were basically”WTF is going on”. We have a meeting next week to level set, but I’m just kind of anxious for the outcome of that part of me kinda just wants to say in the most professional way possible “ I don’t know what you guys really need me for it seems like you’ve got it figured out and if you don’t mind, I’d like to focus on my day-to-day tasks”.Like gun to my head, I think the idea of shipping this to customers is suicidal for our company. It’s an insane amount of code that no one really understands what’s going on, which means the only person that can effectively fix bugs is Claude and I’ve heard horror stories of Claude really not being able to handle big projects.I just don’t know what to do because I feel like if I was trusting my gut, I would say let’s slow down and talk about what we actually want to build, take some time to actually pass through the code and make sure that we’re making smart choices. But I just know that that would be met with such resentment and distain. I feel like this is a group of individuals that is so angry that for so long people that know what is going on have gotten in the way of what they want, which is more more more now now now.Has anyone else experience this?

Called “Today, I did it.” Basically enter within a field different activities you did for the day, run that though an ai api to quantify that action in numbers and spit it back out.

I currently work at one of the big banks, graduated from a top 10 CS uni (no 1 in country) and have 2.5 years of professional experience. Life there is good, I get along well with colleagues and we like each other, but my goal has always been to get into a big tech company. The bureaucracy and nature of a bank really stifles engineering i feel, hence my decision to transfer. I simply felt Apple is the pinnacle of engineering standards and I would want to learn from Apple instead.Recently, I had the interview with the hiring manager for the first round and he seemed really disinterested in me early on, but not necessarily from the start. His body language shows it, he would rock his body back and forth. He asked me only resume-focused questions and just asked one simple technical question which i got correct and then ended the interview.I was quite taken aback because when i sit for interviews at the other major tech companies, I had expected a rigorous technical questions but it wasnt the case for Apple which felt really strange to me. Then, yesterday (2 days after my interview) my status on the applications portal showed in the 'Archived' state.To add on some context, I feel it might have been my work experience. I am relatively early in my career but have a few short stints of about 1 year each and I am only 10 months in the bank.Also, in the bank, we dont have root access and i read in big tech they tune kernel parameters for the hyper-scale traffic, use /proc for troubleshooting as it has less overhead and has more info like we can see what version of binary its run, spread out interrupts alongside cores (RSS), etc. So, my Linux professional experience is clearly not stellar tho i know a lot of theory from reading.When i described some stuff to the hiring manager specifically about our disaster recovery process, i am guessing it could feel really different and strange to him that we have to take screenshots and failover abruptly (not canary) and other stuff but that is simply the protocol of the bank.I would appreciate any advice from you all on my situation. If you were an interviewer / hiring manager , why would you behave the way the Apple Hiring Manager did to me during my interview ? I have been very polite throughout but sth about my interview he was probably dissatisfied. Maybe I rambling away or what not ?Thank you to this awesome community in advance and you all have a great week ahead!",42,0.93,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qfvh8w/apple_sre_role_hiring_manager_felt_disinterested/,2026-01-18 01:48:56,2026-01-22 01:55:02
1qhjehf,Advice - burning out a second time. How can I save myself?,ilovemrgoosesomuch,cscareerquestions,"As titled. Software engineer with 5 yoe at a unicorn, I've been with my current company for about 2 years now. I had a life-changing event that happened in my family before my graduated. As a result, during the initial couple years of my career, I was very ambitious and set for faang/unicorn level pay. I pushed and pushed and pushed myself, even though I did not want to. I felt like that was when I developed this chronic fatigue and burnout about work. Anyway, I did not stop, until I got into my current company, and I felt satisfied that I got what I wanted.Since then I felt like I got out of survival mode, and somehow without fear, I started hating my job more and more. About a year into my current job, my burnout was so bad, to the point that I couldn't bring myself to work more than 1 hour a day no matter how hard I tried. I sat in front of my laptop during nights and weekends but I could not get any work done, it felt like my brain shut down. I ended up taking a sabbatical for three months. I took the time and travelled to Europe and did not do anything but to spend time with my family for three months.After I came back, everything was so much better. I felt better about work, I was way more productive and I could function as normal. Sure I still didn't like working, but I didn't hate it and I could tell it was different than the period I was burnt out.Fastforward to today, a year from my last sabbatical, I feel like the burnout is slowly creeping back. It's been 2 weeks now and I've been extremely unproductive. I feel like I can't get things into my brain, I can feel that it is similar to the burnout I had last time, but fortunately a bit better. I seriously don't know what to do. My company has good wlb, great engineering culture, tc is a bit above faang level. I feel like I have nothing to complain, yet i hate my body for feeling this way. I think the root cause is that this place is a very fast-paced and high growth company. I don't work long hours by any means, but the work is very challenging and expectations are high. There are pros and cons to this, I feel like my work has meaning, i get rewarded, but sometimes it's very very draining. I feel like it's sucking the life out of me. I don't know what to do. I don't hate CS by any means, but this level of mental efforts does not seem like it's something I wanna do with my life. Maybe I want to coast. Maybe I'm ungrateful, maybe I want the pay but not do the work. i feel like I'm slipping and spiraling a bit downwards mentally.Any advice is appreciated.",42,0.92,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qhjehf/advice_burning_out_a_second_time_how_can_i_save/,2026-01-19 22:46:32,2026-01-22 01:55:02

1qfp760,I don't understand the point of online coding assessments that companies give out and it drives me crazy.,LongjumpingPage6168,cscareerquestions,"So, like the title, I don't understand the point of online coding assessments that major companies give on HackerRank, CodeSignal, CodeVue, etc. that we have to do on our own, while being proctored with camera and microphones on. I am OK with technical interviews with another engineer where we can code together and I can communicate my thoughts, processes, and my knowledge while programming. However, what's the point of stupid online assessments that major companies shove down our throats? You tell me that I have to do these proctored online assessments without any access to Internet (I cannot search for syntax or anything related to the coding problems) and I have to program with the camera and microphones on, and I cannot talk or look at anywhere else during the assessment because I'm afraid they would cause me of cheating. No one would hear me communicating my thoughts or processes during coding. And if I cannot pass all test cases within the time limit, I'm automatically eliminated from the hiring process, and my application would be thrown away, all of my past work experiences, skills, and projects I have gained over the years would be useless for them. And even if I pass all the test cases, I can still not move forward due to other reasons.People said that I have to do LeetCode, and I have practiced on my own for years on both LC, HackerRank, CodeSignal,... and solved over 100 problems... I also reviewed all data structures and algorithms again, but at the end, what's the use? Even when doing coding assignments in classes my professors allow us to search online but why cannot I search anything during these stupid assessments? And you know that most of us cannot pass these assessments in this way. So, I fear that even if I do 1000 to 10,000 LC problems the result is still the same, when I know that the companies only care if I pass all the test cases in these coding assessments.And funnily, I got my first part-time web developer job on campus, and my first IT infrastructure internship at a Fortune 500 multi-industry company without any LeetCode-style interviews. Especially in the hiring process for my first internship program, I only had to go through phone screen with a recruiter, and a behavioral interview with the IT manager where we discuss about my projects and past experiences, and within a week, I got hired for the program. But now, I did not get the return offer from the company so I have to do all of these LC over again with no hope.I feel like this is the only thing that fails me to get the full-time career I need after my graduation in May 2026. The other things like resume, networking, communication, interview skills, I am still learning and improving everyday, but these assessments feel hopeless to me. Just thinking about how I can be unemployed after graduation drives me crazy and makes me feel so embarrassed.And I've heard some people said I can skip these assessments with referrals. Is this true? I have friends who are working in these companies and I used to work with some of them, or we had little interactions but we're still in good terms. How do I reach out to them in a professional way to get the referrals? Can someone tell me? I'm out of options.",39,0.8,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qfp760/i_dont_understand_the_point_of_online_coding/,2026-01-17 21:20:15,2026-01-22 01:55:02

1qflfga,Experience with a 2 month job hunt late 2025,Used-Salamander-6003,cscareerquestions,"Inspired by a [previous post](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1or3gyj/my_experience_interviewing_in_2025_with_5_yoe/) from a few months back.Sankey diagram: https://i.imgur.com/sYt3l2y.pngSome terms:* Withdrawn = I withdrew from the process, due to lack of interest for moving forward, or for timing* Rejected = They rejected me and communicated so* Ghosted = They did not respond (either to the initial application or after any rounds had been completed)* Outreach = They reached out to me via email (cold, to my personal inbox) or referral (someone I used to work with connected me with the founder/recruiter)Some tidbits about my profile:* I've worked exclusively at small-to-medium startups, anywhere between Seed and Series C* Based in San Francisco, open to remote or hybrid roles* Current base in the range of 230-250k* Currently employed, with tenure 4 years* Full stack SWE looking for full stack / frontend roles* This is my third time doing a serious job search of this manner.* Total YOE = 7Been at my current company for over 4 years, and looking to leave to find new challenges and more interesting work. Outside of that I was pretty happy at my job and would not have minded if I didn't get any offers (other than the obvious blow to my ego).Almost all of my jobs were applied through Welcome To The Jungle, formerly Otta. I responded to a few recruiter email reachouts, but only if the recruiter worked directly for the company, rather than for a third party. I did not apply to any companies as practice; I only applied to companies that I genuinely wouldn't mind working for and whose salary range was within at least what I was making now, or more.Almost all companies followed a pretty standard process - recruiter call, technical screen, hiring manager screen, onsite. All companies did not ask any leetcode or brainteaser questions (I did my best to filter those companies out). One company had an online assessment before I talked to anyone, and a take-home later in the process that took ~10 hours. I had fun doing the take home and did not mind the time it took.Preparing for my interview was pretty straightforward. Because I was targeting companies with no leetcode, I did not prepare for coding assessments at all. I did well on interviews that required me to write code (save for one, where I flubbed due to a misunderstanding of the problem / incorrect assumption as it was based on a real-life product). For system design, I used the free versions of HelloInterview (I did not pay for membership like the other post), but I did have an existing lifetime membership for GreatFrontEnd for FE system design. I did not find it that useful for the interviews I encountered.For scheduling interviews, the majority of them were scheduled from 6AM-9AM PT (east coast morning), or (2PM-6PM PT) (west coast afternoons), depending on where the company was located.For the companies that I got rejected, I think my weakest area was for sure system design questions, and doing technical deep dives of my work projects. Two of the five companies that rejected me provided detailed feedback, which I appreciated and understood their perspective. Some rejections were purely tactical errors on my part.In the end (just before new years), I accepted a remote role for +20% base, and a lot more equity than my current role. The role I accepted was one where I was most interested in the company anyway; both offers I received were from companies I would've been happy joining. The entire process took a little less than two months from the initial offer being sent, to me accepting an offer.Happy to answer any questions.",36,0.93,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qflfga/experience_with_a_2_month_job_hunt_late_2025/,2026-01-17 18:51:04,2026-01-22 01:55:02
1qewjyx,Stuck in my career and don't know what to do,radioactiveflamingos,cscareerquestions,"For context, I'm a 2023 grad from engineering university, interned at big bank and got converted to a full time offer at the end of it.I am very grateful to have a job in my current position, but I feel like I've been rotting away as a developer for the past almost 3 years of working at the same company.My whole time has been a huge mess unfortunately. This team is entirely focused on replacing an existing internal platform within the company and I've been stuck on doing mindless CRUD work for the entire 2+ years I've been working. The product is essentially created out of a war started between two directors who disagreed on the current approach of the platform at the company.Besides the messy team origins, my biggest difficulty has been gaining a deeper domain knowledge and be able to insert myself into key initiatives. I'm not sure if it's bad luck or just me not being smart about which work I pick up, but I somehow always end up taking tasks that don't help me to stand out or make a huge noticeable impact. Our team suffers from very poorly written stories and constantly unclear product requirements so it tends to be a roulette when taking on work for the sprint.Additionally, sometimes seniors and tech leads are secluded from ad hoc conversations that happen between leadership, so requirements get changed on the fly at times or critical information is missed leading to mistakes and constant miscommunication of requirements.Regardless, I screwed up during these few years and couldn't make a name for myself within my org. I've missed my chance to work on more impactful projects and take ownership on bigger features. I've fallen into the state of being a feature monkey and don't see myself going forward any further nor do I think it's worth as several engineers and managers have already begun leaving my org.This experience has made me question whether I should even bother continuing engineering as a career. I'm starting to think I'll be capped as a junior / mid level engineer due to my inability to play the game right. I already feel so behind compared to my peers and have really nothing impressive to talk about in interviews in terms of feature ownership.Overall, working at corporate has started to make me dislike development and I have no motivation or energy to upskill or tackle side projects anymore. I'm pretty lost as for what to do at this point as no team is willing to hire internally and my current endeavors for external opportunities has been absolutely awful.

1qhyrob,Internal Transfer from Google to DeepMind,scenetaec,cscareerquestions,"Hey, I’m joining Google as a new grad and wanted to get some perspective on how feasible it is to internally transfer to DeepMind down the line, ideally as an ML or Research Engineer.During my internship, I met some absolute outliers from GDM, but also plenty of solid, “normal” smart folks. Overall, the distribution of talent didn’t seem any different from my own team, which made me wonder whether an internal transfer might be more realistic than I initially thought.I’ll be starting on an AI-related (but non-research) team in a different product area. The office I’m joining has a fairly strong GDM presence.I did CS with Math in undergrad with a focus on probabilistic ML, and I have one publication in a top AI journal (not first author).For folks who’ve seen or gone through this process:* How rare are internal transfers to GDM? Do you need to be absolutely exceptional?* Beyond strong feedback in my current role, what tends to matter most? * Internal ML work (e.g., 20% project with GDM) * Being active in research communities again * Kaggle or other ML side projects * Internal networking and referralsAny advice & anecdotes would be really appreciated.

I'm in NYC if that makes any difference.I did full stack at my old job, mostly with React and Node.js, along with mostly AWS services. Since I've only interviewed when I first started, I don't have a lot of experience interviewing and don't know what to expect nowadays. I've been studying full time mostly DSA and system design for the past two months and feel like I'm almost there with that. I'm thinking there will also be some live coding implementations that I'm going to incorporate more into my studies. Curious if anyone has good exercises or resources regarding what companies expect for the implementation round. Looking for insights on what to expect and resources outside of DSA/system design.

1qdrrse,I have a live coding session for round 2 at a large company and I am terrifid,plexto,cscareerquestions,"So long story short, I just recently graduated and have been working as an intern/contractor for a company for about 2 years now. I don’t think my company I work for now will be able to hire me due to a hiring freeze so I am applying to other jobs. I just recently did a pre screen interview with a recruiter from a big company that I was shocked even reached out to me as I hear nothing, and I passed that. The next step is a technical interview. I was told it will consist of 1-2 DSA medium questions which will be a majority of the interview, followed by some potentially light fundamental questions and talking about my background. I have no problem talking about my background, but the live coding really terrifies me. This is my first ever technical interview as my current company doesn’t do them. I feel the stakes are extra high because of how bad the market is, and the pay is very high. My DSA skills are horrid as is, and the idea of having to narrate live what I’m doing without going silent for too long and then receiving follow up questions makes me think there’s no chance I pass. I guess this post is more of venting than seeing assistance, but I guess I’m looking for some advice.

There also aren’t really any networking events where I live either. Does anyone have tips for getting interviews at these kinds of companies?

1qgqakm,Asking for basic advice as a CS student who is a junior in University,Knee_Grow_Juice,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, I've been reading through this subreddit lately to manage my anxieties of my future career. I saw a lot of varying comments, some encouraging and others not so much. I have decided for myself that I will stick with my passions for SWE but I'd love to get some advice or hear some other people's opinions.For some background, I'm a junior in a university that is not the best for CS and I have had 0 internships so far. My dreams were to be a SWE ever since I started coding in highschool in 2022.My second semester in college (2024) I started doing research with a CS professor that I liked and have continued it ever since. During my time at university, I also developed and published a Google Chrome extension, mainly to make life easier, and also a VSCode extension, for my professor's research.I also love using Django and have built several full stack web apps (although mainly CRUD). But, I have never deployed something other than on a web service platform like Vercel, Onrender, or Heroku. I'm aware that most of the web apps I build are not scalable and will most likely break if more than 1,000 requests hit an endpoint at once. I also know some things like CI/CD or unit tests are very important for real world projects but I've always thought those things are experiences gained at an internship.I have started applying to internships ever since I was a sophomore and I also attended a career fair last year in the spring. I only started keeping track at the start of my junior year and so far I have more or less applied to 150 intern positions. Only had 2 companies (one small, one medium sized) reach out after for an interview after the OA, but I most likely bombed both because there were no responses after. I know AI is having a big impact on the job market and there are also layoffs happening in tech companies, but I also know several people who still landed internships at Meta and even Google.So, I just wanted to know if anybody could recommend some strategies to stand out more as an applicant or just give some basic advice on my next steps.

I’ve been there 2 years. It’s full time WFH. The benefits are buns and pay could definitely be higher but many of my cs friends are getting laid off frequently and the interview process sucks as I’ve tried to get another job here and there but have been unsuccessful and draining.

The role is mainly full-stack web development. My background is in robotics, and I previously worked as a C++ developer.I left my previous job because I wanted to see something different and broaden my experience.

I was laid off from a small consultancy that relied too heavily on a single client, which is currently going through a major layoff. Before cutting internal staff, they terminated contracts with external collaborators like me, and my company couldn’t reassign me to another project.From what I’m seeing, the market is tougher than I expected. It’s hard to find a position that pays at least what I earned in my previous job. While backend development—especially Java/Spring Boot—still seems in demand, it also feels more saturated than data engineering.I know I don’t yet have enough experience to apply for mid-level data engineering roles, but I’d be willing to take a pay cut for a junior remote position, as I believe it’s a better-paid career path in the long run.Thanks in advance for your advice!",3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qfhif8/considering_switching_from_mid_backend_developer/,2026-01-17 16:23:49,2026-01-22 01:55:02
