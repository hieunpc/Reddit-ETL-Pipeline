1qp0f0i,The Data Engineer Role is Being Asked to Do Way Too Much,FreshIntroduction120,dataengineering,"I've been thinking about how companies are treating data engineers like they're some kind of tech wizards who can solve any problem thrown at them.Looking at the various definitions of what data engineers are supposedly responsible for, here's what we're expected to handle:1. Development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data2. Producing high-quality data and consistent information3. Supporting downstream use cases4. Creating core data infrastructure5. Understanding the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, AND software engineeringThat's... a lot. Especially for one position.I think the issue is that people hear ""engineer"" and immediately assume ""Oh, they can solve that problem."" Companies have become incredibly dependent on data engineers to the point where we're expected to be experts in everything from pipeline development to security to architecture.I see the specialization/breaking apart of the Data Engineering role as a key theme for 2026.

My mission ended in December due to budget cuts, and I am currently “on the bench” (inter-contract) with my probation period ending soon.•The Issue: I am tired of the consulting model (instability, lack of ownership, dependency on random missions). I want to stabilize and, most importantly, transition into Analytics Engineering / Data Engineering.The Offer (Internal Role):I have an offer for a permanent contract (CDI) at an End Client (a digital subsidiary of a massive Fortune 500 industrial group, approx. 50 people in this specific entity).•Title: Senior Analytics Engineer (New position creation).•Tech Stack: Databricks / Spark + Power BI (Medallion architecture, Digital Performance & E-commerce focus). This is exactly the stack I need to master for my future career steps.•The “Catch”: The fixed base salary offer is 12.5% lower than my current base salary in consulting.•Variable: There is a 10% variable bonus (performance-based), which brings the total package closer to my current pay, but the guaranteed monthly income is definitely lower.My Plan / Strategy:1.Tech: Acquire deep expertise in Databricks and Data Engineering (highly in demand).2.Domain: The role focuses on Digital Performance / E-commerce, which seems valuable.My Questions for the community:1.Does taking a 12.5% step back on base salary seem justified to gain the Databricks expertise + the stability of an internal role?2.Is it risky to accept a “Senior” job title that pays below market rate for that level, or will the title itself be valuable on my CV in 2 years?3.Has anyone here taken a pay cut to pivot technically?

1qltru0,Is there more to DE than this? Are their jobs out there for feeling like you actually matter?,DoctorQuinlan,dataengineering,"I'm pretty sure this isn't the norm, but I feel so exhausted with my job. The main problem is my team is not good and the company, while overall is very good/well regarded globally/competitive, is very pretentious. My job is not very challenging. In fact, it's the mundanity of it that exhausts me. Everything is the same over and over to process client data. There's almost 0 feedback/appreciation for it too, and I'm pretty sure the successor of the data basically passes off my work to others and pretends he did it. I of course could push myself more, learn new tech, and integrate it. But I just don't feel motivated. I still plan to do some online free courses about AI/ML soon.But longterm, I'm not sure this job will sustain me. I have a noticeably worse mindsets (become a bit egotistical and negative myself, snarky, etc.). I'm in my early 30s, but about 10 years ago I switched from pre-medicine to tech. I was heavily invested in the the med route and had already applied to medical school. Then I spent too much time around some people I shouldn't have, and changed paths. Looking back, I probably wish I stayed in healthcare, though it has its own challenges and of course worse lifestyle usually. That said, there's no way I would want to switch back now.All that to say, for so much of my life, I was looking at a career that directly helped people...so maybe that is part of my problem now. I could very well be in a 1/3 life crisis now, but overall okay (so dont worry :)). I'm debating a small to significant career change.I think at the least, to save my sanity, I absolutely need to change jobs in the next year or two, if even that. Otherwise, I fear what my mind and personality will become. Things I've considered:- online courses (for sure will do in the interim)- a second masters (in tech related or business related field - my undergrad was economics, which I enjoyed)- no further education (besides online stuff), but just change jobs- stay at current job and do bare minimum BUT try to create a startup on the side (one big goal of mine is to be an entrepreneur some day).Anyways, I digress. One reason for this post is because (1) I want to know if others feel this way in DE and (2) I am wondering if there are more rewarding industries out there. Something I've always been interested in is sustainability or in general, somehow making the world a better place. As cliche as it sounds, it'd be awesome to use my skills to improve the planet/humanity. I'm still looking at jobs and applying, but wanted to see if anyone here has recommendations. My fear is that whatever company I transition to will just be more of the same. I've been at a number of companies and in different job roles over the years, but there has not been a single one that I just loved (or even half loved). Everything felt like a cog in the wheel, like it doesn't help humanity, and just puts money in someone else's pocket.Curious to hear if others feel this and if this is just the way of life.

1qnorsn,How to improve ETL pipeline,Ibception952,dataengineering,"I run the data department for a small property insurance adjusting company.Current ETL pipeline I designed looks like this (using an Azure VM running Windows 11 that runs 24/7):1. Run \~50 SQL scripts that drop and reinsert tables & views via Python script at \~1 AM using Windows Task Scheduler. This is an on-premise SQL Server database I created so it is free, other than the initial license fee.2. Refresh \~10 shared Excel reports at 2 AM via Python script using Windows Task Scheduler. Excel reports have queries that utilize the SQL tables and views. Staff rely on these reports to flag items they need to review or utilize for reconciliation.3. Refresh \~40 Power BI reports via Power BI gateway on the same VM at \~3 AM. Same as Excel. Queries connect to my SQL database. Mix of staff and client reports that are again used for flags (staff) or reimbursement/analysis (clients).4. Manually run Python script for weekly/monthly reports once I determine the data is clean. These scripts not only refreshes all queries across a hundred Excel reports but it also logs the script actions to a text file and emails me if there is an error running the script. Again, these reports are based on the SQL tables and views in my database.I got my company to rent a VM so all these reports could be ready when everyone logs in in the morning. Budget is only about $500/month for ETL tools and I spend about $300 on renting the VM but everything else is minimal/free like Power BI/python/sql scripts running automatically. I run the VM 24/7 because we also have clients in London & the US connecting to these SQL views as well as running AdHoc reports during the day so we don't want to rely on putting this database on a computer that is not backed up and running 24/7.Just not sure if there is a better ETL process that would be within the $500/month budget. Everyone talks about databricks, snowflake, dbt, etc. but I have a feeling since some of our system is so archaic I am going to have to run these Python and SQL scripts long-term as most modern architecture is designed for modern problems.Everyone wants stuff in Excel on their computer so I had a hard enough time getting people to even use Power BI.

1qon39x,Benchmarking DuckDB vs BigQuery vs Athena on 20GB of Parquet data,explorer_soul99,dataengineering,"I'm building an integrated data + compute platform and couldn't find good apples-to-apples comparisons online. So I ran some benchmarks and wanted to share. Sharing here to gather feedback.Test dataset is ~20GB of financial time-series data in Parquet (ZSTD compressed), 57 queries total.---## TL;DRPlatform | Warm Median | Cost/Query | Data Scanned:--|:--|:--|:--DuckDB Local (M) | 881 ms | - | -DuckDB Local (XL) | 284 ms | - | -DuckDB + R2 (M) | 1,099 ms | - | -DuckDB + R2 (XL) | 496 ms | - | -BigQuery | 2,775 ms | $0.0282 | 1,140 GBAthena | 4,211 ms | $0.0064 | 277 GB*M = 8 threads, 16GB RAM | XL = 32 threads, 64GB RAM***Key takeaways:**1. DuckDB on local storage is 3-10x faster than cloud platforms2. BigQuery scans 4x more data than Athena for the same queries3. DuckDB + remote storage has significant cold start overhead (14-20 seconds)---## The Setup**Hardware (DuckDB tests):**- CPU: AMD EPYC 9224 24-Core (48 threads)- RAM: 256GB DDR- Disk: Samsung 870 EVO 1TB (SATA SSD)- Network: 1 Gbps- Location: Lauterbourg, FR**Platforms tested:**Platform | Configuration | Storage:--|:--|:--DuckDB (local) | 1-32 threads, 2-64GB RAM | Local SSDDuckDB + R2 | 1-32 threads, 2-64GB RAM | Cloudflare R2BigQuery | On-demand serverless | Google CloudAthena | On-demand serverless | S3 Parquet**DuckDB configs:** Minimal: 1 thread, 2GB RAM, 5GB temp (disk spill) Small: 4 threads, 8GB RAM, 10GB temp (disk spill) Medium: 8 threads, 16GB RAM, 20GB temp (disk spill) Large: 16 threads, 32GB RAM, 50GB temp (disk spill) XL: 32 threads, 64GB RAM, 100GB temp (disk spill)**Methodology:**- 57 queries total: 42 typical analytics (scans, aggregations, joins, windows) + 15 wide scans- 4 runs per query: First run = cold, remaining 3 = warm- All platforms queried identical Parquet files- Cloud platforms: On-demand pricing, no reserved capacity---## Why Is DuckDB So Fast?DuckDB's vectorized execution engine processes data in batches, making efficient use of CPU caches. Combined with local SSD storage (no network latency), it consistently delivered sub-second query times.Even with medium config (8 threads, 16GB), DuckDB Local hit 881ms median. With XL (32 threads, 64GB), that dropped to 284ms.For comparison:- BigQuery: 2,775ms median (3-10x slower)- Athena: 4,211ms median (~5-15x slower)---## DuckDB ScalingConfig | Threads | RAM | Wide Scan Median:--|:--|:--|:--Small | 4 | 8GB | 4,971 msMedium | 8 | 16GB | 2,588 msLarge | 16 | 32GB | 1,446 msXL | 32 | 64GB | 995 msDoubling resources roughly halves latency. Going from 4 to 32 threads (8x) improved performance by 5x. Not perfectly linear but predictable enough for capacity planning.---## Why Does Athena Scan Less Data?Both charge $5/TB scanned, but:- BigQuery scanned 1,140 GB total- Athena scanned 277 GB totalThat's a 4x difference for the same queries.Athena reads Parquet files directly and uses:- **Column pruning:** Only reads columns referenced in the query- **Predicate pushdown:** Applies WHERE filters at the storage layer- **Row group statistics:** Uses min/max values to skip entire row groupsBigQuery reports higher bytes scanned, likely due to how external tables are processed (BigQuery rounds up to 10MB minimum per table scanned).---## Performance by Query TypeCategory | DuckDB Local (XL) | DuckDB + R2 (XL) | BigQuery | Athena:--|:--|:--|:--|:--Table Scan | 208 ms | 407 ms | 2,759 ms | 3,062 msAggregation | 382 ms | 411 ms | 2,182 ms | 2,523 msWindow Functions | 947 ms | 12,187 ms | 3,013 ms | 5,389 msJoins | 361 ms | 892 ms | 2,784 ms | 3,093 msWide Scans | 995 ms | 1,850 ms | 3,588 ms | 6,006 msObservations:- DuckDB Local is 5-10x faster across most categories- Window functions hurt DuckDB + R2 badly (requires multiple passes over remote data)- Wide scans (SELECT *) are slow everywhere, but DuckDB still leads---## Cold Start AnalysisThis is often overlooked but can dominate user experience for sporadic workloads.Platform | Cold Start | Warm | Overhead:--|:--|:--|:--DuckDB Local (M) | 929 ms | 881 ms | ~5%DuckDB Local (XL) | 307 ms | 284 ms | ~8%DuckDB + R2 (M) | 19.5 sec | 1,099 ms | ~1,679%DuckDB + R2 (XL) | 14.3 sec | 496 ms | ~2,778%BigQuery | 2,834 ms | 2,769 ms | ~2%Athena | 3,068 ms | 3,087 ms | ~0%DuckDB + R2 cold starts range from 14-20 seconds.

I built it after getting frustrated with every existing open source option:* Sentry is great, but it doesn't know what a dag\_id is. Errors get grouped weirdly and the UI just wasn't designed for data pipelines.* Grafana + Prometheus feels like it needs a PhD to set up, and there's no real Python integration for error analysis. Spent a week configuring everything, then never looked at it again.* Airflow UI shows me what happened, not what went wrong. And the interface (at least in Airflow 2) is slow and clunky.What Granyt does differently:* Stack traces that show dag\_id, task\_id, and run\_id. Grouped by fingerprint so you see patterns, not noise. Built for DAGs from the ground up - not bolted on as an afterthought.* Alerts that actually matter. Row count drops? Granyt tells you before the CEO asks on Monday. Just return metrics in XCom and Granyt picks them up automatically.* Connect all your environments to one source of truth.

1qlxojt,"Looking for feedback after 5 years building a data stack for .NET (dataframe, columnar storage, connectors)",IGDev,dataengineering,"Most of you work with Python and SQL exclusively, but that’s okay your feedback is still important. Almost 10 years ago I started working for a .NET embedded BI reporting tool. This kind of tool typically sits after ETL process, however a lot of businesses don’t follow that and simply want ETL with their dashboards all in one. The problem with that is there’s a huge gap in .NET for that functionality. Since that wasn’t the product direction, 5 years ago I started letting out that frustration by starting to code a framework that was extendable with connectors, sinks, and at the center of it was an in-memory analytical database.Over the years I continued to work on it off and on, finally to the point where I am now. I have several connectors, an in-memory analytical database (DataBlock), my own columnar file format and engine that I nicknamed Velocity (VelocityDataBlock), ML (VectorBlock), and other various libraries for UI (UIBlock). The last two haven’t been publicly exposed yet. Here’s some code snippets of how the code looks.### DataBlock var processed = await DataBlock.Connector.LoadCsvAsync(""raw_data.csv"") .Select(""id"", ""name"", ""value"", ""category"") .Where(""value"", 0, ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan) .Compute(""processed_value"", ""value * 1.1"") .Sort(SortDirection.Descending, ""processed_value"") .Head(1000);### VelocityDataBlockThe snippet below materializes a DataBlock after Execute() is called. var topCategories = velocityBlock .Where(""Year"", 2024) .Pivot(""Category"", ""Region"", ""Sales"", AggregationType.Sum) .Sort(SortDirection.Descending, ""East_Sales"") .Head(5) .Execute();It’s also possible to do something similar to what Polars does by using AsResult(). var result = velocityBlock .Where(""OrderDate"", DateTime.Today.AddYears(-1), ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan) .AsResult(); // Stream result rows long totalRevenue = 0; foreach (var row in result.EnumerateRows()) { totalRevenue += row.GetValue(""Revenue""); } // Materialize the result var data = result.ToDataBlock();### SinksPDF export of a DataBlock. var pdfSink = new PdfSink { Title = ""Data Export Report"", Author = ""Datafication System"", Description = ""Automated data extraction from web sources"", RowLimit = 1000, LandscapeOrientation = true }; using var pdfStream = await pdfSink.Transform(dataBlock); using var fileStream = File.Create(""report.pdf""); await pdfStream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);Many of the connectors also have their sink output too, for example CSV. using Datafication.Sinks.Connectors.CsvConnector; var csvOutput = dataBlock.CsvStringSink();There’s honestly too much I could write about, but before I ask the feedback questions, I’ll throw in that the VelocityDataBlock can typically achieve 60M rows/sec on my 2020 iMac. However, I’ve learned that .NET isn’t optimized the best on MacOS and if you try on Windows (which I’ve verified) you can easily get 100M rows a second. At some point I’ll put up a benchmark and the results. If you’re curious to test on your end, try the QueryPerformance sample from the Datafication.Storage.Velocity repo. Use “dotnet run -c Release sf50” for testing with 50M rows of data.### Feedback Questions1. In a data world predominantly using Python and tools like dbt is there a place for an SDK like this?2. Was the syntax easy to understand based on the tools you’ve used?3. Was there any functionality that you frequently use that wasn’t available?If you have any other thoughts or questions, let me know.## GitHub Organization[https://github.com/DataficationSDK](https://github.com/DataficationSDK)",8,0.85,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qlxojt/looking_for_feedback_after_5_years_building_a/,2026-01-24 20:19:20,2026-01-30 02:08:33

1qq3se7,Good Data with Databricks - problem with cache in Good Data,FlanSuspicious8932,dataengineering,Hey all! got a question for people who had 'pleasure' to work with Good Data. How can I increase the cache so Good Data are not constantly querying dbx? The design looks like this: databricks is scheduled to run on 3 AM so between 3:01 and 2:59 next day nothing will change in these tables Good Data is using these tables to show data but even though it's not direct query its constantly querying dbx after filter change or whatever because it hasn't got enough space to store the refreshed data I was Power BI developer and tbh it's hard for me to understand this problem with Good Data... Im not the good data admin so I'm relying on devs team that 'it is what it is' and it's pissing me off because it's ridiculous.But my main-main problem is that it's laggy even though we (5 people) are the only data consumers. It will be laggy af when clients will start using it and going above Medium warehouse on dbx will be costly and this cost will be undefendable because ROI will be way too low.Thanks in advance!,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qq3se7/good_data_with_databricks_problem_with_cache_in/,2026-01-29 09:13:19,2026-01-30 02:08:33

1qllhix,Filemaker to Postgres Best Practise,Slow_Quarter_4936,dataengineering,"Hey hey fellow data engineers,i just started a new job some months ago for a company which has a pretty wild 'organically grown' data landscape to put it mildly. The two main data storages are Filemaker applications built by non-IT consultants a while ago. They got their tweaks but for the most part serve the purpose. I was hired to kind of consolidate the data into future structure, to connect it and prepare the introduction of more serious data analysis aside of crappy excel exports.As Filemaker JDBC routine and possibilities are rather limited and slow i wish to pull together both databases into respective schemes in one postgres db via python as this is my most convenient set-up. Therefore i got my own server with a bit of space. I've written some first scripts and tests and for the smaller one of the two databases this works pretty good and im quite satisfied with the result.The problems start to occur with scaling as the other database is significantly larger and my (admittedly not very storage efficient) code would take way too long and consume way to much storage in the target structure, but as a one man DE team i just don't have sufficient time to plan a highly efficient, totally aligning target structure for the existing dbs.So my question is if anybody has some best practises, ideas, experience, tips on how to tackle this problem. I am not fixed to the idea of that postgres db. The main goal would be to be able to systematically analyse that Filemaker DBs via SQL like queries (Joins, CTEs, Views, sophisticated reportings) and also to be able to connect the data of the two DBs. Right now i can satisfy basic analysis requirements via customly built python scripts which connect to both db's via JDBC but this is rather time consuming and far from the ideal state in my head. Thanks for your ideas! tl;dr: I need to systematically connect and analyse two rather big Filemaker DBs with the goal of unifying them at some point in the future, ideally via python into a postgres db and im in need for tips, best practises, hints.",2,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qllhix/filemaker_to_postgres_best_practise/,2026-01-24 12:15:05,2026-01-30 02:08:33
1ql0r1w,Certs or tools? What should I learn next as a mid level DE?,Cptn_beebus,dataengineering,"I’m trying to decide what to learn next to make myself more competitive in my job search and would love some feedback. After \~5 years of professional experience, I think there are two main areas where my background is weaker than what a lot of current data engineering roles expect:1. Cloud – I have some foundational certs in Snowflake and Azure, but no real hands on professional cloud experience. My previous roles were mostly on-prem.2. Common industry standard tools – Things like Spark, Airflow, and dbt, which show up constantly in job descriptions.I’m looking at a couple of learning paths that would be pretty time-intensive, so I’m trying to pick what will give me the most ROI. Right now I’m debating between:1. Going deeper on cloud with a data engineering focused cert (leaning toward the AWS Data Engineer cert to diversify beyond Azure/Snowflake).2. Spending time learning Spark and Airflow (or similar other tools) and building a realistic ETL pipeline I can put in a public repo—possibly even deploying it in the cloud with a real cluster as second step.For a bit more context: I’m targeting mid level IC roles. I’m confident in my Python and SQL and feel good on data fundamentals (currently reading *Fundamentals of Data Engineering* as a refresh/gap fill). I’ve been getting some interviews, but mostly with companies that don’t yet have data engineers or don’t fully understand the role.

Mod approved I'm currently working in a role similar to a product manager, but leaning more toward the engineering side. While I currently earn an ok wage (working in the EU and coming from a third world country), I feel like I don’t really see myself working in this line of work forever, and I don’t see strong career/wage progression here.While looking for a possible career shift that could play to my strengths, I stumbled upon analytics engineering/data engineering. A lot of articles and people I’ve read on gave me the impression that it might be possible to break into the field without having a degree specifically in the area (I have a degree in materials science and if my impression of this is wrong then sorry). Btw I basically dont have any programming or analytics background except the limited amount of time I had with Matlab.My question is:1. Do you think this will still be true in the coming years? Considering that I’m currently working full time and can only learn in my spare time after work, I don’t plan to break into DE immediately, as I know that’s basically impossible. But maybe breaking into data analytics or analytics engineering could be more realistic and doable?2. I'm currently starting with SQL and then plan on moving to Python, Git, some visualization tools and then dbt and cloud warehouses. Is this a solid plan or are there any other stuffs I should take into account? Any tips on typical mistakes that one can do early in these phase that might hinder/slow down my progress?3. What are your best resources for learning and for having a decent roadmap or plan to become a data analyst, analytics engineer, or data engineer? I don’t mind paying for a course if it’s worth it. So far I'm using SQLBolt, w3schools, thoughtspot for their free courses as a start. Are there websites where I can practice writing SQL queries a lot?

There’s too much to describe in just this post, so I ask that you check out the comprehensive README for a thorough description and explanation of all the features that I described above.Darl only has python standard library dependencies. This library was not vibe-coded, every line and feature was thoughtfully considered and built on top a decade of experience in the quantitative modeling field. Darl is MIT licensed.**Target Audience:**The motivating use case for this library is computational modeling, so mainly data scientists/analysts/engineers, however the abilities provided by this library are broadly applicable across many different disciplines.**Comparison**The closest libraries to darl in look feel and functionality are fn\_graph (unmaintained) and Apache Hamilton (recently picked up by the apache foundation). However, darl offers several conveniences and capabilities over both, more of which are covered in the ""Alternatives"" section of the README.**Quick Demo**Here is a quick working snippet. This snippet on it's own doesn't describe much in terms of features (check our the README for that), it serves only to show the similarities between darl code and standard python code, however, these minor differences unlock powerful capabilities. from darl import Engine def Prediction(ngn, region):     model = ngn.FittedModel(region)     data = ngn.Data()                  ngn.collect()     return model + data                                                def FittedModel(ngn, region):     data = ngn.Data()     ngn.collect()     adj = {'East': 0, 'West': 1}[region]     return data + 1 + adj                                                def Data(ngn):     return 1                                                           ngn = Engine.create([Prediction, FittedModel, Data]) ngn.Prediction('West')  # -> 4 def FittedRandomForestModel(ngn, region):     data = ngn.Data()     ngn.collect()     return data + 99 ngn2 = ngn.update({'FittedModel': FittedRandomForestModel}) ngn2.Prediction('West')  # -> 101  # call to `Data` pulled from cache since not affected  ngn.Prediction('West')  # -> 4  # Pulled from cache, not rerun ngn.trace().from_cache  # -> True",2,0.63,0,https://github.com/mitstake/darl,2026-01-26 00:17:24,2026-01-30 02:08:33

So I am doing that. Tldr: If your repo is public or you are working on frontends - any secrets you hardcode into checked in files ever are compromised and can be used by anyone at your expense. Once a secret hits a public repo (github and others), scraper bots will likely grab it within minutes. Removing it from the repo at a later point doesn’t help - git history is trivial to scan. Git is meant to be easily reversible. That goes for your 'chore: delete api key' commit as well. If the key was ever committed to git on a publicly accessible repo, assume it’s compromised.Likewise, all frontend code runs on the client. Anything in frontend is public. Frontend is never a place for secrets, not even temporarily. If a secret was ever committed there, burn it immediately.The only fix is rotating the key on the provider side so the old one stops working and will no longer be accepted. I know you are very proud about your Ai Chatbot or your Weather App Dashboard or your Smart Home Control. And you should be. But stay safe.

1qobknh,I've made a Git course integrated into VSCode and Cursor,Loud_Safety_1718,learnprogramming,">TLDR: I built a Git course that runs inside your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, and friends), so you learn Git by using it in real dev environment. It's well-designed and illustrated. Link: [https://gitbybit.com](https://gitbybit.com/)---Hi folks! My name is Alexander Shvets. People know me best as an admirer of raccoons and the creator of Refactoring.Guru.Today I'd like to show you the project I've been working on for the past two years, it's [GitByBit](https://gitbybit.com).# Who is it for?The course will be most helpful for three groups of people:* **Developers who “use Git” but mostly as a black box.** You know a few commands, but you want to actually understand what you’re doing.* **Builders returning to code** (PMs, designers, ex-devs) who now use AI tools for prototypes and internal tools, and need their Git muscles back.* **Hobby coders and beginners** who want a practical, confidence-building path from zero to “I can work with Git.”# What makes it different?I designed [GitByBit](https://gitbybit.com) as a modern way to learn Git (if we can still say so about a project that doesn't use AI, ha-ha). It's story based, you learn about everything gradually, one concept built upon another. This course is also hyper-focused on practice: building muscle memory for commands, using real Git, real IDE tools, etc.That's possible because of the unique format: the course is integrated right into your code editor (assuming it's VS Code, Cursor, or any of the clones). It can also be run online via GitHub Codespaces. This format allows it to achieve some pretty cool things:1. **Real Git, editor and terminal.** You're always using real stuff! Once you finish the course, you're literally one shortcut away (Open New Window, Ctrl+Shift+N) from applying everything you've just learned about Git in your next project.2. **Instant feedback.** The course can check the results of your actions, explain errors, suggest workarounds, etc. You don't have to jump between a web page with instructions and the terminal, or search for explanations of cryptic Git errors. It's all in one place.3. **Respects your time.** The content is presented in bite-sized chunks, which helps you keep focus and stay engaged. No endless videos you have to sit through. The main course can be completed in one sitting, in an evening.4. **Gitopedia.** While progressing through the course, you build your personal in-editor Git reference, unlocking bits of supplemental material: deep dives into concepts, detailed explanations of commands, best practices, etc. These bits go into your personal knowledge base, a thing I called Gitopedia. You can pull up the Gitopedia as a separate tab in the editor, or arrange it to be opened in parallel at all times. It also serves as a map of what you've learned so far.5. **Illustrated.** There are cool handmade [illustrations](https://gitbybit.com/blog/0005-illustrations)!# What's covered in the course?There are two parts.**1. The FREE main course, focuses on Git essentials**: things that you need to know to work on your personal projects. Setting up and configuring Git, working with the terminal, the staging area, commits, branches, history, remote repos, etc.The course teaches Git in terminal first, but also shows how to achieve the same thing via graphical user interface of the editor.Apart from learning the Git itself, you also get insights on using the terminal effectively (navigating history, using autocomplete, etc.), learn about software release cycle, semantic versioning, licenses, best practices and more.**2. Optional paid add-on** (extra practice and team workflows; free course stands on its own):* Selective staging and resetting changes.* Different ways to clean up the repo or ignore unwanted changes.* A detective scenario where you investigate project crashes using git history and git blame.* A deep dive into merging/rebasing branches.* And my favorite: the full GitHub pull request workflow, from forking someone's repo to updating it according to the maintainer's demands, and the eventual merge.# Next stepsI'm considering translating the course to several languages, but I'm not sure which ones yet. Spanish, almost certainly. Let me know if you think yours should be in the list.Enjoy and have fun! :red_heart:",52,0.83,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qobknh/ive_made_a_git_course_integrated_into_vscode_and/,2026-01-27 11:42:22,2026-01-30 02:08:34

Now before this I was fine learning Python and honestly it was kind of fun making basic scripts and mini-games. But now, the past two weeks I have basically been bashing my head against the wall with web development. The barrier to entry level is very high for a beginner like me. I usually approach youtube tutorials to always get ahead, to 'dissect' them and break them down whenever I don't understand it to the fundamentals. What I wasn't prepared for was the huge amount of studying, like web architecture, learning other languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, full stack development, APIs, Databases, Flask, Bootstrap and all of this Web Dev jargon I never knew about before I stepped into this. The point is, I've spent 80% of my time basically studying on paper everything, and 20% actually coding anything for like the past 2 weeks.I expected a level of frustration but these days it's been a test of will and patience. It's become suffocating having to sit on my desk for two to three hours everyday for the past two weeks, and not feel a sense of progress towards my goal. I'm constantly learning without a way to practice or test the limits of that knowledge. And when things go wrong in a way I don't understand (like a bug), in a language I have no control or little knowledge over, it's very difficult to fix without feeling angry or lost.So my question is, did I overestimate myself here and skipped a few too many steps approaching web dev?

1qpfx22,"I can't decide what language, stack or domain to begin learning deeper. Need some help to get pointed in the right direction",Crapahedron,learnprogramming,"I've been a floater so far. I've dabbled with a handful of different languages (python, ruby, java, c, c#, js) mostly because I was curious about what this programming thing was all about. My curiosity is growing significantly. I started solving basic problems with some scripting languages (sorting files with python, made some VERY BASIC selenium web automation scripts with java etc) and I really enjoyed it. I want to take it one billion steps further, however I don't know what direction to take it. In some ways, because I dont know what I don't know - as in there are a lot of programming professional domains that probably exist that I don't even know of. There are lots of languages and learning resources I probably don't know of. (I only know of the few big recommended ones like freecodecamp, odin, cs50 etc)With only a few exceptions, I'm pretty open minded to where I want to take this. I want to learn about data structures, algorithms and general design patterns and all the things professional developers eventually grow into. However to WHAT I apply these to? I have no idea. Here's what I know: I have no interest in traditional web development - especially front-end work. I tried to force myself to like it but I can't. (which is kind of a shame, because even traditional desktop applications are essentially getting deprecated in favor of cloud based web apps.) The biggest thing I think I'm mostly looking for is a language or technology stack that a) Has AMPLE resources to help someone go from beginner to contributor in a fairly streamlined fashion, b) interesting open source projects I could eventually try to contribute to and build experience working through the workflow of contributing to a team based project and c) something that has some kind of remote employment culture attached to it. (I live in a very remote part of the world and all current and future employment relies on remote work unless I want to climb an oil rig or hunt polar bears.). <--- stretch super longterm goal / bonus pointsThings I am curious about:* c# / windows desktop application development (whether this is even a thing in 2026 and beyond I have no idea)* c and systems / OS level programming (under the hood nuts n' bolts is incredibly interesting. Would love to learn how an OS works, whether it's windows or linux.)* MUD's / text based multiplayer games. See /r/mud for what I mean. I think these are interesting learning vehicles to get involved in. They stress OOP, classes, networking and efficiency while also working on what is probably a very legacy codebase. (some of these mud's have been online for 30 years!)* the ruby language in general - yeah I know I mentioned webdev as things I don't like, but ruby as a standalone scripting language is a beautiful thing. I would have strong interest in delving way deeper into it. (What are the odds rails devs can get by without giving a crap about the front-end? lol)I'm an older dude, so building dedicated desktop applications initially sounded interesting. (so probably c# .net windows apps in visual studio). I dont know if there's any professional demand for this stuff long term however these days. I'm from the Winamp/ICQ/Napster era so that's where my brain immediately went :D. I was looking at the TIOBE index for inspiration, but I think all it does is create FOMO so I stopped. Got overwhelming.

Im a student and I’d like to get some up-to-date opinions on the state of Spring / Spring Boot in 2026 and looking forward, especially regarding job market demand, long-term viability, and industry trends.I have professional experience with TypeScript, mainly in the modern frontend/backend ecosystem but i felt that the lack of strong structure, the huge dependency ecosystem, and how fast tools and frameworks change can make it easy to feel “lost”, even on medium-sized projects. Because of that, I’m looking to move toward something I think is more serious, structured, and predictable in the long run.I narrowed my options down to C# (.NET) and Java (Spring / Spring Boot). At first, I was leaning toward C#, partly because several indexes (for example, TIOBE) show C# growing while Java appears stable or slightly declining. I also had the impression that the .NET community is larger and more “welcoming”.However, when I looked at the actual job market, the number of openings requiring Java + Spring (at least in my region and for remote positions) seemed significantly higher so i started learning it.i Would like to know the point of view of people that works with Spring/Spring boot, things such as:How do you see Spring/Spring Boot in 2026 and over the next 5–10 years?Is it still a solid choice for backend systems?Do you see it losing relevance compared to .NET, Node.js, Go, in the long run?From a career perspective, is Java + Spring still a good way to progress?I’d really appreciate your insights, thanks!",7,0.71,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qp9b49/state_of_spring_spring_boot_in_2026_and_beyond/,2026-01-28 11:53:06,2026-01-30 02:08:34

1qlrhun,Future & Programming Help,tomiis4,learnprogramming,"Hi, so little backstory to this post. I started programming when I was still at primary school. It was for about two years, then it's almost 4 years where I haven't been programming because I was burned out, but now I want to start again, maybe create something little but useful but mainly for fun. It started at front-end, but later moved to back-end and CLI applications. That's where I feel in love with that type of programming - not focusing on look (even though I'm capable of something simple and good looking) but mainly function. For example 3D rendering using JavaScript, many NeoVim plugins using Lua and some simpler using GoLang. It has been one of my most favorite language I have ever tried, but I haven't used it that much for personal projects. I have done couple CLI games, tool but it wasn't something long term or ""big"".I want to get back to programming, but I don't have any project ideas which would interest me and could take some time to finish (like month or more). Preferably GoLang, but I wouldn't mind using, or mixing another languages. So my question is what would you recommend me to do, to get back into programming again or something. Thank you.My favorites projects I have enjoyed so far were \- 3D .obj parsing -> rendering -> rotating website from scratch, with textures \- VIM inspired TypeScript CLI text editor \- NVim RegExp explaining plugin, from scratch and more, mainly focused on ""technical"" part.",4,0.65,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qlrhun/future_programming_help/,2026-01-24 16:30:59,2026-01-30 02:08:34

1qkuhox,Should I avoid bi-directional references?,Star_Dude10,learnprogramming,"For context: I am a CS student using Java as my primary language and working on small side projects to practice proper object-oriented design as a substitute for coursework exercises.In one of my projects modeling e-sports tournaments, I currently have `Tournament`, `Team`, and `Player` classes. My initial design treats `Tournament` as the aggregate root: it owns all `Team` and `Player` instances, while `Team` stores only a set of `PlayerId`s rather than `Player` objects, so that `Tournament` remains the single source of truth.This avoids duplicated player state, but introduces a design issue: when `Team` needs to perform logic that depends on player data (for example calculating average player rating), it must access the `Tournament`’s player collection. That implies either:1. Injecting `Tournament` into `Team`, creating an upward dependency, or2. Introducing a mediator/service layer to resolve players from IDs.I am hesitant to introduce a bi-directional dependency (`Team -> Tournament`) since `Tournament` already owns `Team`, and this feels like faulty design, or perhaps even an anti-pattern. At the same time, relying exclusively on IDs pushes significant domain logic outside the entities themselves.So, that brings me to my questions:1. Is avoiding bidirectional relationships between domain entities generally considered best practice in this case?2. Is it more idiomatic to allow `Team` to hold direct `Player` references and rely on invariants to maintain consistency, or to keep entities decoupled and move cross-entity logic into a service/manager layer?3. How would this typically be modeled in a professional Java codebase (both with/without ORM concerns)?As this is a project I am using to learn and teach myself good OOP code solutions, I am specifically interested in design trade-offs and conventions, not just solutions that technically ""work.""",6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qkuhox/should_i_avoid_bidirectional_references/,2026-01-23 15:54:11,2026-01-30 02:08:34

My co-founder just finished a website for a locksmith business using a framework he built called Jenga. The site's been running in production with zero downtime so far, which has been pretty solid.**What is Jenga?**Jenga is built on top of [Obelisk](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk) (a Haskell web framework) and adds a static page generation layer plus an SEO optimization using a library called [lamarckian](https://github.com/augyg/lamarckian) (you can check it out on his [GitHub](https://github.com/augyg)). He's been working with functional web frameworks for years but kept running into gaps around static site generation and SEO tooling that most frameworks in this space don't really prioritize.The interesting part is lamarckian handles meta tags, structured data, and sitemap generation at the type level. When you change a route, the compiler catches everywhere that references it. Entire categories of bugs don’t make it to production because they wouldn’t compile.**The Stack**The site uses SendGrid's HTTP API for contact forms, runs on NixOS deployed to DigitalOcean with standard DNS through Namecheap. Most of the HTML generation uses custom quasi-quoters for cleaner string interpolation, and [Template Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Template_Haskell) handles the routing layer. The type system catches a lot of common web development mistakes before runtime.**What's Next**He's just released version 1.0.0 of Jenga, which [you can check out here](https://github.com/Ace-Interview-Prep/jenga)! We also are building a job board as part of the Ace Talent platform, where Jenga is the core infrastructure. Might explore some FFI bindings for browser APIs down the line - which allows us to work entirely in Haskell based on the page.Just wanted to share since it's been interesting seeing how functional programming languages like Haskell handle production web work.

Recently I have been practicing Python and I enrolled in the LangChain academy course for LangGraph. I really don't like the course because they briefly go over concepts and provide no quizes or practice problems or anything like that to really be able to apply what is being taught independently.I was able to get the basics of LangGraph down, but after that I was introduced to a bunch of different concepts, and it became really difficult to continue the course because they don't explain why you need to know certain things, why you would do this over that, when do you do this, etc. I had to ask AI for further clarifications on the lessons, and to create me projects to complete based on the lessons. This was doable for the basics, but as more things were introduced I was spending more time design and prompting the AI for the optimal project to complete than actually learning LangGraph. This was because as we all know AI is not reliable for programming, and I was worried about it was teaching me the wrong things as it keeps having me do stuff that are not covered in the lessons and a bunch of other bullshit.So I eventually quitted the course and started doing what I can do, which is going back to the fundamentals of Python. I think having a solid foundation would not be a waste of time. I have halfway completed the Free Code Academy certificate course for Python. I know certificates are BS these days, but I'm just taking it for the content and I like how I'm given quizes, tests, workshops, labs, and projects to complete to really apply what I have learned and be able to program on my own.**TLDR HERE:**But I don't know what to do after the Python course. I feel so overwhelmed with all the stuff I was given to learn. It feels like I was given a list of tools to build a house or a car and there is a bunch of information on how to use these tools, but there is no guidance or instructions on how to use all of these tools to build a house or a car. I am left to figure that out on my own. I feel like this is wrong and that there should be more support and instructions from start to end and nothing is to be skipped.So that's why I'm making this post on how to learn this stuff to be good enough to get hired. I know I can do this, but I feel like I am not given the proper opportunity/resources to do this.This is the stuff I was given:* LangGraph - Note: Be able to create a workflow editor, human in the loop is very important.* LangChain * MCP servers* Agents * Fast API (back end)* React * Next.js * RAG* Redis (scaling)Other questions I have that I tried asking my friend:* How do you know if someone knows there shit or not?* What are you (my friend) and the people hiring/doing the interview looking for someone like me? They're going to ask me questions and stuff and look at my online profiles and resume. What do they want to find?* How do I get to the point where I can confidently prove that I am ready for the job and have mastered these concepts.",4,0.7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qm6vml/whats_the_best_way_to_learn_this_tech_stack_for_a/,2026-01-25 02:38:33,2026-01-30 02:08:34

1ql95v5,Is libvlc suitable for music player development in C#?,SaintFTS,learnprogramming,"Caution: post contains rant.Hi there, first time posting here. I have a little question about C#, external libs and project development.To start - nearly 2 months ago i came up with idea to build my own cross-platform music player for csharp (i had no prior experience in such projects, but thought that it would be pretty easy. I was wrong). Primarily because i wanted to finally build some pet project for my portfolio to become at least minimally hirable, and because all the players were missing my crazy suggestions i'd come up with. For UI i chose Avalonia UI, because it's native C#, and Flutter would require C# and UI to communicate via ports, which is not really... good, i think. And i want to rant about it, holy crap, why are docs and guides are so ass? It was literally sucking my soul and happiness while i was browsing net to find ""how to do X in AvaloniaUI"". AI helped a bit on the frontend side just to understand basics of Avalonia and WPF, but still it wasn't a really good experience.Before choosing UI engine i had a big dilemma about Audio Engine. Long story short - i tried to debug OwnAudioSharp on my windows machine, but ran into windows-library-specific-quirk that OwnAudioSharp was somehow triggering and i dropped it. It's a great library, but i was trying to track down issues it was causing on Windows for 2 weeks straight, it was too much for me. Then came LibVLCSharp. I thought i've found a holy grail... I was horribly wrong. Unaware of almost completely asynchronous nature of LibVLC i was chasing ghosts, such as fixing library chewing audio playback if it wasn't awaited for ~40ms before playing (turned out i crutch-fixed an issue that's present in VLC itself), playback incapable of stopping if 1s of playback is left, tried to fix these quirks without await Task.Delay's for 6 HOURS STRAIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY. I did so much yet nothing. Even Event-to-Task pattern is absolutely incapable of synchronizing the start of music playback with code, it still causes race conditions. So i have a question for c# devs, **is libvlc even suitable for c# development? Or any player development** Because it is driving me crazy with every new quirk it introduces, and i am absolutely helpless when i try to fix it. I even permanently replaced windows with linux, but libvlc is the same...It also bugs me so much because, as i already said, i want to do a pet project to get at least some job in Tech. At least something to start growing as a real developer, and my inability to build anything is killing me inside.Thank you in advance!",3,0.72,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ql95v5/is_libvlc_suitable_for_music_player_development/,2026-01-24 01:18:54,2026-01-30 02:08:34

My APIs also control the UI on the frontend part. For example, a single could contain.1. Order Detail2. Buttons that will be displayed based on role. like a staff can only see the order, whereas a supervisor can modify it. And like this sometime there are even 10 of such buttons.3. Order metadata. Like a staff will only see the order date and quantity whereas manager can also see unit and sale cost.4. Also, let's say there is something like order\_assigned\_to, then in that case I will also send a list of eligible users to which order can be assigned. (In this particular case, i can also make one more API ""get-eligible-users//"". But which one is preferred.Somehow, my frontend guys don't like many APIs, I myself has not worked that much with next, react. So, I do what they ask me for.Generally what is preferred ? My APIs are very tightly coupled , do we take care of coupling in APIs as well.

I was very upfront in interviews(with my manager, tech lead and architect) that I didn’t have deep experience in their tech stack, but they still hired me cus they liked me and gave me \~30% base bump.Before applying I spoke to my skip and I was told I’d be doing architecture, data onboarding, detection/alerting, reporting, optimization. Reality: it’s a ton of platform admin + production fire-fighting. Constant ops, constant pressure, and not what I naturally thrive in.The team lives in reactive mode. Seniors help when I ask, but they’re overloaded, so real mentorship barely exists. I still get work done, but the environments are complex and full of dependencies outside my control, so some stories roll across sprints. I even took the training courses they recommended when I joined, and somehow that annoyed the scrum master because it slowed delivery.Year-end review came back Meets/Meets, but here’s the kicker: my current manager is retiring and the scrum master becomes my new manager. That’s what’s making me lose sleep. His feedback: deliver faster, work more independently, stop leaning on seniors, pick up “harder” tasks, no multi-sprint rollovers. He literally called some of my work “protective tasks” and said anyone should be able to pick up any story.Had a recent 1:1 two days ago where scrum master(new manager)he basically said, “Now that you’ll be reporting to me, I have expectations.” Faster output, constant upskilling, more ownership. None of that is crazy, but the tone felt like a spotlight got turned on me overnight. I’m the only junior internal hire on the team and I already feel the difference in how he treats contractors vs me. It feels less like coaching and more like evaluation.Honestly? It feels like the early stages of a PIP setup: watch closely, raise the bar, document gaps, then decide.The problem is also fit. Long term, I don’t want to be a platform admin or ops firefighter. I’m way better at architecture, data pipelines, analytics engineering, ETL, and strategy. This role is draining me mentally and killing my confidence.So now I feel like the clock started and I got 6 months until mid year.On one hand, I can grind, overdeliver, and try to survive under the new manager. On the other, I should probably start aggressively interviewing and pivot back into data engineering / warehouse roles before this turns ugly.The area of solace I have is I’ve got financial runway if shit hits the fan (have $710k NW) but I don’t want to waste months proving myself in a role I don’t even want.1)How do you tell if stricter expectations are normal vs quiet PIP prep?2)If you sense the clock started, do you grind harder or job hunt immediately?3)Anyone here move from platform/ops back into DE/warehouse successfully?4)What would you actually do if you were me?Appreciate any real answers.TL;DR: Internal transfer into observability platform role turned into ops/admin + firefighting. New manager coming in, raising expectations, feels like spotlight/PIP risk. Role mismatch + stress.

1qmr44k,It has never been a better time to talk to a real person,supyonamesjosh,cscareerquestions,"Recruiting sucks right now, but the most recent problems aren’t directly impacting the people searching for jobs. It has never been easier to automatically apply for positions with completely made-up resumes created by AI for a specific job. Hiring managers are pulling their hair out as they waste time interviewing people who made up their skills, interviewing people who try to use AI to answer interview questions and even completely different workers showing up for the first day of work than the one who was interviewed.&nbsp;This is an opportunity. &nbsp;Hiring managers do not want to go through this, and by far the easiest way to be sure a person who is applying for a job is real is to actually know this person. It has never been a better time to talk to people in real life rather than just hitting apply on an application that already had 50 people apply.&nbsp;Important note: The initial reaction to this may be fear that you are making people uncomfortable or imposing. 95% of the time this isn’t true. People like being helpful and if they can’t help they will forget about you the next day. &nbsp;Here are the three paths I would take in order of how serious you are in a job search. If you are unemployed do all three.&nbsp;* Go to industry events. Talk to everyone. One of the main points of presenting at industry events is to find talent. They exist so that they can find you. Ask everyone if they have anything open. This is especially true if you are early in your career. People with experience like helping people. It makes them feel powerful and important. Don’t stalk or pester anyone obviously, but you can ask if there are openings and if so what the best way is for people to see your resume to everyone.* Call up recruiters. Ask them about jobs they have open you are interested in. I want to emphasize that recruiters make money *by finding people jobs* calling them up is exciting! Not only are you a real person who has read the job description before applying, you also have another leg up in that you are showing you are proactive. Proactive is good. Proactive people are likely to be good at their job and thus make the recruiter the most money possible. My first job out of college was from this about 10 years ago. I asked specifically about a job, they said no you aren’t a good fit for that one, but how about this other one? Immediately was interviewed and hired.* Cold call/message/write to people who are managers for positions being advertised. This is the hardest one and potentially the scariest. It is going to be hard to figure out who you should be contacting and you could be completely wrong. There are two things you have going for you though: &nbsp;1. It’s pretty much impossible to annoy people from one polite message. If you are polite and there is nothing the person can do, they are probably just going to delete your message and move on with their day. They will forget you exist an hour later. If somehow your polite message offended them, they never ever were someone you wanted to work for anyways. Dodged a bullet.2. Managers absolutely cannot find anyone right now. I work with so many teams that have perpetual openings that just cannot be filled because everyone being interviewed is terrible. Any sort of lifeline is exciting. Maybe this will be the person that stops them from wasting hours every week in pointless interviews.&nbsp;Good luck out there.

1qpx9cu,Completely Stumped on Next Steps. Need some career advice :(,cjlcjl12,cscareerquestions,"So, I graduated about a year and a half ago, coming up on 2 years now. Trying to break into the CS job market has felt like a complete anomaly to me. For the first while I was putting out applications left and right, though I have admittedly slowed down and tried making fewer but more tailored applications. This strategy has at least lead to a few interviews, even making it to second stage interviews. Alas though, still ending in rejection.In the meantime I have managed to get a job at a local place with benefits and worked my way up in the past few years. While the pay isn't great and doesn't pay nearly enough to move out of my parents house, its enough income that I can afford car bills and paying chunks off of my (relatively small) student loans. Thank god for scholarships.The root of my problem though is that I'm losing motivation in the job hunt, I feel like I didn't truly understand what I was getting into going in CS. Originally I started college for Phys/Astro which was something I was extremely passionate about. Unfortunately I faced serious burnout in my courses and dealt with a pretty rough episode of depression coming fresh out of the COVID era. While I was able to keep up a nice GPA I was absolutely miserable. Then I discovered programming for the first time through some of my courses!I finally found a new thing that I was passionate about and enjoyed doing, I love math, I love applying concepts learned in tangible ways and programming felt like that to me. Sadly though I didn't really understand the scope of what I was getting into, I just saw the fun new things I was learning because learning has always been one of my favorite things to do. Now I'm sat here just having turned 25 last week with absolutely no idea what to do next. I've had to move a bit over an hour from my girlfriend and friends because I can't afford to live in the area I consider home anymore. I've considered pivoting to something new but attending \*more\* school really just isn't in the cards for me at the moment besides potentially some night classes at my local community college. Even then I'm not sure what I'd pivot too and I don't want to do the blind rush into something like I did last time since that's what got me into this mess. Many of my favorite things that I believe I would enjoy as a career don't pay nearly enough to live comfortably with the economy (US) being what it is right now and things don't appear to be changing positively.I guess my question then is just, where do I even go from here? I feel like there are both 100 directions and absolutely none.

I started working for an american company about 2 months ago as a backend making GPT wrappers in Python. I thought some of you guys would find my experience so far interesting/informative:Company is mid-sized subsidiary based in non-tech hub, doing automation with AI agents for enterprise clients. I was hired after a single non-technical interview to a 25k a year contract. I was one of six people hired (all latin americans) that started on the same day in an existing work team, there seem to be many other teams in the company as well doing similar stuff.Every senior, mid level and junior engineer is LATAM based, or either Indian or Pinoy (though those get assigned to other teams, I guess they want time-zone uniformity within teams). I'm from a South American country where 25k a year is above average living but nothing spectacular. There's plenty of Central American engineers in my team, which I suspect are paid even less. Middle management and higher positions are all US based, but seem experienced dealing with offshored labor. They seem to hire in chunks of 6-8 people at a time, I guess they don't feel they are taking much risk in doing so because of how little they have to pay compared to have US-based engineers.Before I got hired I had several interviews with US based companies. I had a second-round technical interview with a somewhat known Silicon-Valley company, I did OK at it but not great, they ghosted me after. I think the job posting was for like 40k a year (mid-level Silicon Valley SWE obv would make like 200-300k/year)BTW some of the nearshoring, LATAM focused agencies you will see spamming LinkedIn will pay 1k a month to juniors (I interviewed for one a year ago or so, didn't sign with them after they lowballed me super hard)I've done OK so far at my job, many of the guys who got hired alongside me are OK at coding but not super fluent in english, most of them seem a bit lost with regards to AI Agents (very new tech obv). I get the feeling expectations are not super high, and they will be satisfied if you do an adequate job.From what I've heard is that my company (or I guess it's parent company) is running an offshoring mill in Asia that is 5-10x the size of its LATAM offshoring operation.So yeah, this is where many american engineering jobs are going.

I’m early in my career and currently working as a Software Engineer at Apple. I’m enjoying the role so far, but I’ve been thinking a lot about long-term career direction and what “success” looks like in CS.One big thing is that I don’t think I want to be coding and staying super technical forever. I can see myself moving toward more leadership, product, or business-focused work over time, but I’m not sure what path makes the most sense.My parents are strongly encouraging me to pursue an MBA, especially if I can get into a top program like an M7. I’m open to it, but I’m not sure if it’s actually worth it given I’m already in a strong SWE position, and I don’t want to do it just because it sounds prestigious.I’m trying to understand what career paths realistically make sense from here, and what the day-to-day work looks like in those paths.If you’re already a SWE at a top company, when does an MBA actually make sense? For people who did a top MBA after SWE, what roles did you end up in and did it feel worth it? What does the day-to-day look like compared to SWE? Is the MBA mainly useful for switching careers, accelerating leadership growth, or networking?I’d also love to hear about salary differences. For roles people transitioned into after MBA (or without an MBA), what are typical salary ranges compared to staying on the SWE/technical track? Is there an average uplift people see after a top MBA?Also, should I be thinking about job security long term if I’m not trying to stay technical forever?

I've tried to think over about what I've been missing to improve, but it's something that I think I could not handle it.My experience is not relevant that I want. I stated working with Drupal to build a document management system with Drupal 7. This project was a nightmare because it was built by interns. There were not a senior engineer who taught and coordinated software architecture.In two years, we did not use Git as well as we wanted. Each guy had his own repository and there was a main repository to version the flagship product. You know, we broke distributed version concept.

I was working with a Scada Platform to build a OEE meter. This is worst project ever. Reductant code, spaghetti code, and overengineering were main problems there.I spent two years of my life in that company. Now, I have over 4 years of work experience, but they are no relevant to say I am full-stack developer.I sent my CV to several companies. Some companies failed, another ones I passed but manager/team lead said no because they thought my experience was not relevant. They said me you have never used CI/CD or Agile frameworks, maybe you skills are sharpen, but your soft skills are low because you always work alone.I think they are right. However, I do not know what I can do for solve it. If I send my CV to junior jobs, I am overqualified. If I send it to mid-level they rejected me because I do not have relevant experience. Also, If I have luck and they led me to participate in the process, The manager is going to reject me because I do not have real experience in the area.I am a loop.

1qpkt88,I feel like my skills are getting outdated in my DevOps role. Is changing jobs too risky now?,Overall-Reference999,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, I need some career advice. I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer in a B2B EdTech startup here in Brussels. I've been here for over 3 years now on a permanent contract (CDI), which means I have roughly 1.5 years left before I can reach the 5-year mark for my long-term residancy.The situation is a bit mixed. On one hand, I have quite some freedom and the people are great. We are mostly cloud native and use some nice tools like Azure DevOps and Terraform. I can choose some of my own tools, but only if I'm willing to really push for it. The problem is I'm basicly the only person with infra knowledge in my whole team, so I don't have anyone to learn from. Even though we are on the cloud, almost everything still runs on VMs. I've used Kubernetes in previous jobs before, but never with real scale, and it’s just not happening here because we don't have the traffic to justify it. I feel like if I stay here for the foreseen future I'll be way behind the market. Also the company hasn't reached break-even yet, even if they say they are hopeful for this year.I just got an offer for an SRE role at a very big e-commerce platform. The tech would be a huge step up with massive scale and a full Cloud Native environment (K8s, etc). I would be part of a proper SRE team of around 10 people, which is exactly what I want for my growth. The money is around 20% higher, so not the biggest pro of this change.The big issue is that the new offer is a 1-year fixed term contract to start. I have about 6 years of total expierience and some savings so I'm not broke, but I'm really worried about the stability. Since my legal status is tied to my employment, I really need to stay employed for the next 1.5 years without any gaps.If things go wrong or they don't renew after the first year, I'm afraid of messing up my plans. Is the techincal growth and joining a proper team worth the potential risk to my long-term stay here?",8,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qpkt88/i_feel_like_my_skills_are_getting_outdated_in_my/,2026-01-28 19:10:15,2026-01-30 02:08:36
1qp9418,Making a career change. Looking for serious advice please,SuperKaleido,cscareerquestions,"I know you probably see these posts every day, but I just wanted to put my hat in the ring and ask for some solid advice on my approach from you lovely people.I am a 33-year-old male living in London. I have:\- Placement on a 4-year part-time Comp Sci & Ai Degree at Birkbeck University starting in October, attending 2 x 6-9pm classes a week from Mon - Fri **(Shows my long-term commitment and dedication to the field)**\- CompTIA A+ I am studying for and expect to be finished by the end of March **(Shows basic aptitudes and foundations of IT)**\- Home labs and projects to be uploaded to GitHub, as I am doing some independent learning on KodeKloud by end of April **(Shows independent drive and examples of self-study)**\- 8 years working in hospitality management, 9 months as an account exec. in an advertising agency, and 2.5 years working as a freelance graphic and web designer creating assets for small clients, independents and hospitality venues **(Strong soft skills and proof of continuous working attitude)**I have always had a love of technical problem-solving because of my strong sense of step-by-step analytical thinking (which I sometimes attribute to my heavy OCD). I've always tried to create a strong sense of structure and organisation within systems in whatever role I've been working in, regardless of the industry, and found myself being drawn to IT/Tech because of the way my brain works and enjoys the nature of work.Eventually, I'd love to move into Cloud/DevOps and be responsible for the stability of networks within an organisation, and after my degree, I'd like to pursue an Integrated Machine Learning Systems Master's at UCL to expand my knowledge and skills to move into MLOps at some point in the future. Hoping to make a meaningful contribution to an industry where my mind seems to be suited for possibly becoming an innovator in the field, or assisting teams with making major advancements in Machine Learning in an Engineering role, possibly even with embodied Ai when robotics begins to become more prevalent in society from 2030 onwards.I possess a strong sense of emotional intelligence, the ability to present and communicate with stakeholders in non-technical terms, and a proven ability to work with and effectively manage teams of others. These traits are proven in my previous work experience as a freelance designer and my years in hospitality management, working in some of the top venues in London.Some questions:What should I avoid doing? What can I highlight from my candidate profile? Is there anything else I should do to strengthen my profile? Is this enough for me to apply for entry-level IT jobs in help desk or other role?

1qoffh3,Overwhelmed at new job as full stack developer,HelpfulStrawberry908,cscareerquestions,"Hi all, i just started a new role as a full stack developer at a startup working on web and mobile apps. This is my 2nd job as a software engineer, my first role was in a factory, and it is more of a IT support role for their internal web software. Background of me, i have degree in electrical engineering and i am a bootcamp career switcher into SWE.In my previous role, there was no SDLC going on and most of the work is user requested bug fix or small feature improvements, and it was mainly recorded on excel sheets. There was no sprints, scrum or whatever, and i am usually the only person working on the code. Now i have changed company due to the previous one being slightly outdated, and this new company is alot more modern. They have 2 week sprints and work in agile team with daily standup, and have alot of SWE working on the same app. I am taken aback by the amount of tasks there is, and the very strict protocols about resolving tickets, sprints, proper SDLC, git branching and merging, and code reviews. Now i am feeling some imposter syndrome, not sure if i will be able to fully contribute independently to the work. I know some people will say, you passed the interview so the company know your level before selecting you. But it doesnt help that almost all the engineers in the team are senior with CS degrees and know indepth what they are doing, and i am feeling lost all the time. It has been a few days since i started, this imposter syndrome is getting to me and affecting me at work slightly, making me doubt myself all the time.Is this normal?

1qnvx9f,"Debating WGU vs OMSCS (Georgia Tech), Help Wanted!",Gjallock,cscareerquestions,"So I’m coming to the end of my bachelor's in CS from WGU and have a decision to make. For context, this is where I’m at.I’m 24. I have an associate's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from a local community college, which helped kickstart my career as an automation engineer. For those who aren’t familiar, an automation engineer, in my case, is responsible for the automation of manufacturing equipment. I’m way oversimplifying here, but the job entails developing and troubleshooting specialized controllers that typically use non-traditional programming languages. Principles remain largely the same, so there is definitely a huge skill overlap between programming and the ever-growing need for more advanced computer systems for control and data acquisition in manufacturing. Today, I have about 8 years of full-time industry experience (4 as an engineer) and am almost finished with my bachelor's in CS from WGU.I started my CS program at WGU to check a promotion box in my current career. Still, I've always had a nagging fantasy of moving into a software engineering position or a similar role. With that in mind, what would be the wisest choice for me for a master's program?WGU affords me time, which is very important to me right now. My current position demands a lot of my time, and I never know when I might get called in to work. I am 24/7 on-call site support and the lead for my team, which means even on my “off” weeks, I’m still supporting the juniors. It’s a lot. OMSCS appears to be a much more rigorous workload AND schedule, but carries much more prestige. My main question is for folks who are already in the software engineering field. How much does that prestige matter for \*me\*? Do you feel my experience is relevant enough, or would I be filtered out immediately? I’m currently making around 105k base in an MCOL city, but am also worried about starting pay. I will be receiving a roughly \~7% raise this year and expect around \~10-15% the following year with a promotion. That puts my base at about 125k by the time I assume a master's program would wrap up. Would I be shooting myself in the foot by expecting a significant pay drop to make this transition happen?I’m hoping someone else has been through a similar path, but I’ve found my situation to be pretty unique and am struggling to find good resources as I don’t have a single connection within the tech industry.

I assumed this would be my go to person/senior. However this person does not give me tasks or really communicate with me at all. If I ask questions they answer them, but they delegate nothing to me nor have they taken anytime to explain how our services work-basically our only communication we have is if I reach out with a question. I am okay with working independently and figuring things out but it feels super weird to sit in silence and to wonder what I should be doing besides familiarizing myself with our codebases.I finally managed to suggest something small to do to them, add some additionally error handling to an api + some unit tests and they just said go ahead and submit a PR and I’ll review. The PR hasn’t been reviewed yet after 4 days. I have a manger that is the manger for the whole dev team but not technical, and he told my priorities should be getting api x working, which it is and then to begin work on brand new service.We don’t use JIRA or anything of the sort either.

1qll45l,"Last year of school, can't get an internship, what should I do?",UnfairAnything,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I'm graduating in May 2027 in a pretty no-name university in Canada. I have one non-SWE internship I got during last summer, but during Fall I spammed out maybe 1000 applications, got one interview, then rejected at the final stage. I'm not getting any OAs or interviews at all. I can barely sleep at night anymore, maybe 4-5 hours without some sort of anxiety attack or impending doom so I just really need some guidance right now if possible.",6,0.88,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qll45l/last_year_of_school_cant_get_an_internship_what/,2026-01-24 11:54:32,2026-01-30 02:08:36

But it seems like IT is a completely different track than SWE with a different skillset and career progression, even if you are networks/systems engineer trying to switch to SWE.So I am curious, are there any software engineers here that made it out of the IT support world? If so, how did you do it?",4,0.75,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qpq0m3/has_anyone_here_transitioned_from_it_to_swe/,2026-01-28 22:21:41,2026-01-30 02:08:36
