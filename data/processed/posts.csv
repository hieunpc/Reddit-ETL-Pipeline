1qcw5qe,Data modeling is far from dead. It’s more relevant than ever,eczachly,dataengineering,There’s been an interesting shift in the seas with AI. Some people saying we don’t need to do facts and dimensions anymore. This is a wild take because product analytics don’t suddenly disappear because LLM has arrived. It seems like to me that multi-modal LLM is bringing together the three types of data:\- structured \- semi-structured\- unstructured Dimensional modeling is still very relevant but will need to be augmented to include semi-structured outputs from the parsing of text and image data. The necessity for complex types like VARIANT and STRUCT seems to be rising. Which is increasing the need for data modeling not decreasing it. It feels like some company leaders now believe you can just point an LLM at a Kafka queue and have a perfect data warehouse which is still SO far from the actual reality of where data engineering sits today Am I missing something or is the hype train just really loud right now?,71,0.91,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qcw5qe/data_modeling_is_far_from_dead_its_more_relevant/,2026-01-14 19:04:52,2026-01-16 01:51:51

The organizations's data volumes are small - I only need single-node compute, not distributed Spark clusters.**Polars** looks perfect for this scenario. I've heard a lot of good feedback about Polars. But I’ve also heard some warnings that it might move behind a paywall (Polars Cloud) and the open-source project might end up abandoned/not being maintained in the future.**Spark** is said to have more committed backing from big sponsors, and doesn't have the same risk of being abandoned. But it's heavier than what I need.If I use Polars now, am I potentially just building up technical debt? Or is it reasonable to trust it for production long-term?

1qaut4d,"Data Engineer by title, not by work. Feeling stuck and unsure what to do next.",mindwrapper13,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I have a little over five years of experience. I started my career as a Software Engineer working on Python-based full stack applications for 2 years and later moved into a Data Engineer role at a new company because there were very few Python backend opportunities at the time.Over the last three and a half years, I’ve realised that I never really got to work as a “proper” data engineer. Most of my work involved data administration, Python automation, some cloud services, cloud data warehouses, basic data modelling, and a few simple Airflow pipelines that pulled data from APIs and loaded it using pandas. I never worked with Spark or large-scale data pipelines.Now that I’m trying to switch jobs, I’m in a confusing spot. Based on my experience, companies expect me to be a Senior Data Engineer, but I don’t have hands-on experience with many of the tools they expect at that level. At the same time, when I get considered for junior roles, the pay is around 50 percent lower than what I make today. It’s also hard not to compare myself to people with fewer years of experience who seem to have worked on far more complex data systems.I’m willing to start now, learn Spark seriously, build strong projects, and put in the effort. I’m just unsure if it’s too late at this stage or if taking a pay cut is the only way to reset my career. Is there a smarter way to transition into real data engineering without completely derailing things?Any honest advice would really help.TL;DR: 5+ YOE with a Data Engineer title but limited real DE experience.

1qdv3wh,Getting off of Fabric.,FirefighterFormal638,dataengineering,"Just as the title says. Fabric has been a pretty rough experience.I am a team of one in a company that has little data problems. Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs, and Cassandra.A little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. I moved into data engineering at this company after they pitched the role as a *greenfield opportunity* that had already adopted Fabric, but was open to new tech.I took the role because:* the impact would be high* I’m currently doing a master’s (OMSA)* it felt like the right next step career-wiseNow to the problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.The core issues:* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview featuresThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.Coming from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.It's my opinion that the company didn't know what they needed so they went with a consultant that hyped Fabric as a no-code, low-code best option since they didn't have anyone with a proper skillset. It's time for me to pitch alternatives while also keeping in mind potential new skill sets that will be hired in the future. Management has hinted that I'd be leading a team eventually and leveraging the data for ML projects in the future.I'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.DE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.",39,0.98,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qdv3wh/getting_off_of_fabric/,2026-01-15 20:39:42,2026-01-16 01:51:51

1q9gsng,Porfolio worthy projects?,Tamzes,dataengineering,"Hi all! I'm a junior data engineer interested in DE / BE. I’m trying to decide which (if any) of these projects to showcase on my CV/portfolio/LinkedIn, and I’d love if you could take a very quick look and give me some feedback on which are likely to strengthen vs hurt my CV/portfolio. [**data-tech-stats**](https://github.com/simon-milata/data-tech-stats) ([Live Demo](https://dts.simonmilata.com/)) My latest project which I'm still finishing up. The point of this project was to actually deploy something real while keeping the costs close to 0 and to design an actual API. The DE part is getting the data from GitHub, storing it in S3, aggregating and then visualizing it. My worry is that this project might be a bit too simple and generic. [**Study-Time-Tracker-Python**](https://github.com/simon-milata/Study-Time-Tracker-Python) This was my first actual project and the first time using git so the code quality and git usage weren't great. It's also not at all something I would do at work and might seem too amateurish. I do think it's pretty cool tho as it looks pretty nice, is unique and even has a few stars and forks which I think is pretty rare.[**TkinterOS**](https://github.com/simon-milata/TkinterOS) This was my second project which I made cause I saw GodotOS and thought it would be cool to try to recreate it using Tkinter. It includes a bunch of games and an (unfinished) file system. It also has a few stars but the code quality still is still bad. Very unrelated to work too. I know this might feel out of place being posted on a DE sub but these are the only presentable projects I have so far and I'm mostly interested in DE. These projects were mostly made to practice python and make stuff. For my next project I'm planning on learning PySpark and trying Redshift / Databricks. My biggest issue is that I feel like the difficulty of DE is the the scale of the data and regulations which is very hard / very expensive to recreate. I also don't really want to make simple projects which just transform some fake data once. Sorry for the blocks of text I have no idea how to write reddit posts.

1qca3r2,Am I under skilled for my years of experience?,OrganicSun3556,dataengineering,"My experience: DE in a FTSE financial services company for almost 2 years. I am worried that my companies limited tech stack / my narrow role is limiting my career progression - not sure if what my day to day work looks like is normal? My role is primarily around building internal facing data products in Snowflake for the business. I have owned and delivered a significant and highly used 'customer 360' MDM data product as the main/sole data engineer in my team, but my role is really just that - I don't do much else outside of Snowflake. We also don't use Dbt so I don't have any real world experience with that either. Similar to another post made on here recently, I don't know how to do a lot of stuff that is mentioned on here simply because I've never had the chance to. I don't really know what containerisation is, I don't know how to spin up VM's, all the different Azure/AWS tools. In terms of technical skills, I would rank myself as the following:* SQL - Intermediate (maybe creeping into advanced here and there but I need AI help). I can write production level code* Data modelling - beginner (can design/build a 3nf and star schema, I dont understand data vault)* Python - I'm not specialised at all as we don't really use Python too much but I can write Python code well enough that it is understood by anyone, although it might not be optimal, and I can understand/copy most Python code I've seen. I have a few Python projects I've done over the years.* APIs - no experience* Kafka - understand the concepts but I find it so complicated. I've made a new topics and connectors with a lot of help.* Dbt - 2 projects I've done on my own, no experience at work.* Airflow - played around with it with some personal projects but nothing major - my team doesn't use it at work so I have no opportunity to* CI/CD - fairly good understanding* Documentation - I can make good documentation.",13,0.9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qca3r2/am_i_under_skilled_for_my_years_of_experience/,2026-01-14 01:39:22,2026-01-16 01:51:51

1qahyip,Best Bronze Table Pattern for Hourly Rolling-Window CSVs with No CDC?,SoloArtist91,dataengineering,"Hi everyone, I'm running into bit of dilemma with this bronze level table that I'm trying to construct and need some advice. The data for the table is sent hourly by the vendor 16 times in the day as a CSV that has transaction data in a 120 day rolling window. This means each file is about 33k rows by 233 columns, around 50 MB. There is no last modified timestamp, and they overwrite the file with each send. The data is basically a report they run on their DMS with a flexible date range, so occasionally we request a history file so they send us one big file per store that goes across several years.The data itself changes state for about 30 days or so before remaining static, so that means that roughly 3/4s of the data may not be changing from file to file (though there might be outliers).So far I've been saving each file sent in my Azure Data Lake and included the timestamp of the file in the filename. I've been doing this since about April and have accumulated around 3k files.Now I'm looking to start loading this data into Databricks and I'm not sure what's the best approach to load the bronze layer between several approaches I've researched.Option A: The bronze/source table should be append-only so that every file that comes in gets appended. However, this would mean I'd be appending 500kish rows a day, and 192m a year which seems really wasteful considering a lot of the rows would be duplicates.Option B: the bronze table should reflect the vendors table at the current state, so each file should be upserted into the bronze table - existing rows are updated, new rows inserted. The criticisms I've seen of this approach is that it's really inefficient, and this type of incremental loading is best suited for the silver/warehouse layer.Option C: Doing an append only step, then another step that dedupes the table based on a row hash after a load. So I'd load everything in, then keep only the records that have changed based on business rules.For what it's worth, I'm hoping to orchestrate all of this through Dagster and then using DBT for downstream transformations.Does one option make more sense than the others, or is there another approach I'm missing?",9,0.92,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qahyip/best_bronze_table_pattern_for_hourly/,2026-01-12 01:51:22,2026-01-16 01:51:51

1qbs00s,"Is maintenance necessary on bronze layer, append-only delta lake tables?",frithjof_v,dataengineering,"Hi all,I am ingesting data from an API. On each notebook run - one run each hour - the notebook makes 1000 API requests. In the notebook, all the API responses get combined into a single Dataframe, and the dataframe gets written to a bronze delta lake table (append mode).Next, a gold notebook reads the newly inserted data from the bronze table (using a watermark timestamp column) and writes it to a gold table (also append).On the gold table, I will run optimize or auto compaction, in order to optimize for end user queries. I'll also run vacuum to remove old, unreferenced parquet files.However, on the bronze layer table, is it necessary to run optimize and vacuum there? Or is it just a waste of resources?Initially I'm thinking that it's not necessary to run optimize and vacuum on this bronze layer table, because end users won't query this table. The only thing that's querying this table frequently is the gold notebook, and it only needs to read the newly inserted data (based on the ingestion timestamp column). Or should I run some infrequent optimize and vacuum operations on this bronze layer table?For reference, the bronze table has 40 columns, and each hourly run might return anything from ten thousand to one million rows.Thanks in advance for sharing your advices and experiences.",8,0.9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qbs00s/is_maintenance_necessary_on_bronze_layer/,2026-01-13 13:58:26,2026-01-16 01:51:51

For eg I can have Spreadsheets for some data and join it in Looker to BigQuery.**Why AirByte**A big part of this is deciding on an ETL. When I started we were using Celigo but found them to be pretty inflexible on billing. It's just a good example of lock-in I want to avoid. So I've been testing the Airbyte Shopify->BigQuery connector and it seems to do what i need. While it has the commercial solution, I feel confident I can switch to the community (open source) version later if I wanted to self host an ETL (which i think is a good long-term strategy in this day and age).**Lock-in thoughts**We are a Microsoft/Sharepoint place and while I don't dislike Azure I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft. We happened to already have Looker and GA because our Shopify vendor preferred it, and the business has never questioned this. So essentially I've put a Google Cloud strategy around these tools, and adding BigQuery is a bit of a no brainer. Obviously there is cloud lock-in to Google here, but in the massive event of Google dropping Looker/BigQuery I reckon we would survive as a business since most of our operational stuff is over in Shopify.**Doubts**The Shopify analytics platform is insanely good. If I could add some custom data to it I wouldn't be here writing this post. But I don't think that's in their business strategy to be a generic BI tool.Unexpected costs are always a concern.

1qa4iwo,Newbie looking for some advice/guidance - long post,PPEverythingg,dataengineering,"Hey guys, so I’m very new to all of this so trying to sort it all out. Looking for help! I did go through the search by on this page, and found a decent amount of answers - however I honestly need it explained like im 5 and then I have some follow ups.. and then FAQ won’t open for me. So I’ll start with my background and situation -I’m 29 years old, and I am a EHS (environmental health and safety) manager for a FAANG company. It’s a stable career. However I am not very content there. I kind up ended up in this career on accident, and then ran with it. I used to be a computer science major, and spent a year or so learning coding through books and online programs as well. I withdrew from the course, because honestly I siked my self out of it. I convinced myself the market for that field is just too competitive and that it would be a waste of time for me. Reason I felt I didn’t have a chance is because I’m not really in a position to be able to internships as I cannot leave my job to do any (sole provider family of 5) so I felt I was at too big of a disadvantage.Well I finally decided, I do want to pursue tech because that field is what I truly enjoy. This is part where I need help, I’m having a hard time figuring out exactly what role I should pursue/what the natural progression is for these roles? So to breakdown my interest - I am really interested in all things data, I love engineering/coding, and I’m a big excel nerd. I would like to get into power BI as well, just haven’t jumped on. I do a decent amount of data work at my role now, because my company is huge on metrics/data. I use excel daily to deep dive data and analyze trends and what not on there, and I’ve made a lot of tools/trackers as well.So what I’ve kinda narrowed down for the main data roles areData AnalystData ScientistData EngineerBusiness Intelligence AnalystSo do all these roles progress together like advance through them, or are they all entirely separate paths? I wanted to see if someone could explain them to me like I’m 5, and then maybe tell me which kind of degree is recommended for each one? I have a decent understanding of data analyst/BI Analyst- so are those starting points to eventually become data engineers? Im also confused on this, because everything I’ve read online is that it seems none of them are entry level, so how would I start?The two degrees im tossing around right now are from WGU - either Data Analytics or go back to Computer Science. Are there other/better degrees out there I should explore for this field?TLDR - Questions:\- can someone break down the main different data roles simply and how/if they progress together?\- What’s the better option for a degree - Data Analytics, Computer Science, or is there something else I should explore?\- Which degrees are beneficial for each different data role?\- Is it dumb for me to want to leave my stable career to pursue this?\- Do I even have a chance without really being able to any internships?\-What’s the best role for breaking into this field?Sorry guys I know this a lot!

We've taken that and expanded it into this!For those interested in the tech stack:1. C++ for internal processing engine + DuckDB, Swift + AppKit for UI2. Wrote our own custom caching engine, and SQL transpiler in C++. Transpiler takes DuckDB SQL and converts it into native SQL for full predicate pushdown (i.e. Athena, BigQuery, ClickHouse, Snowflake, Postgres, etc).3. Wrote our own graphing library from scratch, all GPU native using custom shaders.4. Wrote a custom Amazon S3 OS integration to replicate S3 buckets on Finder. Intercepts sys-level calls to reference remote data.5. Super limited use of AI code. i.e. no vibe coding. Claude is high as a kite.

1qd17gs,Many DE tasks and priorities to organize,hegardian,dataengineering,"Where I work, there is no Scrum. Tickets keep coming in, and the coordinator distributes them and sets priorities. There are no sprints, because management frequently overrides priorities due to requests from the board and other management areas—almost on a daily basis. It’s basically a ticket queue that we execute as it comes.During the day, I receive many different demands: validating data, mapping new tables, checking alerts from failed processes, discussions about possible data inconsistencies, reviewing PRs, helping interns, answering questions from people on other teams, etc.Sometimes more than 10 people message me at the same time on Teams. I try to filter, organize priorities, and postpone what is not feasible to do on the same day, but more demands arrive than I can realistically handle, so tasks keep piling up.We do have a team board, but I don’t like tracking everything there because some tasks are things like “talk to person X about Y” or “validate what person X did wrong,” which I don’t want to expose directly to colleagues and managers. So on the board I keep things more generic, without many commentsLately, I’ve been putting everything into a single markdown file (tasks and personal notes). The most urgent items go to the top of the list as a simple TODO, but it keeps growing and sometimes it becomes hard to manage tasks and prioritiesNaturally, there are tasks that never get done. My manager is aware of this and agrees that they should only be prioritized when it makes sense, but new ones keep coming in, and I miss having a tool where I could search for similar tasks or something along those linesHave you ever faced this difficulty in organizing tasks? Do you have any tips for a simple workflow? I tried using some tools like Todoist and Taskwarrior, but I ended up preferring the ease of searching in a single file, even though it grows very large very quickly and eventually becomes messy and difficult to manage.

This reduces the risk of data being lost during processing.The changing data would be stored in a new table every month, and once that data is around five years old it would be deleted (or handled in a similar way).I know this sounds fairly simple, but there will be thousands of data entries in the CSV files every 10 minutes.Do you have any tips or advice? Is it a bad idea to split the unchanging string data into a separate table to save space?

1qaamfb,Low retention of bronze layer record versions and lineage divergence,Personal-Quote5226,dataengineering,"In the bronze layer, our business is ok (and desires) the clean up of older versions of records. In fact, we can't guarantee that we'll be able to keep this history forever. We'll always keep active records and can always re-build bronze with active records. However, we do have gold level data and aggregate fact table, and it's possible that some of the records in gold could be from a snapshot in time. Let's say there are 3 records in a gold fact that summarize a total. Record 1: ID=1, ver=5 ,Amount=$100 Record 2: ID=2, ver=5, Amount=$100 Record 3: ID=3, ver=3, Amount=$50There will be a point in time where this gold fact will persist and not be updated even if Record with ID=1 has a change in the amount in bronze layer. This is by design and is a business requirement.Eventually in bronze, record with ID=1 changes to ver=6 and Amount now=$110.This time, we don't want to update the gold fact for this scenario, so it remains as ver=5.Eventually, in bronze, due to retention, we lose the bronze record for ver=5, but we still keep v=6. The gold still has a record of what the value was at the time and a record that it's based on the record being v=5.The business is fine with it; and in fact they prefer it. The like the idea of being able to access the specific version in bronze as it was at the time, but if it's lost due to retention then they are ok with that because they will just trust the number in the gold fact table; they'll know why it doesn't match source by comparing the version value. As a data expert, I struggle with it. We lose row-version lineage back to bronze, but the business is ok with that risk. As data engineers, how do you feel about this scenario? We can compromise on the implementation, and I believe we are still ensuring trust of the data in other ways (for their needs) by keeping the copy of the record (what the value was at the time) in gold for the purposes of financial review and analysis.

1qbyv1w,Protip: don’t use AI when you are learning programming.,mazda7281,learnprogramming,"I’m a senior developer working currently as a Team Leader for big corporation. We are currently recruiting and amount of junior, mid and sometimes even senior developers, who cannot write a simple code by their own without using AI is absolutely ridicoulous.AI can be helpful at work, but when you learn, it can hurt you more than it helps. It gives you answers too fast. You paste the code, it runs, and you feel good for a moment… but you don’t really know why it works. Then later you get a different problem, something small changes, and suddenly you are stuck. And the worst part is: you don’t build the “debug muscle”, and debugging is a big part of programming.I see this with juniors sometimes. They can produce code, but when I ask “why did you do it this way?” they can’t explain. When tests fail, they panic. When an error shows up, they don’t know what to try first. It’s not because they are not smart. It’s because AI took the hard part away, and that hard part is exactly what builds skill and confidence.When you learn, the best thing is to struggle a little. Write the code yourself. Read the error message. Try to understand what the program is doing. Use print logs or a debugger. Read docs. It feels slow and annoying at first, but this is how you become strong. This is how you start to “see” problems.If you really want to use AI, use it like a helper, not like a driver. Ask for a hint, not a full solution. Ask what an error means. Ask to explain one line.

Almost every time I get a task, my team lead says something like:“Here is a small task, this should take you 1–2 days.”But in the end, it usually takes me 5–6 days to finish. I know I’m still a junior, but it really annoys me that I’m so slow. And in meetings, when I say that I’m still not finished, he sometimes looks at me like I’m stupid. Maybe I’m just overthinking it, but it really gets to me. Another thing is that when I try to learn something new, it takes me a really long time to understand it. If a “normal” developer needs maybe 1–2 hours to get it, it often takes me 4–5 hours. That makes me feel even worse, like I’m just not smart enough for this field.I know that programming is not for everyone, and sometimes I’m scared that I might be one of those people who are just not made for this job. The worst part is that I actually want to be good. I really like programming. But the daily work often demotivates me so much. I even started a project at home (a small Mini CRM) to improve my skills, and I want to learn Azure and later move more into cloud / cybersecurity. That’s my long-term goal. But another problem is that after work I’m often so mentally exhausted and demotivated that I don’t even want to touch my own project anymore.

Still, sometimes I feel like I will never be good enough to be a proper software developer.So I wanted to ask: Is it normal for junior developers to feel like this?

1qb7a1b,What does a Software Architect actually do all day?,Significant_Loss_541,learnprogramming,I used to think it was about drawing fancy diagrams and picking the latest frameworks. Then I learned its actually the opposite.Most of my time goes into subtraction not addition. Removing dependencies that nobody needs. Cutting connections between systems that shouldnt talk. Simplifying whats already there before building something new.The hardest part is saying no to complexity that feels exciting but solves yesterdays problem.Good architecture is invisible. When it works developers dont fight the system they flow with it. When it fails every change becomes a negotiation with technical debt.Heres what a typical week looks like for me.Monday a new requirement arrives that breaks three assumptions from last quarter. Back to the drawing board.Tuesday and Wednesday are deep work days. Sketching out how systems should interact or better yet how they shouldnt. Looking for the natural grain of the problem.Thursday is code reviews and design discussions. This is where theory meets reality. Developers will tell you very quickly if your elegant solution makes their lives harder.Friday is documentation. Not the kind nobody reads but the kind that answers why did we do it this way when Im not around.The real skill isnt knowing every design pattern or framework. Its knowing when NOT to use them.The best code is code you dont write. The best dependency is one you removed. The best architecture feels obvious in hindsight.Will I miss writing code every day? Probably. Theres something satisfying about seeing your function work perfectly at 2 AM.But theres a different satisfaction in seeing a system that ten developers can understand and extend without calling you. In building something that doesnt fall apart when requirements change and they always do.Thats the job.

Noticed clear patterns across all successful implementations that our initial design was completely missing.They make sharing incredibly easy with pre-written messages and one-click options, show clear benefit to both referrer and referred person like ""give $10 get $10"", display progress toward rewards so you know how close you are, prompt sharing at natural moments like after completing task not randomly, make rewards actually valuable not just badges or points.Applied all these patterns to our feature by simplifying sharing to one click with customizable message, implemented two-sided incentive with real value, added progress tracking prominently, triggered share prompts after positive experiences like successful workflow completion.Feature launched 3 weeks ago and referral rate is 23% meaning almost quarter of users refer at least one person, PM says that's way higher than initial goal of 10%. Honestly just copied what works for other products instead of making up our own approach, turns out proven patterns exist for most features and following them works better than trying to be original.Biggest lesson is when building growth features research is more important than innovation, these patterns have been tested millions of times already so just implement what works.

But lately I have been feeling that I am honestly getting dumber. I feel like even the small amount of knowledge I had is fading away. I have been using AI to help me learn (but lets be honest, I have used it to generate a lot of code for me) and that made me lazy. I was getting frustrated with when AI wasn't doing what i wanted it to do and I kept asking and asking until it gave me a solution, not necessarily a good one. And I kept going.Has anyone felt the same way using AI? It honestly made me dumber. At some point I had to google the syntax for a for loop. And not that I was just blindly accepting all the code it generate. I was reading it, I was re-typing it (mindlessly), but at the end of the day I felt like I was loosing the little knowledge I have. This feel like the AA (Anonymous AI) rant. But I have been forcing myself to stop using AI. No code completions, no code generation. Just me, VSCode (which is also all about AI) and good old Google.

But I’ve recently been reading about the job market for ux/ui design (which is my area of interest and eventual job seeking) and have read that the barrier of entry is a lot higher and that AI will be doing a lot of the front-end work for companies. I’m concerned that I’d be wasting my time only focusing on front-end and not have it pay off. I like programming because you have to keep up with emerging technologies and always have to improve. With that said I have some questions:1. Will getting a cs degree actually help me find a job? From what I read on this subreddit it seems like everybody recommends that you have a degree to stand out and land a job. 2. Should I continue my self study and switch to a full stack learning program to stand out? (Which I’m seriously considering) And if I do what additional learning should I do? I’ve read on here that DSA is something that companies look for when hiring, should I add that to things I should study? What projects should I create that will help me stand out to companies when I feel competent enough in my skills? (Again under the assumption I switched to full stack) I welcome all feedback!

1qbu5z8,Interested in learning to code for the purposes of career pivot but only have an old laptop w linux. What are my options?,Crapahedron,learnprogramming,"I'm a manual QA who is interested in learning to code with the purposes of moving out of QA and into a jr role (eventually. I know it's a long game.) My unit is going to be downsizing over the next year or two as our automation platforms increase in scope weening out the need for largescale manual testers. This will be the second time I'm going to get downsized out in replacement for devs. I want to avoid going through this cycle a third time, so I'm making it a priority to start learning development so perhaps I can move into something a little more stable longterm. (Let's pretend AI isn't a thing at the moment.) Here's the issue: I don't really own any personal computers. I've always had work issued machines, and I can't use it for personal projects. What I do have is an old thinkpad (I'm talking really old.) I've since swapped the old harddrive out and replaced it with an SSD and doubled the ram so it's at least functional... I then installed Ubuntu on it. With legacy hardware such as this (it's a thinkpad x220 from 2011....that keyboard tho!) what are my actual options? I know I won't be building native iOS apps on this brick.... but what are some domains I could actually consider working towards some subject matter learning? Coming from a windows only work environment, I'm actually very excited to work in a *unix environment proper. Here are things I'm interested in:* Ruby / Rails (ruby is so funky)* Webdev in general (html/css/js + framework of choice)* C development / OS dev / Kernel Dev (out of my league difficulty wise but probably the most doable on legacy linux machine)* infosec / security (I can mangle this laptop, nobody will care.)* stretch option: windows app dev with c# and visual studioI'm very curious about programs like The Odin project for one of the first two points. Looking through it, its interesting that it forces you to use git and pull down and push up your work into a github repo which is FANTASTIC to replicate a real life workflow. I really don't like writing in the browser based editor for freecodecamp (though, it might migrate me to an editor later in the program I dunno)Given that linux is a brand new thing to me, I'm finding it to be an amazing environment to move around in. It's just so fascinating. It would be a good place to learn C because I'm not afraid of blowing up the machine by messing with a kernel file or something. (I have ubuntu on a bootable USB and can full wipe/install in about 20 minutes)AS someone who only has cursory domain knowledge of these areas of interest, there are likely things I'm not fully aware of, or considering when making a decision.

I wanted to go into research originally, but soon after graduation realized I hated it. I also was diagnosed with many different chronic illnesses, and these make it difficult to stand for long periods of times. Since 2022, I have been working in a medical pathology lab working in many of the different departments. I currently am a night supervisor there, and I act as a pathology assistant for the pathologist/doctors.I don’t necessarily want to stay in the medial field, hence why I have been looking into new career fields. I recently came across computer programming and seemed to really like it. I also get bored very easily with mundane tasks, and I like the idea that computer programming is constantly fixing bugs, making new codes, and problem solving, even if it’s semi-similar.I am asking for advice since I am not sure where to start. After some research I have noticed that many people have not gone to school for computer science, yet still work as a software engineer.I have already stated Coursea and their computer programming workshop that gives me certification at the end. I know this is not much and will not just get me job. I know I will need to work hard to learn at least Java Script and Python very well and build a portfolio.I sadly can’t really go back to school with my current situation, plus it’s not something I can afford. Therefore, I really am trying to find online resources or programs. I am willing to join a fully online program since I can deal with that along with my work schedule, as long as it’s under 5k.My main question is pretty broad, I am looking for any advice, resources, realism/realistic thoughts, and possible areas of computer programming/software engineering that I should focus on.

1q99oo3,Personal projects to learn distributed systems,Prestigious_Towel_18,learnprogramming,"Hi there! I'll try to be as brief as possible.I started working as a software developer at a small start-up in February 2025 and ended up leading a small project that's more or less a small fleet manager. There are many things that apps like fleetio have that the client does not require so please keep that in mind. Our team is of two people and a PM.I'm the one that leads the meetings and decides on architecture basically. While I know it sounds completely insane that someone with such little experience is doing this, it has been working well so far and the client is really happy.With that in mind I started reading DDIA because as I have no senior to learn from, it's quite difficult to know how to scale things, how, when to scale, etc. it might not even be necessary that we scale out, but it is a topic I'm super interested in so the book is super helpful.My question after all this intro is, is it possible to apply DDIA concepts to personal projects for the sake of it?I had a quick idea to spin up an app like Pastebin to generate unique links of text, just for fun!My idea is :Redis for generation of unique links with snowflake IDs and TTL to reduce bloat and guessable IDs.Kafka for event streaming and eventual consistency among replicas (in different AZs/regions)I am thinking of simulating this by having a primary db and a few read only replicas around the world from AWS. I'm also thinking of adding a load balancer just to learn that too.Is this viable in the slightest to learn these technologies? While I understand the theory behind them, distributed systems is not something I'm learning or will learn at my job and it's something I found super super interesting.If this is possible, are there ways for me to simulate many users or requests without breaking the bank in something like AWS?My apologies if I sound ignorant about these concepts, I just don't talk to many senior folk, and the ones I know don't have distributed systems experience.Lastly, I know that Kafka is a little bit of an overkill for a toy project but I kinda wanna simulate this for learning purposes.Thank you for any input you may have and I hope you started the year great!",5,0.73,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q99oo3/personal_projects_to_learn_distributed_systems/,2026-01-10 17:17:05,2026-01-16 01:51:52

I don't **KNOW** that there exists a solution with the constraints I've set forth but i think there probably should be. If anyone can show that there cannot exist a solution for some reason and suggest alternate constraints that most closely match what I have while having a solution that would be appreciated too.# What I’m asking for* Is this a known class of problem (or combination of problems)? I've looked at a number of approaches but none of them seem to fully encapsulate the problem.* Are there standard algorithmic approaches or heuristics for problems like this?* Is this usually approached with backtracking, graph search, maze-routing ideas, constraint programming, or something else?* Are there examples of similar problems (even outside batteries) that might be good references?I’m not (necessarily) looking for a turnkey solution (though if i was provided with a simple answer I would not be upset) I’m trying to understand **how people normally reason about and structure problems like this** so I can move in a productive direction.This kind of combinatorial / routing problem is *not* what I usually work on, so I may not know the right terminology or standard methods. If you have suggestions, explanations, or even “you should look up X” pointers, I’d really appreciate it.Thanks for reading, and I’m happy to clarify details if needed.",4,0.84,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qd6me9/looking_for_algorithm_ideas_to_solve_engineering/,2026-01-15 01:59:49,2026-01-16 01:51:52

It turns out my instincts were right, I mostly got lucky. I didn’t really earn this.I was hired into a branch that I have no experience in (embedded software) after assuring the hiring manager / senior developer that I would work hard to catch up with the expectations. I genuinely meant that. However, it has been much harder than I anticipated.Yesterday, I had a call with my team lead and another developer, the one who hired me and is essentially involved in everything (his cracked). They told me that my performance has been slow, especially during the last sprint, and that I’m very close to getting fired. They’re not the ones who make that decision, but they were passing the message along.The cracked one basically told me (unofficially): If I want to keep my job, I need to work on my free-time. According to him, there’s no way to both catch up and deliver expected work within the official eight-hour workday. I don’t think he’s being unreasonable or malicious, he is just a developer after all, he just wants to protect me. I’m willing to put in extra time, but the problem is that I’m also a university student. Realistically, I can only manage an extra two to three hours a day.This sprint fucked me up. It’s Saturday today, and I have homework due next week that I won’t be able to complete properly because I’m spending the weekend trying to avoid getting fired.I feel like I was hired at the worst possible time. The team was already behind schedule, management is panicking, and I’m expected to deliver at an unrealistically fast pace.

1qattkj,Do you ever feel like recruiters are the reason you are not able to get your dream job?,CommandGrand1484,cscareerquestions,"The number of jobs in the past few years has definitely gone down and it is far more difficult to get an interview call today.But on the other hand, I have been rejected without an interview call from jobs that I would be a perfect fit. I have exactly the skills they want. And at times, it feels like it's these recruiters who are making the decisions on who is a good fit for the job or not. They call you, discuss with you and write some notes for the hiring manager. And the hiring manager sometimes blindly trusts the notes that the recruiter is giving them.For example: 1. I told a recruiter I have 6 years of experience in Java. Then her immediate question was ""How many years of experience do you have in ExpressJS"". I said I am not that experienced in Javascript/typescript. To which she responded with ""But you said you have 6 years of experience in Java"". This was one of those job postings that are really vague and don't specify which programming language experience they want. ""Need to have at least 5 years of experience in a modern programming language like Java, Golang, Rust or Javascript/Python"". I applied for the job and had the first screening call with the recruiter.2. Another time I had a call with a recruiter who asked me what I was doing. I told them that I am working in ARM there is an open source library called DPDK, people use it to be networking stacks in userspace. I am working on bench-marking some of the functionality of that library on ARM processors. We are trying to change some of the functionality of that library to use Arm Neon SIMD instructions.She let me blabber on for like 15 mins and then she said ""Alright I need you to repeat everything you told me so far. I need to write notes for the hiring manager"". I sighed and then started repeating everything. And then the second time around she is like ""What is a library?"". ""What is ARM?"". ""Does ARM make processors?"". ""What does it mean that you are optimizing code in a library? Are you a Frontend engineer or a backend engineer?"".At that point, I was like let me write those notes for you. And she was like I need to write these notes myself. And then out of politeness I said ""Look I am not a native English speaker. Let me type out some text for you. You can copy that into your notes. I am not that good at verbal communication."" This was around the point in the call where she asked me to explain to her what SIMD instructions are. She declined that offer.And after the call, I got rejected. This was specifically for a job that required people with experience in ARM Neon.Sometimes I wish I could directly talk to the hiring manager or a software engineer in the team. Sometimes it really feels like these recruiters don't understand what the hell I am working on. And they are the people who are rejecting me :|",198,0.79,146,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qattkj/do_you_ever_feel_like_recruiters_are_the_reason/,2026-01-12 12:39:41,2026-01-16 01:51:53

The ceo even undercut that criticism by saying i certaintly could do my job better and look even if it was perfect I dont think it would effect this decision. Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back. he said he thought the world of me and said i should know hes not the type to mince words but he said he would give a recommendation to whoever.

So its January and I just got off a call with my company where I was told they like me in this role and are giving me the title and a pay raise to go with it. However, the pay raise was only 7k a year, my total pay is now 85k a year for a technical lead position. I have people below me in this position that make more than I do. Not only is the pay way less than I expected, but my company had a job posting for a Technical Lead where the listed salary was 120k, which is still low but 35k more than I was offered. I feel incredibly insulted by the offer they gave me.I have a few thoughts on what I should do:1. I am thinking about messaging them back and asking for either 130k a year or my old role back. The extra work from the role is worth way more than 7k extra a year, so if I can't get more pay I would rather just be in an individual contributor role and not leadership.2. Or take the offer and try and job hop as soon as I can. While the pay sucks the title is good and could help me land a new role somewhere ill actually get paid well.With that said I am not really in a position to lose this job unless I have something else lined up and while I have been looking for a new role already, I haven't had much luck at all with the market being so bad. I would hope the new title would help, but I am unsure with that. So what do you think I should do? Any advice is appreciated.EDIT: I forgot to add that I never really wanted this role either, the only reason I accepted it to begin with is because I thought it would have nice pay and my family and I could purchase a home. Now it just feels like a role I don't like and the pay sucks, this is why I might ask for my old role back.EDIT 2: I have 6 YOE as a developer almost half of which is with this company. My title before this promotion was junior developer so the jump is pretty significant and why I was expecting my pay to have a significant jump as well.EDIT 3: This is my final update, I spoke with my company and got an extra 10k added to my salary. Its still not where I would like to be but it is better at least. I will probably stick it out another year to have a full year with the title then I will bounce to somewhere that will pay me more.

I've been sending out around 50 apps per week and so far it is utterly soul crushing to see constant rejection letters. I've basically been throwing my resume to anything that even has the word tech in it at this point because I dont see any entry level positions open anywhere. Hell I've even applied to internships for 0$ of pay and I cant even get that. The fuck am I supposed to do in this job market? How am i supposed to gain on the job experience without experience.

1qaq157,Laid off. 8 months of Final rounds but no offer and dwindling savings. Any advice?,tobythestrangler,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, looking for some advice / sanity check.I've got ~3 YOE as a Data Analyst and ~1 year as a SWE. B.S. in CS (full-stack focus) and an M.S. in CS (ML + Statistics). Based in NYC. I've been interviewing for junior and mid-level Data Analyst, Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer, and Backend SWE roles. I pretty much gave up on landing a DS role for now but I have been pretty open to any data adjacent role. Most of my interviews have been for analyst and analytics engineer roles though.Lately, interviews themselves haven't been the issue. I'm consistently making it to final rounds, and the feedback has actually been positive. Stuff like great culture fit, strong skillset, asks the right questions, etc. No glaring red flags. But… I keep getting rejected at the very end. Usually it's the classic: ""The other candidate had more experience with X tool"" or ""We went with someone with a PhD."" Sometimes, it'll be ""The role was closed due to budget."" I'm honestly getting a bit jaded. I don't think I've ever had this hard of a time and it feels like there are way more interview rounds now than when I first started my career.What's stressing me out more is my personal situation. My girlfriend and I live together, and she's worried we might have to move out of our apartment because retail income just isn't covering the bills. Been stretching my savings from my last job and now the pressure is starting to hit hard.I'm not really sure what else to do to finally get an offer. Do I just keep grinding and hope timing lines up?

1q7xn8k,I can't do small talk and I feel like I'm falling behind building professional relationships.,ijustneedanametouse,cscareerquestions,"My current team is very close. They banter and make references with each other. Even with the managers they all rib on each other. To some people being able to banter with your boss is great, to me it just feels like unclear boundaries of what is acceptable to talk about, and so I don't feel comfortable saying anything personal. I feel like an outsider to group of friends. Every time I do pitch in it always feels like the conversation just dies. So I always end up being the quietest one in the group, because I have nothing to say. And so people rarely speak to me or know me. I can tell because people usually talk very straight and professional to me, and then very casually to everyone else. Now this wouldn't be a problem, except that the people who are more talkative have better rapport with higher ups, or get recommended more, and so I feel like I get passed over for projects. But I really struggle with casual talk in a professional environment. A lot of stuff in my team is based on ""tribal knowledge"". There are several people who were hired around the same time as me and I feel like they're already ahead of me, they seem to know the managers better, they seem to be more involved in what's going on in the company. Maybe I unintentionally come off as mean or cold. Definitely robotic. But I'm just nervous and never know what to say. If it has nothing to do with the exact specific task at hand my mind just completely blanks. I wouldn't be able to remember what my favorite movie was if asked. I just don't know what to do because this is always a problem for me. I've tried to learn how to ""small talk"" and it just feels really hallow.

I had amazing people in my team my seniors have taught me stuff about architecture, decisions, patterns, technologies, every day I was asking less questions and everyone said I was doing fucking amazing and rocking everything, they even let me be on business meetings to discuss business logical decisions and they let me run the project alone for a week. They’re extremely happy with me.Then after one year I started to introspect and look into the present and future and came to some conclusions…My job is fucking easy. I get figma designs, use storybook to pop components and use props to build UIs, then organize stores, hooks, forms, validations, tealium for analytics, A11Y, simple state management and maybe a few edge cases… but it’s a traditional bank not rocket science, SPAs are as simple as they get.

I've been working as a full stack engineer uninterrupted since early 2019. I started at a major US bank, went to a streaming service and now I'm working in ecommerce for a mid-major regional retailer; I don't think I'm anywhere near being a 10X whiz kid dev but I've never had anything less than Above Average ratings on performance reviews and I would say I'm generally perceived as competent at the least. My problem comes in that none of these jobs, tasks or projects have given me anything close to resembling satisfaction. I think I've come to realize that while I like solving problems, building tools for people to use and seeing all the cool things we can do, I don't like basically everything else that makes up our jobs as engineers. I don't find joy in upgrading Node versions or repositioning a button to increase customer retention; optimizing our add to cart functions feels like a waste of time to me when it already works and we see no impact on metrics in the slightest. I have trouble bringing myself to care about code coverage in tests for features that no one actually wants and likely only a handful of folks will ever use. I exercise, I eat enough, I drink water and pay my bills on time but I can't imagine myself doing this for the next thirty years of my life. So what's the ""escape plan""? I've considered going back to school for an MBA but having spoken to many consultants who have taken that path I don't think it's for me. For a while I also looked at going back for a Masters in CS but that felt like a great way to further pigeon hole myself into only being seen as Guy Who Codes. It also seems silly to just move laterally and become a pure 'product/manager' person who comes up with or supervises the new features that bum me out so much to build. Speaking to folks older than me, the common advice is go speak with a career counselor but the two experiences I've had with them reminded me far too much of those quizzes you had to take in middle school that suggested career paths. This forum has helped me out a lot in the past by giving good feedback, tough love, and even just hearing that others are in the same boat so I come to y'all hat in hand wondering - am I crazy for feeling like this?

1qbb5z0,Some Tips For New Grads and Job Search in General,AccomplishedSea8675,cscareerquestions,"Strategy for Applying and How to get More Responses:* Do apply to any and all big companies. This includes Big Tech (tech companies such as Google, Datadog, OpenAI, FAANG etc.) but also includes big non-tech companies (think Walmart, Target, Ford, Epic to a certain extent). However, be prepared to never get responses from these. The conversion rate of responses from these is a lot lower than other companies. This is due to both the amount of people applying, you applying later than other people (they may just only look at the first X number of applications), but also the amount of company leadership, direction, and planning changes that are typical with these big companies (these are expected). You may not get a response and that may mean nothing with your resume or applications. Which leads us to...* Apply to startups and / or small businesses. There are a lot of startups out there that may benefit from your specific experience or skills. Where do you find these though? ycombinator, workatastartup, builtinnyc, wellfound are good places to start. More than applying, here is where you might need to ""network"". Look at the founders, look at the people working there. Referrals here are a lot more helpful than in Big Tech companies, because things at smaller companies are a lot more personal and less automated. This is how I found my early-stage startup job. So you might want to look at founders / early employees; see if you have any connections on LinkedIn or went to the same school. See if you have any secondary connections. Reach out to people. Even if not, you can cold message on LinkedIn. You may not get a lot of responses. That's ok / expected. * Startups are less cyclical in their hiring, meaning they may hire at random times / year round / for the right person / after fundraises. My experiences:* Have gone through extensive job searches 3X. This helped a ton. Each cycle required 300-700 apps each. Got a random job in 1, an early stage startup the 2nd time, Big Tech the 3rd time.* Anecdotal evidence: Applying with or without a cover letter does not seem to matter in my case, at least it didn't in my experience. The places I got interviews I didn't use a cover letter.* For startups, things are a lot more informal... even cold reached out to someone on LinkedIn (alum from my school) once to ask about their experience at their startup, and it turned into an interview lol (for which I got to the final round). They didn't even have a position open, but were willing to hire for the right engineer.* Have gotten Amazon, Datadog offers (and currently work at Datadog)",15,0.81,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qbb5z0/some_tips_for_new_grads_and_job_search_in_general/,2026-01-12 23:36:16,2026-01-16 01:51:53

But after speaking with the hiring manager, he asked me if I was comfortable with learning SmallTalk as 99% of the time will be spent on it.The company is really interesting though, as well as its location.I am absolutely not familiar with this language. Does anybody have any info?

1qafxa7,"Do Agents Turn us into ""Tactical Tornadoes?""",ewheck,cscareerquestions,"I'm reading John Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design* and Chapter 3's discussion of the ""tactical tornado"" led me to think about how we use LLMs and agents in our profession. The relevant section of the book goes as follows:>Most programmers approach software development with a mindset I call tactical programming. In the tactical approach, your main focus is to get something working, such as a new feature or a bug fix. At first glance this seems totally reasonable: what could be more important than writing code that works? However, tactical programming makes it nearly impossible to produce a good system design.>The problem with tactical programming is that it is short-sighted. If you’re programming tactically, you’re trying to finish a task as quickly as possible. \[...\]>Almost every software development organization has at least one developer who takes tactical programming to the extreme: a *tactical tornado*. The tactical tornado is a prolific programmer who pumps out code far faster than others but works in a totally tactical fashion. When it comes to implementing a quick feature, nobody gets it done faster than the tactical tornado. In some organizations, management treats tactical tornadoes as heroes. However, tactical tornadoes leave behind a wake of destruction. They are rarely considered heroes by the engineers who must work with their code in the future. Typically, other engineers must clean up the messes left behind by the tactical tornado, which makes it appear that those engineers (who are the real heroes) are making slower progress than the tactical tornado.I do not work at a company that has widely adopted the usage of agents (a handful of people in my department have access to Devin), but I have noticed most pro-agent discourse revolves around how you can improve the speed of development and ship faster. From the passage I quoted, it seems like speed of development is not considered a universal good by all and focusing on it can have drawbacks.Since I do not have the experience to comment on this, my question for those who have heavily adopted the usage of agents themselves (or work on teams where many others have) is have you seen any of these negative outcomes whatsoever? Have you experienced any increase in system complexity that may have been easier to avoid had you iterated more slowly?Ousterhout's alternative to tactical programming is strategic programming:>The first step towards becoming a good software designer is to realize that **working code isn’t enough**. It’s not acceptable to introduce unnecessary complexities in order to finish your current task faster. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system. Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a developer is to facilitate those future extensions. Thus, you should not think of “working code” as your primary goal, though of course your code must work. Your primary goal must be to produce a great design, which also happens to work. This is *strategic programming*.When I see the power users discuss how they operate with several different instances of Claude working concurrently, I can't help but think that it would be nearly impossible to work with a ""strategic"" mindset at that level. So again, a question for those who have adopted this practice, do you attempt to stay strategic when basically automating the code-writing? As an example of what I'm asking, if you feed an agent a user story to implement, do you also try to ensure the generated code will easily facilitate future extensions to what you are working on apart from the user story itself? If so, what does that process look like for you?",6,0.65,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qafxa7/do_agents_turn_us_into_tactical_tornadoes/,2026-01-12 00:22:42,2026-01-16 01:51:53
1q91kus,Am I cooked? Seeking advice,Disastrous-Injury584,cscareerquestions,"So in this past December i’ve completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from a T20 (I think) with a 3.0 GPA (not on my resume)I didn’t have any Swe internships. All I have is around 2 years of IT experience (service desk at school) and some web development experience I got from developing for a friends business. (Which I have included on my resume as work experience) I have some projects, but obviously am working on building better ones that align with jobs I apply for. I will have acquired Sec+ by the end of this month. (Will explain why I’m getting this cert) So I’m just wondering if I am too cooked for this field and should pivot to IT, or keep trying?My current fallback hopes are that with my 2 years of entry IT experience and Sec+ that I can at least land some sort of IT role and pivot to something better after that if I can find something that can sponsor me for a clearance. I want to know if it is a realistic goal for me to land something in software in the defense industry because I live in the DC area and I assume that these jobs will have a lower barrier to entry. With Sec+ and my experience, is this still an attainable goal? Or is the industry just too cooked for hoping that this is even an option anymore?I’ve also started studying for Aws certified cloud practitioner as recommended by my employed friends. Is this worth my time? It does seem like a very easy cert. I do have a decent network (many friends, mutuals and relatives in tech in my area), really thankful for that. I hope to utilize it as much as possible for referrals. I have done tons of resume review and I believe my resume is solid. I am also interested in getting into Tech consulting as that is a big field in this area. Can anyone give me tips for that? Side note - I am a US citizen, born and raised, and should have no problems with getting a security clearance. My questions: Are my goals still realistic?Should I change anything?Am I cooked?Anything else I should know? My plan now is to: 1. Apply aggressively for any entry level IT positions to secure some type of a fallback by June-ish and hopefully have some way of getting sponsored for a security clearance. 2. Also apply to defense software roles for the chance to go straight into my dream field. 3. Keep my skills sharp with Leetcode and projects TLDR: Am I cooked for software jobs? New grad. No internships in swe, 2 years entry level IT experience, Sec+",5,0.7,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q91kus/am_i_cooked_seeking_advice/,2026-01-10 11:14:39,2026-01-16 01:51:53
1q90qcc,"A vacancy for my dream job just opened up. But now I realize I still lack C++/embedded experience, and I'm also a bit sick of startups... my thoughts are going in circles. What would you do?",QuantumQuack0,cscareerquestions,"So, finally the vacancy I thought I had been waiting years for, has appeared. It's in a certain deep-tech field, on the crossroads of physics, embedded, and networks engineering. The vacancy itself is for embedded software.Problem is... while I have actual experience with the physics (down to the literal same kind of physical system), I _want_ to work on the control/embedded side of things. But I have no C++ experience, and they explicitly ask for that.Professionally, I've only worked in python. I've dabbled a bit in Rust, a tiny bit in C++, and embedded C. I've played around with microcontrollers for a bit, but there aren't really any projects I'd like to do here at home so I didn't stick with it. I'm just afraid that, if they somehow pick me, I will make critical mistakes very early on in the product development (as the <10th employee).The other thing is that, for me, it's _yet another_ startup in this field. I've worked at two similar startups now, where I've started bright-eyed and bushy-tailed only to absolutely f%%%ing hate it after 2-3 years. My first job was a very similar, very young startup, where I worked more on the physics-side of things. Given that it was a young startup and I was full of ideas, I worked myself to death. And in the 3rd year, due to that and the fact that I started disagreeing with the direction, I quit.My current job is at a more mature startup, on paper not a startup anymore now. Much better WLB, but the startup-like shenanigans are also getting to me here. Tons of technical debt, move-fast-and-break-things, poor communication because we've grown fast but not matured... everything is a mess and it's killing me.I don't know if I should apply. I actually know the founders/current employees (not super-close but I was a MSc student under one of them, and worked with 2 others during that time) and I'm honestly pretty good at interviewing, so I think I actually have a chance. But part of me just wants to get out of this startup life and the hype around this field. I feel like work has occupied my life far too much ever since my graduation.I just want to chat with you guys and ask, what would you do? What advice do you have?Edit: I realize the reason for this post may be a bit unclear. For context, I've actually really come to hate my current job and want to leave asap, but don't want to jump from the frying pan into the fire.",8,0.76,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q90qcc/a_vacancy_for_my_dream_job_just_opened_up_but_now/,2026-01-10 10:23:28,2026-01-16 01:51:53

1q8k9zy,Is it a bad move to take a role that involves salesforce integrations?,Chezzymann,cscareerquestions,"Basically, I might be starting a new role shortly with a tech stack of Node.js, React, SQL, and AWS, but apparently there is a significant aspect of it that involves salesforce integrations with the jsforce SDK. Essentially, we would be creating services / integration layers in Node that are responsible for syncing Salesforce related onboarding data with the core services. And some front end work in React to manage that part.From what I heard in the interviews, I wouldn't be touching any proprietary salesforce stuff, as there is a separate salesforce team that handles that. There would be collaboration though if there are potential issues in the salesforce side, so I might have to occasionally look at some apex code when talking with the salesforce devs. I'm not too worried as long as I stay a software engineer and dont get roped into salesforce land, but in terms of future job searches I'm a bit concerned that if they hear 'salesforce integration' in the interview when describing a recent project they'll run for the hills.
