1qy6ca4,AI engineering is data engineering and it's easier than you may think,ivanovyordan,dataengineering,"Hi all,I wasn't planning to share my article here. But Only this week, I had 3 conversations this week wit fairly senior data engineers who see AI as a thread. Here's what I usually see:* Annoyed because they have to support AI enigneers (yet feel unseen)* Affraid because don't know if they may lose their job in a restructure* Want to navigate in ""the new world"" and have no idea where to startHere's the essence, so you don't need to read the whole thingAI engineering is largely data engineering with new buzzwords and probabalistic transformations. Here's a quick map:* **LLM = The Logic Engine.** This is the component that processes the data.* **Prompt = The Input.** This is literally the query or the parameter you are feeding into the engine.* **Embeddings = The Feature.** This is classic feature engineering. You are taking unstructured text and turning it into a vector (a list of numbers) so the system can perform math on it.* **Vector Database = The Storage.** That's the indexing and storage layer for those feature vectors.* **RAG = The Context.** Retrieval step. You’re pulling relevant data to give the logic engine the context it needs to answer correctly.* **Agent = The System.** This is the orchestration layer. It’s what wraps the engine, the storage, and the inputs into a functional workflow.2Don't let the ""AI"" label intimidate you. The infrastructure challenges, are the same ones we’ve been dealing with for years. The names have just changed to make it sound more revolutionary than it actually is.I hope this will help so of you.",193,0.86,33,https://www.datagibberish.com/p/ai-powered-apps-dictionary-for-data-engineers,2026-02-07 06:20:37,2026-02-14 02:07:59

Spent roughly 5 years at my current job, all with excellent reviews each year, survived the last round of layoffs, had my performance review which basically said don't make any thing and start putting process in place while the ceo just looked at me in disgust.

I've been applying to jobs, but I usually get stopped where they are looking for cloud experience. I've been working with data for almost 20 years now, so I'm hoping my experience can help in terms of getting a job.

1r2nrv3,Am I cooked?,Slik350,dataengineering,"Will keep this as short and sweet as possible.Joined current company as an intern gave it 1000% got offered full time under the title of:Junior Data Engineer.Despite this being my title the nature of the company allowed me work with basic ETL, dash boarding, SQL and Python. I also developed some internal streamit applications for teams to input information directly into the database using a user friendly UI.Why am I potentially cooked?Data stack consists of Snowflake, Tableau and and Snaplogic (a low code drag and drop etl tool). I realised early that this low code tool would hinder me in the future so I worked on using it as a place to experiment with metadata based ingestion and create fast solutions. Now that I’ve been placed on work for a year that is 80% non DE related aka SQL copying/report bug fixing Whilst initially I’d go above and beyond to build additional pipelines and solutions I feel as though I’ve burnt out.I asked to alter this work flow to something more aligned with my role this time last year. I was told I’d finally be moving onto data product development this year April (in effect I’ve been begging to just do what I should have been doing) and I’ve realised even if I begin this work in April I’m still at almost three years experience with the same salary I was offered when I went full time and no mention or promise of an increase.I know the smart answer is to keep collecting the pay check until I can land something else but all motivation is gone. The work they have me doing is relatively easy it just doesn’t interest me whatsoever. At this rate my performance will continue to drop for lack of any incentive to continue besides collecting this current pay check.I’ve had some interviews which are offering 20-25% more than my current role, interpersonally I succeed and am able to progress but in the technical sections I struggle without resources. I’d say I’m a good problem solver but poor at syntax memorisation and coding from scratch. I tend to use examples from online along with documentation to create my solutions but a lot of interviews want off the dome anwers…Has anyone been in a similar position and what did you do to move on from it?Tldr:Almost at 3 years experience, level of experience technically lagging behind timeframe due to exposure at work being limited and lack of personal growth.

1r383ef,Is Microsoft OneLake the new lock-in?,AwayCommercial4639,dataengineering,"I was running some tests on OneLake the other day and I noticed that its performance is 20-30% worse than ADLS. They have these 2 weird APIs under the hood: Redirect and Proxy. Redirect is only available to Fabric engines and likely is some internal library for translating OneLake paths to ADLS paths. Proxy is for everything else (including 3rd party engines) and is probably just as it sounds some additional compute layer to hide direct access to ADLS.I also think that there may be some caching on Fabric side which is only working for Fabric engines...My scenario - run a query from Snowflake or Spark k8s against an Iceberg table on ADLS and on OneLake. The performance is not the same! OneLake is always worse especially for tables with lots of files...So here is my fear - OneLake is not ADLS. It is NOT operating as open storage. It is operating as a premium storage for Fabric and a sub optimal storage for everything else...Just use ADLS then.. Yes, we do. But every time I chat with our Microsoft reps they are pushing and pushing me to use OneLake. I am concerned that one day they will just deprecate ADLS in favour of OneLake.Look Fabric might be decent if you love Power BI, but our business runs on 2 clouds. We have transactional workloads on both, and no way are we going to egress all that data to one cloud or another for analytics.

1r3jdmc,I'm not entirely sure how to incorporate AI in my workflow better,thro0away12,dataengineering,"Hi all,I am seeing A LOT of discussion on AI and I feel nervous b/c I haven't quite integrated AI too much in my workflow yet. To be quite frank, I don't know how just yet - I am supposed to be wrapping up a task and moving onto a brand new project. My current task that I've worked on for some time now has been really all over the place - basically, I'm an analytics engineer and I create the datasets that go into dashboards for stakeholders. I work in a slightly niche scientific domain where the parameters of what I need weren't well described and the only way I know I'm looking at the right thing is eyeballing and seeing which parameter is the one that makes the most sense per the stakeholders ask. The issue I am currently dealing with is our data warehouse went through an upgrade and not all the data I need is there - so I have to sometimes use data from the raw data files. And in those files, I have to go through 2 or 3 and find the parameter by eyeballing b/c I don't know the exact name of the field, but can tell what is the right one by looking at it. Also, how we actually want to use and transform those parameters is constantly changing per stakeholders request. There's just a lot of vagueness in this process that is difficult to be clear with a prompt. Writing code isn't really the hard part for me (with this work in particular) and so far, I use genAI (my work gives access to GPT-5) to help me debug if something is wrong or give me a better solution to what I'm doing, which it gives me a good answer I'd say 6/10 times. I'm seeing people discuss Claude to an extent they are no longer doing anything technical at all really, just prompting. Is this really is for people's work these days? I feel behind because I use AI very sparingly and haven't touched Claude yet. I'm planning to try it out but idk what is hype or real anymore, on LinkedIn people are teaching vibe coding courses and it's like being made to feel anybody can be an engineer now, no technical skills needed. Or the narrative if you're not using AI, you are going to become irrelevant. It's honestly making me nervous about how to move forward in my career or what to do anymore really.",10,0.81,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r3jdmc/im_not_entirely_sure_how_to_incorporate_ai_in_my/,2026-02-13 07:59:09,2026-02-14 02:07:59

Majority of the services of Fabric are still not in GCC, so commercial was the choice of poc for us. But the transition of couple of lakehouses from Synapse to the Fabric was really painful. Also, the pricing model is very ambiguous. For example, if we need powerbi premium licenses, how Fabric handles that? \- Lakehouse Explorer does not supportfor OneLake security RW permissions.

For our own SQL engine (Floe), we needed stable, reusable statistics and relational metadata to support predictable planning over Iceberg and Delta.

1r06p4k,Easily work with Lance datasets using LanceDB on Hugging Face Hub,laminarflow027,dataengineering,"> Disclaimer: I currently work at LanceDB and have been a member of Lance's and Hugging Face's open source communities for several years.Recently, Lance became an [officially supported format](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-x-huggingface-a-new-era-of-sharing-multimodal-data/) on the Hugging Face Hub. Lance is an open source, modern, columnar lakehouse format for AI/ML datasets that include multimodal data, embeddings, nested fields, and more. LanceDB is an open source, embedded library that exposes convenient APIs on top of the Lance format to manage embeddings and indices.Check out the latest Lance datasets uploaded by the awesome OSS community here:https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3AlanceWhat the Hugging Face integration means in practice for Lance format and LanceDB users on the Hub:- Binary assets (images, audio, videos) stored inline as blobs: No external files and pointers to manage- Efficient columnar access: Directly stream metadata from the Hub without touching heavier data (like videos) for fast exploration- Prebuilt indices can be shared alongside the data: Vector/FTS/scalar indices are packaged with the dataset, so no need to redo the work already done by others- Fast random access and scans: Lance format specializes in blazing fast random access (helps with vector search and data shuffles for training). It does so without compromising scan performance, so your large analytical queries can be run on traditional tabular data using engines like DuckDB, Spark, Ray, Trino, etc.Earlier, to share large multimodal datasets, you had to store multiple directories with binary assets + pointer URLs to the large blobs in your Parquet tables on the Hub. Once downloaded, as a user, you'd have had to recreate any vector/FTS indices on your local machine, which can be an expensive process.Now, with Lance officially supported as a format on the Hub, you can package all your datasets along with their indices as a single, shareable artifact, with familiar table semantics that work with your favourite query engine. Reuse others' work, and prepare your models for training, search and analytics/RAG with ease!It's very exciting to see the variety of Lance datasets that people [have uploaded](https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance) already on the HF Hub, feel free to share your own, and spread the word!",5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r06p4k/easily_work_with_lance_datasets_using_lancedb_on/,2026-02-09 15:10:52,2026-02-14 02:07:59

I am a recent computer science graduate who started working for a large non-profit organization which is reliant upon an old, very complex, ERP system (say... a few hundred tables, hundreds of millions of records). They don't provide an API, integrations are done by directly touching the database. Each one was developed ad-hoc, as the need arose over the last 2 decades. There is some code sharing but not always. 2 integrations which ostensibly provide the same information may have small divergences in exactly how they touch the database. They are written in a mix of C# and SQL stored procedures/functions. Many of these are very complex. Stored procedures call stored procedures and inserting an entity may wind up touching 30+ tables. A lot of the time, it's required. The ERP manages finances, staff, business operations; there is a lot of conditional logic to determine what to insert, update, delete, etc.. Are there any tools or techniques that could be useful here?

Each node is shipped as a binary and should be installable on new servers with minimal config. Nodes need shared state like sessions, user creds, quotas, and proxy pool data.a. My current proposal is: each node talks only to a central internal API using a node key. That API handles all reads/writes to Redis/DB. This gives me tighter control over node onboarding, revocation, and limits blast radius if a node is ever compromised. It also avoids putting datastore credentials on every node.b. An alternative design (suggested by an LLM during architecture exploration) is letting every node connect directly to Redis for hot-path data (sessions, quotas, counters) and use it as the shared state layer, skipping the API hop. -- i didn't like the idea too much but the LLM kept defending it every time so maybe i am missin something!?!

We encountered significant challenges with implementing efficient and versatile sample-level versioning (or caching) for these pipelines, which led us to develop and open-source [Metaxy](https://metaxy.io): the framework that solves metadata management and **sample-level versioning** for multimodal data pipelines.[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) sits in between high level orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io)) that usually operate at table level and low-level processing engines (such as [Ray](https://ray.io)), passing the exact set of samples that have to be (re) computed to the processing layer and *not a sample more*.## BackgroundWhen a traditional (tabular) data pipeline gets re-executed, it typically doesn't cost much. Multimodal pipelines are a whole different beast. They require a few orders of magnitude more compute, data movement and AI tokens spent. Accidentally re-executed your Whisper voice transcription step on the whole dataset? Congratulations: $10k just wasted!That's why with multimodal pipelines, implementing incremental approaches is a requirement rather than an option. And it turns out, it's damn complicated.## Introducing Metaxy[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) is the missing piece connecting traditional orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)) that usually operate at a high level (e.g., updating tables) with the sample-level world of multimodal pipelines.Metaxy has two features that make it unique:1. It is able to track partial data updates.2. It is agnostic to infrastructure and can be plugged into any data pipeline written in Python.Metaxy's versioning engine:- operates in batches, easily scaling to millions of rows at a time.- runs in a powerful remote database or locally with Polars or DuckDB.- is agnostic to dataframe engines or DBs.- is aware of *data fields*: Metaxy tracks a dictionary of versions for each sample.We have been dogfooding Metaxy at Anam since December 2025. We are running millions of samples through Metaxy. All the current Metaxy functionality has been built for our data pipeline and is used there.### AI DisclaimerMetaxy has been developed with the help of AI tooling (mostly Claude Code). However, it should not be considered a vibe-coded project: the core design ideas are human, AI code has been ruthlessly reviewed, we run a very comprehensive test suite with 85% coverage, all the docs have been hand-written (seriously, I hate AI docs), and /u/danielgafni has been working with multimodal pipelines for three years before making Metaxy. A great deal of effort and passion went into Metaxy, especially into user-facing parts and the docs.## More on MetaxyRead our [blog post](https://anam.ai/blog/metaxy), [Dagster + Metaxy blog post](https://dagster.io/blog/building-real-time-interactive-avatars-with-metaxy), Metaxy [docs](https://docs.metaxy.io/), and `uv pip install metaxy`!We are thrilled to help more users solve their metadata management problems with Metaxy.

1r0ljxk,Production Access,fordatechy,dataengineering,"Hi. Question about production access. Does your organization allow users/developers who are not admins or in IT access to run their pipelines in production? Meaning they developed it but maybe IT provided the platform such as Airflow, nifi, etc. To run it. If they can’t run it do they have production access but just more restricted? Like read access so that they can debug why a pipeline failed and push changes without have to ask someone to send them the logs for them to see what happened.I’m asking this since right now I’m in an org where there are a few platforms but the two biggest don’t allow anyone outside their 2-5 person teams access to it. Essentially developers are expected to build pipelines and hand them off and that’s it. No view into prod anything. The reasoning by those admins is that developers don’t need to see prod and it’s keeps their environment secure. They will monitor and notify us if something goes wrong. I think this is dumb honestly as in my opinion that if you can’t grant people production access and keep it secure at the same time your environment is not as good as you think. I also think that developers need prod access if they are an engineer. At minimum I think they should have read access so that they can easy see how their pipelines are performing and debug if needed. The environments and nifi and ssis for the record and this isn’t a post to bash them so I’m only saying that for context. I don’t care what the platform is per se but just the workflow in general.How does your organization work?

1qyg20m,How to talk about model or pipeline design mistakes without looking bad?,SoggyGrayDuck,dataengineering,"I started at a company a little over 3 years ago as a DE. I had previously had a solution/data architect position working in AWS but felt like I was ""missing"" something when it came to new pipeline design vs traditional warehousing. I wanted to build a Kimball model but my boss didn't want one. I took a step back and at the same time moved into a medium/large sized business from startup culture. I wanted to see their design and identify if/what I was misunderstanding. A consulting firm came in and started changing things, changing everything. I was not in these discussions because I was new and still learning the code base but the pipeline used to have 4 layers, data lake, star schema, reporting layer and finally a data warehouse layer (flat tables that combined multiple reporting tables to make it super easy for low skilled analysts to use). The consulting firm correctly said we should only have 3 layers but apparently didn't provide ANY direction or oversight. My boss responded by removing the star schema! well they technically removed it but simply merged the logic from two layers into one script... pushing the entire concept of data warehousing into the hands of individual engineers to keep straight. I wish I could describe it better but let's just say it takes experienced top level engineers months of hand holding to get straight. Anyway I'm sure you see the problem I'm talking about. Threw me soo far off track and I started questioning EVERYTHING I knew! lost my confidence and my recruiter picked up on it.

Sei o básico (funções, variáveis etc.), mas sinto que ainda não entendo bem os conceitos e a estratégia por trás das coisas.O que mais me confunde é que muitos cursos ensinam um fluxo tipo: pegar um CSV, salvar em algum lugar, limpar, subir de novo, carregar no Python, automatizar com o Windows Task… e, sendo bem sincera, isso parece pouco prático no dia a dia real de uma empresa.Aqui onde trabalho temos vários dashboards, alguns bem pesados para editar, que puxam direto do banco do TI. Usamos Oracle e MySQL. Aí fico pensando: o Python não poderia se conectar direto no banco e alimentar o BI? Porque, se for para pegar dados de um banco que eu nem tenho permissão de edição, jogar no Python e depois subir para outro banco ou planilha… isso realmente compensa?Também fico perdida porque vejo opiniões muito diferentes: tem gente que fala que Power BI é maravilhoso, outros dizem que o certo é fazer todos os gráficos no Python e que BI é ruim… e eu sinceramente não sei por onde começar nem no que focar para evoluir.Outro ponto: temos um banco em que o pessoal do TI cadastra nomes de empresas e outras informações de formas diferentes. A gente trata isso nos dashboards, mas sempre aparece uma nova variação e temos que corrigir tudo de novo. Se levássemos esse tratamento para Python, não seria o mesmo problema? Como garantir que os dados fiquem padronizados e corretos ao longo do tempo?E ainda surgem outras dúvidas: onde guardar os códigos? como organizar os projetos? como lidar com erros? questões de segurança?O Python é tão abrangente que acabo não sabendo em que focar primeiro.Se alguém puder compartilhar como funciona esse fluxo na prática (Python + banco + BI) e o que realmente vale a pena estudar no início, eu agradeceria muito!",0,0.3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r19lmd/power_bi_x_python/,2026-02-10 18:56:58,2026-02-14 02:07:59

The first thing I noticed is that most softwares we see are built on top of open source tools that have been made by thousands of developers world wide example: Linux, Database Management Systems, Frameworks so most devs work on business logic on top of this software.What is important for any programmer are fundamentals when you understand some commonly used fundamentals like: data types, variables, conditions statements, loops, collections, functions, data structure and OOP are enough for expressing logic. Before writing and following syntax I basically think a good programmer understands something in a very high level way instructions, also how the full flow works without touching the syntax. Then, the last part is translating high level written instructions into syntax based on a certain language.This is based on my opinion and how I have been coding also being language agonistic by ensuring that logic comes first before anything else.

1qzlroe,"Self taught programmer exhausted and lost, hoping for guidance",UsefulExplanation131,learnprogramming,"Hey, everyone. Im really hoping to get outside perspectives on some difficulties ive been experiencing while learning to program. I keep experiencing burn out and exhaustion over and over again and I can’t figure out why it keeps happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore and just can’t think clearly about my situation anymore. Here is some background: Rough timeline of my programming journey: August 2022- I begin working through TOP curriculum with the goal of seeing if i enjoy programming. I decide that i do enjoy it -> Feb 2024 - I physically and mentally burn out from my job as a delivery driver. Managing my job, programming, and therapy was too much and I quit after i got injured while working.  March 2024- after spending a year going from 45 mins of studying/week to 10 hours/week, a mental health crisis, and 1 month after quitting my job, i complete the foundations module of TOP -> Nov or Dec 2024 - I take advantage of being unemployed and living off savings to focus hard on programming. I build up to studying 25-30 hours/week consistently. I realize I don’t like front end stuff. I choose the js path on TOP, skip the “advanced html/css” and “react section,” but complete everything else up to the file uploader project of the “NodeJS” section. Around December i take a small break to focus on an art project, and that snowballed to a few months of no programming (though i think that would’ve happened regardless if i took a break or not). -> Feb 2026 - the past year and few months were a blur of trying so hard to build back the habit of programming as well as i did the first time. I spend some months completely dreading programming and unable to start and some months of still struggling, but able to at least show up mostly consistently. I follow a pattern of on for 2-3 months to off for 2-3 months. After i learn I don’t like front end stuff and realize that endlessly building endpoints was equally dreadful, i decide to focus on other backend topics and keep finding myself bouncing around. I spend a few months on [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) then burn out. I go to nand2tetris to switch things up, last a month, then burn out. I decide to learn C from “C programming: a modern approach,” to switch things up again, and actually have some fun, but things fizzle out again. Every attempt leaves me broken and exhausted. At this point, I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to restart. The feelings that kept me going during my most consistent periods of study, feeling like im improving and growing as a person and programmer, the satisfaction and euphoria of solving some problem that I genuinely believed i could not solve, just have been completely absent for so long. During all of this, ive been working hard in therapy to resolve a lot of things including social anxiety. I bring this up because i have bad social anxiety that prevents me from going to local programming meetups, participating in online programming communities, and applying for jobs. Going at this mostly alone just adds another layer of complexity to it all. Ive made a lot of progress on that front but still have a ways to go. I haven’t programmed in a couple months now and its like no amount of time away makes me dread programming any less. I feel spiritually broken. Im too close to my situation to think objectively anymore. What do y’all think i could do differently? Why does programming keep becoming this thing that i dread? Am i focusing on studying too much and not spending enough time making projects? For me, the hardest part about this whole journey (and ive realized this applies to many, maybe most, endeavors) hasn’t even been the intellectual side of things. That’s hard, sure, but by far the hardest part has been the emotional side of things. Specifically, having to find a way to program consistently over time. That’s the aspect of all of this that is the most soul crushing. It was hard to get yourself to program today, and guess what? You have to do it all over again tomorrow. And the day after. Maybe not every single day, but most weeks, most months. How do y’all not get overwhelmed with this? I think i do a decent job of focusing only on the short term but the big picture and the stakes are always on the back of my mind. I do find enjoyment in solving some programming problems, but I can’t deny that I wouldn’t be pursuing this if it wasn’t a well paying career that doesn’t require a degree. Which is the reason why i even decided to see if i enjoy programming and why i still pursue it after all this struggle. Every job ive had up to this point has been low skilled work. Server, cook, cashier, delivery driver, etc. I’m almost 25 and i want and need to get a career going. I can’t keep living the life that ive been living and programming seems to be a good enough fit. It’s intellectually challenging, doesn’t require a degree, well paying, and i find a lot of it enjoyable (even if there are a lot of things i find tedious and annoyingly boring).That being said, i do have ideas that get me excited and could be solved using code. Some of my programming project ideas include:* Something similar to GitHub but for digital artists to save snapshots of their artwork. * Data management system for iot devices. Inspiration came from thinking about how massive amounts of data from telescopes are efficiently stored and organized* A tool that takes a 3D model and allows you to see the cross section along the axial planes* A massive library of artworks that pulls artwork from the online catalogs of museums and other collection websitesI can’t help but feel like i am not ready for any of these projects and that I need to keep studying and learning before i can attempt any of them. That was part of the inspiration to learn c, to better learn how databases work by making a simple database since these are all data intensive projects. Anyway, if anyone has anything to share about what I could do better, that would be greatly appreciated.

However in JS, arrays are composite data structures which hold *heterogeneous* values and are ordered with an index. Would an array in JS be closer to a record as far as data structures go or am I putting the cart before the horse in the importance of the allowance of more than one data structure?

There is also an ""harder"" version of it where you need to print 2 pyramids. you know, the beginner level stuffs..since i dont have prior syntax knowledge i asked AI to generate me a code in order to check it, study it and understand it. and after i did it, i felt everything was clear, i knew what every line did and why. NICE RIGHT?\#\##\###\####when it came part 2 i decided to imperatively not use AI and only using my knowledge acquired from the first exercise to complete it.this time the first of the two pyramid had to be reversed, so with blank spaces before the ""#"" symbols. Like this:\#\## \###\####So how do you reverse a pyramid? by starting printing spaces instead of ashes right ? perfect. This concept was pretty obvious and clear in my mind, as it should be, but the application? impossible. I could't ""invent"" a way to do it. I just lacked the creativity, even if i had all the starting points in front of me.The formula to print the ashes was the same exact formula for basically all the other operations in the program:for (int s = 0; s < height - i; s++) { printf("" "") }the only difference here is that im subtracting the variable (i) from the (height), because as the height increases i should also decrease the number of spaces.

1r02yay,Coupling data with behaviour considered harmful,Achereto,learnprogramming,"I've seen a couple of posts by people new to programming struggling with understanding OOP and people in the responses making claims about the benefits of OOP. I want to give a bit of a different perspective on it, having written OO code for over 15 years and moving away from it over the last 2-3 years.The core idea of OO is to model things analogue to the real world. So for example a `Datetime` object would represent a specific date and time, and everything related to that (like adding a second or minute) would be implemented by the object. It would also allow you to compare dates in an expressive way. Some languages allow you to have something like `if (today < tomorrow)`, or calculate the difference using `one_day := tomorrow - today` which is neat. **This approach couples data with behaviour.** If you need to add behaviour to a class and you don't own the class, you can't just add the behaviour to the class, and if the fields of the class are private you also can't easily access them from the subclass. So you're already facing a design problem. Yes, people have thought about it and found solutions but the key is that the coupling of data and behaviour *created* the design problem that had to be solved. With structs and functions you could just write a new function and would be done. No design problem in the first place.But the problem becomes worse: With objects acting on their own behalf you lose the efficiency of [iterating over data and modifying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVbI1HIzCE). For every update on an object, you have to call a method and create significant computation overhead (and no, the compiler usually can't optimize this away).In fact, the problems created by coupling data to behaviour (like classes do) has become such a pain for developers that we started teaching ""Composition over Inheritance"". In simple terms this means that an object (containing data) shouldn't implement its own behaviour any more, but instead provide placeholders for other objects that implement specific behavior can be used by the original object, effectively decoupling data from behaviour again (undoing OO). One of the better talks explaining this principle is [Nothing is Something by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) from ~10 years ago. In her example in the second half of her talk you can see that the `House` class is stripped down to data and placeholders for behaviour, giving her the maximum flexibility for new features.To reiterate: **OOP couples data with behaviour. The design problems arising from this are best solved by decoupling data from behaviour again**If you need more convincing data, then you can look at all the [OOP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). 13 of those 22 patterns (including the most useful ones) are actually separating data from behaviour, 3 are debatable if they do (Composite, Facade, Proxy) and only 6 (Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Flyweight, Memento, Observer) aren't about separating data from behaviour.If coupling data with behaviour is the root problem for many design problems in programming and the solutions people come up with are different ways to decouple data from behaviour again, then you should clearly avoid coupling them in the first place to avoid all of these problems.So what should you learn instead of OO? I would say that Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a good start as they seems to continue emerging as a solution to most design problems. Even ""Composition over Inheritance"" is already a step towards ECS. ECS have become more popular of the last years with both Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine switching to it. There is a fantastic video about the [ECS in Hytale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglU107_DA4) as well, explaining how this makes modding extremely easy. More upcoming companies will do ECS in the next years and learning it now will put you in an advantage in the hiring processes. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. :)(ps: not sure if ""Tutorial"" is the right Flair because I don't actually show code, but it may be the best fit for explaining a concept and its downsides)",18,0.78,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r02yay/coupling_data_with_behaviour_considered_harmful/,2026-02-09 12:30:41,2026-02-14 02:08:00

It’s basically an automated form where you enter your name, the station, select a specific part from a dropdown, and add a short description of the issue (after it’s fixed) so the next shift has proper documentation and certain parts can be monitored.I work with Excel on a surface level and thought this would be something like:“Delete a few unnecessary dropdowns, add some new ones, rename a few labels — done.”Since nobody else was interested, I said I’d give it a try. I made it clear that this would be somewhat experimental on my end. My boss was totally fine with that and said I could take as much time as I need. We currently use our own list, but it’s all free text, which makes filtering difficult. For example, one station is officially called “03st02,” but colleagues enter things like “3st2” or “3-2”… you get the idea.Anyway — I received the file and the password for the VBA project.And wow. I completely underestimated it.The file basically contains a full program running in the background, constantly cross-checking every input. I can’t just remove, add, or rename anything without breaking everything else. And honestly, for our department’s needs, it feels way overengineered.

1qz1j3i,AI coding - Are we killing the golden goose ?,Ravenclaw_Guy,learnprogramming,"Before I start my rant, I want to say I use AI everyday. I use it for:1. Understanding a concept/service. Why is it designed in a particular way and verifying the sources (not all the time, only when I am skeptical of the answers).2. Understanding a piece of code from a language I am not familiar with. Asking the LLM to explain each line.3. Asking the agent to edit a specific function in an unfamiliar language to do a certain thing and asking the agent to explain line by line.4. Writing unit tests.5. Pros/Cons of a system design approach. 6. Fixing the grammatical mistakes that I make while writing something or asking it to rewrite certain sentences which are harder for audiences to grasp.The ability of an LLM to do all of the above is big win and a big productivity boost for me. I am still amazed by the capabilities of an LLM to do all the above. However, I am somewhat disappointed and puzzled by the upper management push to not write code at all and delegate the writing part to AI agents. When we wrote code line by line, it gave us the ability to understand the software that we are building in a fundamental level. The friction we had when writing code, helped us to develop critical thinking and helped develop the debugging skills (the golden egg the management got over time). If we delegate this work to AI, are we not going to lose this skill eventually ? When things go wrong, the senior management is going to ask the engineers to fix the issue not an LLM. The engineer has to have atleast some mental model of how the code works. Isn't it too late and expensive to rewrite things when a production issue happens ?Finally, how are software engineers going to create novel libraries/services if they don’t write code and understand the underlying behavior. Are we sure that the engineers can create a library like React if they have not written HTML/JS by hand in years. I want to know your thoughts and hear opposing view points. I am of the opinion that an LLM can make me 1.2x faster not 10x faster. This is a conversation I have been having internally with me and many of my colleagues (who are very smart than me) did not reciprocate the same feelings.

1r01dh1,Where should I start with learning to write code for VSTs and for music hardware?,reduke2,learnprogramming,"A bit of a niche question, but I'm hoping someone in the community could help me out with this, since I'm finding a scarce amount of resources online regarding this topic. I'm a bachelor of music student and my main focus has been in emerging music technology for a long time, but it was only recently when I took an elective course in Pure Data that my mind was opened to the possibilities of creating my own VSTs, and it wasn't until even more recently that my roommate/bandmate suggested that he use his electrical engineering course to good use and we make music hardware together. Naturally, I love this idea, and we've been conceptualising a few admittedly ambitious ideas for boutique guitar pedals, synthesizers and other music hardware that we'd love to use ourselves, but now that he's started his EE course, I'm at a position where I really do have to start locking in and learning the relevant programming. I'm aware it'll take years before we're both skilled enough to create anything close to the ideas that we have now, but I figure it's never too early to start learning now. For VSTs in particular, I know the JUCE framework for C++ is the standard, and I've found a decent amount of resources on that, so I'm not too worried about it. My bigger question regards the hardware side of things. Which microcontrollers are standard for pedals, eurorack modules, synthesizers, etc, or does it depend more on processing power and other factors i'm not yet aware of? Is C++ a good language to know or should I also think about branching out and learning other languages instead? How does one even write code for microcontrollers and make it interact with the electronic components on the PCB? Are these stupid questions? As you can tell, I am truly lost in the dark here as I haven't an ounce of programming experience (outside of pure data and briefly learning GML when I was younger) but I know I can learn it, I just desperately need to know where to start, where to find resources, who to talk to, and what I should focus on learning now.

1qz5qrj,How to create a random video player executable,Special-Afternoon-25,learnprogramming,"The situation is the following: both my parents are retired, and because they have neither hobbies nor social life, they spend most of their time at home watching the news. Due to this I noticed a deterioration lately in their mental health and mood. I thought I could download some of the series they used to watch time ago, store them in a USB and connect it to the TV so they can watch that instead of the news all the time. My parents are old and they would not know how to navigate through Netflix or other platforms, so I‘d have to do it this way.What I would like, and here is my question for you, is a file in the USB that randomly plays any video file in the USB. My parents basically use the TV as background noise so they wouldn’t care about what’s playing or follow the episodes in a given order. I want a file that they click on it and it plays whatever in the USB stick, and I need it to be random so it doesn’t always play the same episode first.

Would this tree be sorted if audioList is pre sorted especially since mutableMap preserves insertion order (*I think because it should be a linked hashmap)? Intuitively, I would think so but I am also very capable on not thinking.Later, I add each node to a map whilst also calculating the total song files under each folder. private fun computeTotal(node: FileNode, localNodeIndex: MutableMap) { if (!node.isFolder) { node.musicTotal = 1 node.durationTotal = node.song?.duration ?: 0 node.albumId = node.song?.albumId ?: 0L localNodeIndex[node.absolutePath] = node return } var count = 0 var duration = 0L var albumId: Long? = null node.children.values.forEach { child -> computeTotal(child, localNodeIndex) count += child.musicTotal duration += child.durationTotal if (albumId == null && child.albumId != 0L) albumId = child.albumId } node.musicTotal = count node.durationTotal = duration node.albumId = albumId ?: 0L localNodeIndex[node.absolutePath] = node }Would this map: localNodeIndex be sorted (by absolutePath)? Again intuitively I believe so, especially if the tree is sorted, but I am not fully certain.I also wish to get all the song file paths under a certain folder (given that folder's node) and currently I do this by using a sorted list of the paths, binary searching for the folder, using the index of the insertion point + musicTotal to sublist from the song path list (I do check if the boundary paths begin with the folder path).Binary search function fun List.findFirstIndex(curPath: String, selector: (T) -> String): Int { return binarySearch(this, 0, this.size, curPath, selector) } @Suppress(""SameParameterValue"") private inline fun binarySearch( list: List, fromIndex: Int, toIndex: Int, key: String, selector: (T) -> String ): Int { var low = fromIndex var high = toIndex - 1 while (low <= high) { val mid = (low + high) ushr 1 val midVal = list[mid] val midKey = selector(midVal) if (midKey < key) low = mid + 1 else if (midKey > key) high = mid - 1 else error(""index found for $key which should not have been found"") } return low }Would there be any methods better than doing so?

Belfort dropped out.A lot of you all here need to take some inspiration from that. Gatekeepers are annoying I know but the doom and gloom in this field has reached a point where I, as a senior engineer in this field, feel a call to gatekeep a little bit.The COVID era job market is never coming back - at least not any time soon which may as well mean never for those of you trying to break into this field with no passion. And that word is the heart of what I want to get at here; passion.Obviously there are still dentists today. Most of whom became dentists well after Belfort was a student and discouraged from his dreams. Just as there will be software engineers well into the future.But the people that became dentists despite the market drying up did so because they had a true passion for the field. It still pays well sure but there was a golden age that has now passed and this is where CS is now.This post isn't to straight up tell you to give up on a CS career.

They claim that they want in the next 6 months that some kinds of code to eventually be done entirely by agents, including the review process. They've also set a baseline that all engineers know how to use tools like Claude code in their every day work.When pressed on the issue, our CTO admitted that on average, pre things like Claude, our engineers only spent about 1 hour per day on actually writing code. The rest was spent in meetings, writing RFCs, designing, etc. To me, this says that coding was never the actual issue. So seriously, what exactly am I missing? Is there something magical that's happening right now that makes the current agents with the current context window constraints able to handle highly complex systems?Do the folks at the top really not care about the cognitive decline associated with these kinds of tools?

From the moment of waking up, until going to bed, I would stay anxious, would keep on getting teams messages from my manager and director, and would always be worried and anxious about delivering my work.Six months ago my team got internally switched and not only my tech stack changed, but also I was unable to understand anything in the new team -- how deployment worked, unit testing, which person takes care of which thing, whom to reach out when people have a disagreement on the approach you used, etc etc.In my previous team, there was a collaborative environment. The team knew there are things that I don't know, because they have never been properly communicated, so I was helped with that. There are changes in the team or deployment process? communicated. Some new framework? communicated. Some update in our best practices? communicated too.But in the new team, the approach turned out to be very much 'sink or swim'. You are told some things initially but then rest of the things, even processes, even whom to reach out and even what to do when there is a conflict with someone else, everything was left on you. Your ticket/task was handled to you and it was said to be your ownership The moment you are assigned your task, you treat it like a sword hanging near your neck and you do everything possible to deliver it on time. Something unexpected causing delays? Some other component which you rely on, not working properly? Nobody cares. You need to deliver on the deadline anyhow.I don't really like this kind of a culture, really. I loved the old, collaborative culture where it felt like we are working on a mission together with our team. Where our team is not our enemy, but they are comrades.

1qyhsyp,"Stuck in a ""Senior Loop""",ShoddyWorkmanshipTed,cscareerquestions,"I was promoted to Senior Engineer originally about 11/12 years ago. After a few years I left the company as I felt like promotion above that was impossible. I was essentially doing the work of other tech leads in the company, but there was always a vague reason promotion to get the title I was already doing wasnt coming. It was always ""next cycle"". I left and went to another company. Hired as a Senior, within about a year or two I'm basically acting tech lead again in terms of responsibilities. But again, every cycle I was told I'd be promoted in the *next* cycle and it never happened. After frustration, I left and started the cycle again at my current company. I'm now approaching my 4th anniversary and the same cycle has played out again, and I'm sensing the same excuses coming as to why no promotion will happen again this year.I'm very frustrated. I'm working at a higher level than my title suggests and have been for a long while now. No offense to the people around me but I now report up through people with much less experience.If I leave, I can't get past a screening for a ""lead"", ""staff"", ""principal"" roles because they want a few years at that title already. If I accept another Senior position, I'm basically back to ""Day 1"" and have to grind to reach the ever elusive carrot or promotion in a few years and I'm worn out of trying hard, having responsibility pushed on me, but never actually getting the reward. What do people at this level do. I'm good at my job from a technical perspective and I seem to be well trusted in terms of people skills, managing a team, but the political side of forcing promotions seems to not be something I'm good at.

I kept applying even when nothing was working, but I also made sure I had hobbies and friends outside of job hunting so rejections did not completely wreck meAt the end of the day, i think it’s just a game of luck.

1r34nff,Should outsourcing be penalized ?,Inevitable_Car6105,cscareerquestions,"I honestly think what’s happening in the job market is pretty obvious. It’s not just AI taking everyone’s jobs (maybe some of them, sure), but a lot of work is simply being outsourced to cheaper labor markets : Eastern Europe, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc.I’m pretty active on a bunch of subreddits, and the difference is obvious. You’ve got people in the US and Western Europe saying they’ve applied to 100+ jobs and can’t even land an interview. Meanwhile, people in places like India or the Philippines talk pretty casually about getting IT jobs, call center work, remote contracts and earning high income ( relative to their country’s norm) .If someone like Trump argues that protectionist policies are necessary to protect Western industries, workers and western dominance , and points to China building its economy off the back of offshored manufacturing , then why isn’t this treated the same way? Offshoring these tech jobs might not look as dramatic as factories moving overseas, but it’s shifting income, skills, and long-term capacity to other countries. It should be treated as a threat to western dominance And the bigger picture is this: when you offshore work, you’re not just saving money in the short term. You’re helping build those countries skilled workforce. Over time, those countries will develop expertise, infrastructure, and competitive companies of their own. That could eventually mean they outperform Western firms and that further weakens Western dominance in the long run.It just feels like we’re watching the same pattern repeat, only this time with tech and services instead of manufacturing. Maybe it’s a bit wild to say but I don’t think companies that offshore lots of their jobs like this should be allowed to operate in the country or at the very least they should face much higher taxation that makes offshoring unattractive",63,0.76,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r34nff/should_outsourcing_be_penalized/,2026-02-12 20:34:31,2026-02-14 02:08:01

1r0clp4,Do you actually use AI to develop code beyond it being a glorified autocomplete?,macko939,cscareerquestions,"Hi Everyone,I'm a mid level dev, I also do quite a lot of devops work. For the longest time I was quite against using AI to develop code because I wanted to enjoy the challenges, solve problems etc. I simply enjoy my job too much to want to delegate it away.And recently, I've been experimenting with some AIs (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude) because as much as I enjoy my job, I don't want to fall behind. But my real, hands on experience was that AI was only really useful as a glorified autocomplete, generating boilerplate code, and maybe stuff like terraform skeleton code. It's good for things that are not a problem at all and that I can do quite fast myself anyway, but whenever I try to use AI to solve an actual problem/something I'm stuck on/something that requires logic, it always fails miserably. Trying to talk it into actually doing the work, and even pointing out the mistakes (and entering the, 'you're right, I'll fix that!' loop for ever), it makes me feel like a Sisyphus, and it never goes anywhere. Pretty much every single time I've attempted it, I was better off writing the code myself anyway.

Or do I start looking?,dr335i,cscareerquestions,"So a year ago I started at my first development job after a career change. I consider myself BLESSED to have found a role, and such a good one to get started in. The job is way chiller than I ever could have expected. I'm fully remote, on a team of five (with some very experienced people), On Call weekend once every ten weeks or so but it's generally very uneventful. Leadership is thoughtful, people get along, WLB is amazing (working hours are working hours, 4 weeks PTO, etc). It's really a genuinely great situation. The bad is that the work isn't really challenging or interesting. We maintain probably 20-30 different legacy Java applications, frequently that just looks like small little feature or workflow changes, database work, or some kind of server script that needs to be done. We're in the process of modernizing them - but the vast majority (which truly are very simple boring CRUD workflows) are getting moved into a proprietary ""pro-code"" platform (a convuluted, absolute mess of a thing that uses java objects in a bizarre way) with the remaining 5-6 of them being rewritten as cloud native react apps. Right now, we're inbetween that. Theres a few developers that are staying pretty busy doing deep dives into a high impact java app that was originally written around 2006, but the rewrites haven't started yet and I find myself doing super low impact work and trying to ""look"" busy because theres just not much to do. For a while I was enjoying that - doing projects around the house or the yard but now I'm over that. I want to do something interesting and I have NO interest in taking part in the low code nonsense. I'm being underutilized. I also only get paid around 65k (LCOL area so whatever, but even the ""leads"" are barely pushing 100). It seems obvious to look for something else but I work with awesome people, have a ton of free time, fully remote, AND good management? I'd hate to leave and go somewhere else thats miserable. Background: 31, Career changer, went to an average state school after high school for accounting, proceeded to go work at a car dealership because I liked cars and hated taxes. Did pretty well, moved through the ranks, wanted to do something more intellectually challenging, went back to school (WGU don't flame me) to get a CS degree (honestly I was always a nerd who understood computers well and tinkered with stuff so I was more looking for the HR checkbox, I know it's not great though). Decent soft skills, better than a lot of my coworkers for sure, could probably do well at leetcode mediums if I gave it some effort, but no strong interest in relocating. Would consider myself competent and a strong employee but I'm probably never going to be the guy coding on the weekends because he just loves it that much.

1r2l969,Will machine learning end up like software engineering?,adad239_,cscareerquestions,"This is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.Software engineering used to feel like the golden path. High pay, tons of demand, solid job security. Then bootcamps blew up, CS enrollments exploded, and now it feels pretty saturated at the entry level. On top of that, AI tools are starting to automate parts of coding, which makes the future feel a bit uncertain.Now I’m wondering if machine learning is heading in the same direction.ML pays a lot of money right now. The salaries are honestly a big part of why people are drawn to it. But I’m seeing more and more people pivot into ML, more courses, more degrees, more certifications, and some universities are even starting dedicated AI degrees now. It feels like everyone wants in. People from all kinds of backgrounds are moving into ML and AI too, math majors, engineering majors, stats, physics, and even people outside traditional tech paths, similar to how CS became the default choice for so many different majors a few years ago. At the same time, tools are getting better. With foundation models and high-level frameworks, you don’t always need to build things from scratch anymore.As a counterpoint though, ML is definitely harder than traditional CS in a lot of ways. The math, the theory, reading research papers, running experiments. The learning curve feels steeper. It’s not something you can just pick up in a few months and be truly good at. So maybe that barrier keeps it from becoming as saturated as general software engineering?I’m personally interested in going into AI and robotics, specifically machine learning or computer vision at robotics companies. That’s the long term goal. I just don’t know if this is still a smart path or if it’s going to become overcrowded and unstable in the next 5 to 10 years.Would love to hear from people already in ML or robotics.

I've never gotten a formal onboarding into my SWE role and it's been rough trying to understand the codebase (product is older than me). I have been exploring an out (low pay here so I want to leave), but my resume is not getting hits and I am assuming it's because my bullet points aren't exactly ""wow, we should hire this guy,"" due to the nature of my career development here. I've changed the title of the first job to SDET instead of QA since that was the nature of my job.The tech stack is pure Java (no Spring or anything), but it's rare to even have tasks where I'm actively implementing Java code; due to my nature of swapping from QA to SWE, I end up doing things like working on Jenkins stuff or writing Python to improve pipelines/QA tasks, etc.I've tried reaching out for more development-related tasks but it doesn't result in any learning opportunities (""it'd be better to assign this to (other SWEs on team) and it'll be done faster"" or I'll genuinely have no idea how to even approach a task) and I'm usually shuffled off to do more automation/non-development work. On the offchance I do get a development related task and I have questions, I try to ask to further grow my understanding but what usually ends up happening is that they just end up implementing it for me, or the task gets broken apart and suddenly it's a 3 line PR from me, while the actual higher complexities of the original task is assigned elsewhere.I am working on the leetcode grind, I tend to solve most easies and can handle mediums generally (just rusty with some DSA). I do have a CS degree from a mid tier UC. I am just wondering if my career is fucked (I am <30 lol so this is probably an overexaggeration but with the current state of hiring I feel like I'm falling behind hard) or it's a skill issue by me (imposter syndrome? not smart enough to learn the codebase? others formally hired as SWE with similar YOE seem to be doing amazing) or any words of advice. It really feels like I should've left a couple of years ago, since now I feel stuck in a way where I just have multiple chunks of entry-level SWE experience, and I'm not sure how to proceed.",33,0.98,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r36l1e/escaping_the_multiple_1_yoe_trap/,2026-02-12 21:49:26,2026-02-14 02:08:01

1r3hjll,Is 20% equity reasonable compensation for sole dev at idea-stage startup?,Sad-Consequence-uwu,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, looking for a reality check.I recently joined an early-stage startup (idea/MVP level) as the sole technical person. The existing team has 3 more people...all non-tech. I was initially going to only work on the AI parts but that soon turned to handling all of BE. The product would be a web-app; there will be an AI agent and quite a few dynamic dashboards with user data. The AI Agent will provide insights and suggestions from the data among other things.The issue is, they just revealed their plan for the frontend: WordPress + Elementor. They think because they are building the ""site"" in WordPress, they are handling the frontend.The product requires:* Complex Data Ingestion: Parsing fragile PDFs and CSVs from automated emails* OAuth Integration: Securely connecting to Gmail/Outlook APIs.* AI EngineWordPress can't handle a dynamic SaaS dashboard. I’m effectively having to build a ""Custom Backend"" that does 95% of the heavy lifting, including the API bridges to make their WordPress site even function.**Their proposed workload for me is insane... I am the Backend Dev, Data Engineer, and AI Engineer. Their ""contribution"" is marketing and a drag-and-drop website.**I’m getting 20% equity to build 100% of the intellectual property...equity is the only form of payment.I have talked with them about the importance of a solid FE for the product...They are pushing everything to the ""custom backend"" because they don't know how to code. Am I overreacting, or is 20% equity for a solo dev building a complex AI data pipeline and a custom backend way too low?

1r0zfc2,Were recent tech layoffs disproportionately affecting former bootcamp hires?,se898,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I’m asking mostly out of curiosity and to get a sense of how things look from inside the industry today.I used to be a software developer in Seattle about ten years ago. I worked in the field for roughly two years before deciding to switch careers and move on to something else. I’ve been out of tech for a long time now, but I still loosely follow what’s going on. Watching the wave of layoffs since 2022, one thing I’ve been wondering about is whether they disproportionately affected people who entered tech through coding bootcamps during the 2015 to 2021 boom. Back when I was around, bootcamps were just starting to become a thing, and later they seemed to turn into a very common path into junior roles. From the outside, it feels like when hiring tightened, companies cut a lot of junior or surface level roles first. That made me wonder whether former bootcamp hires, especially career switchers with fewer years of deep experience, were more exposed compared to traditional CS grads or more senior engineers.I’m not trying to bash bootcamps or the people who went through them. I’m genuinely curious whether people inside companies noticed any real pattern during layoffs, or whether this is mostly selection bias and anecdotal noise.For those who stayed in tech through the last few years, did layoffs feel credential blind, or were certain backgrounds more vulnerable? Did former bootcamp grads fare worse, better, or about the same as everyone else once the market contracted? Would really appreciate perspectives from engineers, hiring managers, or anyone who went through layoffs themselves.TL;DR:Former software dev from Seattle, out of the industry for about 10 years.

It seems like my mind has stopped functioning and I can't find a solution on my own so I really need help from wise strangers on the internet.So here goes my story: I am a 34 years old man (birthday in about a week from now). I was born and raised in a third world country. I completed my BS in CS in 2013 and I have worked as a software dev until 2019 when I started my own business (not related to tech) so I kinda gave up on my career.My business was doing good and everything was fine until in 2025, I moved to the US. My family is here and I was alone back in my country so it made sense to move here. I thought I could keep my business running remotely but unfortunately, due to some issues I couldn't and it all came crashing down.Now, I dont have anything. I no longer have a career to get a job in IT here nor do I have a business to support me. I am also in $19K of debt. I have started working an odd job to survive here which pays $19/hour but I am even unable to meet my basic need as I need to pay the rent here. I am unable to find a job with better pay. My resume is a disaster.I desperately need to revive my career but I don't know how. I was a .NET (C#) dev back then and I use to work on MVC & Web forms projects. I also use to make REST & SOAP APIs. I did dabble in a little bit of [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) core too. I used to work on MS SQL too.I asked ChatGPT and it recommened to start with Azure cloud as I can leverage my background in .NET & C#. Although I have no experience in cloud, do you think it is a wise suggestion? I have started prepping for AZ900 (which I know, doesnt help in securing a job as its just fundamentals but its a necessary step to cloud). Its been so long since I coded that I have forgotten almost everything about it.Or should I look into AI and Data Science stuff? Feels complicated but since there is all the hype about it and how AI is the future, I am not sure. I was never good at maths so I am not sure if I will be able to grasp it.So can anyone of you please help me in guiding towards a path (in detail please if possible) where I can potentially have a financially stable life? I have always been a hard worker and have been praised for my work ethics, even in the odd job here. So I know with a little bit of help, I can rise again.Right now, I feel broken. I have nothing to show for 34 years of my life. All my friends/ex-colleagues have good careers and are married, have their own house, cars, kids and living a stable (or close to it) life. I can't go back to my country as there is absolutely nothing there for me and I am finding it extremely hard to survive here. After bills, I dont have enough money for basic groceries here. I had a comfortable life back home and was earning well and never had a physical/laborious job in my life. Here I am working 12 hours shift as a warehouse worker. I dont mind it but it feels like I am wasting away my life.I am sorry if my post looks like I am looking for pity. I am not. Its just that I do not have anyone to talk to about this and I am not in a good state of mind right now.Thank you for taking the time to read this and I would really appreciate your help.TLDR: .NET dev who abandoned his career in 2019, is now looking to go back to his career in tech and asking for the correct path.",17,0.71,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r2e825/cs_graduated_who_abandoned_his_career_is_there_a/,2026-02-12 00:07:10,2026-02-14 02:08:01

The 2nd human can think in a truly independent way regardless of what the first human has tried. Hallucinations can still happen between humans but they are much rarer and even when they do happen are usually understandable and predictable.In short, I've observed that human collaboration is scalable in a way that AI agent collaboration is not.It's almost as if due to the simple fact that each human has a unique neural net wiring, human collaboration is able to make discoveries and break throughs that a single neural net whether synthetic or biological, cannot compete against.It's as if the current state of the art for AI is still only at the level where it's a tool.

1r1cpz2,Struggling with 100% remote work again. About to take an in-person role but feeling cold feet. Has anyone else made the switch back?,k032,cscareerquestions,"I’ve had a bit of job instability over the last few years and I'm looking for perspective on switching from remote back to in-person.- 2020-2024: Worked at a large company. After the pandemic... it fluctuated between 100% remote and hybrid. Every time I went fully remote, I eventually hated it. I felt purposeless, like I had a ""fake job,"" and struggled with the lack of structure (I’ve discussed this extensively in therapy).- Last Year: Worked a 1-year stint for a government contractor (hybrid). This worked fairly well for me mentally. I actually did a lot of work on remote days, but from a closer office just to focus. But the contract folded over the summer due to budget cuts (DOGE), forcing me to find a new job quickly. Some other parts of the job didn't quite work...it was a far commute in particular.- Current Role (6 months): I joined a smaller ""boutique"" government contracting firm. It’s 100% remote, and the same bad feelings have returned. On top of the isolation, the environment is toxic, disorganized, and the codebase is chaotic. But after the shakeup last summer with contracting work, I felt desperate. I’m looking again and have landed 5 interviews, mostly focusing on in-person or hybrid roles. Mostly SCIF work in the government contracting world...but the front-runner is a role 20 minutes from my house with core hours of 10am–2pm. They seem really modern, use Svelte and more prototyping stuff, but just the nature of it can't be remote. Where I'm at rn, I mean...it's really not working out, and I have the experience to know and see these are some bad managers and work environment...even outside of it being remote. I feel at odds. My mental health and history tell me I need to be in the office (or at least hybrid) to feel purposeful and get out of the house. But now that it's becoming real, I’m worried I’m going to miss the freedom of remote work once it's gone.Also planning to push for more money. I currently make around $170k TC. I'm gonna push more for $200k-$220k. Security clearance work and being only on-site, I think could justify it. They don't really know my situation that I don't like remote and could use it to my advantage I feel.I don't have an offer in-hand but...I can read the signs one of these 5 will come through at least.Has anyone else here realized they just can't do remote work?

1r450b9,Constant insecurity after being laid off - how to manage?,Rich-Put4159,cscareerquestions,"I got laid off 2 weeks and 2 days ago from Amazon, and there's always been an underlying sense of insecurity about it. My old job as an SWE was genuinely like the only redeeming quality I have. I'm not cool, charismatic, skilled, or attractive like other people. I'm trying to change that, but no matter what I do, I just lack in comparison to other people online and IRL. Most of the people I live have tech jobs still – hell, I see a few still wearing their badges from my old company. I'm kind of tempted to try a career pivot and get a master's because of the whole AI thing, but I don't know if I can get into that great of a school (and in turn, I don't know how accomplished I could get to feel).I don't have a job like other people I know now. Outside of my team, almost all of the people I know at my old company still have their jobs. I also feel even more envious than usual of people that were able to get into really prestigious companies that I've gotten rejected from multiple times (namely Google and Apple). Every time I meet someone new, there's that inevitable circle of everyone saying what they do for a living. It honestly feels like I'm lying if I were to say I'm still a software engineer, so I usually end up caving and saying that I got laid off and am searching. I was debating whether to try to hang out with my friends, but I can't help but feel somewhat avoidant since I'd be the oddball.I know it's technically not my fault (it was a mass layoff of thousands of people, then half my old team including my manager), but as is, I still don't have a job anymore. Beyond getting another position (which I'm of course, working on), I don't really think there's a way to feel better.

I was accepted into OMSCS last year but I withdrew because I thought if I just applied like crazy I'd be able to get a job. Well here I am with no CS job still after a year. The main thing that bothers me about OMSCS is the time commitment with how bad the job market is. I've seen several people who still can't get a job even after doing OMSCS which really makes me question if it's worth it.I recently made another post where I said I was considering going back to university to try and get a bachelors from a more respected university.

1r2lqn4,Is my career dead?,makeavoy,cscareerquestions,"Hi the following wall of text is just me whining about my luck running out, whoa is me, yada yada. But I would appreciate advice after reading between the lines. Recently I was turned down for a job specifically because they said I lacked a bachelor's degree. I have an associate's degree from a community college, and some 4 year university for a mechanical engineering before I ran out of money. I got an insanely lucky break at a small startup anyway for roughly 6 years, then a year at an enterprise position. Both of them remote which is insanely lucky because I live in south PA, hours away from most tech centers. I should have saved up and moved but I was making pretty below average pay so it never really added up. Plus family things kept me rooted where I am. I should have jumped ship from my job sooner but I thought all the experience would look better rather then job hopping. I also had a weird sense of loyalty since they took me on without a bachelors in the first place. The stupid part is I was trying to save up to return to college at that enterprise job but then I was laid off. That was a year ago. I got an entry level helpdesk position at an old job for about half the pay I was making and I've been trapped here ever since. I got maybe 8 interviews total last year and half of them the companies disappeared overnight. The other half went with what unicorns I assume the market is oversaturated with now. At least that's what it felt like.At this point I am at a loss of what to do. I've been up and down the existential nightmare of the AI hype and have safely arrived at the ""it's a tool nothing more"" stance but it feels like it's going to be another couple years before CEOs recognize this. I know most of this thread is in the same boat dealing with that aftermath. But what do I do in the meantime? I get small one off ""maintenance"" with my old company's software I play up a bit on my resume and I'm ""technically"" still registered with them but I feel like it's hurting more then helping. I only play it up because I was under the impression it's much harder to get hired in software if you haven't been doing it recently. If I say I've been doing 99% tech support for the past year that makes it sound like I'm not even an engineer anymore. I had a recruiter straight up ask me ""why'd you leave to do tech support instead"" like I did this on purpose. It's demeaning. It's not that I mind IT but I don't have the certs to move up in it, and I always wanted to build software for a living. It's part of the reason I started having trouble with my bachelor's degree originally, because I wanted to change trajectory and it ended up being too expensive to.I have a handful of active personal projects, including a rust library, a game engine, and a joint one with a dev friend I've been working on that's more of a SaaS. I feel like entrepreneurship might be my only hope at this point but I don't consider myself business brained, nor do I necessarily consider myself a designer. Even my system design is probably just mediocre at best. I feel gross using AI to churn out slop. I am trying to figure out a way to use it productively like i know peers of mine manage without feeling like I'm building on top of popsicle sticks. I think I'm better then AI but by how much i couldn't tell you.Anyway I know this is a bit of a sad sap ramble but really it comes down to income. I love software development, I've been doing it since I was a kid, but I also need money. I have mouths to feed and a mortgage and entry level jobs aren't cutting it. My credit card is almost maxed out and the interest is enough I can never pay it off. I'm hoping the answer isn't just to take up a trade like my dad and father in law did. I always felt like software is what I'm meant to do and it kills me that I can't make it happen anymore. If I could even just get some gigs like the good ol days I could hunker down until the economy corrects, but the gig market is basically dead from what I've found.

1r23kbj,Pushing back more on tech lead responsibilities and moving back to IC,Sashimi1999,cscareerquestions,"I’m in a bit of a weird spot and could use some perspective.I’ve been with my current department for a while—I interned here for three separate stints (about 20 months total) and have been full-time as a Junior SWE for exactly one year. Because of my history with the company (basically rotating between teams in my department), I’ve had the chance to touch basically everything: Frontend, Backend, Databases, Devops pipelines, K8s/containers, Cloud infrastructure, AuthN/AuthZ, API gateways/reverse proxies, and Messaging (Pub/sub). I’ve become the ""jack of all trades"" in our department.Management is now aggressively pushing me toward a Tech Lead/Lead developer role. They want me focused on unblocking other developers, guiding engineers, and handling the ""big picture"" stuff. This would drastically reduce my time ""in the trenches"" where I'm basically delegating the day to day stuff.The issue is that I’m already losing my time to code. My typical day now includes: mentoring other junior developers/interns, discussing integration points with other systems, stakeholder meetings with my EM, sprint planning, and removing blockers for other engineers - for example, getting our authN/authZ infra setup or API routes design done so that implementation can begin on a new module.I’ve only been coding seriously for 5–6 years (including personal projects and my college degree) and only have \~2 years of ""professional"" industry experience. I feel like it is **way too early** to stop being an Individual Contributor (IC). I want to experience being a ""Senior dev"" and build true deep technical expertise. Basically I foresee my career moving towards the ""IC"" path rather than the ""EM"" one.Even worse, I’m starting to feel anxious (like I'm not ready for this step up) and feel like a fraud. Because I’ve been a generalist, I look at our dedicated Backend engineers and realize they are better at their jobs than I am.

I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role, which means I’ve had exposure to architecture decisions, client calls, and owning delivery end to end.Lately though, I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.I recently went through interviews with a US-led SaaS company, and they’ve communicated intent to extend an offer. The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role.From conversations with their engineering leadership, though, this doesn’t sound like a traditional ticket-only support job. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes. They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.If you’ve worked in product SaaS companies or made a similar move, how would you look at this? What would you watch for early on to tell whether it’s actually a stepping stone versus a dead end? Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?EDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.",10,0.82,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qz768l/is_starting_as_a_support_escalation_engineer_at_a/,2026-02-08 12:01:09,2026-02-14 02:08:01

1qzr9gi,"Change of role and corporate political games, what would you do?",Space2461,cscareerquestions,"Hi, I'm a Cloud Data Engineer with 5 YOE, up until now my work has been quite traditional, i've worked with ETL and ELT, recently I even began my ""seniorship path"" by forming a couple new resources in the team and managing by my own several projects with a quite difficult stakeholder.Everything was (more or less) fine. The problem started recently, where my manager decided that I have to learn Business Intelligence, in particular how to make dashboard (a task that I hate and I'm really bad at since I have basically zero aesthetic sense), in order not to present my job to internal stakeholders, but to sell them outside the company (and this worries me A LOT, I spoke about this with my internal stakeholder and he seemed worried too).My perception about why this did happen was that the head of data made some terrible choices that burned out the budget and now they have to find a way to save money (about 60% of the BI team left not being replaced recently). They'll probably to sell this transition as a new way to intend the Data Engineering job, compliant with our target company model.Now I'll soon have to speak with my manager about this, I'll for sure tell him that I'm not ok with this, and that I expected to proceed in a more managerial path, rather than taking on more technical work, that I cannot do and I'm not brilliant with. But I fear that this won't make any changes. So what would you do in my place?I thought about:1. Leaving the company (the market isn't as bad as in the US, so it's not out of questions, but i still would like to have an offer first)2. Take a step back and ask for part-time trying to use the free time to land some other job (perhaps freelance or something different)3. Go to HR, tell them that I'm not anymore happy with my position and see if there's something else available withing the company.4. Comply and see what happens (if they will fire me, they'll have to give me an exit bonus)TL;DRAs a Data Engineer forced to take on even Business Intelligence tasks due to corporate politics. I hate them and I suck at them.

1qydfvw,Fullstack Dev at Career Crossroads,MrrPacMan,cscareerquestions,"Full-stack developer at a startup with 5 years of experience.I’m an OK developer, deliver everything on time, get good feedback from management, etc.But I find myself getting bored with the profession.I delegate almost all coding to an agent, and mainly maintain architecture and design. I don’t miss writing code itself. I don’t see myself continuing to write code in the long term.I want to work more with people, at a “zoom-out” level, have more influence on decision-making, work with stakeholders, etc.On one hand, this sounds exactly like product management, but I’m worried about becoming a junior again in today’s tough market, and also about a potential pay cut (or at least not increasing my salary for the next few years).On the other hand, there’s the team lead path, which is appealing because it preserves some technical involvement (at least at the design and architecture level) and usually comes with higher pay.

1r2fn9z,"I keep getting these scam ""job"" offer emails",BananaBerryPi,cscareerquestions,"I don't know if anyone else had this happen to them (very much likely as I imagine they just go sending off these emails to everyone) but it's the third time I got a weird email about this ""job"" offer.They always start with saying how they found my profile on GitHub or LinkedIn and they wanted to offer me this ""great"" opportunity given my experience and whatnot. They also highlight my language proficiency (ok?) and that they need someone to join interviews in place of their developers. I honestly don't get this scam... Why would they have a developer working on the technical part and have someone else join the meetings for them? How am I supposed to answer questions and update my statuses on daily meetings if I'm not the one doing the job? They say the job is:""• You act as the official contractor and client-facing representative• My team handles all technical execution and delivery • Together, we unlock higher-paying roles, repeat engagements, and sustainable long-term outcomes""All very generic but anyway, I love how they stress in the email how this is ""not illegal and not a workaround of any kind"", but it definitely feels very illegal to me.What are they after? Do they actually ""hire"" people? Sounds like impersonation to me, and like you could get really in trouble for that if you were to actually ""work"" like that.",4,0.76,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r2fn9z/i_keep_getting_these_scam_job_offer_emails/,2026-02-12 01:09:26,2026-02-14 02:08:01
