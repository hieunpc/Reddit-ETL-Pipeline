1q1iezn,Can we do actual data engineering?,marketlurker,dataengineering,"Is there any way to get this subreddit back to actual data engineering? The vast majority of posts here are how do I use tool or compare to . If you are worried about how a given tool works, you aren't doing data engineering. Engineering is so much more and tools are near the bottom of the list of things you need to worry about. The one thing this subreddit does tell me is that the Databricks marketing has earned their yearend bonus. The number of people using the name medallion architecture and the associated colors is off the hook. These design patterns have been used and well documented for over 30 years. Giving them a new name and a Databricks coat of paint doesn't change that. It does however cause confusion because there are people out there that think this is new.",184,0.84,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1iezn/can_we_do_actual_data_engineering/,2026-01-01 23:22:22,2026-01-08 01:50:13

1q37mpm,Again - Take home assignment,Limp-Complaint5817,dataengineering,"I am a senior engineer, and although this has been discussed before, I experienced it again recently. I was asked to prepare a presentation for a panel with only two days’ notice. I spent the weekend preparing the slides, attended the final meeting, and presented to six people. The presentation went very well. However, a month later, I was informed by the recruiter that the hiring process had been paused. After that experience, I decided not to accept take-home assignments again.Unfortunately, I made the same mistake again recently. After a phone screening with fairly basic questions, I was given a take-home assignment. It was described as a prototype, expected to take only a few hours, with up to a week to complete. They also said it didn’t need to be fully finished, as long as I explained what I would do with more time.I was genuinely interested in the company, so I spent two full days working on it and submitted what I had. The feedback came back saying it wasn’t at the level they expected and that more work was needed, so they decided not to move forward. From the comments, it was clearly not a “few hours” task, it was closer to a full week of work and would require paid cloud resources.

1q22shj,What does an ideal data modeling practice look like? Especially with an ML focus.,Capable_Mastodon_867,dataengineering,"I was reading through Kimballs warehouse toolkit, and it gives this beautiful picture of a central collection of conformed dimensional models that represent the company as a whole. I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.I'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like ""how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?"" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. The idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.On the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.In the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.There seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",47,0.92,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q22shj/what_does_an_ideal_data_modeling_practice_look/,2026-01-02 16:17:12,2026-01-08 01:50:13

I work on a variety of things, but my primary role is building an internal platform that’s being used by our clients. One of the platform’s main functionalities is ingesting analytics data from multiple external sources (basic data like clicks, conversions, warnings data grouped by day), though analytics is not its sole purpose and there are a bunch of other features. At some point , my boss decides he wants to “centralize the company data” and hires some agency out of the blue. They drafted up an outline of their plan, which involved setting up a separate database with a medallion architecture. They then requested that I show them how the APIs we’re pulling data from work, and a week later, they request that I help them pull the analytics from the existing db. they never acknowledged any of the solutions i provided for either of those things nor did they explain the Point of those 2 conflicting ideas. So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again, (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of)",29,0.83,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1ddky/non_technical_boss_is_confusing_me/,2026-01-01 19:56:47,2026-01-08 01:50:13

As such other developers cannot make sense of the code (despite me adding comments) and im the main point of contact.Solutions tried:* I had tried to write a function that performs multiple joins using a while loop. However as each small table has a few keys this leads to a very large DAG being built and therefore i get an out of memory error. Sometimes i get a driver error and the whole notebook fails to continue to run.* I did try to break up the DAG with a count statement but the issue still persisted. As such we had to roll back to the linear way i wrote before.* I have also broadcasted the small tables but these have minimal impact.* Caching after some joins but problem persists. Other information:* Small tables - row count roughly 50-100* main table - as of now row count roughly 50k* join type - left join on main table * All tables are already cleansed and are delta tables * Technologies: databricks, pyspark, ADF, ADLSSide question: I used to be a software engineer and now moved to being a data engineer. Is it better to write code modularly using functions or without? in terms of time complexity and clean code writing? My assumption is the former but after a few months of writing pyspark code i believe the correct answer is the latter? Also is there any advice for making pyspark code maintainable without causing a large spark plan?",16,0.81,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q4ibgz/logic_advice_for_complex_joins_pyspark_in/,2026-01-05 10:33:19,2026-01-08 01:50:13

PDBoost is a wrapper that keeps the familiar Pandas API but runs operations on DuckDB instead.**Key features:*** Scans Parquet and CSV files directly in DuckDB without loading everything into memory.* Filters and aggregations run in DuckDB for fast, efficient operations.* Smaller operations or unsupported methods automatically fall back to standard Pandas.**Current Limitations:**Since this is an initial release, I prioritized the core functionality (Reading & Aggregating). Please be aware of:* merge() is not implemented in this version* DuckDB doesn’t allow mixed types like Pandas does, so you may need to clean messy CSVs before using them.* Currently optimized for reading and analyzing. Writing back to Parquet/CSV works by converting to Pandas first.* Advanced methods (rolling, ewm) will fall back to standard Pandas, which may defeat the memory savings. Stick to groupby, filter, and agg for now.Any feedback on handling more complex operations like merge() efficiently without breaking the lazy evaluation chain is appreciated.**Links:*** PyPI: pip install pdboost* GitHub: [https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost](https://github.com/ashish-002/pdboost)It’s still early (v0.1.2), so I’m open to suggestions.

GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.The idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.I hope some of y'all find it useful.GitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",9,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q0t1zj/graphqlite_graph_database_capabilities_inside/,2026-01-01 01:58:27,2026-01-08 01:50:13

Most of my work so far has been very technical: pipeline development, data handling, tool testing, Docker/Apptainer images, Git, etc. I’ve rarely worked on actual data analysis.I recently changed jobs (about 6 months ago), and this experience made me realize a few things: I don’t really enjoy coding, working on other people’s code often gives me anxiety, and I’d like to move toward a related role that offers better compensation than what’s usually available in public research.Given my background, I’ve been considering a transition into data engineering. I’ve started learning Airflow, ETL/ELT concepts, Spark, and the basics of GCP and AWS. However, I feel like I’m missing structure, mentorship, and especially a community to help me stay motivated and make real progress.At the moment, I don’t enjoy my current tasks, I don’t feel like I’m developing professionally, and the salary isn’t motivating. I still have about 15 months left on my contract, and I’d really like to use this time wisely to prepare a solid transition.If you have experience with a similar transition, or if you work in data engineering, I’d love to hear:* how you made the switch (or would recommend making it),* what helped you most in terms of learning and positioning yourself,* how to connect with people already working in the field.Thanks a lot in advance for your insights.",4,0.65,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1b3z2/bioinformatics_engineer_considering_a_transition/,2026-01-01 18:27:50,2026-01-08 01:50:13

1q1fj70,Show r/dataengineering: Orchestera Platform – Run Spark on Kubernetes in your own AWS account with no compute markup,iamspoilt,dataengineering,"First of all, Happy New Year 2026!Hi folks, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and a fellow Data Infrastructure Engineer. I have been working as a Software Engineer for 8+ years now and have been entirely focused on the data infra side of the world for the past few years with a fair share of working with Apache Spark.I have realized that it's very difficult to manage Spark infrastructure on your own using commodity cloud hardware and Kubernetes, and this is one of the prime reasons why users opt-in for offerings such as EMR and Databricks. However, I have personally seen that as companies grow larger, these offerings start to show their limitations (at least in the case of EMR from my personal experience). Besides that, these offerings also charge a premium on compute on top of the charges for using commodity cloud.For a quick comparison, here is the difference in pricing for AWS c8g.24xlarge and c8g.48xlarge instances if you were to run these for an entire month, showing the 25% EMR premium on your total EC2 bill.**Table 1: Single Instance (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$2,794.79|$3,493.49|$698.70||c8g.48xlarge|$5,589.58|$6,986.98|$1,397.40|**Table 2: 50 Instances (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$139,740|$174,675|$34,935||c8g.48xlarge|$279,479|$349,349|$69,870|In light of this, I started working on a platform that allows you to orchestrate Spark clusters on Kubernetes in your own AWS account - with no additional compute markup. The platform is geared towards Data Engineers (Product Data Engineers as I like to call them) who mainly write and maintain ETL and ELT workloads, not manage the Data Infrastcructure needed to support these workloads.Today, I am finally able to share what I have been building: [Orchestera Platform](https://orchestera.com/)Here are some of the salient features of the platform:* Setup and teardown an entire EKS-based Spark cluster in your own AWS account with absolutely no upfront expertise required in Kubernetes* Cluster is configured for reactive auto-scaling based on your workloads: * Automatically scales up to the right number of EC2 instances based on your Spark driver and executor configuration * Automatically scales down to 0 once your workloads complete* Simple integration with AWS services such as S3 and RDS* Simple integration with Iceberg tables on S3. AWS Glue Catalog integration coming soon.* Full support for iterating on Spark pipelines using Jupyter notebooks* Currently only supports AWS Cloud and the us-east-1 regionYou can see some demo examples here:* [Developing Spark applications using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/)* [Using Iceberg tables with Spark](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/iceberg-hello-world/)If you are an AWS user or considering using it for Spark, I would request you to please try this out. No credit card required for using the personal workspace. Also offering 6 months of premium access for serious users in this subreddit.Also very interested to hear from this community and looking for some early feedback.I have aslo written [documentation](https://docs.orchestera.com/) (under active development) to give users a head start in setting up their accounts, orchesterating a new Spark cluster and writing data pipelines.If you want to chat more about this new platform, please come and join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9TXybZcd).",3,0.57,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1fj70/show_rdataengineering_orchestera_platform_run/,2026-01-01 21:23:50,2026-01-08 01:50:13

1q1d18k,How do you stop the urge to _completely_ understand things?,Andrew_7032,learnprogramming,"Most of us growing up in school have learned everything in a sequence. Heck, even everything in life almost follows a sequence. A year starts with day 1 until it hits day 365; a book starts with chapter 1 until it reaches the ending chapter. Almost everything has a sequence. Programming does not have that; you have to have the ability to learn things out of sequence. You can't wait until you have the entirety of JS learned before you move on to something like React. Heck, you will probably never get there in a lifetime, as there will be new additions to the language and deprecations. I have a degree, I have been self-studying, and I am still unemployed. When I start learning a library, it is hard to sort of know what to pick up and then move on and hit the library only when you need it again.This is a barrier, or at least one of the barriers that makes programming a high-paying job. We need to have a different kind of approach to learning to code. I have been trying to adapt my brain's wiring so that I only learn what is important and move on.

1q5salq,C++ or Rust for beginner?,ifoundacookie,learnprogramming,"Post was longer than I expected, TL;DR: High-school level programming experience in Processing/Scratch/Python/Java and 4 weeks experience with C++ about 13 years ago when I was 14. Want to learn programming for game dev. Don't care that they're not entry level languages. Okay, I know, I know, neither of these are beginner friendly at all but honestly I dont care. Im just wanting to learn game dev and I want something I can use for logic that needs to be quick and efficient, like terrain gen, etc. I have some experience in the really basic shit like Processing, Scratch, and Java by taking comp sci in HS but I was an awful student. I also took a 4 week summer camp between my freshman and sophomore years of HS that was for learning simple game dev through C++ but it was REALLY basic and I just made a short 10-minute text adventure. That being said, I have learned about Rust recently and everyone fuckn loves it and I've seen people making some really interesting things with it using its extension for Godot. From my ignorant perspective, C++ seems like a good option to understand more what's going on under the hood, having to manually manage memory and shit, and also has much faster compile times (which ive already experienced when compiling Rust demos in Godot Jesus christ), as well as possibly better job prosepects and translates easier to other languages as I understand Rust is a fairly unique language. With Rust it seems like it's more annoying because you HAVE to handle your memory errors SOMEHOW because the borrow checker thing just doesn't let you fuck that up, as well as maybe being more difficult to understand because of its owner-borrower system or whatever its called, but the whole thing makes sense to me conceptually, not sure how easily I'll be able to implement it tho. (But it seems like it would at least be easier to debug, no?) I've watched videos on both and I haven't been able to find a great answer as to whether one would be better for a beginner. Again, I dont care to learn something more basic, I'm already going to be using plenty of GDScript so I will be learning a simpler language anyway so anything I just simply can't do at my skill level at the moment I'll just fall back on that till I sharpen up with Rust/C++.Appreciate any advice or insight into this question and sorry for the long ass post.",45,0.88,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q5salq/c_or_rust_for_beginner/,2026-01-06 19:27:49,2026-01-08 01:50:13

It was (and it still is) hard to even get an interview. So I ended up doing some freelance and gigs all around.

I always relied on AI to deliver something, didn’t know how to start a project from scratch. So, in November I decided to “start again”. Focusing on getting the basics well and enjoying coding again. And it has been a quite fun journey! In fact, I’m liking studying and trying some stuff. I got a membership on Frontend Masters (mostly because of the algorithm course) and gifted myself with some books for Christmas.

The Playstation 1 and 2 use MIPS architecture, the Gameboy and GBC use z80, and most modern applications and games use x86-64, which is why I'm torn between the three.I don't have a computer science background and my career isn't anything close to CS unless you count working in excel. I also don't anticipate switching careers. This is purely something I want to do in mh free tkme. I understand basic computer concepts but don't know how to code or program. I've made a few game mods, I can look at code and change a thing or two, and I can locate some stuff in memory to freeze or edit via emulator or CE, but that's probably as close as I've gotten. Anyways, I am wondering if there are any great online courses or books I can follow that are good for people with little to no CS background? I'm torn between x86, MIPS, or z80, but leaning towards x86 since it seems more comprehensive and I would think going from CISC to RISC would be easier than the inverse.

1q44o2d,Do i actually like Programming / PC's or is it because of uni?,BrosVGK,learnprogramming,"so for context, when i was in first/second year of middle school, i meet some people who were good with pc's / know how to program. I talked to them a bit about it and it managed to get me into programming and learning about pc's and on and off for a few years, i would try and learn C# because i was curious to try and learn how to make a game, and i was into pc's because i wanted to know how pc's work (hardware wise, not software). Fastforward to graduating high school recently (i graduated in june). When it was time for me to pick my future career i decided i wanted to go to computer science (a bit off topic but i was also into music, specifically playing the guitar and wanting to learn about music theory, and i like to learn to draw) and even though i was into those other hobbies, i picked computer science because i thought i could make some decent money from it, however thats when things went down the hill. When i first started, things weren't too hard, i managed to understand some early stuff. I was learning C++ and general computer theory, and when it came to computer theory i was good at it, because in my mind it was easy. Then when November / December came, everything just didnt make sense. I couldnt even pay attention in classes because i just couldnt understand it and when i try and learning it on my own i still couldnt get it. It got pretty bad because i would cry many nights and being constantly stressed at me not understanding the subjects and that i didnt want to fail my classes. Eventually my school finally had christmas holidays and im still having them as im writing this, but yesterday or before yesterday (it was on jan 2) i got an email from two of my professors (one for programming and another for computer theory) where the computer theory would make a test on things that we learnt for a bit before christmas holidays and from my programming teacher where we would get a midterm on stuff we did from november / december. At that point i just started breaking down because i just dont want to go through that awful experience anymore of being constantly worried and stressed, feeling as if i was on the edge, and one screw up would ruin everything for me. So i guess what im asking is should i even continue my course or should i pick a different career for my life (i was thinking of maritime studies because my dad is an expert in maritime since he worked for 40+ years in it) at this point, im lost and i dont know what to do with my future.thanks for anyone who read the whole essay of a post.

1q6gacy,How do you deal with the feeling after abandoning a project?,SirIll6365,learnprogramming,"Just wrapped up a month-long project using C++, SDL2, and ImGui. I set out to make a simple app that has the very basic features of Lightroom, but I quickly realized that architecture is a completely different beast than programming the logic. It only does the bare minimum of what I originally planned, and I’m struggling with the feeling that I should have pushed harder. But at this point, the passion for this specific codebase is gone, and I just want to move on.I learned a lot about the build process and package management, but the codebase ended up as a bit of a spaghetti mess. I’m at the point where I’ve learned enough to see exactly why my current design is flawed, which makes it feel impossible to keep working on it without a 100% rewrite.I underestimated how hard it would be to design the software. It took me a while to actually set all the dependencies up. Then came writing the pipeline for it to actually be usable. But with each thing I added, I realized another thing had to be fixed or improved. By the time I had implemented the basic features, I'd gone through countless rewrites. Despite my efforts to keep it as decoupled as I could, the codebase was never as clean as I had wanted it to be.I don't exactly regret making this project since I learned a lot from it. However, I feel like I'd feel a lot better right now if I put that effort elsewhere, or if I actually completed all the features I'd planned on implementing. But I just can't bring myself to work on it any longer. If I want it to be well made then I would have to rewrite the whole thing.

To me, this makes sense from my perspective, or at least feels intuitive. I can literally see the programming ""primitives"" I wrote interacting with each other in my source code. For example, I build an endpoint like```python@APIRouter().get(""/blah"")def get_blah(): return ""blah""```then I must tell my main FastAPI() object about the routes using `.include_router()`. Nice. I can also somewhat imagine whats going on in my head, like the `APIRouter` object has some record of all the routes I defined via the decorator and that object is being passed to my `FastAPI()` object.Spring Boot, on the other hand, I notice that I create classes, and some of these classes are never instantiated! At least they're certainly never called in my source code. I can run my application with Gradle and the class I created that was never instantiated actually did something. E.g., I make this class```java@RestControllerpublic class TextController { @GetMapping(""/texts"") public List getTexts() { return service.getTexts(); }}```but I never wrote ""TextController blah = new TextController()"" anywhere?Like, I feel more in control of my FastAPI application than I do with my Spring application?

After some trial and error, I made a collision detection system based on several parts:\> under Scenes class, I load textures for obstacles in each scene and create a dictionary to map each scene to the obstacle textures to be drawn. Also created a dictionary to map each texture to its position.\> in my Map class, I create a 2d array of zeros to represent terrain; then, a method loops thru the dictionary from Scenes, to place 1's on all array elements corresponding to the texture's width&height on the grid.\> In the map class, I create methods like this for each direction, which are called in the main Update() method later when the arrow key is detected: (EDIT: position and tex1 in CanMoveL() refer to the player)         public bool CanMoveL(Vector2 position, Texture2D tex1)         {             bool check = true;             if (position.X == Xbounds[0]+10)             {                 return false;             }             for (int y = 5; y < tex1.Height-1; y++){                 if (terrain[(int)position.Y+y, (int)position.X +1]==2)                 {                     check = false;                 }             }             return check;         }Note: I know there are built-in detection methods in monogame, but I'm not really interested in refactoring in the best way possible, I just had the objective of figuring it out from scratch in a way that makes sense. But, if you have some ideas on how you would have approached it/whether my method is way too inefficient, I'd be happy to hear them!Mainly, I'm concerned about the loop that looks through each ""row"" of my character's height, seeing if it hits the obstacle when projected. I was thinking of Numpy style slicing but I couldn't figure that out in c#?Secondly, It seems like this method is kinda fragmented, with the scene textures loaded in Scenes, but the actual mapping of them in Maps.

1q1kcko,"I built a game to learn Kubernetes by fixing broken clusters (no cloud, runs locally)",Complete-Poet7549,learnprogramming,"Hi All, I built this thing called K8sQuest because I was tired of paying for cloud sandboxes and wanted to practice debugging broken clusters. \## What it is It's basically a game that breaks things in your local kind cluster and makes you fix them. 50 levels total, going from ""why is this pod crashing"" to ""here's 9 broken things in a production scenario, good luck."" Runs entirely on Docker Desktop with kind. No cloud costs. \## How it works 1. Run \`./play.sh\` - game starts, breaks something in k8s 2. Open another terminal and debug with kubectl 3. Fix it however you want 4. Run \`validate\` in the game to check 5. Get a debrief explaining what was wrong and why The UI is retro terminal style (kinda like those old NES games). Has hints, progress tracking, and step-by-step guides if you get stuck. \## What you'll debug \- World 1: CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, pending pods, labels, ports \- World 2: Deployments, HPA, liveness/readiness probes, rollbacks \- World 3: Services, DNS, Ingress, NetworkPolicies \- World 4: PVs, PVCs, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets \- World 5: RBAC, SecurityContext, node scheduling, resource quotas \## Install \`\`\`bash git clone [https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git](https://github.com/Manoj-engineer/k8squest.git) cd k8squest ./install.sh ./play.sh \`\`\` Needs: Docker Desktop, kubectl, kind, python3 \## Why I made this Reading docs didn't really stick for me. I learn better when things are broken and I have to figure out why. This simulates the actual debugging you do in prod, but locally and with hints. Also has safety guards so you can't accidentally nuke your whole cluster. Feedback welcome. If it helps you learn, cool. If you find bugs or have ideas for more levels, let me know.

1q15h6s,React Native vs Flutter vs MAUI,Super-Play-2374,learnprogramming,"I am amateurish in programming and have little experience in mobile android development. After trying MAUI and Flutter in the beginning of November 2025. I found that the six xaml files of a MAUI project to be such a confusing mess, and the widget child (and children) feature of Flutter to be inconvenient for me to get used to. I am used to creating new objects in OOP programming. Then after consulting with AI I realized that React Native is probably the best choice of framework for mobile android development. In around mid December I decided that in 2026 I am going to start learning it. However I found that even the configuration (or setup) for React Native is super complicated. For example the JDK has to be between 17 and 20, and installing something on Android Studio SDK manager. Fortunately I sorted it all out with the help of AI's assistance in a few hours struggling attempts and managed to install React Native apps on my phone. React Native's code structure reminds of HTML at first glance. Hopefully in this year I will be able to independently write code for android apps through React Native.

Linux Subsystem for Windows, Netbeans, node, docker, vs, nakama, unity, UE5, godot, it's just all over the place.I've considered getting a laptop solely for programming, something which I could basically ""nuke"" without worrying about losing any personal files to allow me to have a fresh development environment whenever I take on a big project. I've also considered using some type of web based environment but I don't like the idea of being tied to internet access to code.

I don't think AI will eliminate software engineering, but I do think it'll change the number of people who need to it to achieve very good outcomes. With each iteration and vast amounts of training data, the AI models to get better - and honestly, I'm part of the reason, I have to hold my hands up and say I've used GPT a lot since it came out - it synthesizes anything on Google, SO, documentation, etc. so why not use it to get to the bottom of what I need to know way quicker?And I think this is the general consensus - AI will never do away with software engineering, software will always exist, but it will change who does it, and the number of those people.More relevant in 2026 though is offshoring. For better or for worse, I understand the rationale of offshoring labor, particularly junior positions. Companies exist solely to deliver profits to their shareholders, investing a lot of money into an ""unproven"" college graduate is far less appealing than investing that same amount of money into 3-4 new graduates.So as offshoring accelerates, and AI becomes better and better, I'm ""hiding"". I do my due diligence at work, and I learn what good software is.But no matter how many times I implement a strong observability backbone, no matter how many times I write CDK code and deploy to AWS, no matter how many times I implement authentication middleware, etc. - I have the same feeling that I'm on borrowed time.I'm ""hiding"" in the sense that there will be a time in the future, how soon, I don't know, but there will be a time when my leadership thinks, ""We don't need him anymore"" because I cost them too much, and my work can be consolidated into an offshore option or a senior engineer that is producing more with AI. It'll be a simple decision for them, and honestly I'll be the first to say that their intention aligns with the purpose of a business in the first place, which is to churn a higher profit.But until then, I have no choice but to hide, I can upskill and get as good as I want, and believe me I will try to, but there's going to be an inflection point where I can't hide anymore, and by then who knows what the world will look like.But do any other juniors sort of feel this way, this sort of existential dread, but also acknowledgement that that's sort of the way the cookie crumbles?

They let some more people go recently, our QA of all people, and now I can't help but feel I'm next.Now, I put in work since then, but I've only been tasked with maintaining a dying product that no one really knows how to navigate except the people who built it, who are all gone. I've made improvements and added some things, sure, but I still feel woefully unprepared when I'm put in front of a different codebase.What can I do?

That in-human connection is invaluable when networking. But the trade offs just seem to get larger each year and the difference between living in a tech hub / not seems to lessen too, opportunity wise.If we look at the primary reason for moving to a tech hub (I.e. Seattle, SF, NYC) it comes down to:- more job opportunities- ability to grow a larger networkWith the advent of online applications & speaking to recruiters virtually, many roles aren’t relegated to those living in a specific city anymore. There may be some preference from certain companies to choose locally, but that’s about it.Networking is a big one, but if you were really dedicated to building a solid network, you could do lots of cold outreach on LinkedIn and attend virtual conferences in the industry. Not saying it would be as effective, but the tradeoff of uprooting your whole life and paying a premium (higher COL) just to network a little more efficiently doesn’t seem to weigh in evenly.From people who have moved for these reasons, curious to hear your opinion.",93,0.9,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3ilu4/is_living_in_a_tech_hub_worth_it_nowadays/,2026-01-04 06:24:34,2026-01-08 01:50:14

The work is more boring than I expected coming from a fast-paced, cutting-edge team building brand new services leveraging AI agents to now maintaining legacy services written over a decade ago - very simple services but with high scale (millions of transactions per second).The path to senior engineer here is slim, maybe even non-existent because we already have one on the team and there isn't any real scope in terms of next-level projects for promo. My teammates are also great but not amazingly talented in the sense that there's not a lot for me to learn from them. The pace is slow and the work is quite mundane and nothing to do with AI - it feels like I'm missing the AI wave. So there's minimal career growth here.But apart from that... it's just really good compared to all my previous teams - really nice and fun teammates and manager, love just hanging out with them, we have lunch together everyday, go for outings once or twice a month, play games, talk about a lot of things outside work, the on-call load is very low, no pressure due to relaxed deadlines, excellent work-life balance, minimal meetings, flexible timings, the pay is great, almost guaranteed to be safe from layoffs.... it sometimes feels too good to be true after grinding for the past 3 years on multiple other teams. There's only like 2-4hrs of actual work a day..... and I even look forward to Mondays now (?!)But yet, after many months of relaxing after promo doing not much impactful/interesting work, the itch to do more and grow is back again, especially being young and single with a lot of time to dedicate to work, but I'm not sure if I want to leave something so good in every other aspect... it's hard to come across such gigs over the span of a career and maybe I should just enjoy the chill life while it lasts - but it feels like it'll last forever for this team :) this is like the true definition of rest and vest but maybe I'm too young for that already.So I'm planning to stay at least for a few more months, but not sure after that. I'm also interested in maybe going to a startup, but perhaps that's best to do once I have 5 YOE and can apply for senior instead of chasing promo here which is quite difficult irrespective of team. I could also try switching internally to a team with better work and better promo prospects but not sure if it's worth giving up all the good things here for career growth - vs. just rest and vest... what would you do in this situation ?",83,0.93,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3ofu3/staying_at_a_chill_job_with_not_much_career_growth/,2026-01-04 12:10:41,2026-01-08 01:50:14

1q1g8s3,Not sure I want to transition to manager because of toxic younger coworker,Cheap-Sparrow,cscareerquestions,"I (31m) am the tech lead of a small ""sub team"". We have 3 different groups reporting to the same manager. This manager is not a software engineer. I work at a FAANG company.My coworker (25m) is incredibly toxic. They have had multiple blow ups at others and myself. They won't use jira, they won't make merge requests, and every meeting with them is like walking on eggshells. They are late with all their code and it's very buggy. In order to not go through the MR process this coworker created their own repo and pushes directly to main. When we asked them to combine repos they get very agitated. We asked them to start making MRs for review and they flat out refuse and it causes the meetings to become very tense. My manager doesn't understand why merge requests are important and sees no issue with the coworker's behavior. We recently hired 2 new senior engineers. Within 1 month, both engineers have had issues with this person. They are both actively involved in the behavioral coaching of this person. One new hire told me ""this guy is the single worst behaved engineer I've ever worked with."" He expects me, as tech lead, to deal with this situation. I think that's understandable but I have strict instructions to not get involved.I asked my manager to affirm my position as tech lead so I can get this coworker to make MRs and document their designs. My manager said ""No, if I do that then [coworker] will lose their shit and this is a really delicate situation right now.""This young coworker hates me in particular. Probably because I am in charge? My manager has asked me to stay out of it so he can coach this guy himself. My manager told me ""I've never met someone like this in my entire career. I am completely flummoxed and I have no idea what to do.""During one very public blow up, my manager was slacking me privately saying ""I'm confused why he's mad"" and ""just drop [this requirement]. You're right but we need him to feel like he's saving face"".The approach that we're taking is to let this coworker fail on his own. We aren't supposed to save their code when we find bugs, we aren't supposed to push for improvements. We are supposed to let them fail so they realize they need help. Our project is off track.One of the new engineers told me they are having a ""very hard time"" on the team because of this person. I feel a responsibility to respond to that but I have strict instructions to stay out of it. ***Okay. So here's my question.I'm being positioned to become the manager of this team. I said No a year ago because this engineer would have been my only report. My manager thinks I have the wrong attitude and ""[I] need to work with [coworker] because we can't just give up on everyone under the age of 30"". I think this person probably needs to be PIPed and let go. At my previous company (also faang) this would have resulted in a pip a long time ago, both for the attitude but also the sheer lack of deliverables.I can stay on the IC ladder and climb this way, but then a new manager will be hired. This hurts my chances of moving into management later. It also annoys my boss who wants me to just deal with the engineer by coaching instead of a PIP.* Should I take the manager position and have this person as my report, knowing my hands are tied when dealing with them? Or should I try to stay as an engineer?* Do I have an obligation to work with this person, like my boss is telling me?

I am a senior SWE at my current company (well known unicorn). 7 YOE. I joined a few months back. Prior to this company, I have always been a product dev - like I work on adding features to some microservice, testing it, etc. I have worked on large projects and have been responsible for the design and implementation, but they have all been based on things I had some experience on, or I had some point of contact with whom I could discuss ideas. At this company, I am not working on product. I am working on internal developer tools. For example, this team is instrumenting custom dev container solutions to create remote dev environments. This involves writing shell scripts, understanding daemons / processes. I had a few projects so far, but these have been relatively unrelated and disjointed. For example, I implemented a small improvement to some scripts. I also migrated some CI / CD pipelines from 1 vendor to another. These projects are also always consistently out of my experience. I don't know anything currently about working with daemons / processes and usually I don't have a point of contact to talk to.

What can I do?",WistfulHopes,cscareerquestions,"I'm 23 years old, and I've had several part time/contract jobs for indie game development studios, and a wealth of programming projects. However, I have never had a full-time job. Unfortunately, my current part-time job has had struggles with finances, leaving me unable to afford paying bills for myself and my long-distance girlfriend without posting on social media begging for donations, even with both of us having part-time jobs. I've been searching for a job as a programmer for 3 years now, with no luck due to the major crash in both the game development and general software scene.I don't have a degree, but I've taught myself programming over the last 5 years and have what I'd consider pretty decent knowledge for a junior. I have 5 years of C++ and Python and 4 years of C#. I'm also quite experienced in Unreal Engine, and to a lesser degree, Unity. Additionally, I am versed in x86 and ARM assembly, as I spend a lot of time reverse engineering binaries in IDA Pro/Ghidra/Binary Ninja. However, I'm struggling to find jobs that meet my relatively lower-level language experience while hiring a junior dev in terms of workplace experience. Game development and malware analysis are probably where I'd do best, and I could definitely handle general software engineering, but the game development scene is obviously fucked, malware analysis jobs are extremely hard to come by, and my skillset doesn't include web development yet. I'd be fine with learning on the job, but it seems that these days, job postings require experience in almost every aspect to begin with.I'm aware that contacts are usually the best way to get a job in this industry, but all of my job-related contacts exist in the game dev sphere, and no one's hiring for roles that I'd meet in that scene at the moment. I don't have much connection to people in general software engineering or malware analysis. I cannot afford to travel even close distance due to lack of funds and physical disability, so I don't have much of a chance going to in-person developer meetups. My parents seem content to keep me stuck inside their house while having me pay rent monthly, so I cannot rely on them for funding or travel.This has obviously been taking a severe toll on my mental state, as I'm struggling to find work that pays me enough to allow me and my girlfriend to survive, let alone move in together. I'm pretty desperate for a job that pays half-decently, and due to my disability I don't think I could physically handle a minimum wage job, never mind the fact that it probably wouldn't be able to pay the bills where I live, around the Seattle area.

I plan to take 2-3 years to finish the program then apply for new jobs once complete. I’m having some second thoughts about whether my time would be better spent working on personal projects relevant to my desired position instead of the degree. I have a pretty clear target area that I know I could work on side projects for, but I don’t know if this will be taken less seriously than certified courses. For anyone who has been in a similar position as me, do you think the degree was key for boosting your career? (I’m not worried about time commitment differences as I would be working the same in either case. The cost of the program is also not a factor.)Any advice is appreciated!",32,1.0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q4uaec/masters_vs_personal_projects_for_career_boost/,2026-01-05 18:49:02,2026-01-08 01:50:14

1q3a75y,5 YoE. Feel like I'm making a mistake accepting an offer.,agentxtaco,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone, looking for some career advice here.I’m an L2 engineer (5 YOE) currently at an e-commerce shop. I generally love my job—I own features from backend to frontend, write my own Terraform, manage GCP resources, the works. It feels fulfilling to ship stuff that people actually see and use.The problem I’m experiencing is trying to get an internal promotion. I’ve been acting at a Senior level for a while. My manager pushed for my promotion last year, but the Director blocked it because they haven’t heard enough about me to deserve it and my manager cited ""people outside the team don't know me"" (I'm fully remote and introverted, don’t get a lot of opportunities to network). Now my manager wants me to rotate to another team for a quarter just to ""prove visibility"" before they consider the promo again. It feels like moving goalposts and political hoop-jumping, and hasn't been sitting well with me since.Recently, a recruiter reached out to me about a job at a late stage health tech startup, I went through the whole interview process not expecting to get it, but I did receive an offer. I negotiated it up and signed, but now I’m having intense buyer's remorse.* **Positives:** Senior title, good pay bump. Marketable tech stack.* **Negatives:** The work sounds like it could be pretty dry, mostly data processing and generating reports. No Greenfield development and I’d be working in a monorepo. I’m worried I’ll lose that spark I get from building new features for the website.* **Some weirdness:** I’d be reporting to a “manager” who is also an IC on the team. He’s never managed before and is new to interviewing. I’m worried he won’t have the clout to advocate for me or help me grow.Has anyone made a jump like this? Is reporting to a fellow IC on my team a massive red flag?I’m afraid I’m leaving a job I enjoy (mostly) for a place where I’ll be bored and stuck, just for money and to chase a title my current company is gatekeeping.",30,0.87,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3a75y/5_yoe_feel_like_im_making_a_mistake_accepting_an/,2026-01-03 23:51:28,2026-01-08 01:50:14

Mostly I ended up implementing business logics, bug fixes and occasional deployments. Never had a chance to work on end to end feature from design to documentation, the ones where I worked end to end were internal tools which were mostly useless when I left the company. I am a senior at my current role, I am involved in sprint refinements and creating stories but the actual feature Deisgn is already provided and I help with story creations. I had asked multiple times to be involved in feature discussions but always get sidelined by my lead/PO with the solutions architect.I am worried I would be stuck in this phase and didn’t get to work on high level design.

1q1d23l,How do I stop feeling like I will never have a good career or will become jobless?,squalexy,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone!I'm 30, from Portugal, did a cs licence and master's and started working last year in a big 4, so I only have 1 year of experience doing data engineering. My goal has always been to be a versatile software engineer, I've always wanted to work with data, cloud, machine learning, devops (later in my career), qa and so on. But lately, my mind has been plagued with insecurities and I feel worried about my future. I'll try to provide as much context as possible.For starters, I have no idea where AI will take us and I'm starting to feel dependant on it after going through 4+ years without using it in college. The fun part of this field, for me, has always been to think and develop a solution to a problem, but I'm not a fast learner or fast thinker, and by the time I think of something, Copilot is giving me a much better answer in less than a minute. I don't know when and where to draw the line, when do I start to think ""Maybe I'm using too much AI now"" or ""I'm an engineer, I shouldn't be asking AI to help me solve this""?Second, I feel like this field is starting to become a bit of everything, everywhere, all at once. There's constantly a new tech or stack to learn, then there's AI that you either embrace or refuse (with no clear winner here), then you also have to learn stuff from other subfields because they lay off people and you have to do the job of two, and the list goes on. I get home tired from +8h of work, I don't want to look at a screen and think ""Oh let's build a fun project or learn a new stack!"". I do try to get as much cloud certificates (aws, gc etc) as possible, since our company provides us the vouchers, but that's as far as I can motivate me to go.Then, I also feel like I'm trapped in this job because it's a project lottery and the market isn't looking fun for juniors. I'm working on building agents for our company and while this feels very up to date, I'm afraid it's only another hype that will fade with time and not get much use in the future. Somehow, due to the fact that I'm not coding much, I feel like I'll unlearn everything I've worked on for the past few years (and I did forget most of the stuff from college already) and then I won't have the required skills for better jobs in the future.I also really dislike the country I live in because of our extremely high rent prices and very low salaries (a 1bedroom apt is 50% of my salary right now). This makes me want to move to another country, but I don't know if it might be a good fit, if the market is also terrible there or if I even have a shot with all the competition.Bottom line of all of this is: **I never know if what I'm doing will help me grow and prepare me for a better future, and I don't know what's the right path to follow because I'm in constant doubt and uncertainty. I can't get motivated to work because I don't know if what I'm doing is meaningful to my future and I can't focus on one thing at a time.**Have any of you felt like this or have any advice to help me address this?",18,0.83,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q1d23l/how_do_i_stop_feeling_like_i_will_never_have_a/,2026-01-01 19:43:49,2026-01-08 01:50:14

Like at a certain point in a problem, no one knows why it is happening or how to solve it and you end up just trying random things in prod?

No idea. How do I find out? No idea? It feels like our distributed system is so complex that no one knows. We had to severely limit the size of our thread pools because that is how the database is supposed to work most effectively. But if the thread pool queue is filling up what am I supposed to do?

I'm graduating with an unimpressive GPA (around 3.0) from a university that isn't well known for computer science (around #80 on the usnews list). I have no internships. The only CS-related experience on my resume is a couple semesters of frontend-focused undergrad research and a software position for a satellite lab at my school, where I haven't yet written a single line of code. My projects are mostly school projects, and nothing that would stand out too much. I do have several years of non-tech job experience, but I'm not sure how impressive that looks to recruiters.I've worked with most popular programming languages in some capacity (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, etc), but I haven't mastered any. I've also not done any Leetcode practice, so I wouldn't feel confident answering hard interview questions yet.As a freshman majoring in computer science, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. Even though I was following along with the coursework, I always felt that I was a bit behind my peers in terms of internships, projects, and real-world CS skills. It's taken me too long to recognize how hard it is to find a job as a new grad, and I'm not sure where to go from here. Is it worth grinding for months trying to land a job in this field given how non-competitive my resume looks? Is there even enough time before I graduate? Or should I just switch fields?

Got laid off in 2017, but just as I was starting to look for a new job, my father unexpectedly passed away, and I had to step away from engineering to help support a family real estate business. I was never really passionate about the business, and frankly had to teach myself everything to make it work. I've been able to keep the business afloat, but just barely, and as I'm looking to get married and have a family soon, I know the income from that business just won't be able to support a family. So I've decided to sell the business and try going back to SWE. The problem is, from what I can tell, the job market is horrible, and it's even worse with an 8 year gap in my resume. My background was primarily as a Java developer, but my last couple years at the trading firm I did a fair amount of work in Spark, so I've decided to lean into the data engineering angle and have been teaching myself modern Spark and cloud computing to brush up on my skills in my free time. I know I will probably have to start back at a level 1 or maybe 2 role given my resume gap, and I've already sent my resume out to a few companies I thought might be a good fit through linkedIn, but have gotten zero calls back.

I started college in 2021, and my financial aid will likely be cut off after this coming spring. At this point, I still have 10 CS classes left (about 28 credits), which would require at least another year or more to finish.I’m considering switching to a Business Management major with a minor in CS, where I would have 8 classes left (about 11 credits) instead.For context, I recently got a tech-related internship this past fall, and my resume is very tech focused, mainly around data analytics. I’m comfortable with technical tools, but my preferred role after graduation is data analyst or a tech role that requires minimal coding, rather than heavy software engineering.Given the financial aid situation, time to graduate, and my career goals, I’m trying to decide whether it makes more sense to:•Push through and finish the CS degree, or•Switch to Business Management + CS minor and continue building technical experience on the sideI’d really appreciate any insight from people who’ve faced a similar decision or are working in data/tech roles.

Got hired at the end of first year for one of side projects of community member. Fell in love with coding and worked really hard through the summer. Afterwards got an offer into well-established YC-backed company and currently working there as Software Engineer.And honestly - I love every bit of it. But I see two very big problems at the horizon which am not sure how to tackle yet:\- Working with AI is too much. Since I started my serious commitment on a very early stage kind of project - I got used to the principle of speed is the key. And because of that I did a lot of coding with AI (cursor). I didn’t cut it off correctly early enough, and now when I am trying to write code on my own - it takes much more time I feel like I am falling out if industry-needed pace. I can’t say that I am vibe-coding, because I am still very responsible for my code, and I know precisely how something is implemented, and I am not doing “Claude pls code feature” as well, but still like I am feeling that I won’t be able to write code if I don’t have access to AI instruments. So there’s my first question. How normal it is? How do you define an edge between AI slob and speed ups that AI can provide?\- Vector of further development? I am trying to study the stuff beyond my actual responsibilities, and I feel like my next big choice is choice of supplementary skills: doing distribution (sales, marketing, PMF and all that kind of stuff) VS digging deeper into architecture, devops and deeply engineering kinds of topics.Argument of first approach for me are the fact that I can be more independent, but that’s not something I particularly like.Arguments for the second approach are the fact that I love it, but again I love it because I am able to move with fast pace because I have AI. Also, I am not sure how relevant those skills are compared to distribution (e.g Technical guy who can sell is much more desirable part of a startup than just deeply technical guy)Your feedback is very important to me and is truly appropriated",5,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q41ui2/advice_for_an_engineer/,2026-01-04 21:13:49,2026-01-08 01:50:14

My question is this, if you apply for multiple SWE positions at a company and one recruiter gets back to you first and you start the process but fail at say the 2nd round, if another recruiter for the other position you applied to at the same place reaches out could you just start the process again and hope you get a better problem that you can solve. I am asking this because a few years ago I did this scenario where I went through one cycle and got to the 2nd round but did not pass, then that same week another recruiter for the other position I applied to reached out to start. Being the naive new grad I was, I thought I was being a good boy by being honest and telling the recruiter I had already gone through the process recently and if I could still proceed with his cycle. Obviously he did not let me lol. Looking back I am wondering if I should just keep my mouth shut and not said anything. I know this might vary per company depending on how generic early round interviews and if they keep you in a general pool and then narrowing the team at the end vs a place where each job posting going down separate cycles.

I got a nice pay bump out of it, but my primary motivation for leaving was to seek more learning opportunities as I felt I was no longer learning much in my previous company.At my current company, even though I am only 3 months in, I feel like I have even less opportunities to learn here. For starters, engineers on my team work in isolation. We are a small team, and each individual handles a few services on their own. This means there is virtually no reason for the engineers to collaborate, and in fact, there is barely any code review done since they have no reasons to. There is very little guidance as well, as the team expects you to seek answers out yourself. I understand the principle behind it, however as a new joiner, I'm struggling to adapt as I don't know what I don't know, or even don't know what I need to know.I have been assigned 2 projects - the first is an existing full stack web application where the codebase is in a pretty sorry state, and the second is something agent related that they are exploring and which I personally do not believe in.I am thinking of jumping again, however, I really want to stay at least a year to beef up my resume and look less like a job hopper. But I feel increasingly unmotivated to work. My team is actually great in the sense that my teammates are very friendly and helpful, and there is no politics or ego issues. The company itself also offers great benefits - we have WFH, office pantry is great, we have flexible working hours. So I like the company and my team, just not what I'm doing.To experienced SWEs, do you have any advice for me? Should I stay and soldier on a year, or should I jump now? Should I rethink my circumstances, and that it's actually not bad at all? I have spoken to my manager about this before, but the answer I got was pretty much this is how the team has been operating for years and it has worked for them.",3,0.6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q53svu/having_doubts_about_current_role_after_switching/,2026-01-06 00:48:27,2026-01-08 01:50:14
1q3alkv,How to choose an area of expertize?,Culius_Jaesar,cscareerquestions,"I am currently a ""jack of all trades"".34 years old and 11 years of experience. I've worked mostly with dotnet, but over the years I've had full years working with typescript, flutter, Angular, I've done project and team management, I've even done product owner and had direct contact with clients.I was competent in all of those areas and tasks, however I have a hard time selling myself as more than a fullstack developer. Whenever I get approached on Linkedin it's for fullstack jobs, some I don okay in interviews, others I don't.Also, due to so much task rotation, I haven't really becase top 5% at any area and I think mostly due to this, I haven't been able to get a good paying job. I currenlty make 41k (in Portugal) and I truly feel like I'm loosing passion for developing. I'm tired of implementing dashboards and CRUDs and not going anywhere.I've volunteered to implement the CI/CD pipeline at my currect company, as well as participating in the solution design of a new system, just to get more experience in cloud and Solutions Architect and maybe land a well paying job.Am I doing the right thing in trying to disperse even more? I feel like I haven't found my ""dream job"" that will make me stay up (more) nights studying and trying to become better every day.I have a bachelor in software engineering and a masters in information management, I've even studied things like business process management. On paper my profile is a good hybrid one that merges technology and management, but I feel like I'm wasted just doing developer work, and I would be wasted if I'd accept any of the job offers on Linkedin.For reference, I have put a lot of effort on my CV and have a more product owner oriented CV that I submit to companies. But not all companies want a ""junior"" product owner or a ""junior"" solutions architect.",3,0.81,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3alkv/how_to_choose_an_area_of_expertize/,2026-01-04 00:08:12,2026-01-08 01:50:14
1q3752n,Early-career SWE stuck with outdated tech stack - when to start applying?,Hdjekso,cscareerquestions,"Hi all, I'm looking for some career advice from people who’ve been in similar situations.I’m currently working as a software developer at Epic Systems. I started in August 2025 and was placed on a team that primarily works with MUMPS (old database language) and a very small amount of SQL. Unfortunately, my day-to-day work has little to no exposure to more modern stacks.Some teams/ apps at Epic do work with more modern technologies (C#, TypeScript, React, etc.), but:* You need at least 1 year of tenure before you can apply for a team change* You need to be in good standing with your TL* There’s no guarantee you’ll be able to transfer, or get the specific team/stack you want* Even when modern languages are used (C#, TypeScript, React), Epic tends to use them in fairly weird or non-traditional ways for frontend and middleware, which doesn’t translate cleanly to industry-standard experience eitherMy main concern is losing competitiveness in the broader SWE job market by spending too much time working with a dated tech stack.I’m trying to decide when it makes the most sense to apply for a SWE role at another company, and I’m stuck between two options (or any alternatives if those make more sense):**Option 1: Apply after \~1 YOE (new grad / early career roles)** Pros:* New grad roles tend to have less strict requirements* Having \~1 YOE might make me more competitive than fresh gradsCons:* Job market is rough right now* Competing with a very large pool of new grads**Option 2: Apply after \~2 YOE (junior roles)** Pros:* Presumably fewer applicants than new grad rolesCons:* Likely won’t meet job requirements due to lack of real-world experience with modern languages/frameworks* Concerned I’ll have “wasted” 2 years learning skills that don’t transfer well outside of EpicI do have experience working with modern programming languages/ frameworks in college, and do plan on making some more personal projects to increase my competitiveness, but it's hard to find the time with a full-time job. Personal projects also can't compare to real production experience.For those who’ve worked at Epic or similar companies with niche or legacy stacks, transitioned from older tech to modern stacks, or hired/interviewed junior engineers: When would you start applying, and how risky is staying longer? Is the Epic name plus general SWE experience enough to offset the tech stack issue?Thanks in advance!",3,0.64,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q3752n/earlycareer_swe_stuck_with_outdated_tech_stack/,2026-01-03 21:45:37,2026-01-08 01:50:14
