1pyecpd,Mid Senior Data Engineer struggling in this job market. Looking for honest advice.,This_Bird6184,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I wanted to share my situation and get some honest perspective from this community.I’m a data engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience building and maintaining production pipelines. Most of my work has been around Spark (batch + streaming), Kafka, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS and GCP), and large-scale data systems used by real business teams. I’ve worked on real-time event processing, data migrations, and high-volume pipelines, not just toy projects.Despite that, the current job hunt has been brutal.I’ve been applying consistently for months. I do get callbacks, recruiter screens, and even technical rounds. But I keep getting rejected late in the process or after hiring manager rounds. Sometimes the feedback is vague. Sometimes there’s no feedback at all. Roles get paused. Headcount disappears. Or they suddenly want an exact internal tech match even though the JD said otherwise.What’s making this harder is the pressure outside work. I’m managing rent, education costs, and visa timelines, so the uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I know I’m capable, I know I’ve delivered in real production environments, but this market makes you question everything.I’m trying to understand a few things:•Is this level of rejection normal right now even for experienced data engineers?•Are companies strongly preferring very narrow stack matches over fundamentals?•Is the market simply oversaturated, or am I missing something obvious in how I’m interviewing or positioning myself?•For those who recently landed roles, what actually made the difference?I’m not looking for sympathy. I genuinely want to improve and adapt. If the answer is “wait it out,” I can accept that. If the answer is “your approach is wrong,” I want to fix it.Appreciate any real advice, especially from people actively hiring or who recently went through the same thing.Thanks for reading.",106,0.9,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pyecpd/mid_senior_data_engineer_struggling_in_this_job/,2025-12-29 05:58:33,2025-12-31 01:49:04

1pxu6ts,Are we too deep into Snowflake?,stuckplayingLoL,dataengineering,"My team uses Snowflake for majority of transformations and prepping data for our customers to use. We sort of have a medallion architecture going that is solely within Snowflake. I wonder if we are too vested into Snowflake and would like to understand pros/cons from the community. The majority of the processing and transformations are done in Snowflake. I anticipate we deal with 5TB of data when we add up all the raw sources we pull today.Quick overview of inputs/outputs:EL with minor transformations like appending a timestamp or converting from csv to json. This is done with AWS Fargate running a batch job daily and pulling from the raw sources. Data is written to raw tables within a schema in Snowflake, dedicated to be the 'stage'. But we aren't using internal or external stages.When it hits the raw tables, we call it Bronze. We use Snowflake streams and tasks to ingest and process data into Silver tables. Task has logic to do transformations.From there, we generate Snowflake views scoped to our customers. Generally views are created to meet usecases or limit the access.Majority of our customers are BI users that use either tableau or power bi. We have some app teams that pull from us but not as common as BI teams.I have seen teams not use any snowflake features and just handle all transformations outside of snowflake. But idk if I can truly do a medallion architecture model if not all stages of data sit in Snowflake. Cost is probably an obvious concern.

1pz4ynz,How should I implement Pydantic/dataclasses/etc. into my pipeline?,paxmlank,dataengineering,"tl;dr: no point stands out to me as the obvious place to use it, but I feel that every project uses it so I feel like I'm missing something.I'm working on a private hobby project that's primarily just for learning new things, some that I never really got to work on in my 5 YOE. One of these things I've learned is to ""make the MVP first and ask questions later"", so I'm mainly trying to do just that for this latest version, but I'm still stirring up some questions within myself as I read on various things.One of these other questions is when/how to implement Pydantic/dataclasses. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about it, just thought it was a ""better"" Typing module (which I also don't know much about, just am familiar with type hints).I know that people use Pydantic to validate user input, but I know that its author says it's not a validation library, but a parsing one. One issue I have is that the data I collect largely are from undocumented APIs or are scraped from the web. They all fit what is conceptually the same thing, but sources will provide a different subset of ""essential fields"".My current workflow is to collect the data from the sources and save it in an object with extraction metadata, preserving the response *exactly* was it was provided. Because the data come in various shapes, I coerce everything into JSONL format. Then I use a config-based approach where I coerce different field names into a ""canonical field name"" (e.g., `{""firstname"", ""first_name"", ""1stname"", etc.} -> ""C_FIRST_NAME""`). Lastly, some data are missing (rows and fields), but the data are consistent so I build out all that I'm expecting for my application/analyses; this is done partly in Python before loading into the database then partly in SQL/dbt after loading.Initially, I thought of using Pydantic for the data as it's ingested, but I just want to preserve whatever I get as it's the source of truth. Then I thought about parsing the response into objects and using it for that (for example, I extract data about a Pokemon team so I make a Team class with a list of Pokemon, where each Pokemon has a Move/etc.), but I don't really need that much? I feel like I can just keep the data in the database with the schema that I coerce it to and the application currently just runs by running calculations in the database. Maybe I'd use it for defining a later ML model?I then figured I'd somehow use it to define the various getters in my extraction library so that I can codify how they will behave (e.g., expects a Source of either an Endpoint or a Connection, outputs a JSON with X outer keys, etc.), but figured I don't really have a good grasp of Pydantic here.After reading on it some more, I figured I could use it *after* I flatten everything into JSONL and use it while I try to add semantics to the values I see, but as I'm using Claude Code at points, it's guiding me toward using it *before/during* flattening, and that just seems forced. Tbf, it's shit at times.To reiterate, all of my sources are undocumented APIs or from webscraping. I have some control over the output from the extraction step, but I feel that I shouldn't do that in extracting. Any validation comes from having the data in a dataframe while massaging it or after loading it into the database to build it out for the desired data product.I'd appreciate any further direction.",23,0.86,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pz4ynz/how_should_i_implement_pydanticdataclassesetc/,2025-12-30 01:47:44,2025-12-31 01:49:04

1py90n4,[EU] 4 YoE Data Engineer - Stuck with a 6-month notice period and being outpaced by new-hire salaries. Should I stay for the experience?,Remarkable_Result596,dataengineering,"Hi All,​Looking for a bit of advice on a career struggle. I like my job quite a lot—it has given me learning opportunities that I don’t think would have materialized elsewhere—but I’ve hit some roadblocks.The Context​I’m 26 and based in the EU. I have a Master’s in Economics/Statistics and about 4 years of experience in Data (strictly Data Engineering for the last 2).​My current role has been very rewarding because I’ve had the initiative to really expand my stack. I’m the ""Databricks guy"" (Admin, Unity Catalog, PySpark, ...) within my team, but lately, I’ve been primarily focused on building out a hybrid data architecture. Specifically, I’ve been focusing on the on-premise side:​Infrastructure: Setting up an on-prem Dagster deployment on Kubernetes. Also django based apps, POCing tools like OpenMetadata.​Modern Data Stack (On-prem): Experimenting with DuckDB, Polars, dbt, and dlthub to make our local setup click with our cloud environments (Azure/GCP/Fabric, onprem even).​Upcoming: A project for real-time streaming with Debezium and Kafka. I’d mostly be a consumer here, but it’s a setup I really want to see through. Definitely have a room impact the architecture there and downstream.​The Problem​Even though I value the ""builder"" autonomy, two things are weighing on me:​The Salary Ceiling: I’m somewhat bound by my starting salary. I recently learned that a new hire in a lower position is earning about 10% more than me. It’s not a massive gap, but it’s frustrating given the difference in impact. My manager kind of acknowledges my value but says getting HR to approve a 30-50% ""market adjustment"" is unlikely.​The 6-Month Notice: This is the biggest blocker. I get reach-outs for roles paying 50-100% more and I’ve usually done well in initial stages, but as soon as the 6-month notice period comes up, I’m effectively disqualified. I probably can't move unless I resign first.​The Dilemma​I definitely don’t think I’m an expert in everything and believe there is still a whole lot of unique learning to squeeze out of my current role, and I would love to see this through. I’m torn on whether to:​Keep learning: Stay for another year to ""tie it all together"" and get the streaming/Kafka experience on my CV.​Risk it: Resign without a plan just to free myself from the 6-month notice period and become ""employable"" again.​Do you think it's worth sticking it out for the environment and the upcoming projects, or am I just letting myself be underpaid while my tenure in the market is still fresh?​TL;DR: 4 YoE DE with a heavy focus on on-prem MDS and Databricks. I have great autonomy, but I’m underpaid compared to new hires and ""trapped"" by a 6-month notice period. Should I stay for the learning or quit to find a role that pays market rate?EDIT:Thanks for all the feedback. I think quitting materialized as the best move I can make given the circumstances. After looking into it, the 6-month notice period on a standard employment contract seems to be a significant gray area. Under local law, contract terms generally cannot be worse for the employee than what is written in the national statutes (which would normally be 1 month for my length of service). However, custom arrangements are possible, and there is a chance the company’s version is legally valid, meaning I might be stuck with it.​My plan: I am not making any moves yet. I am going to consult with the National Labor Inspectorate and a legal expert to get a formal opinion. I need to know if this clause is actually enforceable or if it would be thrown out of court.​If the 6 months is likely valid: I will probably resign immediately to ""start the clock"" so I can be free to look for a new job sooner.​If it is likely invalid: I will start applying for jobs like a normal human being, knowing I can legally leave much earlier.​I don’t want to risk a lawsuit or a permanent mark on my official employment record for ""abandoning work"" without being 100% sure where I stand.",17,0.88,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1py90n4/eu_4_yoe_data_engineer_stuck_with_a_6month_notice/,2025-12-29 01:42:32,2025-12-31 01:49:04

There’s often a push to “fix” historical data so it can be analyzed alongside newer, cleaner data, but at some point the effort starts to outweigh the value.

Is the decision driven by regulatory requirements, analytical value, storage cost, or just gut feel?

1pwccv7,Who owns data modeling when there’s no BI or DE team? (Our product engineering team needs help),Groove-Theory,dataengineering,"**Long ass post sorry. Skip to the bottom for the TL;DR questions if you don't want the backstory.**# Backstory:Howdy... not entirely sure this is the right subreddit for this (between here and the BI sub) but figured I'd start here.Ok so... I'm a tech lead for our engineers working on our core product in a startup. I am NOT on the data engineering or BI side of things, but my involvement in BI matters is growing, and this is me sanity-checking what I see.Our data stack is I think ok for a startup. We source our data, which is mostly our main Postgres DB plus with a few other third party tracking sources, with 5X into our staging tables in BigQuery. Then we use dbt to bucket our data into dimensions, fact tables, and what are called ""reporting tables"" which are the highest 1-to-1 tables that are used in whatever presentation layer we use (which is Looker). Our ingestion/bootstrap logic all exists in a GitHub repo.This entire system was originally designed and put together by a very experienced senior data engineer when we were in a scaling phase. Unfortunately, they were laid-off some time ago cuz of runway issues before they could completely finish everything. Since that time, our management has continually pushed for additional and additional reporting, but we haven’t replaced that position. And it's getting worse.Today, we have ONE business analyst (not on the eng team) with no tech skills, having learned SQL basics from ChatGPT. They create reports as best as they can, but idk how correct they are in querying stuff from the BI layer (frankly I don't care tbh, not the eng team's concern)Anyway, the business comes to us with a regular set of new reporting requirements for tables, but many of these do not make sense. At all.For example: *""I’d like a list of all cars, but also like a column for how much spaghetti people eat per day, and then a column of every fish in the sea, and we need a dashboard for the fish-spaghetti-car metric per month ""*. That kind of bullshitSince we still have a reduced team post-layoffs, product management has started working on sprint stories for any product improvement we do such as *“Create a reporting table for the spaghetti bullshit above""* despite the underlying data structure being ambiguous or incorrect (and not being a spaghetti company). Which I think is pretty fucking weird that they're telling us what the actual implementation should be.We, as software engineers, are comfortable designing application schemas and writing database queries against Postgres (and the PG layer is well formed imo). We, however, are not professionals in business intelligence, and we are facing more and more questions about dimensional design, report structure, which are questions we feel uncomfortable answering.The most aggravating part of this process is the business will attempt almost anything rather than considering adding another senior BI or data engineering person to the staff. They have attempted to draw general engineering talent into doing business intelligence tasks when that isn’t their technical niche. They have attempted to use short-term or lower-quality consultants. Many times, they have simply pressed onward with what we understand to be an iffy model.Increasingly I spend my time fighting off requests against our team or explaining to others why some of those requests are simply nonsensical (in a polite manner of course) but I feel I'm slowly losing that fight over time, and my head of Product/Eng is not helping me here.I always knew the business was crazy when just dealing with product AC, but I've realized they really go fucking bonkers when you talk to them about anything related to a dashboard.# My questions to ya'll*(skip to here if you didn't want to read my sob story above)*My questions are about whether we have a common concept of ""good"" data modeling and who really is responsible. The engineering department is picking up all of this slack, and BI isn’t really our expertise. So...* When is the time for the BI/data modeling necessarily a full-time endeavor and not something that should be accomplished as part of the product engineering team, if at all? Are there any heuristics that you have observed for smaller startups?* Is there ever value in planning or building ""bad"" or ugly reporting tables to meet current business requirements, or is it almost always harmful?* If leadership wants speed and they do not have data modeling knowledge, what data governance patterns work well for you?* How do you communicate concepts of dimensional modeling to non-technical business audiences in a way that leads to lasting behavior change? (If at all lol)* Finally, if leadership is flatly unwilling to engage experienced BI/DE talent, then what is the least worst alternative you've encountered?I'm way outside my lane here as a non-DE so any advice is greatly appreciated.

1pv9j7y,SevenDB : Reactive and Scalable Determininstically,shashanksati,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,I've been building [SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB), for most of this year and I wanted to share what we’re working on and get genuine feedback from people who are interested in databases and distributed systems.*Sevendb is a distributed cache with pub/sub capabilities and configurable fsync.*# What problem we’re trying to solveA lot of modern applications need \*\*live data\*\*:* dashboards that should update instantly* tickers and feeds* systems reacting to rapidly changing stateToday, most systems handle this by **polling-** clients repeatedly asking the database “*has**this changed yet?*”. That wastes CPU, bandwidth, and introduces latency and complexity.Triggers do help a lot here , but as soon as multiple machine and low latency applications enter , they get diceyscaling databases horizontally introduces another set of problems:* nondeterministic behavior under failures* subtle bugs during retries, reconnects, crashes, and leader changes* difficulty reasoning about correctnessSevenDB is our attempt to tackle both of these issues together.# What SevenDB doesAt a high level, SevenDB is:**1. Reactive by design**Instead of clients polling, clients can \*subscribe\* to values or queries.When the underlying data changes, updates are pushed automatically.Think:\* “Tell me whenever this value changes” instead of ""polling every few milliseconds""This reduces wasted work(compute , network and even latency) and makes real-time systems simpler and cheaper to run.**2. Deterministic execution**The same sequence of logical operations always produces the same state.Why this matters:* crash recovery becomes predictable* retries don’t cause weird edge cases* multi-replica behavior stays consistent* bugs become reproducible instead of probabilistic nightmaresWe explicitly test determinism by running randomized workloads hundreds of times across scenarios like:* crash before send / after send* reconnects (OK, stale, invalid)* WAL rotation and pruning\* 3-node replica symmetry with electionsIf behavior diverges, that’s a bug.\*\*3. Raft-based replication\*\*We use Raft for consensus and replication, but layer deterministic execution on top so that replicas don’t just \*agree\*—they behave identically.The goal is to make distributed behavior boring and predictable.# Interesting partWe're an in-memory KV store , One of the fun challenges in SevenDB was making emissions fully deterministic. We do that by pushing them into the state machine itself. No async “surprises,” no node deciding to emit something on its own. If the Raft log commits the command, the state machine produces the exact same emission on every node. Determinism by construction.But this compromises speed significantly , so what we do to get the best of both worlds is:On the durability side: a SET is considered successful only after the Raft cluster commits it—meaning it’s replicated into the in-memory WAL buffers of a quorum. Not necessarily flushed to disk when the client sees “OK.”Why keep it like this? Because we’re taking a deliberate bet that plays extremely well in practice:• **Redundancy buys durability** In Raft mode, our real durability is replication. Once a command is in the memory of a majority, you can lose a minority of nodes and the data is still intact. The chance of most of your cluster dying before a disk flush happens is tiny in realistic deployments.• **Fsync is the throughput killer** Physical disk syncs (fsync) are orders slower than memory or network replication. Forcing the leader to fsync every write would tank performance. I prototyped batching and timed windows, and they helped—but not enough to justify making fsync part of the hot path. (There is a durable flag planned: if a client appends durable to a SET, it will wait for disk flush. Still experimental.)• **Disk issues shouldn’t stall a cluster** If one node's storage is slow or semi-dying, synchronous fsyncs would make the whole system crawl. By relying on quorum-memory replication, the cluster stays healthy as long as most nodes are healthy.So the tradeoff is small: yes, there’s a narrow window where a simultaneous majority crash could lose in-flight commands. But the payoff is huge: predictable performance, high availability, and a deterministic state machine where emissions behave exactly the same on every node.In distributed systems, you often bet on the failure mode you’re willing to accept.

What I would like to do is to use the task schedulers function of ""retrying"" the task in case of a failure for multiple times. The issues are most often resolved by just restarting the application. However task scheduler does not seem to be able to really ""read"" a task as failed even if I am returning error codes other than 0x0.

1pzdizd,Stream Huge Datasets,Suspicious-Pick-7961,dataengineering,"Greetings. I am trying to train an OCR system on huge datasets, namely:* [OCR Cyrillic Printed 1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DonkeySmall/OCR-Cyrillic-Printed-1)* [Synthetic Cyrillic Large](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pumb-ai/synthetic-cyrillic-large)* [Cyrillic Handwriting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/cyrillic-handwriting-dataset)They contain millions of images, and are all in different formats - `WebDataset`, `zip` with folders, etc. I will be experimenting with different hyperparameters locally on my M2 Mac, and then training on a [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai) server. The thing is, I don't have enough space to fit even one of these datasets at a time on my personal laptop, and I don't want to use permanent storage on the server. The reason is that I want to rent the server for as short of a time as possible. If I have to instantiate server instances multiple times (e.g. in case of starting all over), I will waste several hours every time to download the datasets. Therefore, I think that streaming the datasets is a flexible option that would solve my problems both locally on my laptop, and on the server. However, two of the datasets are available on Hugging Face, and one - only on Kaggle, where I can't stream it from. Furthermore, I expect to hit rate limits when streaming the datasets from Hugging Face. Having said all of this, I consider just uploading the data to Google Cloud Buckets, and use the `Google Cloud Connector for PyTorch` to efficiently stream the datasets. This way I get a dataset-agnostic way of streaming the data. The interface directly inherits from PyTorch `Dataset`: from dataflux_pytorch import dataflux_iterable_dataset PREFIX = ""simple-demo-dataset"" iterable_dataset = dataflux_iterable_dataset.DataFluxIterableDataset( project_name=PROJECT_ID, bucket_name=BUCKET_NAME, config=dataflux_mapstyle_dataset.Config(prefix=PREFIX) )>The `iterable_dataset` now represents an iterable over data samples.I have two questions: 1. Are my assumptions correct and is it worth uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets (assuming I pick locations close to my working location and my server location, enable hierarchical storage, use prefixes, etc.). Or I should just stream the Hugging Face datasets, download the Kaggle dataset, and call it a day? 2. If uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets is worth it, how do I store the datasets to GCP Buckets in the first place?

I'm a data hoarder/enthusiast looking for a system to tag a variety of file types and directories in Windows (I'm not opposed to learning a different OS). The default ""Properties"" (for the NTFS ?) are easiest to search, but you can't tag all file types or directories.I use XYPlorer as my file explorer and I like it as a general file browser. I liked the flexibility of the tags, but didn't like how running a script in Command Line to bulk rename hundreds of image files would break the tag link since the tags are all recorded in a tag.dat file (which I'm not opposed to writing something to also change it in there, but I also didn't think it was a very flexible tag data storage method. I'm gathering people's experiences in hopes of finding something I can invest time into when it comes to tagging my media and being able to access it. Things I'm looking for:1. Ease of access (I figure I can write a script to handle the tag hierarchy and categories as needed)2. Tag flexibility (like bulk renaming a tag)3. Ease of tag-ability (while I liked Adobe Bridge to edit tags, it didn't flow the best for me)4. Data versatility (if I can access the data for different visuals at some point or export it into an Excel format)5. Kind of an extra would be doing the opposite of point 4 (adding tags from an Excel spreadsheet)Questions I have:1. Is it more efficient for my uses for tags to be in one main file (like how XYPlorer stores it's tags) or sidecar files (which I liked the concept, but not how TagSpaces did it, and I'm worried about a search function scouring all the sidecar files)?2. Are there other solutions that exist now that I haven't experienced?My solution that stands now is to figure out the way XYPlorer can natively batch rename files and just go with all tags being in the plain text file.

You personally log errors provided by the ‘opposing’ company for why this process didn’t complete. 55% of the time you get an actual reason provided and steps to resolve by sending a communication or resolving by updating or correcting issue with information provided. Other times it will be a generic reason provided by the ‘main team’ and nothing notated by the ‘opposing team’ and you would have to do additional research to send the proper communication to a client or their advisor/liaison. Or figure out the issue and resolve it then and there. 3. There are appropriate forms of communication to send to the client/advisor with steps to complete the process. If you collected data from the top biggest ‘opposing teams’ and have data to present would they be able to change some of their rules? Would you be able impose stricter guidelines at the point of entry when information comes through so the issue ceases before reaching point b? Once enough data and proof have been collected and shown to these ‘opposing teams’? 4. Issue is there is no standardization for these rejection reasons. The given ones in lists are not exhaustive enough. Majority work but do not fit all situations. If you were to see the same rejection reason from specific ‘opposing teams’ aka Firms. How would you collect and present that data to impose change? Could you collect enough data organize it by Firm, rejection reason, true reason & system reason, time/date, and visualize it? “This firm caused by X amount to y. This firm caused us xyz if we were to do this and eliminate this it would save us xyz. Basically reducing same reoccurring issues so we could focus on more complex things? This might not make sense as I’m not using names etc etc but it is in the financial services realm. Was seeing if there was a type of creative angle for this.

1pwynww,Released new version of my python app: TidyBit. Now available on Microsoft Store and Snap Store,swaroop_34,dataengineering,"I developed the python app named TidyBit. It is a File Organizer app. Few weeks ago i posted about it and received good feedback. I made improvements to the app and released new version. The app is now available to download from Microsoft store and Linux Snap store.**What My Project Does:**TidyBit is a File Organizer app. It helps organize messy collection of files in folders such as Downloads, Desktop or from External drives. The app identifies each file type and assigns a category. It groups files with same category and total file count in each category then displays that information in main UI. It creates category folders in desired location and moves files to their category folders.*The best part is: The File Organization is Fully Customizable.*This is one of the important feedback that i got. The previous version didn't have this feature. In this latest version, in app settings, there are file organization rules.The app comes with commonly used file types and file categories as rules. These rules define what files to identify and how to organize them. The predefined rules are fully customizable.Add new rules, modify or delete existing rules. Customize the rules how you want. In case you want to reset the rules to defaults, an option is available in settings.**Target Audience:**The app is intended to be used by everyone. TidyBit is a desktop utility tool.**Comparison:**Most other file organizer apps are not user-friendly. Most of them are decorated scripts or paid apps. TidyBit is a cross-platform open-source app. The source code is available on GitHub. For people who worry about security, TidyBit app is available on Microsoft Store and Linux Snap store. The app is also available to download as an executable file for windows and portable Linux App Image format on GitHub releases.Check the app: [TidyBit Github Repository](https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit)",0,0.44,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pwynww/released_new_version_of_my_python_app_tidybit_now/,2025-12-27 14:08:29,2025-12-31 01:49:04

One of my main concerns is that while I understand PySpark, Hadoop, and big data concepts at a theoretical level, I haven’t yet used them extensively in a real production environment. I’m actively studying and practicing them on my own, but I’m unsure how realistic it is to land a DE role in Germany without prior professional experience using these tools.# Additionally, I’m not sure how relevant this is in Germany, but, I graduated top of my class from a top university in my home country and I previously worked as an AI problem solver intern (3 months) at an MBB consulting firm.Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Felt that I got in by sheer luck. Academically, I’m not smart. I was generally a B-student back in CS college. But I did enjoy SWE mods like networks, distributed systems, or even learning algorithms. Over the past 3 years, my job has been rather chill and I don’t read outside of work. I didn’t learn much while doing frontend for 2 years - my code looks more or less the same because frontend frameworks are very abstracted at my company.Now that I’m in my 3rd year without promotion, I’ve been looking for jobs. I’m terrible at Leetcode, not good at systems design, my problem-solving skills aren’t great either so I’ve been failing interviews here and there. Sometimes I get frontend interviews, which will test JavaScript or React or even HTML/CSS, where each language/framework has a lot of concepts to learn about. I feel that there’s endless to study for and I’m fighting against a bar that is high but I can’t even see where it is.It’s been demoralising. I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. I have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. But it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.As an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.I think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using.

1px6y5g,Stop thinking about what project is the best to learn or for your portfolio.,YerayR14,learnprogramming,"I have been in that place, scrolling infinitely looking for the best (if that even exist) project to learn/upskill/get hired/whatever, but today I have finally understood why people advice: ""Find something that interest you"". I understand the pressure of been unemployed, undergrad or still learning and wanting to build something that becomes the key to getting out of that situation.I’m fortunate to have a job that combines IT support and some backend work. While it’s not as difficult as other situations, I still want to keep improving to reach better roles. And I’ve been there too. Day after day trying to figure out what to build to improve, and even so I believe the previous advice still applies.So, what is that project that interest me so much and made me change my mind? Just a self-hosting e-book library. Sorry if I disappointed someone (I'm not). I got a Kindle a few weeks ago and since I also like home-labs and self-hosting I looked for an app, but every one feels like artificial and not personal, and as a book lover, I want my library to feel personal, something that I truly own, so I decided to build one.You may think, what can an e-book library teach? Well, is not about the specific case of my app, but more of the concept/problem itself that needs to be implemented or solved that can be applied for many contexts. For example: what if an user have 5000 books? How should I store the covers vs basic metadata (cache vs database)? How can I process all that books in seconds (concurrency & parallelism to improve performance)? How can I avoid the rate limits of an external api? How do I keep the database in sync if the user manually deletes a file? What if I implement an internal ddbb back up tool? Can I pass all the books from kindle to the library directly?And even if I knew about some of that questions before, applying it yourself will always teach you more that just theory.Some people will think that thinking about all that stuff early in the project may be over-engineering, but who cares, is your project you can do whatever you can with it according to your objectives, not someone else ideas. So thanks to everyone who has always given that advice, and for those who are in the situation I mentioned, it’s better to build a project that seems simple on the surface, but where you really dive deep than creating something that looks good on paper but you’re not invested in.",27,0.86,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1px6y5g/stop_thinking_about_what_project_is_the_best_to/,2025-12-27 19:55:28,2025-12-31 01:49:04

But about six months ago, I gave it another shot and started grinding through the exercises.I recently finished the first three chapters, and it honestly blew my mind. It gave me a whole new perspective on programming. But here's the catch: before the book, I wrote spaghetti code that ""just worked."" Now... I’m painfully aware that I’m writing garbage, but I don't know where to start fixing it. (Honestly, I want to fire myself after realizing how terrible my code is.)That's the problem.

It solves simultaneous equations in 3 variables. I also want to learn file handling in C.

My main issue is how we learn stuff and the testing model. In classes like Calculus, electronics, or physics, you can add more, it feels like we just memorize algorithms to solve questions. I can learn the 'why' from external sources, for example books or Prof.Leonard for calculus but at uni, if you solve 100 past years questions or questions from books, you still can get a good grade, without truly knowing the material. This means that you cannot solve a different kind of problem that involves the integral that you learned 1 week ago and passed the exam, because you didn't understand what you doing, just memorize algorithm.I have many friends, even when they got a good grade, they still lack an understanding. I don't want to be same but what's point? Am I right to feel this way or I'm being ignorant?

Content creation doesn't really scratch the same itch.It's like with content creation you make things that people watch but how impactful is that?

1punt23,Strategy for learning digital logic,SadFriendship1255,learnprogramming,"For a few years I have been trying to learn programming, without much success. I've always been curious about how computers and digital electronics in general work. My background isn't technical although I work for a software company where people are nice and usually happy to answer noob questions when they have the time. Over the years, I have learned some basics: Very basic Java and C++, what logic gates are, been messing around with Arduino, breadboards and chips, binary numbers, algebra and a bit of precalculus. But whatever information I have gathered seem pretty trivial and overall I feel like I don't ""get it"".Recently someone recommended that I start from the basics again and just focus on one gate per month before I go any further: write the truth table, the HDL description for that gate, and what the gate is made of (for example an OR gate is two NOT and one NAND gates) every day of the month and then do the same for the next gate the following month, until I have covered all the gates. The goal being that this becomes ""automatic"" for me.I am 38 and want to learn out of interest/hobby although part of me is secretly hoping to either make a bit of money with it in the future or even a new career. But I'm not in a rush and willing to take the time to make sure I understand what I'm doing.What's your take on the recommendation that was given to me?

1pxmowh,C : Passing function pointers as argument,Chief_Miller,learnprogramming,"Hello guys,I'm spending my Christmas week brushing up on my C and I decided to go back to source material : ie Kernighan & Ritchie. Probably one of the best programming book I've read so far. Clear and concise (most of the time...).And even if there are sometimes sometimes some example that require you to spend a few minutes studying the code, you usually have been provided with the tools to understand them.However I'm having trouble understanding one line of their code example for function pointers. Here's the code : #include #include #define MAXLINE 5000 /* max #lines to be sorted */ char *lineptr[MAXLINES] /* pointer to text lines */ int readlines(char *lineptr[], int nlines); void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines); void qsort(void *lineptr[], int left, int right, int (*comp)(void *, void *)); int numcomp(char *, char *); /* sort input lines */ main (int argc, char *argv[]) { int nlines; /* number of input lines read */ int numeric; /* 1 if numeric sort */ if(argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], ""-n"") == 0) numeric = 1; if((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) >= 0){ qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1, (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp)); writelines(lineptr, nlines); return 0; } else { printf(""input too big to sort\n""); return 1; } }and here is the line I'm having trouble with : qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1, (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));I understand that the last argument to qsort is a function pointer allowing you to customize the behaviour of the sorting algorithm. That pointer needs to point to a function that take 2 pointers to void as argument and returns an int. I also understand that this part : **(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp)** is used to chose between the function **numcmp** and **strcmp** depending on if the **numeric** flag is set to 0 or not.The book tells us that using a function name like this (without parentheses) in a expression evaluates to the addresses of the functions, a bit like using & for variable name or using the name of an array. And so far, when passing a pointer as an argument to a function, we've been able to write **function(&variable);** as in **scanf(""%d"", &count);**So what's going on with **(int (\*)(void\*,void\*))** just before ? Is that type casting because the functions **numcmp** and **strcmp** are declared to take pointer to char as arguments? I think it is, but the book say nothing about it and the syntax is cryptic at best. I hope one of you guys could shed some lights on it.Merry Christmas and all the best to you all.",3,0.81,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pxmowh/c_passing_function_pointers_as_argument/,2025-12-28 08:49:13,2025-12-31 01:49:04

Am I doomed?",MarathonMarathon,cscareerquestions,"So I'm soon to become one of those ""unemployed CS majors"" everyone keeps talking about once I graduate. I've been struggling to find meaningful employment, and don't have a job lined up. The way things are currently heading, after graduation I'm likely just heading back to my mom's house and maybe working some shitty retail job with 0 upward mobility. This is a future some people (including some friends) from my high school have achieved without attending college, and if that's my future, it means my mom will have wasted 4 years on an expensive degree that ended up being worthless.I'm well aware that it only gets harder and harder to find a full-time job the longer you wait after graduating. Which is why I'm frightened of being jobless or underemployed once that happens, and then having an awkward gap in my resume to have to explain, which only gets more and more awkward the longer I wait.The roles I've been applying to include SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science. While my undergraduate internship grinds have been very hit-or-miss, I have some ""roundabout"" experience (multiple unpaid internships + paid research) on my resume, some of it ongoing (and my performance there has been satisfactory), which I've been told is enough to land me interviews, which I have. It's just that I've been struggling to pass these interviews. I've known people who've managed to hand-wave themselves in through interviews just by talking a bit, but I've somehow failed even one of those when given one (though that was partially my fault since my reference waved me through without even giving me the JD).My clear metric for ""success"" is having enough money to *be able to* move away from home and afford a non-shitty apartment if I wanted to (and in the event I don't, it'll be because the job is in my metro area, aka NYC). If I don't achieve this, I'll have failed. I wouldn't say I'm asking for much, and I feel like this is a quite reasonably low bar to clear, and if I don't clear it, I'm a failure.Now that it's Christmas already and I still don't have any kind of post-college offer in hand, things are not looking up. I've barely applied to any positions between Thanksgiving and Christmas and have secured 0 new interviews therein. I barely even grind Leetcode anymore, since it just makes me disappointed whenever I fail questions that are supposedly ""Easy"" or ""Medium"". If you gave me a Leetcode-style interview or OA right now, I'd probably fail it. I've yet to actually receive such an *interview* (OAs I have, with mixed performance), but I'm well aware that many companies do ask them. A lot of what I've failed so far is behavioral, though I've passed a few.I've received mixed messaging on whether to consider grad school. My parents aren't going to pay for it and I'll have to take out expensive loans if I do go for it. And I know cheap online programs like OMSCS exist, but I don't know if they're right or if it'll be too challenging, and I'm not even sure if it's something I'm seriously invested in either. The whole field just seems like a sinking ship with AI and all, and people seem to be right about there being no need to hire any more juniors.I just want to know what to do, because things seem absolutely grim, and people who've been through 2008 keep calling me entitled and telling me that the job market now isn't nearly as bad as 2008.

1pvf6oe,Are traditional engineering degrees safer than CS nowadays?,userh1bcr1lwg3,cscareerquestions,"I’m a first-year CS student, and honestly, the job market has been stressing me out. Between tech layoffs, market saturation, and the rapid rise of AI, it’s hard not to feel anxious about the future of this field.Luckily, I’m still a freshman, so if shifting to another degree would truly offer better job security and a more stable income, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider it.Don’t get me wrong: I genuinely love tech. I can see myself studying and working in this field long-term because of how vast and interesting it is. But we also can’t deny reality: the industry feels oversaturated, entry-level roles are extremely competitive, and the barrier to entry is relatively low. Anyone who self-studies can technically enter the field (even if they don’t have the same depth as someone who studied CS formally), and that definitely affects competition.So my question is this:If you were in college right now, still studying CS and not yet graduated, would you consider shifting to a traditional engineering degree instead?I’m talking about fields like:Electrical EngineeringElectronics EngineeringMechanical EngineeringCivil EngineeringDo these degrees actually offer better long-term job security compared to CS today? Or is the grass just greener on the other side?PS: I know some people will say, “If you’re doubting CS, then it’s not for you,” or that those who truly grind will succeed—or that this is just a way to reduce competition.

1pz9x0l,Not sure where to go next,Guy-Lambo,cscareerquestions,"I was laid off 6 months ago. I've worked as a software eng in the bay area for about 13 years. I'm 38 now so I'm not young anymore but I still have to work since I can't retire.I've always considered myself as average intelligence for a software engineer with a very strong work ethic. This often got me noticed and promoted at the companies I've worked for. Technically, there are usually a few engineers on the team that are better than me.Interviews were never easy back then for me but I always felt like the jobs were given to me since my experience was great. I would typically talk about my projects and then do some whiteboarding problem where it felt like I was working alongside the interviewer. I think I've had probably 8 interviews in my entire life and got a no offer on 3 of them until recently.Ever since my layoffs, I've failed probably 5 interviews in the first or second round. The furthest I got was 5 rounds(they wanted a few more rounds and I could tell they were not super enthusiastic about me). The interviews seem a lot more toxic recently with interviewers asking me questions like ""what value can you bring if AI can do those things?"" With all these things, I stopped looking for a tech job completely and found a part-time retail job.I'm fortunate enough to have a small savings and the part-time retail job is slowing down my burn. I'm trying to break away from tech right now and find any career worth getting into where I can afford a family in the future ($20/hr in retail is very hard to make work for a single person). I have a year or two to figure something out.I spend some of my free time at the library just reading to get ideas on where I can go but I feel so lost. Here are some options I'm thinking about:**1. Grind leetcode, study AI/design, work on interview skills and keep interviewing until I find a tech job.***Pros:* *- Clear objectives* *- Good pay* *- Job is interesting for the most part**Cons:* *- Layoffs still on the table* *- Extremely difficult to get an offer (I dont even know what to study since questions are so random)* *- I really do not want to grind leetcode anymore***2. Change careers***Pros:* *- Fresh start and something that aligns better with my values* *- Maybe better work-life balance than eng (tradeoff with lower pay is fine)**Cons:* *- Have to do some soul-searching to find next career* *- Probably difficult to switch careers* *- Most jobs are probably slower and less mentally stimulating***3. Start a business***Pros:* *- Be your own boss (kinda not really)* *- No leetcode**Cons:* *- Hard grind that requires all your focus and dedication* *- I prefer more stability*With those 3 options, I'm leaning towards changing careers. The starting a business is something I think about a lot but it's not something I can just pull out of nowhere. The thought of going back into tech gives me anxiety through the roof. Unfortunately, I dont know what careers I can change into.

1pyz75f,Manager back to IC,ruminator755,cscareerquestions,"I’m wondering if anyone has experience going from a software engineering manager (tech lead / manager) role back to an individual contributor?I work at a FAANG and have been a manager about two years. I spend half my time coding and the other half in meetings. I enjoy managing and have great reports. However, my team’s scope of work has become smaller recently, supporting UX Design Systems for our product. I did this type of work earlier in my career and I’m not that excited about it. I’m also fighting for scope with a peer manager. My product area is pretty high pressure with 50-60 hour work weeks, but it’s predictable and stable. It’s highly unlikely I’ll be promoted any time soon.Given this situation I’m thinking about changing teams and moving into a more exploratory team that works on AI applied to concept product features and tries to get AI features into production. This seems more interesting, but I’d have to give up my manager role and go back to being an IC. I know several people on this new team, including the new manager and they all seem great. However, concept product features seem risky in a time when companies are trying to monetize as much as possible. There’s also no guarantee that I’ll be able to be a manager again on this new team.More context, I’m 46 and hope to stay working in tech until I’m 55. Getting direct AI experience seems useful to stay relevant for the next few years.

1py14mn,What to learn in 2026?,hungrystriker,cscareerquestions,"Hello, I hope everyone is doing well. I have been working as a software engineer in a small company where I am one of 6 engineers for a year after graduation. As you might guess, this has its pros and cons. We do not have well-defined responsibilities at the job, so in this 1-year experience, I could work with every part of a software like CICD, BE, FE, AI, etc.BUTThis gives me a feeling of ""knowing a little bit of everything but not mastering anything"", so I decided to start with something with the new year. I enjoy the tasks that I would classify as CICD/DevOps the most. I really enjoy working with k8s, so I primarily have this in my mind to master, but I am not sure if it is the right thing since my experience/title is not mainly DevOps, and in the company, there is not much space to apply those skills on a scale I can write it to my CV, it is basically a couple of microservices. When I checked the jobs I am really interested in, I found that they mostly prefer Go. I have Go in mind too, but again, I have the same concern: I am not sure if a skill that I do not use at my job can help me get my next job.About Me:1 YOE, leetcoding daily (around 300 problems), not actively looking to change jobs, but want to stay interview-ready, and I will try my luck with big tech in 2026.

1pxnki7,Roadmap and resources for becoming a Machine Learning Engineer,Glad_Orchid6757,cscareerquestions,"I came across a detailed guide shared by people who have cleared ML Engineer interviews at different companies and found it helpful to share. The process varies by company, but the core skills are consistent across big tech and startups.About the ML Engineer Interview Process:ML Engineer interviews typically include 4 to 6 rounds a virtual screen which has coding + ML basics, followed by onsite or virtual loops with coding. Expect 45 to 60 min sessions, often with live coding in a shared doc or whiteboard for design. Companies like Meta and Google emphasize productionizing models, while others focus on specific domains.PREPARATION:● Python is the main language that I use for programming.● Additionally, I am very good at the most common Machine Learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit learn, TensorFlow etc.● The basic machine learning concepts are that I know supervised and unsupervised learning methods.● I can evaluate models using several metrics.● I understand overfitting versus underfitting and the relationship between bias and variance.● I also understand the differences between regression and classification models.My preparation was based on these courses:1.) Coursera AI of Everyone/ Deeplearning AI: Machine Learning Engineering for Production by Andrew Ng Concentrates on turning ML systems into real world applications, covering data pipelines, deployment, monitoring, and scaling necessary for ML Engineer positions, putting an emphasis on the real-world systems.2.) Fast ai: Practical Deep Learning A Hands on, code first method to building state of the art models quickly, very good for gaining practical intuition and confidence in implementing deep learning solutions from scratch.3.) Stanford CS229/CS230: Gives rigorous, university level depth in machine learning theory and deep learning that is excellent for the understanding of derivations and advanced topics that may come up in technical discussions.4.) LogicMojo AI & ML Interview Preparation Course: Focused specifically on machine learning interview preparation, with practice problems, ML system design patterns, and commonly asked interview questions. It helps for project development for interviews.MOVING ONTO THE PRACTICE AFTER THEORY:Practice coding without an IDE use Google Docs or plain editor to simulate interviews. Focus on implementing ML algorithms from scratch or debugging production issues.Great platforms for practice:● LeetCode - ML tagged + general coding● Kaggle competitions for end to end projects● [Interviewing.io](http://Interviewing.io) or Pramp for mocksFAQs Asked:1. Basic machine learning2. Model evaluation & metrics3. Feature engineering & selection4. Recommendation systems.5. Convolutional neural networks for vision, normal language transformation transformers for NLP.6. Scaling ML distributed training, data parallelism7. Production issues8. ML system design9. Coding: Implement linear regression, k-means, decision trees from scratch; PyTorch or TF basicsThis GitHub repo on Machine Learning Interviews is a solid checklist covering fundamentals to production topics.DURING THE INTERVIEW ASK YOURSELF:1. Do you feel confident explaining ML concepts clearly?2. Can you clarify problem requirements and ask good questions?3. Are you capable of delineating the whole Machine Learning system by talking about data, features, models, evaluation, deployment, and trade-offs?4. Is your code neat, effective, and without any error?5. Have you thought about real world constraints?6. Can you draw from past projects and experiences effectively?All the best! ML roles are in high demand and consistent practice on projects, mocks, and designs will get you there. If you are targeting specific companies, tailor to their products.

Looking for advice.",AirlineEasy,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I’m looking for some perspective and advice from people who have been in similar situations.I joined a small startup about three months ago as a *full-stack developer*, although in practice I’m doing almost entirely front-end work. The company has been around for about 7 years, ~20 people total, and only 3 developers:* One backend developer* One senior developer who is currently transitioning into a Customer Success role* And meBefore this job, I did a bootcamp and a lot of self-study, but I’m very aware that I’m still junior. I’m learning every day, but there’s a big gap between where I am technically and the level of responsibility and trust they’re giving me.That said, the company has been incredibly supportive so far:* I asked for Frontend Masters access and they approved it* I asked to understand more about the business beyond pure frontend, and they gave me a project building JavaScript automations in Airtable, touching operations, product, inventory, etc.* I asked for regular time with the senior dev to review things together, and that was also approvedFrom a support and trust point of view, I honestly couldn’t ask for more.The company is very product-focused and mainly B2B. They sell hardware and services to other businesses, but they also have a SaaS product. Around 80% of customers actively use it and pay for it, yet there’s no clear long-term SaaS strategy or roadmap. It feels more like “it exists and works” than “this is a core growth engine.”Here’s where my internal conflict starts:* On one hand, I know I’m still junior and should probably focus on fundamentals, shipping solid frontend work, and not overthinking things.* On the other hand, I see a real opportunity here to grow the SaaS side of the business, help shape a more structured software team, and eventually take on more responsibility if things go well.* I’m interested in full-stack and system complexity, not just UI work, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself or become “the guy with ideas but weak execution.”So my questions are mainly:* Is this a good environment for a junior dev to grow, or is the lack of senior technical leadership risky?* How would you balance learning deeply vs stepping up when the company clearly gives you room?* Should I focus narrowly on becoming a very solid frontend engineer first, or is it reasonable to also invest energy in understanding the business and SaaS side early on?* Any red flags or opportunities you see from the outside?I’m genuinely grateful for the chance I’ve been given, but I want to be intentional about how I grow and avoid making preventable mistakes.Thanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read or respond.",9,0.85,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pukjxr/junior_dev_in_a_small_startup_learning_fast_lots/,2025-12-24 10:42:26,2025-12-31 01:49:05

1pwky0q,Confused About Role Fit After Rejections,InterestingAd757,cscareerquestions,"Posting this here since couldn’t get answer on other subs. I recently graduated with a distinction in a Master’s in Applied Maths (UK, semi-target) and a Bachelor’s in CS. This cycle, I interviewed for roles like Quant Research, Quant Dev (Python/C++), and Quant Trading at firms like JS, HRT, and Optiver also some FAANG. I progressed to later stages in some but faced early rejections in others.I have a strong stats and math background (stochastic processes, machine learning, etc.), plus experience as an ML engineer deploying models. I’m comfortable with low-latency concepts (OS, architecture) as well (though still learning a lot I enjoy rust and recently enjoying C++ too), so I have a mixed skill set.I’m now reflecting on direction: I’m drawn to QR and QD roles, but QR often requires a PhD. I was advised I could succeed in QT with some improvements, but I feel more aligned with research or dev work.Given different skill sets required, what path should I focus on? Can I reapply next year despite rejections this year?

1pwhfz9,how to deal with a needy manager,kovanroad,cscareerquestions,"I'm currently working with a manager who is very senior in our organization, very experienced, intelligent, etc., but he has a few traits that can be challenging. I'd like try o figure out ways to deal with these / overcome rather than give up / leave, for now.I myself am a senior, experienced engineer, we both have decades of experience, relatively successful careers.The challenge with working with him, though, is that its like \_he\_ has a difficult time working autonomously. As examples... he'll write a library for some good in principle idea of his, generally with an ambitious and elaborate implementation, a few ok unit tests, etc... then ask me to integrate some applications with that library. Fair enough. After I do that, he'll look at the integrated application+library combo, say it's not working as expected... and that its basically my job to diagnose/troubleshoot the whole combination. If I ask, well, has this library functionality been tested, has it \_ever worked\_, generally the answer is no. Now, sure, it is \_possible\_ for me to take over and figure out what's wrong with his library, but it's kind of inefficient, since its all fresh in his head, and I'm coming at it from it uninitiated, so maybe it's a few days work just to figure out how it's \_supposed\_ to work., etc.Other examples are, there are tasks assigned to me, I do them, send a PR, he approves the PR, I put the PR in a weekly status update, the ticket gets updated and closed... then a few weeks later, he'll be like ""what happened with ticket 1234? did that get ever get done? was it lost, i don't see it when running the app"". I do some basic looking around... turns out the app has been rolled back to an older version by someone else in the team. It's frustrating, though, because that would be pretty trivial for him to look into via either email, the ticket system, looking at the app version, asking other people in the team, etc etc... but he chats straight to me like drop everything, work got lost, etc.. which can be disruptive.Overall, I feel like, if I had junior-ish developer reporting to me that started out like this, that would be ok, but I'd be focusing strongly on getting them up to speed, self-sufficient, and past this stage over the first year or two, and if they didn't, I'd consider that to be a problem. Along the way, I'd be asking questions like ""What have you tried so far to diagnose this?"", ""Do you have everything you need to solve this kind of issue yourself in future, etc."".Overall, it just feels like he is intelligent, but also kind of ""needy"", lacking in attention to detail, and ultimately that's going to stop us both from being able to do our best work, but it's kind of difficult dealing with this as the report rather than the manager in this situation.

I really enjoy programming from scratch and try to avoid using libraries or APIs unless they are absolutely necessary. For most of my projects, I like to understand the algorithms and mathematics behind everything I build. I dislike using high-level libraries because they make me feel like I’m relying on a black box that I don’t fully understand.A good example of this is that I implemented DNNs and CNNs, along with backpropagation, in CUDA. Even though I understand the math and logic behind them, actually programming everything myself gives me a much deeper understanding. Every time I use my custom AI library, I feel a sense of accomplishment and complete understanding. I know that my library is probably less efficient and has fewer features than industry-standard libraries, but I strongly dislike not knowing or controlling the underlying implementation.Most of the industry now uses Python, which I really don’t enjoy programming in.

1pydg9v,Vibe coding and the workplace,dawnkiller428,cscareerquestions,"This story might be all too familiar. Context I am a 5th year student about to graduate thankful to have a full time job lined up. I am 70% excited 30% scared. I went into CS because I genuinely enjoyed coding from a young age, might I say even good at it. I was able to spend hours at my desk working on personal coding projects, or overengineering assignments simply for the joy of it. I was so good in fact I remember in first year for our introductory coding course I rolled out of bed 2 min before my exam (covid times so online) finished the exam in 15 minutes went back to sleep and got a high 90 on it.My Data Structures course was the final time I coded without the help of AI. it was taught in C and I was able to comfortably implement various Data Structures, like trees, linked lists, etc in C with a full conceptual understanding but since AI came out I have fallen into the hell hole that is vibe coding, and I feel embarrassed and scared. during my internships it first began with using AI to ask for help to make a component look good, or refractor some code, or debug something. then at one point asking it to implement entire components. and during my final internship basically vibe coding my entire project. Although i still would dive in and make sure the code made sense and that I could explain it. Everything I vibe coded impressed managers and my team who went on to actually implement my project into production. However I still fell like a fraud. All my uni courses I have more or less AI'd my way through with a few exceptions. I even remember one time I promised myself not to use AI for an assignment. so I used vs code instead of Cursor. In the file i remember adding a comment like:`################` `# Course Code` `# Assignment X` `################` `# Question 1: Pascal Triangle.`Based of just that that copilot provided a tab that was the entire assignment done, I of course accepted the tab and it passed all test cases without a hitch. I was initially excited about how much more productive AI made me, but as of late I have begun despising my dependence on AI to product. I act as a high-level manager just prompting it what to do. I no longer have the ability to understand the code. so if it breaks it's just me asking it to fix it again. and with me starting my full-time position in the new year I'm worried that this hole I have dug myself into is gonna be my demise. It has affected my confidence greatly because I simply do not understand what is being written anymore. it's more or less a foreign language. I do not know what best practices are anymore.I see my peers that did not rely on AI the same way, have a much deeper understanding of their work, and review code at a much more intricate level. They also build much better looking projects than me and are quicker as well, as they use AI more as a helping hand than doing their entire jobI feel it is too late to brush off my JavaScript book and go through all the concepts again. I just need some advice on what to do at this point. I'm joining a fast-moving team and am expected to start producing results very quickly. I dont want to rely on vibe-coding, because I know it wont be outputting the best code. but at the same time I cannot rely on myself as I barely know anything. I guess I'm trying to tackle the fundamental problem that I have no real valuable skillset at this point that is of benefit to anyone.I did not use AI to write or proofread this post so forgive any grammar mistakes please!",4,0.63,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pydg9v/vibe_coding_and_the_workplace/,2025-12-29 05:12:15,2025-12-31 01:49:05
