1ppuky6,My “small data” pipeline checklist that saved me from building a fake-big-data mess,Jhaspelia,dataengineering,"I work with datasets that are not huge (GBs to low TBs), but the pipeline still needs to be reliable. I used to overbuild: Kafka, Spark, 12 moving parts, and then spend my life debugging glue. Now I follow a boring checklist to decide what to use and what to skip.If you’re building a pipeline and you’re not sure if you need all the distributed toys, here’s the decision framework I wish I had earlier.1. Start with the SLA, not the techAsk:* How fresh does the data need to be (minutes, hours, daily)?* What’s the cost of being late/wrong?* Who is the consumer (dashboards, ML training, finance reporting)?If it’s daily reporting, you probably don’t need streaming anything.2. Prefer one “source of truth” storage layerPick one place where curated data lives and is readable by everything:* warehouse/lakehouse/object storage, whatever you have Then make everything downstream read from that, not from each other.3. Batch first, streaming only when it pays rentStreaming has a permanent complexity tax:* ordering, retries, idempotency, late events, backfills. If your business doesn’t care about real-time, don’t buy that tax.4. Idempotency is the difference between reliable and hauntedEvery job should be safe to rerun.* partitioned outputs* overwrite-by-partition or merge strategy* deterministic keys If you can’t rerun without fear, you don’t have a pipeline, you have a ritual.5. Backfills are the real workloadDesign the pipeline so backfilling a week/month is normal:* parameterized date ranges* clear versioning of transforms* separate “raw” vs “modeled” layers6. Observability: do the minimum that prevents silent failureAt least:* row counts or volume checks* freshness checks* schema drift alerts* job duration tracking You don’t need perfect observability, you need “it broke and I noticed.”7. Don’t treat orchestration as optionalEven for small pipelines, a scheduler/orchestrator avoids “cron spaghetti.” Airflow/Dagster/Prefect/etc. is fine, but the point is:* retries* dependencies* visibility* parameterized runs8. Optimize lastMost pipelines are slow because of bad joins, bad file layout, or moving too much data, not because you didn’t use Spark. Fix the basics first:* partitioning* columnar formats* pushing filters down* avoiding accidental cartesian joinsMy rule of thumbIf you can meet your SLA with:* a scheduler* Python/SQL transforms* object storage/warehouse and a couple checksthen adding a distributed stack is usually just extra failure modes.Curious what other people use as their “don’t overbuild” guardrails. What’s your personal line where you say “ok, now we actually need streaming/Spark/Kafka”?",239,0.98,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ppuky6/my_small_data_pipeline_checklist_that_saved_me/,2025-12-18 16:06:50,2025-12-19 01:46:54

Most experienced DE has less skill in git than others. Our repo is mainly with DDLs, airflow dags and SQL scripts (we want to soon start using dbt so we get rid of DDLs, make the airflow dags logic easier and benefit from other dbts features).We have test & prod environment and we currently do the feature branch strategy -> branch off test, code a feature, PR to merge back to test and then we push to prod from test. (test is our like mainline branch)Pain points:•⁠We dont enjoy PRs and code reviews, especially when merge conflicts appear… •⁠sometimes people push right to test or prod for hotfixes etc.. •⁠we do mainline integration less often than we want… there are a lot of jira tickets and PRs waiting to be merged… but noone wants to get into it and i understand why.. when a merge conflict appears, we rather develop some new feature and leave that conflict for later..I read an article from Mattin Fowler about the Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches and while it was an interesting view on version control, I didnt find a solution to pur issues there.My question is: do you guys have similar issues?

They complain about distribution keys and the trouble with parsing of json logs. They are struggling with Redshift's SUPER data type. They claim it’s ""weak for aggregations"" and requires awkward casting hacks. They want snowflake because it works no frills (especially VARIANT and dot notation) and they can query semi structured data.The big argument is that savings on Redshift RIs will be eaten up by the salary cost of engineers having to constantly tune WLM queues and fix skew.What needs to be picked here?

The proposal is to migrate our dbt models from PostgreSQL to BigQuery in order to take advantage of BigQuery’s OLAP capabilities for analytical workloads. However, since I am quite fond of PostgreSQL, and value having a stable, open-source database as our data warehouse, I am wondering whether there are extensions or architectural approaches that could extend PostgreSQL’s behavior from a primarily OLTP system to one better suited for OLAP workloads.So far, I have the impression that this might be achievable using DuckDB. One option would be to add the DuckDB extension to PostgreSQL; another would be to use DuckDB as an analytical engine interfacing with PostgreSQL, keeping PostgreSQL as the primary database while layering DuckDB on top for OLAP queries.

1ppgsdq,Unrealistic expectations or am I just slow?,thro0away12,dataengineering,"I’ve written about my job on this sub before but I really am at a loss at times and come here to vent frequently. I am fine with hearing it’s a me problem, I really am. But I don’t know how to work faster when everything feels so chaotic upstream of me. I am not eating well, working 8+ hours and finding myself really sleepy (taking 2 naps a day these days) that are signs of burnout I’ve been experiencing especially over the last few months. I’ve been given feedback about not being as fast as the team anticipates on projects. Currently, I’ve been focusing on migrating old projects to a new architecture we plan to use by early next year. I really started being 100% dedicated to this work as of October/November of this year, which gives me 2-3 months to migrate my old projects to this new architecture. In theory it sounds easy to my higher up: all I have to do is copy + paste and tweak my old code to new architecture and that’s it. Except it’s not that easy:1. In current architecture, I built several views that depend on each other. When deploying on this architecture, nobody made me aware (bc nobody seems to know) that changing things in upstream views causes deployment failures until I started working on this and my only workaround is to delete downstream views -> push -> confirm deployment successful -> make changes to upstream views-> push -> confirm deployment -> bring back deleted views -> push -> confirm deployment. This has caused a lot of delays and plenty failures that made me have to go to SWE team to fix that sometimes took the whole day to resolve 2. Naming conventions and the way the data is stored have changed in new architecture with no documentation about this, leaving me to figure out using “eyeball” technique to see where new data is stored and changing my code accordingly 3. Data in old architecture is not always coming through new architecture and I have to just figure this out by checking discrepancies and opening tickets for missing data that doesn’t get resolved no matter how much I ping people to look into it or fix it (I also don’t blame them because I feel other people are inundated too)4. Validation is a nightmare, I’ll have 30+ discrepancies and after checking code and data is there, I have to go through these records one by one to see why it’s not there by comparing tables. It turns out that some records are not meant to be in the new architecture, which I was not told until later when I did validation and had to compare what info from our schema tables was missing between the two. I have to look for specific clues between the old and new dataset for indication whether something is valid or not so I can document there is a reason for discrepancy 5. Documenting all of this and more is a task of its own 6. Ongoing enhancements are expected to be added to some projects I have one project that is comprised of 10 SQL views. The expectation was this would take 2 weeks but it took me a month: 1. creating the views and aligning them to new data model 2. dealing with random/unanticipated failures because of how these views are connected that I can only ask the SWE team to because they can tell me what things in my code that used to be compatible with this new architecture aren’t anymore 3. Validating data and having discrepancies no matter how many times I’ve fixed any errors because some things are “discrepancy by nature” of this new model which I either document and write an explanation of why it’s valid or a something I have to open a ticket for 4. The new way we’re modelling data sometimes doesn’t work for existing projects and I have to add more lines of code to work around that This is not new of the culture of my team. They give me several projects at a time thinking it will take 2 weeks. It takes longer for me and I have been told I have a consistent issue with slowness that makes me feel it’s a me issue. I explain to management my process, I started documenting all issues way more, but nobody gives me constructive advice on what I can do differently to work “faster” and it makes me feel like a failure. One of the advices I was given was “ask for help” but whenever I do, nobody is able to help. When there were holidays, I asked overseas employees to help me investigate a discrepancy an came back to see nobody was able to do it no matter how many people I pinged and explained the issue in detail. As a side note, some of the code I’m migrating now was a nightmare to develop in the first place - it was projects I inherited with no documentation, no idea what the project outcome should look like or what “acceptance criteria” deems the project complete or not. The code was 1000 lines and took several minutes to run with poor performance issues. Like a million full joins, sub queries within subqueries. I was once asked to add something to a where clause in this query and unknowingly broke something that I didn’t realize was a break bc I have no idea what the end result is supposed to look like. I was told to reverse it immediately and asked the SWE team who told me we can’t simply reverse our daily pipeline. The colleague who asked me to made the change became furious and this is where negative feedback about me started. I later worked hard to re-develop this whole project, breaking down the code into separate parts in order to join these separate views together at the end to make cleaner, optimized code. The team did like that work, but even then, issues would arise - upstream pipeline would fail, I have to interrupt my 10 projects to manually get a dataset, upload it through our transformation tool, export and manually put back into S3 that takes 30+ minutes. Later, it turns out that simple joins to create the end table aren’t enough per requirements because of unanticipated quirks with the data that requires a full join and 2 additional CTEs to get right. Basically, I’m just really tired. The business requirements are really ambiguous and a work in progress, our data is in different constantly changing formats and we have failures or changes of me upstream of I have to keep track of while working through other projects and stop everything to fix it. Of note, most of my team members are not strong technically but do have domain knowledge, yet I feel domain knowledge is not enough because the way we do things technically feels very poor as well. Sorry to make everybody read all this, I don’t have any other friends who work in data who I can vent to about this.",25,0.93,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ppgsdq/unrealistic_expectations_or_am_i_just_slow/,2025-12-18 03:37:08,2025-12-19 01:46:54

1pkgak4,"Migrating to Microsoft Databricks or Microsoft Azure Synapse from BigQuery, in the future - is it even worth it?",tytds,dataengineering,"Hello there – I'm fairly new to data engineering and just started learning its concepts this year. I am the only data analyst at my company in the healthcare/pharmaceutical industry.We don't have large data volumes. Our data comes from Salesforce, Xero (accounting), SharePoint, Outlook, Excel, and an industry-regulated platform for data uploads. Before using cloud platforms, all my data fed into Power BI where I did my analysis work. This is no longer feasible due to increasingly slow refresh times.I tried setting up an Azure Synapse warehouse (with help from AI tools) but found it complicated. I was unexpectedly charged $50 CAD during my free trial, so I didn't continue with it.I opted for BigQuery due to its simplicity. I've already learned the basics and find it easy to use so far.I'm using Fivetran to automate data pipelines. Each month, my MAR usage is consistently under 20% of their free 500,000 MAR plan, so I'm effectively paying nothing for automated data engineering. With our low data volumes, my monthly Google bills haven't exceeded $15 CAD, which is very reasonable for our needs. We don't require real-time data—automatic refreshes every 6 hours work fine for our stakeholders.That said, it would make sense to explore Microsoft's cloud data warehousing in the future since most of our applications are in the Microsoft ecosystem. I'm currently trying to find a way to ingest Outlook inbox data into BigQuery, but this would be easier in Azure Synapse or Databricks since it's native. Additionally, our BI tool is Power BI anyway.My question: Would it make sense to migrate to the Microsoft cloud data ecosystem (Microsoft Databricks or Azure Synapse) in the future? Or should I stay with BigQuery? We're not planning to switch BI tools—all our stakeholders frequently use Power BI, and it's the most cost-effective option for us. I'm also paying very little for the automated data engineering and maintenance between BigQuery and Fivetran. Our data growth is very slow, so we may stay within Fivetran's free plan for multiple years.

The type model reflects the needs of modern applications and allows for rich annotations with semantic information that can be evaluated and understood by developers and by large language models (LLMs).JSON Structure’s syntax is similar to that of JSON Schema, but while JSON Schema focuses on document validation, JSON Structure focuses on being a strong data definition language that also supports validation.The JSON Structure project has native validators for instances and schemas in 10 different languages.The Avrotize/Structurize tool can convert JSON Structure definitions into over a dozen database schema dialects and it can generate data transfer objects in various languages.

Our data mainly lives in product DBs (Postgres), BigQuery, and our CRM (SFDC). We want agents for lightweight automation and reporting. Current approach: Instead of giving agents any kind of direct warehouse access, we’re planning to run them against an isolated sandboxed environment with pre-joined, pre-sanitized views pulled from our DW and other sources. Agents never see the warehouse directly.On top of those sandboxed views (not direct DW tables), we’d build and expose custom MCP tools. Each of these MCP tools will have a broader sql query- with required parameters and a real-time policy layer between views and these tools- enforcing row/column limits, query rules, and guardrails (rate limits, max scan size, etc.).The goal is to minimize blast radius if/when an LLM does something dumb: no lateral access, no schema exploration, no accidental PII leakage, and predictable cost.Does this approach feel sane?

Our downstream SQL streaming table (CREATE STREAMING TABLE ...) immediately failed because we can't pass skipChangeCommits.Question: Is there any hidden SQL syntax to ignore deletes, or is switching to Python the only way to avoid a full refresh here?Auto Loader Partition Inference: After a partial pipeline refresh (clearing one table's state), Auto Loader failed to resolve Hive-style partitions (/dt=.../) that it previously inferred fine. It only worked after we explicitly added partitionColumns.Question: Is implicit partition inference generally considered unsafe for Prod DLT pipelines?

1pl62x0,dlt + Postgres staging with an API sink — best pattern?,racicaleksa,dataengineering,"I’ve built a Python ingestion/migration pipeline (extract → normalize → upload) from vendor exports like XLSX/CSV/XML/PDF.

1pp4av7,Clickhouse Aggregation Definition,CoolExcuse8296,dataengineering,"Hi everyone,## Our current situationI am working at a small software company, and we have successfully switched to Clickhouse in order to store all of our customers' telemetry, which is at the heart of our activity.We are super satisfied with it and want to move on.So far everything was stored in PostgreSQL.Currently, we're relying on a legacy format to define our aggregations (which calculations we need to perform for which customer).These definitions are stored as JSON objects in the db, they are written by hand and are quite messy and very unclear.They define which calculations (avg, min, max, sum, etc, but also more complex ones wih CTES...) should be made on which input column, and which filters and pre/post treatments should be made on it.They define both what aggregations should be made daily, and what should be calculated on top of it when a user asks for a wider range. For instance we calculate durations daily and we sum these daily durations to get the weekly resultThe goal is ultimately to feed custom-made user dashboards and reports.A very spaghettish code of mine translates these aggregation definitions into templated Clickhouse SQL queries that we store in PGSQL.At night an Airflow DAG runs these queries and stores the results in the db.It is very painful to understand and to maintain.## What we want to achieveWe would like to simplify all this and to enable our project managers (non technical), and maybe even later our customers, to create/update them, ideally based on a GUI.I have tried doing some mockups with Redash, Metabase or Superset but none of them really fit, mostly because some of our aggregations use intricate CTEs, have post-treatments, or use data stored in Maps etc..I felt they were more suited for already-clean business data and not big telemetry tables with hundreds of columns, and also for simple BI cases.## Why am I humbly asking for your generous and wise advicesWhat would your approach be on this?I was thinking about maybe a simpler/sleeker yaml format that could be easily generated by our PHP backend for the definition.Then for the conversion into Clickhouse queries,I was wondering if you guys think that a tool like DBT could be of any use in order to template our functions and generate the SQL queries, and even maybe to trigger them.I am rather new in Data Engineering so I am really curious about the recommended approaches, or if there might even be some standard or frameworks for this.We're not the first ones to face this problematic for sure!I just want to precise we'll go fully opensource and are open to developing stuff ourselvesThank you very much for your feedbacks!",4,0.83,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pp4av7/clickhouse_aggregation_definition/,2025-12-17 18:37:20,2025-12-19 01:46:54

My manager has given me free reign to research various options and come up with a plan that we can execute over 2026, just with the understanding that our company has a footprint in Azure, so I shouldn't branch out to AWS or GCP for example.Proposal:+ Azure Blob Storage to ingest and store all our vendors' files and data on a daily/hourly basis+ Dagster+ (hybrid) for orchestration+ Deltalake tables created/updated in blob storage for staging, warehouse, and marts layers using delta-rs and polars for transformations+ For serving to BI tools, use external tables in a Databricks SQL warehouse pointed to delta tables+ Keep Tableau as is, reduce our need for Alteryx over time to just last mile transformations/adhoc analysis for my other team membersOther considerations:+ DBT: I did some of their courses and tried to recreate an existing pipeline using dbt-core orchestrated by Dagster and it seemed overkill for my purposes. Everything I liked in it was already covered by Dagster, such as data lineage, testing, and the features that might be nice require cloud. I'm also more comfortable writing transformations in Python rather than SQL.+ Table maintenance: I'm aware that external tables are not managed by DBX and it's on me to manage the tables manually (optimize/vacuum). I figure I can set up a script that runs once a month or something to automatically do it.+ Why delta-rs? Again, we don't have overly complex data needs or sizes that require Spark computing costs. Our machines are perfectly capable of handling the compute requirements that we need. If we get to ML models down the road, then I'd probably run those in DBX notebooks and rely on their computing power.Has anyone else ran a similar design before?

1por4wa,Data VCS,cmcclu5,dataengineering,"Folks, I’m working on a data VCS similar to Git but for databases and data lakes. At the moment, I have a headless API server and the code to handle PostgreSQL and S3 or MinIO data lakes with plans to support the other major databases and data lakes, but before I continue, I wanted community feedback on whether you’d find this useful.The project goal was to make a version of Git that could be used for data so that we data engineers wouldn’t have to learn a completely new terminology. It uses the same CLI for the most part, with init, add, commit, push, etc. The versioning control is operations-based instead of record- or table-based, so it simplifies a lot of the branch operations. I’ve included a dedicated ingestion branch so it can work with a live database where data is constantly ingested via some external process. I realize there are some products available that do something moderately similar, but they all either require learning a completely new syntax or are extremely limited in capability and speed. This allows you to directly branch on server from an existing database with approximately 10% overhead. The local client is written in Rust with PyO3 bindings to interact with the headless FastAPI server backend when deployed for an organization. Eventually, I want to distribute this to engineers and orgs, but this post is primarily to gauge interest and feasibility from my fellow engineers. Ask whatever questions come to mind, bash it as much as you want, tell me whatever comes to mind.

We are considering 2 approaches:1) ingest the stream via an application that reroutes it to a Marquez instance and store the harmonized data in Postgres. Enrich the data there by adding additional attributes, then process it via batch jobs running on azure app service (or similar) and save it in graph format somewhere else (possibly neo4j or delta format in databricks). 2) Ingest the stream via structured streaming in databricks and save the data in delta format. Process via batch jobs in databricks and save it there in graph format. Approach 1 does away with the heavy lifting of harmonizing into a data model, but relies on a 3rd party open source application (Marquez) that is susceptible to vulnerabilities and is quite brittle in terms of extensibility and maintenance. Approach 2 would be the most pain free and is essentially an ETL pipeline that could follow the medallion architecture and be quite robust in terms of error proofing and de bugging, but is likely to be a lot more costly because structured streaming requires a databricks compute to be available 24/7, and even the batch processing jobs for enriching the data after ingestion were written off as being too expensive by our architect.

I have basic SQL/Python but limited real-world DE experience, and there’s no clear guidance on training. Looking for advice on what training to prioritise and what I can do now to add value while the warehouse is still being designed.Hello, I was recently promoted from a senior support engineer/analyst role into a newly created *Junior Data Engineer* position at a \~500 person company. I came from a very small IT team of six where we were all essentially jack-of-all-trades and i've been with this company for about 4 years now. Over the last year, the CEO hired a new CTO who’s been driving a lot of change and modernisation (Intune rollout, new platforms, etc.). As part of that, I’ve been able to learn a lot of new skills, and a data warehouse project has now been kicked off.The warehouse (Microsoft Fabric) is being designed and built by an external consultancy. I have a computing degree and some historic SQL/Python experience, but no real-world data engineering background. The expectation is that I’ll learn alongside the vendor during the build and eventually become the internal owner and point person.We have a fairly complex estate, about 30+ systems that need to be integrated. I’m also working alongside a newly created *Data & CRM Owner* role (previously our CRM lead), though it’s not entirely clear how our responsibilities differ yet, as we seem to be working together on most things. The consultancy is still in the design phase, and while I attend meetings, I don’t yet have enough knowledge to meaningfully contribute.So far, I’ve created a change request for our public Wi-Fi offerings as we want to capture more data, and allow our members to use their SSO account, and started building a system integrations list that maps which systems talk to each other, what type of system they are, and which department owns them. My plan is to expand this to document pipelines, entities, and eventually fields across the databases. I have also made one hypothetical data flow that came off the back of a meeting with a director who wants to send feedback request emails to customers.My director doesn’t have a clear view on what training I should be doing, so I’m trying to be proactive. My main questions are:* What training should I be prioritising in this situation?* What else can I be doing right now to add value while the warehouse is being built?Any advice would be appreciated.I really fear that this role doesn't even need to exist, so i want to try make it need to exist.

Code is only part of the trade of programming. Professional programmers understand what our users need. We have clear vision for what a finished software package is and does and looks like. We get our work tested, packaged, and across the finish line. Along the way we write some code. The thing is, if we can do the other things well, the code is (usually) pretty easy, comparatively. At the same time, pure code isn't finished and doesn't have any users. That gets very boring very fast.Wanna see some examples of software packages of a scale that one person -- you -- can make and publish and try to attract live people as users?* These are Javascript utility packages. https://www.npmleaderboard.org/* These are plugins for WordPress: https://wordpress.org/plugins/* ...for Python. https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Topic+%3A%3A+Artistic+Software * Indie games. https://itch.io/There are other lists and repositories of packages out there for the searching. Laying down lines of code is just a part of our trade. The programmers of many of those packages did the whole job: explanation, instructions, code, testing, packaging, publishing, and then bug fixing. Read through some of the package descriptions; they'll give you a feel for what a piece of finished software looks like.Don't be too intimidated by the packages that turn up on the first page of these lists. The best of them have been around for many years, and have been through a lot of changes to perfect them. But those packages started somewhere. Yours can too.Make good software and stay in touch.",165,0.92,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pobmbd/programming_is_a_trade_we_make_programs_for_people/,2025-12-16 19:47:35,2025-12-19 01:46:55

I am a current game development student in university, however for some reason my uni's game development department and CS department aren't super cooperative. I have just completed algorithms & data structures class (generally the 3rd CS class you take here) and so far everything we've done has been in java with a bit of python. Our games department does not have any specific programming classes because the assumption is that most of that will be handled by the CS department, however the main engine we use for the game dev classes is UE5 which runs in C++. There is a games scripting class that I've just completed but that's all using blueprints. I've been told that higher level CS classes don't have a specific language requirement, however there is no dedicated class using c++ or even a primer as far as I'm aware, and would like to be able to transition my knowledge from java to C++ so I can start working effectively in building from there in that to sharpen my skillset later on. Advice I'm seeing tends to be either to read a specific book/forum (which tends to be a \*very\* slow method for me, safe to say I'm generally an audiobook person) or to just ""go and start"", which I can grab a compiler and start googling how something formatted in java is formatted in c++, but that doesn't give me as good of an understanding.

1pmo24t,Teaching an old programmer new tricks...,TypingTadpole,learnprogramming,"I confess that I have a standard / frequent question around ""how do I create X type of app"", but there are three twists to the question, I promise! The FAQ helped, but before I go off and running, I want to ""test"" my hypothesis.**First, I'm old**. Not too old to learn (approaching 60), just that I have old programming experience. So I typed programs from computer magazines in BASIC into Commodore VIC-20s and PETs back in the 80s and saved them on cassettes; I learned BASIC and STRUCTURED BASIC in high school in the 80s; I took BASIC/FORTRAN/COBOL courses in university in the 90s. I learned enough to write a menu system in BASIC for running in DOS back in the '80s that allowed me to add/subtract items, write batch files that would launch when the menu closed and then reopen the menu when I was done running whatever program was, compile it and run it in DOS. Used it for years. So I have \*\*\*SOME\*\*\* experience. Just nothing recent. Oh, and I also can debug basic HTML / CSS issues on websites but avoid javascript stuff at least for now. I'd rather run WordPress with free plugins than program my own. I'm more of a user than a developer. The second twist is that I have **two very specific needs** in mind, both of which could perhaps be done with a robust GUI and back-end database instead of programming it. But well, I want something a bit more customizable to my specific issues to solve. So, like the videos recommend, I have specific problems to solve that will keep me interested! The first is harder and I have more passion for it; the second is easier and maybe where I should start, even though I'm not as excited about it.And the third twist is that I am **NOT trying to build a revenue stream**. I'm open to having a small revenue stream tied to it enough to buy myself a coffee if someone wants the extra ""bits"", but just looking to use the apps myself, $$ is not my goal. If others in my immediate community find it useful, I'd be open to sharing the apps everywhere for free and with no advertising. Maybe some ""extras"" available in a pro version for $1 or something.The first need would be a mobile app (iOS and Android) that acts like a **field recorder** as if someone was doing a survey or recording a business transaction BUT without local wifi/internet access. So, like you were out in the woods, say, doing biology research and you wanted to record which birds you saw, and the date/time/interesting details. BUT you also want to be able to record the equipment you were using and the place/location with sort of default ""profiles"". Like, ""Profile 1"" says you're using equipment X, Y, Z; Profile 2 says you're using X, A, B; Profile 3 says Y, Z, B, etc. But I want to load the default profiles in as starter info. There are existing database apps that do this, but I have some unique usage links that I'll need to pull from unique style databases too, which the database apps didn't have the power to do. Ultimately, I need the initial recording apps (mostly dumping info into a set of fields in a database) and then once I'm back in civilization, uploading them to a more powerful PC app that would be almost the same software in PC form, with some extra printing, formatting, layout features. I confess I have no idea where that info is saved on the phone, or the PC, or the inbetween bits (common upload to cloud when there's a connection? Like synching photos?). Just that I want the data to eventually be in the PC for more processing. It's not very complicated for operations (input screen, load profiles, enter data, save data, load previous records, etc.), and the graphics needs are not very sophisticated (very functionally focused). If it was the early 90s, I'd be tempted to even use COBOL. The app will do no calculations or advanced graphics; it's almost entirely a text-based database entry and retrieval function with some flex on forms.The second need is similar but even simpler in design. It's like **a quiz game.** Questions, with 4 possible answers, timed. It could be used as a game or as a flashcard-type study aid. I have a specific purpose in mind, but the functionality is basically that of a trivia game -- load small database (say 25 Qs about topic 1), go through the Qs, have options for hints or retries, get score at end, equivalent of a global leader board (so some internet required). But all single player, not live games with others, no live online element. And the extra twist for this one is I would love to be able to do it in iOS, Android, AND a version for my website for those who DO have access. The mobile apps would work differently, and I don't NEED a website version, but I'll keep my options open. The FAQ tells me to use Kotlin or Java (for Android); Objective-C or Swift (for iOS); C#, VB or JS for Windows Phone; or use PhoneGap / Titanium in HTML/CSS/JS. Oh and C# for the Windows PC version (no, I am NOT going to try MAC too). But with my specific two-use functionality...is that the way to go?

1pmcu55,Struggling with Data Structures and Algorithms. Please help,WildCantaloupe8757,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I’m struggling with my data structures and algorithms course in uni. This is kind of my last resort for help. I was thinking I might even hire a tutor at this point. I really want to learn this, so I've watched lectures and followed tutorials, but I feel stuck in a cycle of confusion and I’m hoping for some guidance on how to break out of it.A lot of my high school math is rusty as well, so I’ve been relearning on the fly. When I see the pseudocode or a solution, I can usually understand it at a surface level but when I'm given a problem, I blank on how to even start designing the algorithm. It feels like there's a gap between recognizing a solution and inventing one.I see the final algorithm, but the problem-solving process that led to it feels like a mystery. What mental steps should I be practicing?What I'm struggling with so far:* Foundational Math (Floor/Ceiling, Powers, Logarithms). I understand what a log is, but feeling its impact in binary search is different.* Algorithm Principles & Efficiency (Time/Space Complexity, Big-O). Is Big O notation like a set formula? * Arrays (Operations, Insertion/Deletion)* Searching (Linear, Binary Search)* Basic Algorithms (Array Merging) I'd really appreciate any help. I'm a visual learner so if you can recommend any YouTube channels or websites that are exceptional at teaching the problem-solving process would be great.

I want to check whether this is a known limitation or something wrong in my build/integration.Target:NXP [i.MX](http://i.MX) RT1064 (1 MB internal SRAM + 4 MB Flash) on bare-metalToolchain: arm-none-eabi-gcc with newlib-nanoDisplay: 16x128 LED matrixUI: LVGL with a custom HarfBuzz text shaping hookStack: size - 64kB ; stack region: SRAM\_DTCHeap: size - 128kB ; heap region: SRAM\_OC2Libraries:FreeType 2.13.2 (static) + HarfBuzz 8.3.0 (static, Meson build)Font: NotoSansDevanagari, AnjaliOldLipi and so on as a C arrayAll threads, atomics, glib, ICU, getenv, etc. are disabled. No pthreads, no OS services.I have two build setups with very different behavior.Case 1 (non-cyclic build):I build FreeType without HarfBuzz, then build HarfBuzz with FreeType, and do NOT rebuild FreeType again with HarfBuzz enabled.Result: English text works and Indic gives me hard fault at GSUB.Case 2 (cyclic build, as described in FreeType docs):Build FreeType without HarfBuzz.Build HarfBuzz with FreeType enabled.Rebuild FreeType with HarfBuzz enabled.Result: English and Indic text breaks, hard fault or hb\_font\_destroy gives error.The fault consistently appears somewhere in the GSUB path. The backtrace usually goes through hb\_shape(), hb\_shape\_full(), hb\_shape\_plan\_execute(), hb\_ot\_shape(), and apply\_forward() in GSUB. In some runs the crash appears closer to hb\_font\_destroy(), in others during hb\_shape(), so I suspect memory corruption or an assumption violation rather than a single bad call.Important observation:When FreeType is NOT rebuilt with HarfBuzz, English works but Indic fails.When FreeType IS rebuilt with HarfBuzz, both English and Indic fail and I get a hard fault.Occasionally, I also get an access violation and I found this:[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22388899/harfbuzz-hb-shape-leads-to-access-violation)My understanding (please correct me if wrong):HarfBuzz does all shaping (GSUB/GPOS, Indic, Arabic, etc.) and FreeType loads glyphs and rasterizes them. The FreeType :left-right_arrow: HarfBuzz cyclic dependency mainly exists for auto-hinting improvements, not for shaping correctness.Since my display is a very low-resolution 16x128 LED matrix, hinting quality is not very important, but correct glyph order is.So my questions are:1. Is HarfBuzz GSUB shaping expected to work on bare-metal targets with no OS and newlib-nano?2. Is rebuilding FreeType with HarfBuzz actually required if shaping is already done by HarfBuzz?3. Are there GSUB code paths that assume stack size, libc behavior, or memory features that may not exist on embedded targets?4. How much stack and heap would be required for proper Indic rendering?I have attached an image from the IDE incase anyone wants to check.If you happen to know someone who might be familiar with this issue, I’d really appreciate it if you could share this with them.

Staying focused on long lectures is a huge problem for me, because of that I can't learn on freeCodeCamp anymore.So now I’m looking at alternatives:* Scrimba: seems interactive and video-based, which I need, but from what I've understood there are no projects where you actually get to write *everything* on your own and it's really shallow in terms of libraries and general depth* The Odin Project: To me personally it seems impossible to learn here, because there's lots and lots of text which is just a big no-no for my small clip thinking brain (thank you, tiktok).* freeCodeCamp: still amazing structure, but now mostly text-only which also makes it hard. The bite sized video lectures were perfect, but they're not there anymore.I’m not a total beginner.

1pq1jtc,software engineering at 30 — bootcamp vs community college vs online university?,Aguadecoco-bacano07,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for honest advice and different perspectives on a possible career change (or career expansion).I have a degree in International Business, but after graduating I worked in roles unrelated to my degree, so I don’t have professional experience directly connected to it. At the same time, I’ve become genuinely interested in learning programming / software engineering — not only as a potential career switch, but also as a new skill I could combine with my business background in the future and as a strong plus on my resume.Here’s my situation and my doubts:• I can’t realistically commit to a full-time traditional university (time + cost).• A bootcamp appeals to me because of the structure, guidance, accountability, and also the opportunity to meet people and network.• English is not my first language, and although I use it daily, I want to keep improving. Being in an environment where I’m pushed to communicate more in English feels like a plus.So far, I’ve started learning on my own:•freeCodeCamp•Planning to try The Odin Project nextI’m realistic about expectations:•I know a bootcamp won’t guarantee a job•I know the market is competitive•I understand I may not get hired right awayMy goal is to build real skills, start with solid foundations, and keep studying long-term. Even if I initially apply for jobs related to my original careerOne important factor is that I currently have the option to stop working for about 6 months, since my husband can support me during that time. That’s why I’m seriously considering an intensive learning path like a bootcamp, so I can fully focus during that period.I looked into Hack Reactor, but my experience has been concerning:•I was told about a full scholarship. I applied and 3 weeks later they informed it wasn’t available for now. •I pass the CCAT test, contacted them to know about the next steps. Someone told me they will contact me but is been almost a month a haven’t heard for them. Because of that, I’m unsure whether Hack Reactor — or bootcamps in general — are still an option right now.So my main questions are:1.Bootcamp vs community college vs online university — what would you recommend in 2026 for someone in my position?2.Is a bootcamp still worth it mainly for structure, foundations, and momentum?3.Are online universities that people often recommend on Reddit actually a good option?4.If you were in my situation — limited time/money, strong motivation, and a non-tech degree — what path would you choose?Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences.

After that, Go starts looking attractive because it’s fast, clean, and great for backend work. Then something else shows up… and I switch again.I’ve been doing this for a while now, and it feels like I’m trapped in a loop. I keep restarting instead of actually finishing things. I end up knowing multiple languages, but mostly at a shallow level, and I rarely ship anything I’m truly proud of.If you’ve been through something similar, how did you break out of it?

I've been doing courses for a few months now and I finished my fundamentals, starting my advances modules in January.I also decided to do an additional module for AI ML and Maths, because I am interested in it and I see how it can be valuable for me.I just started also learning in my personal time, by doing small projects like a ""To-Do"" checklist, calendar, mood tracking app with JSON data saves, learning some PyQt for the UI as well. I have plans to create automation software like an automatic maze generator and solver and etc. I've started 3Blue1Brown algebra lessons and problem solving as well.Although, I am using Claude AI to coach me additionally. I don't ask AI to write for me the code I want, but I do use AI to explain to me principles, to show me certain commands, how you call stuff, I ask about the logic. I never implement a code that I do not understand and sometimes spend hours reading on a topic an asking questions. Still, I feel a bit guilty for using AI for additional coaching, but I'm just a little slow when it comes to learning and need my own time and speed and I need a lot of freedom to ask questions - something, which is not freely available in academies and with real teachers.I am really interested in learning a lot of stuff, because I am very curious. I am curious about software development, ML, game dev, robotics, low-level languages as well and is all things I want to explore in the future step by step.

For those that do not know FDM, they do a 3-month training programme that gives you fullstack coverage, then you will go for interviews to get a placement with a client (think the usual DSA questions). In my country, the clients are banks, and the tech stack taught is Java/Spring/React. I was advised to try and start studying the course objectives as much as I can so I struggle less during the course.***Please no comments about how I shouldn't join FDM. I know where I stand in the job market, having spent about 5 months on job applications, and I'm very grateful and thrilled to receive an offer from FDM. Please just be happy for me, and help me with my journey!***I completed CS50's Python and Intro to Programming so I can code in C, Python, JavaScript (poor front end skills though), and also have started programming in Java. I have projects on my portfolio, and I am really passionate about software engineering and I've bought some books to start. The more I read online about what CS majors read, the more overwhelmed I get. Additionally, I feel the added pressure of impressing the interviewers at an interview to get the top banks (think investment banks), but that's in 3-4 months' time.These are the books I have bought so far, and have started reading:* SICP (JS Ed.) by Abelson and Sussman* The Pragmatic Programmer (20th Ann. Ed.) by Thomas and Hunt* Clean Code (4th Ed.)Then there are other books that non-CS grads have been advised to get:* Operating System Concepts (Dinosaur Book)* Compilers Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Dragon Book)* Introduction to the Theory of Computation by SipserAnd then there are books on Java and OOP:* Effective Java by Bloch* Core Java I and II by Horstmann* Head First Design Patterns by Freeman and RobsonThere are just so many books. I am VERY happy to read them because I think these are just fascinating and I enjoy reading the books I have so far... but in what order?I'm a little confused about priorities because I've heard that DSA is taught very early on at university, but doesn't actually help you much on the job. Yet, I need to have a good understanding of it for interviews. I read *Grokking Algorithms* and *Grokking Data Structures*, and those were really fun reads, but those are just general overviews and theories; they don't actually help you with coding. Then I tried Leetcode and Neetcode, and however much I do, I just struggle with understanding because the video explanations aren't that great. So.... do I actually need to read Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne? How would that affect my job? But a lot of comments online have told me that this does require some understanding of Mathematics. Other reddit posts have pointed me towards MIT's Mathematics for Programming Course (but that looks pretty long) before reading this.**tldr:*** Which order should I buy / read the books above?* Which books should I buy to get better at Java / in general?* Do I actually need to read Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne?

From the outside it’s hard to tell whether more reps naturally fix this or if people have to actively change how they approach live rounds. For those further along did your interview performance improve just by doing more of them or did you have to find ways to stay more structured while answering?,175,0.98,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1po6gtz/prep_vs_live_performance/,2025-12-16 16:32:50,2025-12-19 01:46:56

Two reasons:1) as I mentioned, I never struggled finding a job.2) when I talk to senior developers and leads in different companies, they always say: no qualified developers or current developers in the company should be fired because they are not doing their jobs well for many reasons.3) in the past 3 years, I've noticed a decline in the quality of the employees in general. They either lack skills, or they are lazy and we can't depend on them.My guesses: the location is a major factor in the availability of jobs. Outsourcing may have affected some jobs.

1ppv153,Got laid off last year for the first time in 12 years. Experienced the worst job search of my career. Here's the Sankey.,cscq_throw_away,cscareerquestions,"[2024 Job Search Sankey](https://i.redd.it/wwa5kzx1nz7g1.png)[Here’s my previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/rqpfir/the\_result\_of\_my\_passive\_job\_search\_over\_the\_past/) where I got the job I was laid off from. I was there for two and a half years and I hadn’t interviewed at all during that time. It took me four months to get an offer and I managed to get two of them in the same week. One was from an early seed stage startup and the other was Meta. I accepted Meta for more immediate TC and stability, but then I got laid off again just before hitting my year mark. I just finished interviewing again and this time the results are much better. Waiting for the last potential offer/rejection to come in before I post that Sankey. Overall the system design interviews were my biggest weakness again like in my previous search. Hellointerview helped a lot with that and I ended up paying for two mock interview sessions with them. Those are painful but worth it. Besides system design interviews, though, I got rejected a lot in the initial round for not having enough depth in particular tools. I’ve been working in developer tools and infrastructure for most of my career and a lot of places I was applying to wanted much deeper experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. I had worked with all of those at the previous two jobs I had in the 6 years prior to this search, but hadn’t really dug in deep on them and it showed in those early screens. I also got several rejections in the final rounds towards the end where the feedback was that I did very well but someone else just had a bit more relevant experience so they were getting the offer. I even had one recruiter say that the hiring manager tried to get headcount approved to extend offers to me and the other candidate but got denied and I was the second choice. Here’s the details of the two offers I did get: **Seed stage startup*** Salary: $190k* Target bonus: 10%* Equity: $88k in options* Remote**Meta*** IC5* Salary: $215k* Target bonus: 15%* RSUs: $710k over 4 years* TC: ~$425k* Hybrid 3x/week[Sankey source](https://sankeymatic.com/build/?i=IIBxBsEsFMBMAIDaA2AHAXXgOQPbwE7QDOIOAdkdAFCgQwKIDsArJgErQBW0AxgC5wqAeiHwAhkSIBXALaQyAc3Hhw8HADN4fABbRxPHtBACEYsFB5i%2BkckQLEp4E%2DHnxLKogBp4UkLCt6kJpkvMREYvgAnjTm9EgATBjwAMJiKvAA7qKEPPhSkAL4MXRwCZgA8mRQIeKSYTLQZHzFUKWIAIyYABJipuCEvZEuTdD4AG4wGaXqOPhaugQ44NS0rQzx7Lx5BaP2JOSwgqtxHZgAkmQFkGlavNqX7otSZLBUVD19A7BD8oUT0FMEDM5jo9PglnpTvAONx%2BIIqBxcvlCntSC82ht4ABxbQ4IgmN6I7YohqSMQKUoNJDtZAAFkwAHUCtpYIQMgitsjdqTwhSEFSUElUuksvYkTsikSuXMeeTKZDaUkcXiCVKJfBZXyNZD2vToVxeKrOerNfKkHrKtU9BJKJIGk0OeKSWE5fydedLtYbgIePdII9wc9XlRhapRTlibsoQAVMQAaz0uKpNsgCjI9uaocy2WNKI6AE5NrCCVnw7mo8xOvALldvXcHjdAy8Q2kwzmnVGAMyM5msgEtkXtyNzJgVKrya11O2NTOt7Ni4fU1jY3H4%2BGxhPwJOToip9MzsrwJk6PvsjeJnDJyR7jPUouGwTnreXnc3g%2BITEAMXkjZwQaoT7brUu5preULHiybLiOoKJiAYRjWIoajqOooyEtAcG6Agf58FoeAyEMIR8Bksxxne%2BrFoIHCYaUOF4RqhHQMRpHkbgqK2NQVA1l6qg%2Bn6AZ%2Di8CTIPecKvNx1y8fW%2Dq%2DkG1J6t%2BZCyc2El1r6DaqE2DDtAADJgypruJnqSbc6kyZpgkMMugEvsBb4OqpUlmQJcngb2bJccZan8cp2ljlawH1DObyWhOgXTk0SDdhRD6vKFNQ2kFkWIHqEGnlQ8U7kluEpR6tZOT5Fn%2Dpl4VEGB0WKb5byVUVQkdMuMKxVQNVPHVmJpVBYgwbscGGMY8hKBoqFFC1WnkeUKFoaNlnkdGGEyBqVi%2BgNbxzWIC0yEt2gDeNk1FBle3kcA8HGIIE3DeRAAivBWsGABcjVifAADEyTJDpH06VQd1sYQ%2BwUHoz2MLSwPA99pZDtKL0AEbMDwtLxIw30dQCL35vmqDqIwnbfcdfXOM9H2fp%2BH3feduyEzpPD5qTd2OaZhWtQglO0swtPTXJlOMLAtPXTwt0vR9CO0yjGTQbBJ2IYNh3PYcYg0%2DmuOxKUlOfV9D0Yb6tFSLhfD4YxzH4GRqufd9arOmSWpUibtMlYlEW4c9nbxNDnY6Ujd0GQTyDc8g0DqzZV4gfukVOy7btI7uABeehi%2B0%2BbxF9W7wLpqBfZt%2BAKK4qjtPEVAECnedaCnqD59D8CJ1Q0NKDwSyzC9KGN%2Bo%2Bd8PgYgUCAEQHlgVBkDghyZIX%2BfaPAbP5yQcE7SwZezIccxJ6Cyb57X4D189qAb5v%2Bc4J3PAFEM7RUOoq9izwUjjFY596DpAB0zD5%2DIuj4AU6jggtfARBSzRuHXczPejADFZqF3vveAt9WZUHAGISIdFZ49R1peKw%2Dp86cCkPiIIMDn5ZwoNgFBaDrDqEiI0WAdge72DGKMSgCg24gBHmQqwH9lpkFrjICATFiB63gCELu%2BJIFiGhtAcAdgV5rzVqTLckAB5kO2gobQUBZG4VvtPeAMwmjqDgnocIFAAC0lBn7N3gFaCee8kK3yLoQKB1gKHRz0O0XS%2BdNppgwSnUmUCBHgCUsmMAGF8B2AAJrj0gDHFOyB85TFTNoXCtJXH8MEWMNIUhrTeIiP4%2DO6hHDgBADkSAu5yDwACfAUgu5rB5PcTgdkmRoARKiTE9xRSrh5LEAgtIe4wHjy1smBBaTIC%2BNwgI4E1B4DQwGHGUgvwK5fXieARJKjZibVwgAck8DfBZ%2BcsnQHUJAAAHvABZqz4DSBQts3ZqzF7QCGpQXCYh4ChKGW0tw9yEDpyYtcjMNgKDtwTJEeZ%2Dp8n5ygOgmQ0M0jt0MKkmQOAKHwGOKUbRt8dK6R0swbwcKb66niCDKgEKoW%2DWIGiSgYCb5Ip0p2fMKLb66WYLSLFkK9Dm25C6K2ehtHtDvp2ZAyBvAUpBtS7FdLNZYTUDreiBEuFMRIkbQlH12ioGRfAVFnZUCJBxnylIc4ywdjmKitO8R8ztC5WihFOk86qrtlOMqB5UXMHzMwZAnZyU3zdgik1tLqxeQKhpJm8rb7WvZfEA18R44%2BxpVCr2pR4U2vzLSA17RGAIvvqq0W4seqSx2kNXYqK7HxFtTG5AGND6qo5kJBVMrs0Gp0nqzsvLXWB1fKBS14DaT5kVQGukjBQmqses4eF7Qq3lsVcwF1UKk3worS2qVaBEghr0OTLV8LkAVrlai41iRS6qrxghcNRKkXsodanZgCbXV8wFqOn2DqdKs3aIeqFHxlBfB%2BCMcYkxpj11BIsZY3qb60jzagaNn6PqJEVqqtaG0to7UzagTs1rz0XtQAW119K5h%2DTRIcBAqLkDxE7O2h1aBkDWqAA)EDIT: Explaining my terrible labels: * Withdrew after accepting offer: I used this for the companies I withdrew from once I accepted Meta's offer.* Rejected: means the company rejected me at some point* Ghosted: the recruiter stopped responding to me without an outright rejection* Call w/ recruiter: Only used this if it was the first step before anything else after either applying or getting their email or LinkedIn message.

I rarely see any that are entry level and when I do I never get a response. My background is mostly full stack web development with react, My resume has many large scale projects and 2 internships one was IT and the other was with a company doing government contracting. Here's the main issue:I have zero desire to grind leetcode or interview questions (frankly burnt out from this sort of stuff when it already feels hopeless applying). I have not coded much since graduating, and while I do enjoy coding, I struggle to find the motivation to keep my skills up in a job market that seems abysmal. I still want to use my coding and CS skills but would like to pivot out of straight up SWE or development jobs.I've considered creating my own digital products to sell, starting my own business, maybe going into IT, and more. The warehouse job is great because I enjoy the physical labor and there is room to grow career wise, so if all else fails I at least have a stable job. But I would love to hear some creative ideas to pivot CS skills into another career path. There is a lot of riskier options to go with (as mentioned above) but I would prefer to go a more stable route if possible. I'm open to any and all ideas. Small sidebar: I have no college debt and good savings. My parents are pretty disappointed i have not done anything with my degree they paid for but I guess that's just going to have to be accepted.

1pm2wb0,Jobs outside of SWE?,saddam_cobain,cscareerquestions,"My question is, what CS jobs aren't as cooked as SWE? Job market wise that is. I feel like everything I see online is how bad the job market is for SWE's, and the only hopeful posts are ones about how the job itself is changing. I personally would rather not work in the field if the job truly becomes something akin to managing a team of AI agents. If I'm building something I want to actually build the thing. The degree I'm currently pursuing is in Data Science and the curriculum is still basically the same thing as a normal CS degree except a bit more math. I did this with the hope that the data science job market would be a bit better, but even now I'm hearing that the market is becoming over flooded. One might also think that MLE would be the way to go since that's what's taking over jobs right? But similar to DS I hear that those jobs are changing rapidly and are flooded with applicants. There's not as much need to custom train a model from scratch so most just use API's for the big names. It seems like the only jobs holding up are more Sys Admin and general cyber security roles. Personally, that realm isn't my thing and I'd much rather be programming something even if it's just a couple lines of SQL and Python. Is programming really just dead? At least in the way that it once was? I'm only 18 also, so I'm sure my view is just a bit too narrow. I'm sure that a lot of sectors are feeling this as well. I think just with AI being the new big thing and Computer Science jobs being so adjacent to this new advancement that we catch a lot of the heat because of it.For context on who I am, I'm an undergrad student at a T100. My high school offered free CompTIA certs, so I have the A+, Network+, and Security +. I've been programming since high school, and I did a software dev competition where I placed 5th nationally. I also worked essentially a help desk job my senior year of hs as well.If anyone has SWE adjacent jobs please let me know! Either just ones in general or ones that fit my experience.

1pn21vj,"Should I ""rat out"" the lazy developer?",vandeveloper,cscareerquestions,"Edit: Yes, my coworkers’ lazy and irresponsible attitude is affecting me. For example:User story 1 is assigned to me and person A. Person A did not finish his part and did not tell manager. And then he went on a trip and didnot answer his phone. Then manager made us (me and Person C) work overtime to cover person A's part to meet deadline. I had to “transfered” parts of the task to Person C so he can shared the workload that person A left. Juggling between coding and communication/transferring knowledge and Q&A with another dev really made me unable to focus. Also I was being questioned nonstop and pressured by managers to finish quickly and it worsened my mood and life quality due to pressure and unbalance work hours.User story 2 is assigned to me and person B. Person B didnt really care and did a bad job, and I had to review and corrected his mistake, because I knew in the end if the task isnt done, then I will have to work overtime or being questioned and pressured again. Managers only looked at the surface and whenever theres something not meet deadline, he assigned other members of the team to cover the lackluster member. I don’t know what they do to the particular member in the dark and it is not disclosed.Original:Hi guys, I wonder if theres some coworker that I have to team with and he is either lazy or irresponsible, should I tell the manager or not.I feel like if I always tell the manager, then it would look like I am the problem, who can not work with anyone and always badmouth.Also it may not be wise, since we might have the same paycheck but I am working with all my effort, and someone else is slacking of at work and have more time and energy for his personal life. I'm afraid I will somehow “raise the bar” for expectation and makes all the developers suffer under the already exploitative system.But if I kinda “side with him” and relax, the task will be late or has not very good quality.

1po8gk0,5th Month of Unemployment and Still No Job,ViTaLC0D3R,cscareerquestions,"I graduated university in December 2022. After interning at my former company for about a year, I was hired full-time, working on federal healthcare contracts for the HHS. In August of this year, I was laid off after the federal government canceled all the contracts I was working on, and there were no other positions available for me. I had been at the company full-time for almost three years before being laid off.I have been applying for jobs for almost five months now, and I have had no success. Most of the time, I do not even get interviews. When I do get interviews, I have reached the final round at Meta but did not get an offer. The same happened with Fanatics. At IBM, I failed the first programming interview after the coding assessment. I was interviewing for a C++ role but had limited experience. I have also interviewed for three local roles and made it to the final round in all of them.The only feedback I have received came from my two most recent interviews. For Company A, they said I did not perform well in the programming project during the interview because I focused on new Java features. However, they also said positive things. They thought I had the right culture fit and technical skill, but I lacked experience in DevOps, which I believe was not part of the job description, and I was relatively slow. For Company B, they said, ""We do not think your skillset is the best fit for the fundamental development tasks that will be our primary focus in the months ahead.""My experience at my former employer was mainly with legacy systems, which is typical for government contracts. We used AWS for the entire system: ECS, RDS (Oracle SQL), DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3. But all the backend code, where I worked full-stack, was in Java 8, later upgraded to Java 21, SpringMVC (no Spring Boot), Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, SVN, and Git. The frontend consisted of JSPs that loaded XML files with vanilla JS, Bootstrap, and jQuery, along with CSS and HTML.It seems many companies are looking for reactive websites, which I have no experience with, or Spring Boot and more modern tech stacks. I am getting almost no interviews, and the process can take a month or more just to end in rejection. I know the job market is very difficult right now, but this is taking a serious mental toll on me. I already have disabilities and mental health issues, and I feel like my life and career are falling apart. I do not have skills for ""normal"" non-tech roles, and I do not know what to do. I know the obvious advice is to improve my resume and interviewing skills, but at some point, even getting an interview feels completely random, and the same goes for the interviews themselves.EDIT: Resume https://imgur.com/a/j1UZQnQ",62,0.91,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1po8gk0/5th_month_of_unemployment_and_still_no_job/,2025-12-16 17:47:30,2025-12-19 01:46:56

1plvgdj,Capital One TDP vs AT&T TDP - New Grad Software Engineer Offer Guidance,mrgenius17,cscareerquestions,"Hello Community,Fortunate enough to have received two Entry Level Software Engineer offers from these companies. Looking for your guidance on which will be better to start my career with.Long Term Goals (at least as of now):Work at a bigger, more respectable Company. Either Big Tech or Fin-Tech (like Bloomberg).Get an MBA from a respectable institution (like Top 20), since my undergrad is a no-name school. Intuition behind getting an MBA is I like software, but I also like the business side of things. MBA obviously also helps with getting a promotion to the business side of things. I will probably pursue the MBA part-time while working full-time.Capital One TDP, McLean, VA (DC Metro Area):Base: 130k, One Time Bonuses (Sign-on + Relocation): 30k, Target Bonus (3600)Pros and Cons will of course be a bit team-dependent, I know a Senior Engineer there who 'might' be able to help with team-matching when the time comes. Team has not been assigned yet; they will match us later.TDP Rotations are 1 year and then 6 months, for a total of 18 months. I do not know about the conversion rate from TDP to full-time.Pros:Bigger Name and a more tech-focused company.TCDC Metro Area(?): Plenty of companies in the DC Metro Area to switch to in case things goes sideways. Amazon, Google, Gov Contracting, Consulting.Hybrid Schedule: 3 days in office, 2 days remoteCons:Stack Ranking and PIP Culture: Around 10% of the staff is laid off every 6 months.Performance Review Method: Performance is evaluated every 6 months, and historical performance does not matter in the next cycle.Worth mentioning: Everyone is judged on a scale of 1-5, and as long as you can stay at 3 or above, you are fine.DC Cost of Living is very high, so not sure how far the higher TC will go.I will have to switch sooner or later (unless there's a miracle and I find a great team environment there).AT&T TDP, Atlanta, GA:Base: 90k, One-Time Bonus (Sign-on): 5k, Target Bonus: 10k.TDP rotations are 1 years each for 2 years. Getting placed full-time in a team after TDP is pretty much guaranteed.This is an intern return offer, so I have pretty good rapport with the managers there. I believe I will have a say in the team matching so I end up with a team whose work seems interesting to me.Pros:Chill work environment, very low chances of PIP/layoff.When I interned there, everyone including the managers were really nice.Good rapport with TDP management means getting placed on a good (or at least interesting) team.Chill work environment means I can coast there while getting a Masters in CS from Georgia Tech (part-time) that might help with employability in the future. Georgia Tech name is pretty strong in tech so that would work in my favor.Atlanta also has a lot of companies there to switch to like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Blackrock.Cons:5 days in-office (haven't worked remote in my life so I don't really mind this)Lower TC (?): Atlanta's cost of living is much lesser.Legacy Organization (?): This might play a part when trying to switch.Please help me navigate this. Are there any factors I am not considering or giving enough importance to?My primary thoughts were the TC difference is pretty huge to not be considering Capital One, although in a high CoL area. More tech-focused company. But that comes at the cost of being on your toes all the time, in an unstable market.Would you rather be in the DC Metro Area or in Atlanta?

1pkntlv,Looking to make a list of non-toxic tech companies,parleG_OP,cscareerquestions,"With all the doom and gloom in the tech industry right now, I wanted to hear from this community. What companies do you think are actually good places to work? I’m not talking about top-tier compensation or perks like free food or rides. I mean places where the work feels meaningful, you’re treated with basic respect, you can spend time with your family, and you’re not at risk of getting laid off at the snap of a finger.It feels like in the last 15 years, getting a high paying tech job has become part of people’s identities. The tradeoff is that a lot of us have lost touch with what it means to live a full life, where work is part of life instead of the whole thing. Hobbies, friends, family time, just being a human being. All of that gets pushed aside for the grind.I made the mistake of opening TeamBlind today and that place is a mess. Everything is about who has it worse, who has it better, or people endlessly hyping trillion-dollar companies like it’s their entire reason for being.I don’t expect big tech to magically grow a heart. At the end of the day, these are businesses. So in the spirit of keeping it real, I’d love for people to share workplaces where the culture is actually decent. I’m tired of seeing the 200th post about how terrible Amazon’s culture is. If someone wants a better life, they probably won’t find it in the belly of the beast.To be clear, this isn’t about discouraging anyone from aiming for MAANG if that’s what they want. Go for it. I just want to build a thread where people can say, here are the companies where you can have a career without sacrificing your entire life chasing something you never quite catch. Note : I'm aware that not all top tech companies are toxic, and it greatly depends on the team, please share those as well.",31,0.79,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pkntlv/looking_to_make_a_list_of_nontoxic_tech_companies/,2025-12-12 09:36:07,2025-12-19 01:46:56

I have been applying to roles since January of 25' but it wasn't until August ish that I actually had a decent resume with Full Stack projects, 2 hackathons(including a 3rd place overall), I did a small internship at my school where I used Wordpress. I then also launched a startup solo, I have about 10 non paying users but hopefully it keeps growing. At the same time I have been doing freelance work, from landing pages to SaaS stuff. I have also been networking a lot, been present in almost all cs school events. I got referrals for Microsoft and other local companies(no luck). All while applying to 50 ish jobs per week since April-May.I have only been able to do like 5 phone screenings, a few follow up interviews, 1 technical at a startup and a final non-technical round at a f500 company but for a web marketing role(no leetcode). I have great soft skills and a lot of projects I can talk about so that is really not an issue for me. I have been griding leetcode on and off and I hate it too but what can we do.

Because of that, I still don’t have a solid grasp on what the full-time role would feel like day to day. I also didn’t love the overall Amazon culture, which makes me a bit hesitant about returning.Location is another factor. I’m from NYC and very used to walkability and easy access to everything. Seattle seems closer to that lifestyle, while San Jose feels much more suburban. I’m trying to figure out how much that should weigh into my decision since I plan to move back to NYC eventually.I’m also unsure which role sets me up better long-term (prestige/growth).

1pq35jn,How to accept someone on the team who slacks off,aihaode,cscareerquestions,"There is someone on my team who is more experienced than me, but seriously slacks off.They have made serious errors (always privately to me) and revealed how little they know about our systems.Their output is ridiculously small. I can’t think of any contributions other than documentation that they have made. Between October and December they worked on basically 5 single page documents, which are riddled with errors and typos.We have daily stand ups every day, but out of everyone this person misses it the most. With no explanation.They sometimes have 10 tickets assigned to them but in their update only update on 1 ticket. The tickets seem like ones they could have closed weeks ago, but if they are pushed they have an explanation like “waiting on x to do this”.It’s all smoke and mirrors with them.When they did have a task 10 months ago, I helped them so much with it, and it really bothered me bc it wasted so much time. Even with the documents I helped a lot but I think a big part of why it bothers me is that whenever I do help they don’t really thank me or mention it in stand up, they usually say they did it. They also debate with me about the information I’m giving them.

1pomo0k,My 2025 as a college senior has been quite sobering and I don't even know what to expect going forward,MarathonMarathon,cscareerquestions,"January to May 2025 was a bit bittersweet. Was a college junior at the time, and I had just molded my resume into something semi-satisfactory after sticking a bunch of school projects onto it. I had pretty much locked in with applying to tech-adjacent roles like data analysis at this point, and was prioritizing local companies. I kept applying through the spring, long after many might've given up or accepted offers. And while most of the internships I'd applied to were duds, a few did reach out to me. None of them were really technical, and yet I managed to fail many of those. For some I feel like I came painfully close to an acceptance, only for the door to be slammed in my face never to be opened again.Come May, I was at wits end, and dreading the possibility of having to work at my church friend's father's store and get paid in cash for the second summer in a row. But eventually, I found a company which onboarded me at the last second for the summer. Their office wasn't far from where I lived, so things did go smoothly. Unfortunately, though, they didn't give me a return offer even though they were satisfied with my performance.For this fall I've landed a tech job through my school's research department that pays like 16 an hour. And while I've received glowing reviews for this, it's just through the school. In the meantime I've applied to a few tech jobs, and have even secured a few interviews. My resume looks a lot better now than it might've 1 year ago, people have reviewed it and told me that I'm well qualified for new grad. And yet, I'm like the world's worst interviewer. One guy ended the interview 10 minutes in because he didn't like my responses. Another gave up on me despite me being a referral. I've failed an OA they were asking for a ""winter help desk intern"" even though it's literally help desk.The last month of class I didn't even apply to anything at all, it was just depressing. I just feel like an idiot. I haven't leetcoded in ages, and if you throw LC at me right now I'll probably fail at it miserably. You can do everything with AI nowadays so that's literally what I've been doing for some of my work, like come on even many companies are doing it. I don't even want to leetcode. I don't even want to work. Some days I literally just want to sleep forever, to tell the truth. Once I literally ranted to some of the people on campus so badly after bombing one of these interviews that they had the cops called on me and forced me to go to the hospital to make sure I wasn't planning on unaliving myself.Hopefully I can lock in well enough to land something by the time I graduate may 2026. But something tells me I'm probably not. And if I don't the battle will just grow more and more uphill. You literally cannot afford to live life unless you're at the top of the world. The sooner I leave my shitty parents the better, but the world is conspiring to hate me so badly that they're probably going to force me to live with them for the rest of my life and probably even die with them. It's like the curse of unbinding from minecraft.I absolutely hate all of this, and I'm going to absolutely hate next semester of college because it'll be my last, and I'll have to do and go through with all the routines and actions knowing it'll soon be over which'll just ruin the fun. To paraphrase Calvin and Hobbes, it's like trying to enjoy one's final meal before the execution. I'll have spent what's supposed to be the best time of my life to get a boy/girlfriend and exit it without one. Who the fuck is going to date me if I'm flipping burgers since it's the only job I'll be able to find even with a degree in CS, or if I'm stuck living with my parents in an unwalkable typical American suburb because it's the only home I can afford?Honestly, if the world is going to hate me, I might as well hate the world.",10,0.78,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pomo0k/my_2025_as_a_college_senior_has_been_quite/,2025-12-17 03:52:12,2025-12-19 01:46:56

Performance reviews are strong (“exceeds expectations”), but there’s essentially no room for advancement or technical growth. Long-term, my goal is to land a FAANG / FAANG-adjacent role targeting \~$300k+ TC, and I’m willing to extend my time horizon to get there.**Background:*** Bachelor’s degree in a *non-CS* field, earned \~13 years ago with a poor GPA* Previously made \~$138k at another non-tech company, but was laid off in April 2024* Didn’t land my current role until August 2024* Currently working in a consultant-style role across two projects**Current role details (and why I’m concerned):*** Main project is an R Shiny dashboard with a bloated but functional frontend* Backend is Python scripts in Azure Data Factory + Azure SQL (tables/views/stored procs)* I inherited the project after the original developer left* I’ve successfully: * Troubleshot pipeline failures * Added new dashboard features * Managed stakeholder relationships independentlyThat said, I feel like my *actual* technical fundamentals are eroding. I’ve leaned far too heavily on ChatGPT to do my coding, to the point where I’d describe myself as a “prompt engineer” rather than a strong engineer (and yes - I used ChatGPT to help me write this post, lol). There’s:* Zero technical mentorship* A disengaged manager (old-school DBA, 20+ years at the company)* No push toward system design, algorithms, or deeper CS conceptsI want out of this role in the near term (ideally back closer to my previous comp), but beyond that I want to **rebuild my foundation properly in a structured environment**. Self-study hasn’t worked well for me — I do better with accountability, deadlines, and external structure.**Mental health context:** The layoff last year triggered a rough bout of depression/anxiety. I’m currently medicated and in therapy, and things are stable now. I’m trying to be realistic and intentional about my next steps instead of reacting out of panic.**My questions:*** Does it make sense to take CS fundamentals courses at a community college to demonstrate readiness and improve my chances for something like **Georgia Tech’s OMSCS**?* Is a formal CS master’s actually a good path for someone in my position aiming for high-end tech roles, or would I be better served focusing on: * LeetCode + system design * Targeted projects * Switching to a more technically rigorous job first?* For someone mid-career with weak formal CS fundamentals but real-world experience, what’s the *highest leverage* way to move forward?I’m not looking for shortcuts — I’m okay with a multi-year plan if it’s the right one.

1pok4iq,Sketchy employer sent technical assessment?,elementx1525,cscareerquestions,"I recently applied to a job on LinkedIn that I'm beginning to think is not legitimate somehow. The role is for a remote junior SWE position, and the listing seemed like any other one I've come across on the site. I hadn't heard of the company before, but I quickly scanned their website to check for legitimacy before applying. I heard back from the company about a week later asking if I was interested in completing a quick assessment via interview questions. I was so excited to finally hear back about a potential role so I emailed them back within an hour. Let's call the guy that I'm emailing with Ron.Ron's email wanted me to reply YES if I was interested in the assessment. I haven't seen this before, but I brushed it off as just a little odd. I responded with a YES, and a few hours later, I got another email from Ron with the interview questions attached in an .rtf file. He gave a little blurb about how there are no right answers and the test is to gauge if my skills and approach to the role are a good fit. He let me know that I could reach out with any questions if I had them and wished me luck on the assessment. This was on Friday.I browsed the \~20 questions of the assessment so I could be prepared and started brushing up on some of the topics. They seemed like very normal questions for a junior SWE role. Explain the difference between these two technologies, some DSA, some behavioral, etc. Nothing strange other than an address by their logo at the top that I looked up. It's for a big office building in a major US city that had no record of them having a space in.I completed the assessment over the course of the weekend and emailed Ron back first thing Monday morning. To my surprise, he got back to me within half an hour of my response. He told me that he received my message and that their team will review my answers, then forward them to the hiring board for their decision. He said I'd hear back from him when a decision is made and asked me to acknowledge I received his email. I sent him a message back thanking him for his acknowledgement, and said I looked forward to hearing back. This is where things go downhill.I went to the company's site again to find some more information. Unlike the first time I looked around, this time I was closely reading the information on the site and clicking around. The first thing that raised an alarm was how unprofessional their about us section is. It has a really long run-on sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with three exclamation marks. This prompted me to do a real deep dive on them.After more time on their site, things really started to unravel. Social media buttons that link to nothing. Those buttons you see on the bottom of most web pages about privacy policy, ad choices, etc? All lead to blank pages. Inconsistencies with spacing and grammar. An address that looks to be a residential home in Canada. A portfolio page that has a nice flashy intro, but nothing else. Nothing on the site is selectable text. All very strange for a company that supposedly provides tech solutions.Then I did some research on Google. They have only a few people affiliated with them on LinkedIn, only 2 of which are people have any sort of information about themselves. One is a guy who seems to be a real software developer, complete with a personal website and a lively GitHub. Another is a woman who allegedly started working there years ago as a PM, but only just a few weeks ago posted an update sharing that she started there. She lists herself as still working there, but also has another current job listed. The other people affiliated with the company have no profile picture or anything, but I did find out one of them is Ron because he has a very distinct tagline that came up when I looked up his name as well.Multiple websites that report company information list them as having fewer than 10 employees, most of which are located in Canada or Africa. The company is credited as the designer and developer on a few dozen sites that I can find, but most of them seem to be associated with one specific church in one way or another. They do have a few social media accounts with not much on them. Also, the page for the LinkedIn posting I applied to is gone. Not marked as filled, but entirely gone.I'm just so confused about this whole thing. It seems so sketchy. But why send over a technical assessment if it's a scam? Why put up so many fake sites? It seems like a lot of effort just to get some data. Unless they're going even further and will try to offer people employment to get their bank data and/or social security number. Is this really how far scammers are going now? I'm already exhausted enough looking for an entry-level SWE role in 2025, I don't need scams that look this believable at surface level to waste my time.What do you all think? Has anyone seen anything like this before?TL;DR- I applied to a company for a junior SWE role and they sent over a technical assessment. After doing more research on them, I'm not sure if they are legit due to some sketchiness and inconsistencies.EDIT: Yeah it turned out to be a fake check scam as everyone was saying. There is at least 1 other person I’ve seen post about it with the same story. Now I’m not worried to say the name of the company, it’s Velte Technology Solutions.

Any insights in that regard would be appreciated as well!Edit: if it matters, provided compensation info:* Shield AI: $125k-$175k base + equity + bonus* Castelion: $130k-$185k base + equity",6,0.87,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1poa78e/defense_tech_in_dallas/,2025-12-16 18:52:56,2025-12-19 01:46:56
1pnaq2y,Should I switch jobs for higher pay even if the tech stack is completely new ?,Mjz11,cscareerquestions,"So I *might* get an offer from a new company which would pay me better (a solid increase in salary). I've passed the technical interviews and later this week I'll have a behavioral interview which would be the final one. Note that this would be my first ever job change.Now *IF* I do get the offer, I'm kinda unsure whether to take it or not, for 2 reasons:1- My backend stack is mostly Node.js/.NET, with AWS for cloud. The new company uses Python with FastAPI and GCP, both of which I have no prior experience in.I'm not scared to learn new things however I don't know if having so many different languages and tech stacks will make my resume look all over the place, cause i already have bullet points highlighting my work with React, Next.js, React Native, Express, Fastify, .NET, AWS... So I feel like adding completely new things like Python, FastAPI, GCP... Will make me seem all over the place.2- I would be switching from a startup to another startup, and this time it's not a tech based startup. I think the engineering team consists of like 2 or 3 people only.However it would be a pretty good jump in payment, what do you guys think ?For context, I'm 20 and have been at my current job for around 1.5 years.",5,0.73,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pnaq2y/should_i_switch_jobs_for_higher_pay_even_if_the/,2025-12-15 15:49:34,2025-12-19 01:46:56
1pmwnk2,Would it be a mistake to do a research-based MS in CS (robotics/AI) given the state of tech right now?,adad239_,cscareerquestions,"I am planning to pursue a research-based Master’s in Computer Science focused on robotics and AI, and I want some honest perspectives given the current state of the tech industry.My goal is to build a career in robotics and AI R&D or engineering, working on cutting-edge technology like autonomous vehicles, humanoid robotics, embodied AI, perception, planning, and control. I am not interested in generic software engineering or web or app development. I want to work on challenging problems and contribute to advancing the state of the art in intelligent systems that interact with the physical world.What I am trying to understand is whether this path still makes sense right now. The tech job market is rough, and robotics and AI roles are competitive and limited compared to general CS jobs. Many of the roles I am interested in seem to prefer or require a strong research background, and sometimes a PhD, which is why I am considering a research-focused master’s instead of a coursework-only degree.",4,0.67,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pmwnk2/would_it_be_a_mistake_to_do_a_researchbased_ms_in/,2025-12-15 02:55:51,2025-12-19 01:46:56

1pkj7mx,Next Bubble Predictions & Advice/Tips,br_234,cscareerquestions,"So I've seen and heard about this AI bubble but wanted to see what other people think what will happen. I mean I was alive during the dot com and housing market bubble but I was just a kid (I'm 27 now). So those that have been in the tech industry for a while and experienced or seen the last big bubbles, what do you think will happen?I'm curious but also preparing for a backup since I'm in tech right now (IBM consulting). I'm already looking for other software roles but having serious difficulty like everyone else. My current ""backup"" is to switch to IT/Cyber like a help desk job. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering but don't think I can get a job in that since it's been 5 years since I graduated.

1ppyltc,"People who have worked for pre-funding startups, what are some red flags to watch out for?",Strupnick,cscareerquestions,"I'm interviewing with a start up and have some questions about the things I learned. There are two founders, one who lives in South Asia and the other in the US. Both have extensive experience in their respective fields. The new field is half related to one of the founder's fields.During the interview, I learned:* Pre-funding and pay is equity based until seed round* Planning to present an MVP to investors* Hiring a couple junior developers with promise of mentorship, hiring a senior to lead the team, and hiring a CTO to oversee the whole thing* No equipment can be provided until funding (except any digital development tooling)* The hours are part time, 5 - 10 hours a week* Promise of full time employment when funding is securedI know almost nothing about startups and how they work but I was under the impression that they pitched their idea to investors before hiring engineering teams. I understand that the full time employment bit is not a guarantee due to funding misses or just wanting more experienced developers. I'm a little worried about developing company code on my personal device. Would that pierce the corporate veil and open my computer to being confiscated?That being said, I would be excited to get in on the ground floor of a startup and help build the product from scratch. The hours are flexible and we can work at any time we feel like as long as our weekly tasks are completed. What are your guys thoughts on that? Typical for this early stage or should I run for the hills? What questions should I be asking to get a better picture? How can I protect myself going into this?

1ppbqaw,Need advice on how to pivot in my career,Mmk1016,cscareerquestions,"Hi all - I’ve been at a very small 1M ARR startup for 8+ years as a Technical Support Engineer/ Head of Support (head meaning only me). No CS degree, and while I can troubleshoot API’s, DNS, HTML/CSS/Javascript, I am nowhere near a true dev role. We were a small team to begin with, but after the layoffs I am the only one left outside of the founders. Atleast 1 founder has gone back to a 9-5 to pull in more $$$ for the startup. Outside of support, I’ve taken on the roles of success, onboarding, marketing, demos, design, and the day to day operations. Given that I don’t have anyone I’m managing, is that a hinderance to a Senior Support Engineer/Manager at a bigger company? Are there any other roles outside of support that I can pivot into? I’m very overwhelmed with what steps to even take next since I haven’t interviewed in years. Any advice/referrals is appreciated.",5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ppbqaw/need_advice_on_how_to_pivot_in_my_career/,2025-12-17 23:35:22,2025-12-19 01:46:56
