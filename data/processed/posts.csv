1pqqnmp,Realization that I may be a mid-level engineer at best,I_Blame_DevOps,dataengineering,"Hey r/dataengineering, Feeling a bit demoralized today and wondering if anyone else has come to a similar realization and how they dealt with it. Approximately 6 months ago I left a Sr. DE job on a team of 5 to join a startup as their sole data engineer. The last job I was at for 4.5 years and helped them create reliable pipelines for \~15 sources and build out a full QC process that all DEs followed, created code standards + CI/CD that linted our code and also handled most of the infrastructure for our pipelines. During this time I was promoted multiple times and always had positive feedback. Cut to my current job where I have been told that I am not providing enough detail in my updates and that I am not specific enough about what went wrong when fixing bugs or encountering technical challenges. And - the real crux of the issue - I failed to deliver on a project after 6 months and they have of course wanted to discuss why the project failed. For context the project was to create a real time analytics pipeline that would update client reporting tables. I spent a lot of time on the infrastructure to capture the changes and started running into major challenges when trying to reliably consume the data and backfill data.We talked through all of the challenges that I encountered and they said that the main theme of the project they picked up on was that I wasn't really ""engineering"" in that they felt I was just picking an approach and then discovering the challenges later. Circling back to why I feel like maybe I'm just a mid-level engineer, in every other role I've been in I've always had someone more senior than me that understood the role. I'm wondering if I'm not actually senior material and can't actually do this role solo. Anyways, thanks for reading my ramble and let me know if you've found yourself in a similar position.",315,0.97,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pqqnmp/realization_that_i_may_be_a_midlevel_engineer_at/,2025-12-19 17:15:29,2025-12-26 01:47:28

1pqxp2n,How are you exposing “safe edit” access to business users without giving them the keys to the warehouse?,nagel393,dataengineering,"Curious how other teams are handling this, because I have seen a few versions of the same problem now.Pattern looks like this:* Warehouse or DB holds the “real” data* Business / ops / support teams need to fix records, update statuses, maybe override a few fields* Nobody wants to give them direct access in Snowflake/BigQuery/Postgres or let them loose in dbt modelsI have seen a bunch of approaches over the years:* old-school: read-only views + “send us a ticket to change anything”* Excel round-trips that someone on the data team turns into SQL* custom internal web apps that a dev built once and now everyone is scared to touch* more recently: low-code / internal tool builders like Retool, Appsmith, UI Bakery, Superblocks, etc, sitting in front of the warehouse or APIsRight now I am leaning toward the “small internal app in front of the data” approach. We are experimenting with a builder instead of rolling everything from scratch, partly to avoid becoming a full-time CRUD developer.UI Bakery is one of the tools we are trying at the moment because it can sit on-prem, talk to our DB and some OpenAPI-described services, and still give non-technical users a UI with roles/permissions. Too early to call it perfect, but it feels less scary than handing out SQL editors.Curious what the rest of you are doing:* Do you let business users touch warehouse data at all, or is everything ticket-driven?* If you built a portal / upload tool / internal UI, did you go custom code or something like Retool / Appsmith / UI Bakery / similar?* Any “we thought this would be fine, then someone updated 50k rows by mistake” stories you are willing to share?Trying to find a balance between safety, governance and not spending my whole week building yet another admin panel.",82,0.96,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pqxp2n/how_are_you_exposing_safe_edit_access_to_business/,2025-12-19 22:02:58,2025-12-26 01:47:28

1pqdjh9,Left DE Before Even Getting a Job,HarvesterOfReveries,dataengineering,"Just sharing my story here, not a successful one. I was trying to switch from legacy backend dev at a government organization to a DE role. Did relevant projects, learned a lot, but no luck. I was comfortable working with python, docker, a few frameworks like Airflow, Spark, Dagster, DBT etc. and of course git and Java + a few tools that nobody uses in DE from the job that I was doing.Did about 100 applications, spending a fair bit of time tweaking applications to match every job that I applied to. Did not apply for stuff that I wasn't interested in. Got pretty much nothing.I did however also applied to a few software dev roles too. Ended up landing one and got incredibly lowballed but I was so tired of my previous job, I had to take it like an idiot.Well, started the new job and the work was pretty fun. But colour me surprised, the thing that pushed me out from the previous job wasn't the culture or the work just being boring, it was the cycle. I'm only 26 and honestly, I can't imagine working 9-5 until I turn 50 or 60. I'm drafting up some ideas, learning and researching what's required to create products on my own. Once I'm confident enough in an idea and the progress, I'll probably quit. Or get fired because I'm distracted. Staying for a few for months because of financial constraints.Anybody else have similar experiences? I find it so weird that I was so interested in DE just a year ago, still confident that I can perform well in it, but completely lost interest to put in the effort because in the end I know I'll just get paid peanuts for the actual amount of work I'll do (pay in my country is garbage). The only thing that might change this would be life changing compensation, but obviously that requires much more prep that I don't know if I have the time for (or the ability for that matter). Even that wouldn't be a sustainable way out of this dumb rotten week cycle we humans invented for ourselves. Work like a mchine for 5 days and be tired for the rest of the day after work? Recover from that shit for 2 days and then get back to it again? Fuck. That.Thanks for listening to my rant, please share your own thoughts, because obviously there's lots of people who enjoy what they do and have much more ""work endurance"" than me.

1pr9fxu,Snowflake Openflow a bittersweet experience soo far,Defiant_Month_497,dataengineering,"Just wanted to share my experience with Snowflake Openflow. The client i work for relies heavily on CDC replication for their data ingestion to snowflake. We mainly bring in data from SQL server and oracle database to our snowflake data lake.Our client is using many different ETL tools mainly Firvetran's HVR, IICS and AWS DMS and in some cases snowpipe when they want to ingest data from s3 to snowflake. When snowflake announced openflow which supports CDC replication we were excited. Out of the box it was supporting SQL Server CDC replication and Oracle connector was soon to be released. We were very excited as our client wanted to move away from IICS and HVR due to licensing costs. We immediately started working on a POC when the openflow was available in private preview.POC Area: - CDC based replication from SQL Server to snowflake. Its fairly very easy to setup the connectors and start using it. We were able to configure the connectors and start ingesting the data within couple of hours and mind you none of us had used apache nifi before. Pros: - 1. easy to setup and use.2. Replication latency is pretty low. Plus it can be configured as well to fit your use case. Cons: - 1. Cannot configure target snowflake schema : - biggest downside we have found out yet. We were using the default workflow for SQL server CDC and there is no option to ingest the data into desired snowflake schema. By default Openflow is creating a schema in snowflake database with the source SQL Server schema name. We were pulling the data from SQL server schema ""DBO"" and Openflow was creating the same schema inside our snowflake database.We updated almost all the processors inside the workflow to use the custom schema name, for most part it worked. we were able to create tables and journal tables etc inside our custom schema in snowflake. But there is one processor which merges journal tables to permanent table which was not supporting to use custom schema name. Somehow it was still using "".DBO"". DB name is configurable in this processor but not the schema name. We connected with the snowflake internal team regarding the same and the guy said they working on it after receiving complaints from lots of other clients. Later he suggested us to not configure/updated the workflow which comes with database connectors. If we do update it, it's gonna be considered as a custom workflow and it will be locked out of future updates.So, customizing the pipeline is out of the picture.2. Environment variables and JVM variables: - there is no one stop UI to manage all these variables inside the workflow. You need to navigate to each processor to manage these variables. 3. Error logs: - not a fan of how openflow manages error logs, its very janky to navigate and use. these were the stuff we found out in the last couple of weeks. We have stopped our POC midway due to con 1. And we and the client are totally dissappointed with how openflow is working as of now.",30,0.93,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pr9fxu/snowflake_openflow_a_bittersweet_experience_soo/,2025-12-20 08:20:56,2025-12-26 01:47:28

1prl5t5,(Mildly) hot takes about modern data engineering,ukmurmuk,dataengineering,"Some principles I have been thinking about productive modern data engineering culture, sharing this here to see different perspectives about my outlook.First, I want to begin by making an assertion that in this AI age, code production is a very cheap commodity. The expensive part is in reviewing & testing the code. But, as long as the pipelines are batch, the processing is not in a regulated environment, and the output is not directly affecting the core business, cost of mistakes are REALLY low. In most cases you can simply rerun the pipeline and replace the bad data, and if you design the pipeline well, processing cost should be very low.So, here are my principles:•⁠Unit tests and component-specific tests are worthless. It slows down development, and it doesn’t really check the true output (product of complex interactions of functions and input data). It adds friction when expanding/optimizing the pipeline. It’s better to do WAP (Write-Audit-Publish) patterns to catch issues in production and block the pipeline if the output is not within expectations rather than trying to catch them locally with tests. (edit: write your e2e tests, DQ checks, and schema contracts. Unit test coverage shouldn’t give you any excuse to not have the other three, and if having the other three nullifies the value of unit tests, then the unit tests are worthless) •⁠Dependencies has to be explicit. If table A is dependent on table B, this dependency has to be explicitly defined in orchestration layer to ensure that issue in table A blocks the pipeline and doesn’t propagate to table B. It might be alluring to separate the DAGs to avoid alerts or other human conveniences, but it’s not a reliable design. •⁠With defensive pipelines (comprehensive data quality check suites, defensive DAGs, etc), teams can churn out codes faster and ship features faster rather than wasting time adjusting unit tests/waiting for human reviews. Really, nowadays you can build something in 1 hour and wait 2-3 days for review. •⁠the biggest bottleneck in data engineering is not the labor of producing code, but the frictions of design/convention disagreements, arguments in code reviews, bad data modeling, and inefficient use of tables/pipelines. This phenomenon is inevitable when you have a big team, hence I argue in most cases, it’s more sensible to have a very lean data engineering team. I would even go further to the point that it makes more sense to have a single REALLY GOOD data engineer (that can communicate well with business, solid data modeling skills, deep technical expertise to design efficient storage/compute, etc) rather than hiring 5 “okay” data engineers.

1pr5vte,How to Calculate Sliding Windows With Historical And Streaming Data in Real Time as Fast as Possible?,JaphethA,dataengineering,"Hello. I need to calculate sliding windows as fast as possible in real time with historical data (from SQL tables) and new streaming data. How can this be achieved in less than 15 ms latency ideally? I tested Rising Wave's Continuous Query with Materialized Views but the fastest I could get it to run was like 50 ms latency. That latency includes from the moment the Kafka message was published to the moment when my business logic could consume the sliding window result made by Rising Wave. My application requires the results before proceeding.I tested Apache Flink a little and it seems like in order to get it to return the latest sliding window results in real time I need to build on top of standard Flink and I fear that if I implement that, it might just end up being even slower than Rising Wave.So I would like to ask you if you know what other tools I could try.

1pqr4n9,Should I be using DBT for this?,john-dev,dataengineering,"I've been tasked with modernizing our ETL. We handle healthcare data so first of all, we want to keep everything on prem, so it limits some of our options right off the bat.Currently, we are using a Makefile to call a massive list of SQL files and run them with psql. Dependencies are maintained by hand.I've just started seeing what it might take to move to DBT to handle the build, and while it looks very promising, the initial tests are still creating some hassles. We have a LOT large datasets. So DBT has been struggling to run some of the seeds because it seems to get memory intensive and it looks like maybe psql was the better option for atleast those portions. I am also still struggling a bit with the naming conventions for selectors vs schema/table names vs folder/file names. We have a number of schemas that handle data identically across different applications, so table names that match seem to be an issue, even if they're in different schemas. I am also having a hard time with the premise that seeds are 1 to 1 for the csv to table. We have for example a LOT of historical data that has changed systems over time, but we don't want to lose that historic data, so we've used psql copy in the past to solve this issue very easily. This looks against the dbt rules.So this has me wanting to ask, are there better tools out there that I should be looking at? My goal is to consolidate services so that managing our containers doesn't become a full time gig in and of itself. Part of the goal of modernization is to attach a semantic layer, which psql alone doesn't facilitate. Unit testing across the data in an easier to run and monitor environment, field level lineage, and even eventually pointing things like langchain are some of our goals. The fact is, our process is extremely old and dated, and modernizing will simply give us better options. What is your advice? I fully recognize I may not know DBT enough yet and all my problems are very solveable.

1psmc5j,"Processing large Teams meeting transcripts as a local, deterministic batch job",AuditMind,dataengineering,"Teams meetings with transcription enabled. One hour of discussion quickly turns into 10k+ words of unstructured text.Extracting decisions, action items, and open questions manually doesn’t scale. The common approach is to push the full transcript into a large cloud model and hope for a usable summary.That approach breaks down for a few reasons.Large transcripts often exceed context windows. Even when they fit, you’re dependent on external infrastructure, which can be problematic for sensitive meetings. Most importantly, you lose determinism: the same input can produce different outputs.I ended up treating the transcript like any other batch-processing problem.Instead of processing the full text in one go, the transcript is handled incrementally:- split into manageable chunks- each chunk summarized independently using a stable structure- clean intermediate results written out- a final aggregation pass over those intermediates to produce the high-level summaryIn practical terms:- the model never sees the full transcript at once- context is controlled explicitly by the pipeline, not by a prompt window- intermediate structure is preserved instead of flattened- the final output is based on accumulated, cleaned data rather than raw textThis reframing changes the requirements completely.One interesting side effect of this approach was realizing that model size stopped being a deciding factor altogether. Once the task is constrained and the workflow is explicit, even relatively small models perform reliably enough for this kind of summarization.Once handled this way, transcript size stops being a concern. A small local model is sufficient, because it’s just one interchangeable component in a controlled pipeline. The value comes from explicit inputs, deterministic steps, and reproducible outputs, not from model size.This runs entirely locally on a modest machine, no GPU, no cloud services.I’m curious how others here approach large meeting transcripts or similar unstructured text when the goal is a clean, deterministic result rather than maximal model capability.",8,0.7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1psmc5j/processing_large_teams_meeting_transcripts_as_a/,2025-12-22 01:04:53,2025-12-26 01:47:28

1prcg35,Overwriting day partitions in table when source and target timezones differ,Data-Panda,dataengineering,"Working on one of my first bigger data projects as a junior and I’m a bit stuck.The source system stores timestamps in CST (no DST); the target tables must be UTC.I extract data using a rolling 7–14 day window, filtered by a business date (midnight-to-midnight in CST) as these are essentially log tables. This is necessary because there’s no last-modified field in the source tables and yet records can be updated up to 7–14 days after creation.The target tables are partitioned by the business date, and I overwrite partitions on each run. This works in theory when extracting full days, but timezone conversion complicates things. When converting CST to UTC, some records shift into the next day, meaning a “full day” CST extract can become partial days in UTC, potentially overwriting partitions with incomplete data.I’m avoiding MERGE because there’s no reliable primary key and analysts want to keep duplicates (some are valid), so partition overwrites seem like the best option. Essentially I just want to clone the source tables into BigQuery.One idea is to extract data as UTC midnight-to-midnight, but the only apparent option in the source is extracting as GMT Monrovia (which I think maps to UTC). This is what I’m edging towards, but not sure if extracting data in a different timezone to what it’s natively stored as is a recommended approach?Can someone please sanity check my approach and let me know if it’s a bad idea, or if I’m missing anything?",7,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1prcg35/overwriting_day_partitions_in_table_when_source/,2025-12-20 11:40:52,2025-12-26 01:47:28

1pujt2p,problem with essential batch process and windows task scheduler,Comfortable_Onion318,dataengineering,"We have a big customer for whom we are doing various data driven services. For one example we are very dependant on running a nightly batch process involving a bit of transactional type of data (10\~20k datasets) that get transfered between systems over a tunnel. The batch process is basically a C# ConsoleApplication that gets scheduled by windows task scheduler. We are working on the customers environment so we don't have much of a choice here. There were multiple times where the process simply did not run for no apparent reason. What I would like to do is to use the task schedulers function of ""retrying"" the task in case of a failure for multiple times. The issues are most often resolved by just restarting the application. However task scheduler does not seem to be able to really ""read"" a task as failed even if I am returning error codes other than 0x0.

1pql697,Weird Snowflake future grant behavior when dbt/Dagster recreates tables,poopdood696969,dataengineering,"I’m running into a Snowflake permissions issue that I can’t quite reason through, and I’m hoping someone can tell me if this is expected or if I’m missing something obvious.Context: we’re on Snowflake, tables are built with dbt and orchestrated by Dagster. Tables are materialized using DBT (so the compiled dbt code is usingcreate-or-replace semantics). This has been the case for a long time and hasn’t changed recently.We effectively have two roles involved:* a read-only reporting role (SELECT access)* a write-capable role that exists mainly so Terraform can create/provision tables (INSERT / TRUNCATE, etc.)Important detail: Terraform is *not* managing grants yet. It’s only being explored. No Snowflake grants are being applied via Terraform at this point.Historically, the reporting role had database-level grants:* usage on the database* usage on all schemas and future schemas* select on all tables* select on future tables* select on all views* select on future viewsThis worked fine. The assumption was that when dbt recreates a table, Snowflake re-applies SELECT via future grants.The only change made recently was adding schema-level future grants for the write-capable role (insert/truncate on future tables in the schema). No pipeline code changed. No dbt config changed. No materialization logic changed.Immediately after that, we started seeing this behavior:* when dbt/Dagster recreates a table, the write role’s privileges come back* the reporting role’s SELECT does notThis was very obvious and repeatable.What’s strange is that the database-level future SELECT grants for the reporting role still exist. There are no revoke statements in query history. Ownership isn’t changing. Schemas are not managed access. Transient vs permanent tables doesn’t seem to matter.The only thing that fixes it is adding schema-level future SELECT for the reporting role. Once that’s in place, recreated tables keep SELECT access as expected.So now everything works, but I’m left scratching my head about why:* database-level future SELECT used to be sufficient* introducing schema-level future grants for another role caused this to surface* schema-level future SELECT is now required for reporting access to survive table recreationI’m fine standardizing on schema-level future grants everywhere, but I’d really like to understand what’s actually happening under the hood. Is Snowflake effectively applying future grants based on the most specific scope available?

I assumed the career path was basically just moving from junior to senior backend roles, building APIs and scaling web services. It felt like the industry was 90% CRUD apps and centered around the same few ""cliché"" frontend and backend frameworks.Recently, I started looking into Quant Finance, and it has been a total eye-opener. It is a completely different world where the problems aren't about HTTP requests or CSS; they are about high-frequency execution, mathematical modeling, and processing massive amounts of data in real-time. It made me realize how many deep technical niches we completely ignore because they aren't as ""loud"" as web development.I wanted to share this because if you are starting to feel a bit burnt out or bored with standard web stacks, I really encourage you to look at these non-obvious fields. Whether it is Quant, Embedded Systems, or Bio-informatics, there are rabbit holes out there that are way more technically challenging than the standard paths.

Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing ""execute"" and watching your drone do all the hard work.Unlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.Farming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.Programming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.While it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.If you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.Although the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code.

Felt that I got in by sheer luck. Academically, I’m not smart. I was generally a B-student back in CS college. But I did enjoy SWE mods like networks, distributed systems, or even learning algorithms. Over the past 3 years, my job has been rather chill and I don’t read outside of work. I didn’t learn much while doing frontend for 2 years - my code looks more or less the same because frontend frameworks are very abstracted at my company.Now that I’m in my 3rd year without promotion, I’ve been looking for jobs. I’m terrible at Leetcode, not good at systems design, my problem-solving skills aren’t great either so I’ve been failing interviews here and there. Sometimes I get frontend interviews, which will test JavaScript or React or even HTML/CSS, where each language/framework has a lot of concepts to learn about. I feel that there’s endless to study for and I’m fighting against a bar that is high but I can’t even see where it is.It’s been demoralising. I’ve moved into a backend team and I’m struggling hard. I have a difficult time grasping backend concepts, navigating backend code and understanding architectural designs. I’m lost 70% of the time during my team’s discussions. Everyone else is more senior than me, but they seem to know way more - it feels like that probably knew more than me when they were at 3 YOE. I have a difficult time visualising architectures or technical things when they’re discussing. I learn better when I dive into the code to build something. But it is inherently poor practise to dive into coding without understanding the requirements or the architecture or code itself, which causes me issues down the road. I think my lack of knowledge shows when I implement without understanding the full picture, but I have a difficult time following discussions.As an engineer, I only like to code. I like it when requirements are clear. I don’t like the ambiguity of having to dig around and define the requirements or scoping problems. I only like to build stuff and see my product coming to life and working.I think I should be studying harder for Leetcode, Systems design, and read more on whatever frameworks I’m using.

But about six months ago, I gave it another shot and started grinding through the exercises.I recently finished the first three chapters, and it honestly blew my mind. It gave me a whole new perspective on programming. But here's the catch: before the book, I wrote spaghetti code that ""just worked."" Now...

The formatting of Python also seems to be a cheat that isn't as healthy as having your base reference in C/C++'s symbolic referencing over indentation.My real question because it does seem C style is better for long term than python first and I intend to learn both, is it best to learn C or C++?

I've done this several times to pass arrays of different lengths into general purpose functions (along with their lengths) for software that I've written, but although I thought I had a grasp on the inner workings, I've found I'm unable to fully explain what's going on.Here's my understanding, using a simple example. #include using std::cout; float averageScores(float* scores, int length) {     float sum;         for (int i=0; i<length; i++)     {         sum = sum + scores[i];     }     float average = sum/length;     return average; } int main() {     float testScores [] = {81.2, 90, 91.8, 76.3, 78.4};     int numScores = sizeof(testScores)/sizeof(testScores[0]);     float classAverage = averageScores(testScores, numScores);     cout<<classAverage;     return 0; } Might not be the most efficient way to do this but you get the idea. What I've done is passed an array of test scores into a function that calculates their average. However, to my understanding, when I declare an array variable, it's actually interpreted as something like &testScores\[0\], or the memory location of the first float variable in testScores. First question: the entire array is stored at that memory location, correct? So if the memory location is something like 0x5ffe60, that's where the entire array is stored?Now, in my function I have declared the parameters float\* scores and int length. float\* scores is a pointer. So, this to me seems like creating a pointer to a memory address, similar to the classic example folks usually show when discussing pointers:int x = 6; int \*pX = \&x;Where pX is a pointer to the memory location at which the value of x is stored. So, similarly, it seems that float \*scores = &testScores\[0\].Now, my ultimate question: given that C++ is particular about variable types matching, does this mean that &x and &testScores\[0\] are ""pointer types?"" Like, \* and & are just inverses of the same variable type, and that's why I can write a function that expects a pointer and pass it a memory address.So both \*scores and &testScores\[0\] are float\* numbers? I think I'm missing something because my explanation feels inconsistent. If anyone could clarify what I have right and wrong about this, that would be greatly appreciated.

I do have an example of a practical project I want to finish that I've been working on, but I am really struggling with breaking it down into manageable parts. I am a music producer that posts my type beats on YouTube and Beatstars (beat selling website), and I found that uploading things is starting to become increasingly annoying as I need to click through a ton of menus and upload files and such, so I wanted to streamline that. The idea is a desktop GUI app that uses web automation to upload to Beatstars, and then Google's API for uploading to Youtube.

Here are some criteria:\- should be completable within a couple weeks \- should be easily testable (ideally not too much reliance on graphics) \- should require the use of classes and objects to build it efficiently in order to demonstrate to students the usefulness of these concepts Some examples of ideas I do not like:\- to-do list: this is so boring \- pet adoption system: this is just a simulation of what a system like this would be like to code. It’s of no actual use to anybody \- chatbot: a great project, but doesn’t require object oriented principles \- video game: I would love to do this, but it would be rather difficult to write thorough tests forIf anyone has any ideas or has done any projects on their own that fit these criteria, I would love to hear about them!",10,0.92,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1prg7xw/practical_projects_for_beginners_that_practice/,2025-12-20 14:57:43,2025-12-26 01:47:29

I never called IT because I usually figured it out (I learned that’s why they liked me - I always had new stuff without asking for it). I wanted to make sure I could relate to my people, so I decided to do some homework on IT related stuff. My love of math and problem solving combined with undiagnosed adhd kicked in and I found myself in a Python course. Became a bit obsessed because it felt natural. I am using AI to answer questions about why things operate the way they do and to assist, but only use it now for smaller blocks because it gets dumb really fast. I find myself correcting it when I get it to write blocks for me now. Fast forward to the future. I’ve been building apps at work (mostly power apps, power automate - but learning Python made learning these EASY) and my database is now active. I’ve also built standalone tools with Python at work that are being used. I’ve got no formal education in technology. But I clearly understand the concepts that have been introduced to me. I find myself now gravitating towards a career in technology. I could do this all day. Managing people is great when things are going well but……there’s downsides.

You also get to know about new platforms, tools, and technologies, which is really helpful. What makes hackathons exciting is the experience of solving a real-world problem within a limited time — whether it’s a 24-hour or 36-hour hackathon. Thinking of an idea, building a solution from scratch, and implementing it under pressure is challenging but incredibly fun and rewarding.Overall, the experience is top-notch and honestly enjoyable.

Been lurking around, haven't posted though.I've been wondering about my career and its direction for about a year at least and I felt that's it would be good to share and ask for advice and opinions.Some background.I'm a programmer with about ten years of experience. I come from a math background. Never completed my uni studies but I was fortunate enough to build somegood foundations that helped a ton in programming. Programming for me was also my only hobby for most of the last decade. Read many books, tried many tools and languages. Had tons of fun on many late nights home.Recent two years the excitement dropped off and I've been enjoying non programing stuff a lot. I've organically ended up doing team lead/tech lead stuff for the last five years and I've accustomed to that. My job is primarily reviewing, mentoring, planning and estimating effort.Due to the recent advancements in AI I've started feeling the heat. It seems to me that much of the toolset that used to make us competent as programmers is fading away. Now, as a team lead/tech lead I feel that I do a good job exactly because I've spent so many hours fiddling with stuff from many different angles. But in the age of AI I have much less consifidence in my ability to reasons about those genai system that I think we'll be dealing with in the upcoming years.I've tried to move to areas of game development and design, graphics programming but I gave up after a while. I did not feel the urge to pursue and do what it takes to jump to another field. Right now I'm asked to design systems based on AI which, I don't feel equipped to do.And even though I know that I'm through a burnout for about three years now, I appreciatey job. I appreciate how it has transformed my life and I've seen able to do and own things I never would have if I did not spend so much time studying cs and programming. This is why I decided to create a self made curriculum of data science, machine learning, deep learning and finally genai in order get myself familiarize with those concepts. This is something that's I evaluate to take at least a year. I think that if I am to continue managing development teams and since I seems to a place in our toolset, I think it makes sense. I feel it would boost my abilities and therefore my confidence in order to continue doing a good job.I don't feel like I'm going to definitely lose my job to AI. But I feel like that if I don't expand my knowledge in any way, I leave it to chance. I don't know if I'm maybe too pessimistic about this, but my gut call is saying that it's to re evaluate some things and it's time to be proactive again.Thought I'd share with you, I expect that many might have somewhat similar thoughts, with all this ai madness going around constantly.

1punt23,Strategy for learning digital logic,SadFriendship1255,learnprogramming,"For a few years I have been trying to learn programming, without much success. I've always been curious about how computers and digital electronics in general work. My background isn't technical although I work for a software company where people are nice and usually happy to answer noob questions when they have the time. Over the years, I have learned some basics: Very basic Java and C++, what logic gates are, been messing around with Arduino, breadboards and chips, binary numbers, algebra and a bit of precalculus. But whatever information I have gathered seem pretty trivial and overall I feel like I don't ""get it"".Recently someone recommended that I start from the basics again and just focus on one gate per month before I go any further: write the truth table, the HDL description for that gate, and what the gate is made of (for example an OR gate is two NOT and one NAND gates) every day of the month and then do the same for the next gate the following month, until I have covered all the gates. The goal being that this becomes ""automatic"" for me.I am 38 and want to learn out of interest/hobby although part of me is secretly hoping to either make a bit of money with it in the future or even a new career. But I'm not in a rush and willing to take the time to make sure I understand what I'm doing.What's your take on the recommendation that was given to me? If you don't agree, what would be your strategy if you were me?Thanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read and/or answer!",4,0.84,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1punt23/strategy_for_learning_digital_logic/,2025-12-24 13:49:35,2025-12-26 01:47:29

I have significant free time in the office and on weekends. I feel stagnated and want to use this time to upskill, but I’m paralyzed by choice.The Options: I am confused between these 5 very different paths.1. Deep Dive into Company Legacy Code: I have access to the main production codebase. The Catch: It’s written in a non-intuitive, non-standard way. Is it worth struggling through the code base to understand the domain?2. Certifications (MongoDB & AWS): Since I work with Mongo heavily, should I aim for the Developer/Data Modeling certs and add AWS to the mix? Do these actually hold value for a junior dev in the current market?3. DSA & System Design: Ignore the current work tech stack and just grind LeetCode/LLD/HLD.4. Ride the AI Wave: Learn LLMs, RAG, and build AI projects to stay relevant, even though my current job is purely traditional backend.5. Content Creation: Start documenting my journey/coding tips on LinkedIn/Twitter/YouTube.

I’ve been on this visa for almost ten years. During that time, I’ve delivered multiple successful products and made many of the core architecture and design decisions behind them.Like many companies, mine has been offshoring aggressively. Despite that, my role remained secure because of the technical depth, domain knowledge, and familiarity I have with the projects and their complexity. That context and continuity turned out to matter.With the increasing hostility and constant uncertainty around H-1B, I eventually stopped trying to plan a future here. I asked my employer whether transferring me to an international office was an option, either in the Netherlands or Canada.They agreed.So I’ll be moving to the Netherlands soon, keeping the same job, just no longer in the US. A close friend did the same thing a few months ago and moved her role to Canada.What’s frustrating is that this feels entirely avoidable. The US doesn’t just lose a worker in situations like this, it loses a highly skilled contributor and the taxes that come with that. The work doesn’t disappear. It simply moves elsewhere.After a decade of building, leading, and contributing here, it’s hard not to see this as a self-inflicted loss. I’m not leaving because I wanted to.

Overall the search went much better than last time. With it being only a year since I had gone through this whole thing I felt a lot more prepared and I think it shows in the numbers.A few clarifying points about my labels:* ""Reached out to my network"" was me reaching out to anybody I had interacted with previously including co-workers, recruiters I had worked with before, and actually the offer I turned down last year. The company that gave me the offer I turned down last year met with me but they didn't have anything open and it didn't go beyond that.* ""AI agent applied for me"": I used several AI services to find and apply for jobs on my behalf. These were Jobhire AI, Wobo AI, and Sonara. I didn't count all of the applications they sent out for me because the vast majority of them were ignored. I estimate that it was approximately 200 applications that got sent out by these. I could make another post on my thoughts on these, but to sum it up, Jobhire was absolute trash, Wobo wasn't much better, and Sonara was worth the price in my mind. Overall the AI agents got me interviews with 3 companies, 2 of which proceeded to the final round (1 rejected me and the other I withdrew after accepting another offer).* ""Withdrew after accepting other offer"": This means that I withdrew from interviews before getting an offer from the place I was interviewing with because I had already accepted a different offer. If a company made me an offer, that got counted with the ""Declined"" label after ""Offer"".I've got 13 years of experience with two FAANGs and a FAANG+ on my resume and my specialization for most of that has been in developer tools and infrastructure. System design questions are still my weakest point, and I'm hoping that this next role will help me with more practical hands-on experience that I can use in the future for those problems.My offers:Series A Startup | Series B Startup | Axon-------------------|--------------------|------accepted | declined | declined$205k base | $200k base | $188k baseno bonus | 15% bonus | 10% bonusOptions | Options | $160k RSUs over two years with 1 year cliff (+ refreshers)2-3 days hybrid | 2-3 days hybrid | 4 days mandatory in office Tue-FriSome quick stats from the Sankey:* Acceptance rate from manual applications: 11% (11/100)* Pass rate for initial rounds: 64% (9/14 - not counting ones I withdrew from)* Pass rate for final rounds: 60% (3/5 - not counting ones I withdrew from) - this is a personal best for me. I'm not sure if the 4 companies I withdrew from would have been a similar success rate, but I'm happy with it.* Nearly half the recruiters that messaged me first were for shitty contracting gigs even though I indicated on LinkedIn that I was not interested in those. Ironically at least 10 of those were third party recruiters that wanted to put me right back in at Meta doing almost exactly what I was doing before ... hmm ...* A huge percentage of companies I interviewed with (maybe 85%?) had ""AI"" in their name and almost every company I talked to emphasized how they were incorporating AI in their product or process. The startup I accepted an offer from is the type of company that is selling shovels during this AI gold rush.Overall this search only lasted two months. I hit the ground running as soon as I got laid off from Meta and I had accepted an offer before 60 days had passed. So much better than last year!",116,0.97,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pty6o7/my_latest_job_search_after_getting_laid_off_for/,2025-12-23 16:26:47,2025-12-26 01:47:30

I have no idea.Basically I got into the field 8 years ago and have worked at 3 different places and nothing that I've ever worked on, nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on, has ever had any real impact. And by impact, at the end of the day, one could say I mean money. Nothing that I've ever seen anyone work on has ever helped anyone and in turn made money. Simultaneously, every project, every product I have ever worked on was heavily overstaffed and with extreme food envy among developers.Is there anyone out there that actually works on something that people need? Is there any project out there that actually needs me?I've been interviewing for over a year now too and I ask the interviewers:\- ""What are you working on?""\- ""Why are you hiring for this role?""Nobody can answer these questions. It's always some hand wavy explanation. You know, the kind you usually get from people lying about their resume. ""Oh this and that bla bla...""At the same time, as we all know, life has gotten so expensive that, at least I, personally, cannot really say ""Oh I will just do this job and in 5-10 years I can buy a house or something.""

Am I doomed?",MarathonMarathon,cscareerquestions,"So I'm soon to become one of those ""unemployed CS majors"" everyone keeps talking about once I graduate. I've been struggling to find meaningful employment, and don't have a job lined up. The way things are currently heading, after graduation I'm likely just heading back to my mom's house and maybe working some shitty retail job with 0 upward mobility. This is a future some people (including some friends) from my high school have achieved without attending college, and if that's my future, it means my mom will have wasted 4 years on an expensive degree that ended up being worthless.I'm well aware that it only gets harder and harder to find a full-time job the longer you wait after graduating. Which is why I'm frightened of being jobless or underemployed once that happens, and then having an awkward gap in my resume to have to explain, which only gets more and more awkward the longer I wait.The roles I've been applying to include SWE, data analysis, data engineer, and data science. While my undergraduate internship grinds have been very hit-or-miss, I have some ""roundabout"" experience (multiple unpaid internships + paid research) on my resume, some of it ongoing (and my performance there has been satisfactory), which I've been told is enough to land me interviews, which I have. It's just that I've been struggling to pass these interviews. I've known people who've managed to hand-wave themselves in through interviews just by talking a bit, but I've somehow failed even one of those when given one (though that was partially my fault since my reference waved me through without even giving me the JD).My clear metric for ""success"" is having enough money to *be able to* move away from home and afford a non-shitty apartment if I wanted to (and in the event I don't, it'll be because the job is in my metro area, aka NYC). If I don't achieve this, I'll have failed. I wouldn't say I'm asking for much, and I feel like this is a quite reasonably low bar to clear, and if I don't clear it, I'm a failure.Now that it's Christmas already and I still don't have any kind of post-college offer in hand, things are not looking up. I've barely applied to any positions between Thanksgiving and Christmas and have secured 0 new interviews therein. I barely even grind Leetcode anymore, since it just makes me disappointed whenever I fail questions that are supposedly ""Easy"" or ""Medium"". If you gave me a Leetcode-style interview or OA right now, I'd probably fail it. I've yet to actually receive such an *interview* (OAs I have, with mixed performance), but I'm well aware that many companies do ask them. A lot of what I've failed so far is behavioral, though I've passed a few.I've received mixed messaging on whether to consider grad school. My parents aren't going to pay for it and I'll have to take out expensive loans if I do go for it. And I know cheap online programs like OMSCS exist, but I don't know if they're right or if it'll be too challenging, and I'm not even sure if it's something I'm seriously invested in either. The whole field just seems like a sinking ship with AI and all, and people seem to be right about there being no need to hire any more juniors.I just want to know what to do, because things seem absolutely grim, and people who've been through 2008 keep calling me entitled and telling me that the job market now isn't nearly as bad as 2008.

I have an education and basic proficiency in software engineering, but I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in transportation and diesel mechanic environments. In that space, a lot of workflows are still very manual, handling breakdowns over the phone, outdated desktop software, poor coordination between dispatch, mechanics, and drivers. From the outside, it feels like there are real opportunities for software to improve productivity in industries that aren’t “tech-native.”I have an app idea based on problems I’ve personally dealt with, but it’s too ambitious for me to realistically build alone. In theory, it seems like teaming up with a few other engineers (2–4 people) to build something useful could be a better use of time than waiting for interviews that may never come.What I’m trying to understand is why doesn’t this happen more often?

Between tech layoffs, market saturation, and the rapid rise of AI, it’s hard not to feel anxious about the future of this field.Luckily, I’m still a freshman, so if shifting to another degree would truly offer better job security and a more stable income, I wouldn’t hesitate to consider it.Don’t get me wrong: I genuinely love tech. I can see myself studying and working in this field long-term because of how vast and interesting it is. But we also can’t deny reality: the industry feels oversaturated, entry-level roles are extremely competitive, and the barrier to entry is relatively low. Anyone who self-studies can technically enter the field (even if they don’t have the same depth as someone who studied CS formally), and that definitely affects competition.So my question is this:If you were in college right now, still studying CS and not yet graduated, would you consider shifting to a traditional engineering degree instead?I’m talking about fields like:Electrical EngineeringElectronics EngineeringMechanical EngineeringCivil EngineeringDo these degrees actually offer better long-term job security compared to CS today? Or is the grass just greener on the other side?PS: I know some people will say, “If you’re doubting CS, then it’s not for you,” or that those who truly grind will succeed—or that this is just a way to reduce competition.

My current role is on a product that is going through some changes next year, and I don't have much faith in the leadership or direction they're going with it. I'd like to find a new job but I can barely even get an interview.I had two interviews in the summer (which I got via one referral and one recruiter reaching out to me). Both went multiple rounds before I got a rejection notice. Apart from that I've been getting zero interest putting in between 5-20 apps a week, mostly for mid level SWE positions that are a close or exact match for the tech stack that I've been working in these last 5 years (Spring/React/AWS). All I ever get are rejection emails. Is the field really that saturated? I thought it would become easier to get my foot in the door and at least speak to real people about my experience once I hit the 5 year experience mark but it's not. I feel like I'm getting even less response than when I was applying for new grad jobs 5 years ago. My school isn't prestigious and neither are the companies I've worked for (a couple non-tech industry fortune 500s and some government contract work).Anyway I just needed to vent....

But using total compensation numbers to hire, then removing a major component post-joining, is at best misleading and at worst a deliberate bait-and-switch.This has nothing to do with:Performance Role change Level changeIt’s purely a policy change that benefits the company at the expense of employees who already joined.Posting this for visibility because these “global alignment” narratives are increasingly being used to quietly roll back compensation after offers are accepted.Has anyone else at Walmart or other big tech seen RSUs removed after joining?Is this becoming the new normal in India under cost-control pushes?Any real leverage employees have in situations like this, or is the offer letter basically meaningless once you join?Sharing for awareness.

Especially when the GitHub issue barely has any info and I have to investigate what is happening myself/code interacting with multiple repos. Our tech stack is Java/Kafka/RPC/S3/Logging tool to fetch S3 logs/UI to interact with APIs. Java I’m okay with, but dependency injection is a bit confusing to me bc I’ve never done a whole project using DI before. Even finding where to start to code is confusing when a change has things interacting with multiple repos (I try to use a global search tool we have to find starting point). Also I really struggle with manual testing. Like when I make a change in the back end that logically reflects in the front end, I need to be able to make the change in our front end service (which is also confusing as a product to some extent bc some parts/integrations of our product our team doesn’t own) and then read logging software to diagnose what’s happening behind the scenes whether it be a java stack trace or an API call or whatever.I want to stay at my company for as long as possible bc it’s good and remote so I need to learn company stack specifically. I just need guidance on how to get better FAST.Can someone give me a plan on how to approach this?I’m thinking I need to:1. Learn nuances to the product itself2.

1pto1gr,Other career options besides SWE with stem degree,Mishkle,cscareerquestions,"Hi, I transfered into a computer science degree during covid. Even before AI, I think I was better at taking computer science exams as opposed to coding. I was always better at debugging existing code and loved designing code on white board with people, but not writing it myself. On group projects it seemed like I was good at explaining things to people who could code better than me, and they would code it. I don’t know what it is, but I don’t really like coding itself. I think I was so tired from my theoretical/math-heavy my degree was, I didn’t have the energy for projects. I don’t code unless prompted to by others. I did technical product internships in quantum and I tried really hard to “look successful technically” by starting a club around it. I build a huge network and got 2 internships (one FAANG, one not) out of it, but I just…never seem to code. I think I did this club partly out of embarrassment and because it was more meaningful to me to create opportunities for students bc it had real outcome. I also made it my whole personality. I then tried to do a “PhD” to make myself “better” but I just get lost with starting a project from scratch or actually wanting to do it. Everything I tried took me literally all day. Mastered out. I am not necessarily depressed, but I think my brain adjusted to existing in perpetual uncertainty while needing to do hard math I don’t want to everyday. I always enjoyed things doing a dog walking business or uber in college because of the minimal success/interest I experienced in programming. I did an entrepreneurship minor, and I always loved those courses. Working at front-desk jobs and TPM felt like the same skill set to me kinda, so I think I minimized “TPM” roles because it’s a “non-technically” impressive degree. I did try really hard to like coding/hard topics for so many years but like… I feel like my brain only does it for exams/assignments or to teach others. I would rather do not this at all if other things paid well. I now have two technical degrees, a CS and electrical engineering masters, but I feel like I have no skills bc all I did was math or people-oriented things.I have noticed all other areas of my life social life, hobbies, etc. just wither away because I just sleep until I have to do something code related.I think right now, though my resume “looks impressive” the job market grind is a lot. I literally will just sleep in my car at a parking lot because I just don’t want to do leetcode or specific company prep. I think a lot of life goals like having friends, finding partner, climbing, having interest to do anything besides sleep have like withered in my mid-20s due to how much I forced this interest.There’s a part of me that does think if I do get a nice paying CS job, I can save so much money and retire early due to how much I have minimized my other life needsWhat careers can I consider with my degrees that are more people-oriented, or what can I do to look marketable for TPM roles now.",19,0.96,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pto1gr/other_career_options_besides_swe_with_stem_degree/,2025-12-23 07:37:44,2025-12-26 01:47:30

1pqrd3x,Retention Offer at a Downsizing Company,TheIrishDeaf,cscareerquestions,"I am an SWE with 4YOE (all at my current place of employment) in a LCOL city. Where I work, software is a cost center.For most of my time at this company, we were a team of 4-5. Over the course of this year, the team has shrunk to just me with HR saying they have no intention of opening up or hiring for the lost positions. This means I am salary with 24/7 on-call (no payment for OT or call-outs).I recently became a team of 1 as of mid-september. Based on the concerns I brought up with my manager, I was recently presented with a raise and title change. I went from \~$80k -> \~$91k. This is in effect as of now. This raise also makes me ineligible for the normal end-of-year raise considerations. In addition to the raise, a retention offer was just made for $9k but I would have to remain with the company for 18months. Accepting or rejecting this offer does not effect the title change or raise that I already got.They have already stated that negotiating any of that 9k into base salary is not an option nor lessening the time frame. HR got quite aggressive when I inquired about that. The offer says I would get the net post-tax money, but would have to pay back the gross amount if broken.Like many of us, I have already been applying for other jobs. And honestly, if I had a choice, I would not be here in even 6 months. But with the current job market, especially in a LCOL city, Im not too sure if the option of another job in 18 months is realistic.I've read there is some tax form that could be filled out to essentially get the tax difference between the net and gross so I don't suffer a loss if I break the contract.But my question to you is - how have you handled retention offers like this and what is your opinion on it?Accepting it feels like it might turn into handcuffs of a sort... but rejecting it feels like it puts a mark on me as a flight-risk when I might be stuck there anyways due to the current market.",19,0.81,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pqrd3x/retention_offer_at_a_downsizing_company/,2025-12-19 17:43:44,2025-12-26 01:47:30

Looking for advice.",AirlineEasy,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I’m looking for some perspective and advice from people who have been in similar situations.I joined a small startup about three months ago as a *full-stack developer*, although in practice I’m doing almost entirely front-end work. The company has been around for about 7 years, ~20 people total, and only 3 developers:* One backend developer* One senior developer who is currently transitioning into a Customer Success role* And meBefore this job, I did a bootcamp and a lot of self-study, but I’m very aware that I’m still junior. I’m learning every day, but there’s a big gap between where I am technically and the level of responsibility and trust they’re giving me.That said, the company has been incredibly supportive so far:* I asked for Frontend Masters access and they approved it* I asked to understand more about the business beyond pure frontend, and they gave me a project building JavaScript automations in Airtable, touching operations, product, inventory, etc.* I asked for regular time with the senior dev to review things together, and that was also approvedFrom a support and trust point of view, I honestly couldn’t ask for more.The company is very product-focused and mainly B2B. They sell hardware and services to other businesses, but they also have a SaaS product. Around 80% of customers actively use it and pay for it, yet there’s no clear long-term SaaS strategy or roadmap. It feels more like “it exists and works” than “this is a core growth engine.”Here’s where my internal conflict starts:* On one hand, I know I’m still junior and should probably focus on fundamentals, shipping solid frontend work, and not overthinking things.* On the other hand, I see a real opportunity here to grow the SaaS side of the business, help shape a more structured software team, and eventually take on more responsibility if things go well.* I’m interested in full-stack and system complexity, not just UI work, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself or become “the guy with ideas but weak execution.”So my questions are mainly:* Is this a good environment for a junior dev to grow, or is the lack of senior technical leadership risky?* How would you balance learning deeply vs stepping up when the company clearly gives you room?* Should I focus narrowly on becoming a very solid frontend engineer first, or is it reasonable to also invest energy in understanding the business and SaaS side early on?* Any red flags or opportunities you see from the outside?I’m genuinely grateful for the chance I’ve been given, but I want to be intentional about how I grow and avoid making preventable mistakes.Thanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to read or respond.",9,0.99,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pukjxr/junior_dev_in_a_small_startup_learning_fast_lots/,2025-12-24 10:42:26,2025-12-26 01:47:30

Originally, I applied for a PhD in Computer Science, but since the PI is affiliated with both departments, the scholarship was formally offered under Mathematics instead.My main motivation for pursuing a PhD has always been industry research, not academia. I’m particularly interested in roles at places like DeepMind, FAIR, or smaller, niche AI research labs. From what I can tell, these positions typically expect a PhD in CS / ML (or very closely related fields), and a PhD in Mathematics does not seem to be the standard, or even explicitly listed, in most cases.I am not interested in becoming a professor. I see the PhD primarily as a means to access research-oriented industry roles, not as an academic career path in itself.That said, there are several red flags that are making me hesitate:1. The PI is very new. I would be their second PhD student, and the first one is now a postdoc, still in academia.2. The PI has few publications, mostly in mathematics, and a very low h-index.3. The scholarship itself has some worrying conditions: * Internships are not allowed. * If I decide to leave the PhD early, they may require full reimbursement of the scholarship.The internship restriction is especially concerning, since I want to move into industry research and not stay in academia.At this point, the only reasons I still see for going forward are:1. Is it realistically possible to enter big tech / AI research labs without top-tier publications and without internships?2. Gaining research experience and living abroad.3. I genuinely find the research topic very interesting (I can share more details via DM; I’d prefer not to be too identifiable here).One more important piece of context: I am already working as a software engineer, although with a very old tech stack and in a sector I don’t enjoy (defense).

1pu15ox,How much do majors matter in the CS job market?,allalongthewest,cscareerquestions,"I’m going to college next year and have been having multiple changes of heart regarding my future career prospects and my major. For context, I learned how to program when I was 8, and now I would consider myself a pretty well-accomplished programmer with many great projects to boast. I’m excellent at Rust, C++, C, and JavaScript, and proficient with Java, Python, and other C-like languages. Since ages 8–15 I built multiplayer games, full-stack websites, physics engines, and ECS frameworks, with some projects having thousands of GitHub stars.By 15, I discovered I really liked systems programming and learned theoretical CS topics like OS theory, compiler theory, networking, and embedded programming through open courseware. At 16, I made a dynamic memory allocator that rivals the speed of tcmalloc and jemalloc using a decentralized approach with journals, embedded metadata, and slabs. At 17, I built an ahead-of-time compiler for a Rust-like language with a complete frontend, a robust type checker handling traits and generics, a MIR system with monomorphization, and an LLVM backend generating cross-platform IR.Very recently, I’ve had an intense desire to learn math. I’ve already studied Calc 1–3, linear algebra (Axler is great btw), real analysis (baby rudin, abbott, fitzpatrick), abstract algebra (d&f, aluffi), and category theory, and this interest sharpened after reading Ahlfors' Complex Analysis starting in September, to the point that I'm now seriously considering majoring in it.My mind has been flipping between studying math, CS, double majoring, or minoring in one. Given my extensive programming experience and familiarity with upper-level CS, I feel I’d rather spend college learning something I’m less proficient in (math). Double majoring in Math&CS might make it difficult to take all the math courses I want due to CS requirements, and I dislike entry CS courses like DSA that I likely can’t test out of.I don’t currently have job prospects (they keep changing), but I want to keep SWE jobs as an option after graduation, and I will 100% continue programming and building projects throughout college. If it helps in your consideration, I've been admitted to MIT and will likely commit there, and I might pursue a PhD afterward.

I felt insecure about this learning style and decided I would focus more on trying to study mathematics and computer science topics before college, an effort that just amounted to doing a bunch of practice problems and khan academy constantly as per my math teachers instruction.I wanted to be able to design programs and dissect pre-existing designs, to be able to understand research on algorithms if not to design my own, to explore future applications of CS research or at least to be a software engineer that could make something without relying on a tutorial with code to copy. In college I had to split my focus between biology, chemistry, anatomy, anthropology, discrete math, calculus, linear algebra, bioanthropology.. as you can see, a lot of topics required by my CS degree before I could even think about programming, yet pre-existing programming knowledge was expected and in our CS classes our assignments would consist of fairly complicated 'real world projects' to implement the concepts we were learning but we never talked about any code in class. Most professors were laissez faire in defining how students should learn to program. ""Just code"" which made it hard to see why I was doing so poorly compared to other students.My cohort consisted of: people who had parents who were in STEM/programmers or very STEM oriented schools so they had learnt programming & CS a structured environment for so long they couldn't really define their curriculum beyond ""I just learnt it"" compared to me who just struggled on youtube & stackoverflow without any help.people who were using GPT & friends for all assignments and somehow getting away with it, but I didn't want to risk it and I had no friends either way. People who seemed to make ""just think of things you'd like to make, watch tutorials and ask questions"" work, but I still don't understand the specifics of how they learnt to dissect program design from tutorials without flailing around in the documentation taking notes on a dozen functions and variables that still don't tie together conceptually, especially while dealing with schoolwork at the same time.As professionals, how are students supposed to manage learning software engineering and computer science + other coursework independently?",6,0.88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pu5qcz/how_should_students_manage_professionalrealworld/,2025-12-23 21:32:23,2025-12-26 01:47:30
1pu40fl,Unsure about IBM offer,WildlyPlatonic,cscareerquestions,"I currently work for one of the WITCH companies, and IBM consulting is taking over our project from us soon. The new IBM project lead is offering me a position on the new team, and I just wanted to get some outside opinions on IBM consulting. Switching to them would represent around a 25% raise, and would be fully remote. That might be all that matters at the end of the day. I've read some worrying things about them though in the industry I'm in. They've been sued twice for under-delivering on very similar projects. Maybe that doesn't matter though at the end of the day, as long as I'm getting paid?

1pt9dk5,Internship While Doing Master's to Break into Big Tech,DOUG_DlMMADOME,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,I am currently a backend Java software engineer at a large bank, 3 yoe. I actually recently got promoted to senior but I don't really see it that way as I don't think I've learned much during my time here. Most deliverables are business/regulatory related and not much technological innovation or otherwise. For that reason, and to avoid stagnation, I've been doing OMSCS and have maintained a 4.0 so far. My question is, since I am doing a master's anyway, and I feel like my technical skills could improve by working in big tech, would it be worthwhile to apply for internships? My undergrad was in physics so I didn't have any CS internships in undergrad and jumped more or less straight into the field. I don't mind quitting this job if it means I can transition into more technical companies and positions where I can learn a lot more.I know all levels of the SE field are super competitive but think that going the internship route may be the best option right now.Thoughts?

1prb879,Transitioning from Software Developer (4.5 YoE) to Project Manager – Worth it?,Flamyngoo,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I’m a full-stack software developer with around 4.5 years of experience, and I’ve been at my current company for a couple of years. Recently, the company has been expanding and hiring more IT roles, mainly software developers and project managers.Over the last months, I’ve been more and more involved in client meetings, discussing requirements, planning work, and coordinating what other developers should be doing. Our IT manager noticed this, as he was present in many of those meetings, and he recently offered me the option to fully transition into a Project Manager role.The plan would be to stop recruiting an external PM, hire one additional developer instead, and have me move almost completely off coding (or at least do very little of it). I have about one to two weeks to decide whether I want to stay in a hybrid role with roughly 70% coding, or make a full transition to PM.I do enjoy the planning, organizing, and communication side of the work, but I’m not sure if I enjoy it more than coding in the long run. I’m also unsure how beneficial this move would be for my overall career. Is project management a good long-term path coming from a development background? If I end up not liking it, is it realistic to move back into a coding role later, or would that hurt my career?I’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve made a similar transition, or from anyone who’s seen this kind of move work out (or not) in practice.

I really like the product and overall my tasks are not too bad. Only thing, that lately disturbs me is the Co-Founder who is also managing the company. For context we are 8 people all together in the team. And ofc he his kinda arguing with the non-hierchachy stuff and that we are all responsible... Lately, in the weekly meetings, he is helding 2 hour long monologues about how he wants us to behave. The recent talk was all about just to accept his critique and not to give any professional advice from my perspective as professionally trained CRM-Manager, Copywriter and Graphicdesigner. Overall he is kinda stuck in this idea, that he can do anything, while the team is just there to realise his 'vision' (of earning more money). I know this isn't a healthy workplace and I am working on finding a new job (which these day isn't that easy).

1pt3sxb,Path to a master's degree,Gorudu,cscareerquestions,"Hey all, I'm currently working as a software developer as a contractor in U.S. government.The job is alright. I can't really complain as I have a job, but I've been here for a few years and I'm starting to think more directly about the future.For some context, my background is not a traditional CS degree pipeline. I have a Bachelor's Degree in English and I taught for about 5 years. I enjoyed teaching, but the pay wasn't cutting it for me or my family and I made the switch to CS. I attended a 9-month bootcamp and got the job I'm currently at a little over 2 years ago. This means I have 2 years in software work experience but no CS degree on my resume.While my job seems pretty stable right now (at least for this upcoming year), I'm always considering the next steps and the potential for increased pay. That said, I really don't want to take on loads of new debt and derail my financial progress. What is the most cost efficient way to get a more relevant transcript on my resume? I was looking at online options like WGU but I've been told that wasn't well-regarded and is even blacklisted by some companies. Is this true? Are there similar options that are more highly regarded?Just trying to see my best option or if it's even worth pursuing a master's degree right now.

I was at a consulting company so for 8 months or so all I did was training at the company.I really don’t know how to list this on my resume. I tried embellishing my resume but when questioned on a recent interview it was clear I was lying, I genuinely felt like I was gonna pass out from the anxiety.After 1k+ apps and no job, I’m not sure what to do. It’s been over a year since my last job laid me off. I went to a community college and then an online university so my credentials aren’t great. Both degrees are in CS.I was accepted into OMSCS last year but I didn’t attend because I thought it would’ve been smarter to get cloud certs and make projects then mass apply. Well that obviously didn’t work.Now It seems like it’s impossible for me to get a job. Now I’m going to go back to work on a bachelor’s in accounting but I also want to stay relevant in tech. So I’ll be doing two programs part time.I’m thinking of attending OMSCS again or joining UMD as a transfer student and finish a bachelors in information systems.
