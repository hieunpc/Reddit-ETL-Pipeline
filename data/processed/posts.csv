1p7ho3k,Aspiring Data Engineer – should I learn Go now or just stick to Python/PySpark? How do people actually learn the “data side” of Go?,PixelBot_556,dataengineering,"Hi Everyone,I’m fairly new to data engineering (started \~3–4 months ago). Right now I’m:* Learning Python properly (doing daily problems)* Building small personal projects in PySpark using Databricks to get strongerI keep seeing postings and talks about modern data platforms where Go (and later Rust) is used a lot for pipelines, Kafka tools, fast ingestion services, etc. My questions as a complete beginner in this area:1. Is Go actually becoming a “must-have” or a strong “nice-to-have” for data engineers in the next few years, or can I get really far (and get good jobs) by just mastering Python + PySpark + SQL + Airflow/dbt?2. If it is worth learning, I can find hundreds of tutorials for Go basics, but almost nothing that teaches how to work with data in Go – reading/writing CSVs, Parquet, Avro, Kafka producers/consumers, streaming, back-pressure, etc. How did you learn the real “data engineering in Go” part?3. For someone still building their first PySpark projects, when is the realistic time to start Go without getting overwhelmed?I don’t want to distract myself too early, but I also don’t want to miss the train if Go is the next big thing for higher-paying / more interesting data platform roles.Any advice from people who started in Python/Spark and later added Go (or decided not to) would be super helpful.

1p9x52g,Stuck on incremental ETL for a very normalised dataset (multi-hop relationships). Has anyone solved this before?,Dry-Woodpecker9626,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I have an extremely normalised dataset. Way more than I personally like. Imagine something like:movie → version → presentation → external\_idsBut none of the child tables store the movie\_id. Everything is connected through these relationship tables, and you have to hop 3–4 tables to get anything meaningful.Here’s a small example:* movies(movie\_id)* versions(version\_id)* presentations(pres\_id)* external\_ids(ext\_id)  Relationship goesMovie → version → presentation → external\_idI am trying to achieve a denormalised version of this table, like smaller data marts, which makes my life easier for sharing the data downstream. This is just one of the examples; my goal is to create smaller such data marts, so it is easier for me to join on this ID later to get the data I need for downstream consumersA normal full query is fine — Example SELECT  m.movie_id, v.version_id,  p.pres_id,  e.value FROM movies m JOIN movie_to_version mv ON m.movie_id = mv.movie_id JOIN versions v ON mv.version_id = v.version_id JOIN version_to_pres vp ON v.version_id = vp.version_id JOIN presentations p ON vp.pres_id = p.pres_id JOIN pres_to_external pe ON p.pres_id = pe.pres_id JOIN external_ids e ON pe.ext_id = e.ext_id; The actual pain is incremental loading. Like, let’s say something small changes in external\_ids. The row with ext\_id = 999 has been updated.I’d have to basically walk backwards:ext → pres → version → movieThis is just a sample example, in reality, I have more complex cascading joins, I am currently looking at in future around 100 tables to join, not all together, just in all, to create smaller denormalised tables, which I can later use as an intermediate silver layer to create my final gold layer.Also, I need to send incremental changes updated to the downstream database as well, that's another pain in the ass.I’ve thought about:– just doing the reverse join logic inside every dimension (sounds nasty) – maintaining some lineage table like child\_id → movie\_id – or prebuilding a flattened table that basically stores all the hops, so the downstream tables don’t have to deal with the graphBut honestly, I don’t know if I’m overcomplicating it or missing some obvious pattern. We’re on Spark + S3 + Glue Iceberg.Anyway, has anyone dealt with really normalised, multi-hop relationship models in Spark and managed to make incremental ETL sane?",12,0.85,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p9x52g/stuck_on_incremental_etl_for_a_very_normalised/,2025-11-29 19:13:54,2025-12-02 01:44:06

In fact when I brought it up he said that doesn’t exist for SSIS and then I had to say that it existed since 2012 with the project deployment model. This surprised the dba’s boss and it’s fair to say that the dba probably does not like me right now. I will say that I have brought this up to him privately before and he ignored me so my boss decided for us to meet with his boss. I did not try to create drama but make a suggestion to make the prod deployment process smoother.Anyway that happened and now there are discussions for me to maybe just get my own database since the dba doesn’t want to improve systems.

So I built a real time streaming pipeline on it.It ingests live flight data from the OpenSky API (open source and free to use) and pushes it through this data stack: Kafka, Iceberg, DuckDB, Dagster, and Metabase, all running on Kubernetes via Minikube. Here is the GitHub repo: https://github.com/vijaychhatbar/flight-club-data/tree/mainI’ve tried to orchestrate the infrastructure through Taskfile - which uses helmfile approach to deploy all services on minikube. Technically, it should also work on any K8s flavour. All the charts are custom made which can be tailored as per our needs. I found this deployment process to be extremely elegant for managing any K8s apps. :) At a high level, a producer service calls the OpenSky REST API every ~30 seconds, publishes the raw JSON (converted to Avro) into Kafka, and a consumer writes that stream into Apache Iceberg tables which also has schema registry for evolution.I never used dagster before, so I tried to use it to make transformation tables. Also, it uses DuckDB for fast analytic queries. A better approach would be to use dbt on it - but that is something for later.I’ve then used a custom Dockerfile for Metabase to add DuckDB support as the official ones don’t have native DuckDB connection. Technically, you can query directly Iceberg realtime table - which I did to make realtime dashboard in Metabase.I hope this project might be helpful for people who want to learn or tinker with a realistic, end‑to‑end streaming + data lake setup on their own hardware, rather than just hello-world examples.

These DataFrames should undergo an ETL process (especially data type conversions) on every import before being written to the database.My initial approach was to use dbt seeds and/or models.

If not, what alternative tools are suitable (e.g., Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, pandas-based ETL pipelines, etc.)?Previous attempts:\* dbt seed: loads CSV directly into the database → transformations don't work\* dbt models: only work if the data is already in the database, which I want to avoid\* Currently: manual type conversions in Python (float, int, string, datetime)Looking for: Best practices or tool recommendations for directly transforming DataFrames and then loading them into SQLite – with or without dbt.

1p84rmp,"SCD2 in staging table, how to cope with batch loads from sourcesystem",Crazy-Sir5935,dataengineering,"Hi all, N00b alert! We are planning to do a proof of concept and one of the things we want to improve is that currently, we just ingest data directly from our source systems into our staging tables (without decoupling). For reference, we load data on a daily basis, operate in a heavily regulated sector and some of our source systems endpoint only provide batch/full loads (as they do tend to offer CDC on their end points but it only tracks 50% of the attributes making it kind of useless).In our new setup we are considering the following:1. Every extraction gets saved in the source/extraction format (thus JSON or .parquet).2. The extracted files get stored for atleast 3 months before being moved to cold storage (JSON is not that efficient so i guess that will save us some money).3. Everything gets transformed to .parquet4. .parquet files will be stored forever (this is relative but you know what i mean).5. We will make a folder structure for each staging table based on year, month, day etc. So now you understand that we will work with .parquet files. We were considering the new method of append only/snapshot tables (maybe combine it with SC2) as then we could easily load the whole thing again if we mess up and fill in the valid from/valid to dates on basis of a loop. Yet, a couple of our endpoints cause us to have some limitations. Let's consider the following example:1. The source system table logs hours a person logs on a project.2. The data goes back to 2015 and has approximately \~12 mln. records.3. A person can adjust hours going a year back from now (or other columns in the table in the source system).4. The system has audit fields so we could only take changed rows but this only works for 5 out of 20 columns thereby forcing us to do batch loads on a daily basis for a full year back (as we need to be sure to be 100% correct).5. The result is that, after the initial extraction, each day we have a file with logging hours for the last 365 days.**Questions**1. We looked at the snapshot method, but even not looking at the files, this would result in 12 mln records per day added? I'm surely no expert but even with partitioning, this doesn't sound very durable after a year?2. Considering SCD2 for a staging table in this case. How can we approach a scenario in which we would need to rebuild the entire table? As most daily loads consider the last 365 days and approximately 1 million rows, this would be hell of a loop (and i don't want to know how long it's going to take). Would it in this case make sense to make delta parquet's specifically for this scenario so you end up with like 1000 rows a file and making such a scenario easier?We need to be able to pull out 1 PK and see the changes in time for that specific PK without seeing thousands of duplicate rows, that's why we need SCD2 (as f.e. iceberg only shows the whole table in a point of time).

Got a verbal offer for a Data Engineer II role doing Python/PySpark, Databricks, ADF pipelines, ingestion, and medallion architecture, but the role sits fully in the data/analytics org, not engineering, and pays $105–115K (I currently make ~$180K TC in NYC).Trying to figure out whether this DE role meaningfully helps me pivot into SWE/back-end engineering longterm, or if it’s better to stay in my current job, finish MCIT, build projects, and target SWE directly. Looking for input from DEs/SWEs on how transferable this work is, whether the comp is normal for NYC, and what questions I should ask before deciding.Hey everyone, I’m looking for some candid input from folks in data engineering and software engineering.I’m currently in a strategy/operations role at a tech company while working through the MCIT program (Penn’s CS master’s for career switchers). My long term goal is to be a SWE. I recently interviewed for a Data Engineer II position at a healthcare tech company, and im trying to evaluate whether this role would be a good stepping stone to SWE or if I should just leverage my degree and build projects to make the switch. I’d appreciate any honest advice or experience people have.Here are the key details:Background / motivation* I’ve worked strategy consulting and it has led to a good paying career but I don’t care about strategy in all honesty. I dislike the politics to get promoted, work is quite boring where im learning nothing new* I like consulting in the fact that I had to learn a new industry everyday, but TBH I couldn’t deal with 15-16hr workdays just to learn more* I love the technical side and building things which is why I considered SWE about a year and a half ago (I just expected the market to be better by then lolz) Comp* Base salary: $105–115K (Remote but I live in NYC)* Other factors are TBD as I haven’t gotten the formal letter yet, just verbal and what the job description outlines* I currently make 155k base and TC ~180k so it would be a pay cut for this roleTeam / Org Structure* The role sits in the data - analytics org, not the software engineering org* DEs partner with analytics engineers, ML/data consumers, data scientists* I would not be in the analytics engineering track or an analyst, but they would be my stakeholders* No direct SWE involvement as far as I can tellTech + Responsibilities* Mostly Python + PySpark on Databricks* AWS and Azure* Both streaming and batch pipelines* Medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers)* ADF wiring + pipeline orchestration* File ingestion + transformations + schema enforcement* Some framework or pipeline component building, but unclear how deep the engineering side goes* Not much SQL involved, which surprised me, but they emphasized if they were asking for SQL it would be for more analysts vs engineersMy goals / questions:My ultimate target is a technical heavy role that still pays well, like SWE or backend, but I’m also open to becoming a stronger DE if it meaningfully raises my chances of SWE transitioning.Any insights on the following would be helpful:1. Does this sound like a DE role with strong engineering exposure that can help facilitate a SWE transition? 2. How transferable is this experience toward SWE or backend engineering later?3. For those who started in DE and moved into SWE, what allowed that transition?4. Is $105–115K base realistic for NYC in a mid-level DE role, or does that seem low?5. Would you take this role if your long-term goal leaned more toward SWE?6. Anything I should ask the hiring manager or my internal referrer to get more clarity?I’m not trying to bash the role or Data engineering, I’m genuinely trying to understand if this would meaningfully advance my pivot or if im better off staying in my current role and continuing to work on transitioning directly.

Here is what it says: 'The default refresh for a materialized view on serverless attempts to perform an *incremental refresh*. An incremental refresh processes changes in the underlying data after the last refresh and then appends that data to the table. Depending on the base tables and included operations, only certain types of materialized views can be incrementally refreshed. If an incremental refresh is not possible or the connected compute is classic instead of serverless, a full recompute is performed.The output of an incremental refresh and a full recompute are the same. Databricks runs a cost analysis to choose the cheaper option between an incremental refresh and a full recompute.Only materialized views updated using serverless pipelines can use incremental refresh. Materialized views that do not use serverless pipelines are always fully recomputed.When you create materialized views with a SQL warehouse or serverless Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines, Databricks incrementally refreshes them if their queries are supported. If a query uses unsupported expressions, Databricks runs a full recompute instead, which can increase costs.'",2,0.76,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1p9pgml/why_does_materialized_views_in_ldp_behave/,2025-11-29 13:51:53,2025-12-02 01:44:06

1p8ew4k,"Declarative data processing for ""small data""?",lobster_johnson,dataengineering,"I'm working on a project that involves building a kind of world model by analyzing lots of source data with LLMs. I've evaluated a lot of dataproc orchestration frameworks lately — Ray, Prefect, Temporal, and so on.What bugs me is that the appears to be nothing that allows me to construct *declarative*, functional processing.As an extremely naive and simplistic example, imagine a dataset of HTML documents. For each document, we want to produce a Markdown version in a new dataset, then ask an LLM to summarize it. These tools all suggest an imperative approach: Maybe a function `get_input_documents()` that returns HTML documents, then a loop over this to run a conversion function `convert_to_markdown()`, and then a `summarize()` and a `save_output_document()`. With Ray you could define these as _tasks_ and have the scheduler execute them concurrently and distributed over a cluster. You could batch or paginate some things as needed, all easy stuff.In such an imperative world, we might also keep the job simple and simply iterate over the input every time if the processing is cheap enough — dumb is often easier. We could use hashes (for example) to avoid doing work on inputs that haven't changed since the last run, and we could cache LLM prompts. We might do a ""find all since last run"" to skip work. Or plug the input into a queue of changes.All that's fine, but once the processing grows to a certain scale, that's a lot of ""find inputs, loop over, produce output"" stitched together — it's the same pattern over and over again: Mapping and reducing. It's map/reduce but done imperatively.For my purposes, it would be a lot more elegant to describe a full graph of operators and queries.For example, if I declared `bucket(""input/*.html"")` as a source, I could string this into a graph `bucket(""input/*.html"") -> convert_document()`. And then `-> write_output_document()`. An important principle here is that the pipeline only expresses flow, and the scheduler handles the rest: It can parallelize operators, it can memoize steps based on inputs, it can fuse together map steps, it can handle retrying, it can track lineage by encoding what operators a piece of data went through, it can run operators on different nodes, it can place queues between nodes for backpressure, concurrency control, and rate limiting — and so on.Another important principle here is that the pipeline, if properly memoized, can be fully differential, meaning it can know at any given time which pieces of data have changed between operator nodes, and use that property to avoid unnecessary work, skipping entire paths if the output would be identical.I'm fully aware of, and have used, streaming systems like Flink and Spark. My sense is that these are very much made for large-scale Big Data applications that benefit from vectorization and partitioning of columnar data. Maybe they could be used for this purpose, but it doesn't appear like a good fit? My data is complex, often unstructured or graph-like, and is I/O-bound (calling out to LLMs, vector databases, and so on). I haven't really seen this for ""small data"".In many ways, I'm seeking a ""distributed Make"", at least in the abstract. And there is indeed a very neat tool called [SnakeMake](https://snakemake.github.io/) that's a lot like this, which I'm looking into. I'm a bit put off by how it has its own language — I would prefer Python to declare my graph, too — but it looks interesting and worth trying out.

DQ rules apply to the silver or platinum layers, not the gold layer. The gold layer (i.e. the ""golden source"") should be for consumption.3) Any critical data elements should have full lineage tracking of all layers in #2.

1p7bpun,I built an MCP server to connect your AI agents to your DWH,karakanb,dataengineering,"Hi all, this is Burak, I am one of the makers of [Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin). We built an MCP server that allows you to connect your AI agents to your DWH/query engine and make them interact with your DWH.A bit of a back story: we started Bruin as an open-source CLI tool that allows data people to be productive with the end-to-end pipelines. Run SQL, Python, ingestion jobs, data quality, whatnot. The goal being a productive CLI experience for data people.After some time, agents popped up, and when we started using them heavily for our own development stuff, it became quite apparent that we might be able to offer similar capabilities for data engineering tasks. Agents can already use CLI tools, and they have the ability to run shell commands, and they could technically use Bruin CLI as well.Our initial attempts were around building a simple [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) file with a set of instructions on how to use Bruin. It worked fine to a certain extent; however it came with its own set of problems, primarily around maintenance. Every new feature/flag meant more docs to sync. It also meant the file needed to be distributed somehow to all the users, which would be a manual process.We then started looking into MCP servers: while they are great to expose remote capabilities, for a CLI tool, it meant that we would have to expose pretty much every command and subcommand we had as new tools. This meant a lot of maintenance work, a lot of duplication, and a large number of tools which bloat the context.Eventually, we landed on a middle-ground: expose only documentation navigation, not the commands themselves.We ended up with just 3 tools:* `bruin_get_overview`* `bruin_get_docs_tree` * `bruin_get_doc_content` The agent uses MCP to fetch docs, understand capabilities, and figure out the correct CLI invocation. Then it just runs the actual Bruin CLI in the shell. This means less manual work for us, and making the new features in the CLI automatically available to everyone else. You can now use Bruin CLI to connect your AI agents, such as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other agent that supports MCP servers, into your DWH. Given that all of your DWH metadata is in Bruin, your agent will automatically know about all the business metadata necessary. Here are some common questions people ask to Bruin MCP:* analyze user behavior in our data warehouse* add this new column to the table X* there seems to be something off with our funnel metrics, analyze the user behavior there* add missing quality checks into our assets in this pipeline Here's a quick video of me demoing the tool: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=604wuKeTP6U)All of this tech is fully open-source, and you can run it anywhere.

All of a sudden, there is 1 value (or maybe hundreds of values) that are NULL for userid (out of millions). We have to change userid to be nullable or use an unknown identifier (-1, 'unknown') etc. This reduces our DQ visibility and constraints at the table level. so then we have to set up post-load tests to check if missing values are beyond a certain threshold (e.g. 1%). And even then, sometimes 1% isn't enough for the upstream client to prioritize and make fixes. the issue is more challenging bc we have dozens of clients and so the threshold might be slightly different per client. This is compounded bc it's like this for every other DQ check... orders with a userid populated but we don't have the userid in users table (broken relationship).. usually just tiny percentage.

1paixj7,Rest API design,EcstaticJob347,learnprogramming,"Hey, I’ve been building my REST API and recently stumbled upon a design problem. I’m working on an app for managing a car repair shop. I currently have a few routes, such as:* `/api/clients`* `/api/cars`* `/api/car`* `/api/jobs-histories` (where we store each car’s repair history)Recently, my frontend developer asked me to create an endpoint that would allow him to **send a client and a car in a single request**, and also to **fetch a client and their car in a single request**. Now I’m wondering how to handle this in a RESTful way.I’ve considered several options, but none of them seem ideal:1. Allow passing a car object to the `/clients` route so that both objects are created together. But this feels wrong because the operation is supposed to create only a client, not a client and a car.2. Introduce a new route like `/api/registration`. But the name feels misleading, and creating a new representation for every such scenario seems odd.3. Add some kind of action endpoint like `/api/client/with-car`, but this looks like an anti-pattern since verbs should not appear in REST endpoints.4. Create a generic actions/transactions endpoint like `/api/actions` or `/api/transactions` and put things like `/api/actions/client-with-car` under it. But this also feels like an anti-pattern.Do you have any tips on which approach I should take? What is the correct way to solve this in a RESTful manner? UPDATE:Hey guys, I think I’ve found a way to address this. Thanks for all the answers.The frontend needed this additional query mostly for convenience and to reduce latency in the app plus to make operation easier for frontend. After thinking about it, I realized that the first solution isn’t as bad as I initially thought. It’s actually quite reasonable: the **Client** is an aggregate root and it owns the **Car**, so creating both in a single request is acceptable(car as optional param)I can also later support an `include` query parameter that allows the caller to decide whether they want the client returned with the car or not. This makes the route much more flexible and makes the entire API more expressive, because we’re not creating artificial endpoints for every possible data representation.I think that API should describe **business entities**, not implementation details (like different representations of the same thing). So I’ll go with the first solution.Thanks for all the answers!",46,0.92,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1paixj7/rest_api_design/,2025-11-30 13:59:00,2025-12-02 01:44:07

It’s one thing to memorize that Quicksort is O(n log n), but it’s another thing to actually see how it partitions an array compared to how Bubble sort slowly crawls to the finish line.I was inspired by an old terminal-based visualizer I saw years ago, so I decided to build a modern web version to help people visualize these concepts. I ended up writing a comprehensive guide covering 25 different algorithms, including:- The Classics: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick.- The Modern Standards: Timsort (used in Python) and Introsort (used in C++).- The Weird Ones: Pancake Sort, Gnome Sort, and the chaotic Bogo Sort.",24,0.95,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6g5xj/i_used_to_be_a_ta_and_students_always_struggled/,2025-11-25 15:59:07,2025-12-02 01:44:07

It’s disheartening when I look at threads on this reddit or hear programmers speak about things I literally don’t now a tad about. Because I wanna get to that level and have the drive to do so but not the direction or the patience.I have a ton of motivation and everyday I wake up and try to understand the concepts in OOP (also my next assessment for another topic is due soon which is data structures and algorithms and I’m quite behind because I’ve been focused on this).This just feels like a lost cause I feel like throwing the towel in, I get it’s hard and it’s only going to get harder that’s the point.

1p9uf6a,Best stack for personal project,Ill-Floor6264,learnprogramming,"I’m more of a beginner who’s just starting to learn to code, using AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) as “training wheels” while I learn fundamentals along the way. In February I’ll start studying at a university where I’ll be surrounded by people who really know software engineering and are happy to help me, so I’ll have good support in real life as well.I have a big long-term project in mind and I’d love your advice on the best technical foundation so I don’t have to switch stacks later.What I want to buildI want to create my own “personal operating system” for ultra high performance, with:A fully custom calendar (not Google Calendar) where I can plan my days, weeks, and months.Project and task management (similar to a mix of Notion / Asana) with goals, priorities, and deadlines.Meditation module with different practices and routines that I can schedule, track, and reflect on.Fitness and sleep integrations using APIs like WHOOP and Oura to pull in data on recovery, strain, sleep quality, etc.A system for goal setting, tracking, and reflection (short-, mid-, and long-term goals).An AI “specialist agent team” for different domains (energy management, focus, planning, reflection, learning, etc.).A main AI “orchestrator” that:Has access to my data (calendar, tasks, biometrics, notes, habits, etc.).Tracks my patterns over time.Gives me suggestions on how to structure my days/weeks, improve performance, and recover better.Dashboards that combine:My current energy / recovery state.Upcoming tasks and projects.Sleep and training history.AI-generated insights and recommendations.On top of that, I have a strong interest in beliefs, mindset, identity, and habits of highly successful people. I want a feature where I can:Store detailed notes about successful people (beliefs, identity, habits, principles, etc.).Have these notes automatically processed into a meta-dashboard that shows common patterns across many people (like an evolving “success blueprint” for myself).Store lots of notes in a flexible way (somewhat Notion-like), with tagging, search, and later analysis by AI.Design requirementsDesign is very important to me:It should look and feel premium, very smooth and beautiful.I want full theming, especially light, dark, and maybe a “galaxy / universe” style theme (I like the look of tools like Comet).I care a lot about micro-interactions, animations, and the general “feel” of the app, not just functionality.Other notes:I don’t want to constantly change programming languages later if I can avoid it. I know migrations are possible, but I’d like to pick a stack that can scale with me from “learning projects” to something potentially serious.I’m okay with starting web-first (desktop browser), and maybe adding mobile later once the core works.Of course I am sure I will have more ideas on what to add in the future so I want the possibility to do so and not be limited by my stack.What I’m currently thinkingRight now, I’m leaning towards:Frontend: React (with something like Tailwind + a modern UI library such as shadcn/ui / MUI / similar for beautiful, customizable components and theming).Backend: Node.js with Express (or maybe NestJS later) for APIs.Database / backend-as-a-service: something like Supabase or Firebase for auth, database, and possibly real-time features.AI layer: calling external APIs (OpenAI / Claude etc.), possibly adding a separate Python microservice later for heavier analysis / agents if needed.My questions to you:What do you think about React + Node.js as the core stack for this kind of project, given that I’m a beginner but will use AI coding assistance and have access to knowledgeable students at university?Are there any major reasons I should consider a different stack (for example, Python + Django, Next.js fullstack, something else) for this type of long-term personal system?From a long-term perspective (maybe turning this into a real product if it gets good), is React + Node + Postgres a solid foundation, or would you pick something else today?Thank you for any advice, architecture ideas, or “don’t do this, you’ll regret it later” warnings.",20,0.74,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p9uf6a/best_stack_for_personal_project/,2025-11-29 17:22:35,2025-12-02 01:44:07

Of course this is not needed for AND, NOT and OR but still these basic three where not trivial either for me . Anyway, this is just a rant.

1p7ax9h,Naming Things in really complex situations and as codebase size increases and glossry for common terms.,Dizzy-Complaint-8871,learnprogramming,"Naming has become a real challenge for me. It’s easy when I’m following a YouTube tutorial and building mock projects, but in real production projects it gets difficult. In the beginning it’s manageable, but as the project grows, naming things becomes harder.For example, I have various formatters. A formatter takes a database object—basically a Django model instance—and formats it. It’s similar to a serializer, though I have specific reasons to create my own instead of using the built-in Python or Django REST Framework serializers. The language or framework isn’t the main point here; I’m mentioning them only for clarity.So I create one formatter that returns some structured data. Then I need another formatter that returns about 80% of the same data, but with slight additions or removals. There might be an order formatter, then another order formatter with user data, another one without the “order received” date, and so on. None of this reflects my actual project—it’s not e-commerce but an internal tool I can’t discuss in detail—but it does involve many formatters for different use cases. Depending on the role, I may need to send different versions of order data with certain fields blank. This is only the formatter situation.Then there are formatters that include user roles, order formatters that also include product details, and other combinations. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to separate order and product formatters, but in rare cases I need a product formatter with only an order number or something similar, so I end up creating another formatter because the original one didn’t include it.Beyond formatters, naming functions, classes, methods, getters, and setters also becomes difficult. I know that when naming becomes hard, it may indicate that the code isn’t following the Single Responsibility Principle. But I’m not always sure how to handle this.For example, I might be building an interface that lets users update their data. An admin can update emails, phone numbers, and roles, but a regular user can only update their name. This leads to functions like `update_user_with_role`, `update_user_normal`, `update_user_with_email`, and so on.Most of my projects have role-based access control, and different roles can view or update different fields. Sometimes even the displayed values differ. For example, if an admin views an order, they might see quantity 100, but a vendor might see quantity 70 because the order is split between two vendors. That means writing multiple getters, different database queries, and various ways of manipulating the data. This leads to many functions and a lot of naming decisions.Inside a single function, I often deal with dictionaries (like objects in JavaScript). I might fetch raw data from the database, give it a long descriptive name, remove some parts, process it again, and so on. I end up naming the same dictionary multiple times in different forms, and the names become long and messy. I’m unsure what the right approach is here.Tutorials usually cover only obvious examples aimed at beginners. They say things like “If you calculate tax, call it `calculate_tax`,” which is obvious. But my real-world cases aren’t that simple. If discounts depend on user roles, sure, the logic should be inside the function, but I still need to express it clearly. I also don’t want to get stuck overthinking names because that delays the project.Name collisions happen a lot. For example, I once wrote a function called `get_user` to fetch a user by ID. Later I needed to fetch users by email, username, and other fields. I ended up writing multiple versions, and the original vague name became a problem because it was created early in the project. I eventually renamed it, but it was painful. That’s why I want a better approach from the start so I don’t spend hours worrying about names.Sometimes it feels easier to write the logic itself. I never use meaningless names like `a` or `x1`, but I do end up writing temporary or placeholder names like “this\_has\_to\_be\_renamed”. Then I move on to the next function and write “this\_is\_not\_right\_first\_has\_to\_be\_renamed”, and so on. These names aren’t helpful, but they let me continue writing code without getting stuck on naming.So I’m looking for any guide, project, or glossary I can refer to—something with common naming patterns. For instance, I used words like “collection” or “group” earlier, but “batch” made more sense in my context. I’ve used AI suggestions often; sometimes they help, sometimes they produce vague names because they don’t have the full context.I’m not sure if there is any practical guide, but if there is, please share it. Or share any tips that can help me improve. Naming shouldn’t be something that holds me back; I’d rather focus on the logic instead.

1p6sdl5,Image Blurring algorithm,Several-Airline-5065,learnprogramming,"I recently wrote an image blurring algorithm that uses a basic approach that I learned in my computational physics course in college. Basically, pixels in an image are selected at random, and its RGB values are averaged with the RBG values of all pixels immediately round it. When this happens, the selected pixel (""pixel"" is an object I created) is also set to ""processed"" meaning this pixel has already been worked on, don't perform the averaging operation on it again. This implies that the random selector method I'm using can choose any pixel it wants to while running, so multiple pixels get selected multiple times. This is inefficient. How could I also exclude them from the set of values the random method can select? I was thinking about putting all the pixel values in a linked list and then knocking them out that way with a checkinlist(pixel) method, but maybe a hash table would be better?",6,0.8,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6sdl5/image_blurring_algorithm/,2025-11-25 23:42:48,2025-12-02 01:44:07
1pajb1f,Feedback on my slot machine,finnlinn69,learnprogramming,"Hi, I'm taking a mandatory programming class in uni (even tho I've been coding for the past 4 years) and for my final project I decided to code a realistic slot machine simulator (a console app). I would like some feedback on my work if possible.For a little context, I decided to do a 3-reel game in C#. I generaterate a random number between 1 and 116 and print out a line from my reel set files corresponding to that number (I have 3 files each for one reel set and there's one symbol/emoji on each line). Then I compare the emojis printed out to see if it's a matchMy biggest concern is that for every 100 spins, I win 1-2 times. Is it too low? I fear it is, do I fix it by editing my reel sets?As for my reel sets, my approach isn't traditional (from what I've seen). I decided not to include empty/blank spaces on my reel sets, I rather just made a 116 rows long reel sets with symbols on each row.https://preview.redd.it/n7s0ymdvb04g1.png?width=170&format=png&auto=webp&s=61006f7c1aaa160f50d091513d8d63e04be49780https://preview.redd.it/xnr6yesxb04g1.png?width=145&format=png&auto=webp&s=f326f1a01a621345546203c1cdd571c4e6fe46a6https://preview.redd.it/75whbnlzb04g1.png?width=173&format=png&auto=webp&s=4427fb131a39d777da727102bbeb9d3fcdcd2be1What are y'alls thoughts?PS: I study mathematical engineering and I'm thinking of pursuing a path of math in gambling",5,0.78,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pajb1f/feedback_on_my_slot_machine/,2025-11-30 14:16:05,2025-12-02 01:44:07

1p62h5i,What I Learnt while building a puzzle solving chrome extension for LinkedIn,good_to_have,learnprogramming,"I’ve been experimenting with LinkedIn’s mini-games recently, and I got curious about how some of the puzzles actually work behind the scenes. A few of them felt like they relied a bit too much on trial and error, so I turned that curiosity into a small side project. I built a browser extension that reads the puzzle when you open it, figures out the pattern, and then gives hints or can even solve it automatically. Right now it only works with the “Zip” puzzle, but I’m planning to expand it as I go.While building this, I ended up learning way more than I expected. I got a much better understanding of how Chrome extensions are structured, how to use content scripts to interact with a page, and how to scrape and interpret the DOM in a way that doesn’t break when the site loads things dynamically. I also had to figure out how to design simple pattern-recognition logic, handle communication between different parts of the extension, and work through a bunch of timing issues that I’d never really run into before. Publishing it taught me how the Chrome Web Store process works too. Overall, it was a fun reminder that small projects are often the best way to learn things you didn’t even know you needed.If anyone wants to take a look or offer feedback, here’s the extension on the Chrome Web Store:https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkedin-puzzle-cracker/immohpcmpcbpfbepgkjacopkajnllpak",6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p62h5i/what_i_learnt_while_building_a_puzzle_solving/,2025-11-25 03:51:48,2025-12-02 01:44:07

1p6sep4,How do you effectively compare yourself/study other programmers to find out shortcomings?,tree332,learnprogramming,"I often take advice too literally and get confused on how I should specifically structure my agenda when learning formal math, programming, and computer science. I've made a lot of poor assumptions and ended up in a bottleneck where I'm not really improving in any of these three sectors listed within computational mathematics/CS or software engineering. Because software engineering is usually an asynchronous isolated discipline it's hard to figure out what I am doing wrong and what other people are doing right, especially since people like to summarize and avoid being pedantic, but I don't always know what people mean by their advice. Sometimes I wish I could watch other people develop software or solve algorithmic in real time, read their notes and their learning journey in a biographical timeline. When I try to ask other students they might say ""I learnt from a young age from parents or other tutors"", or that ""they made projects that they liked and just coded a lot"", I don't really get to observe the specifics of what they're doing the way you can study someone when they're playing a sport or some other visible activity. I was told mathematics was the main foundation behind computer science that is mainly unchanging compared to programming languages, libraries and toolkits which change constantly, I thought it would be best if I invested most of my time into studying math while taking 'intro to CS' and intro to 'x programming language tutorials', just trying to focus on passing my CS degree and computational mathematics first before exploring a specific software engineering discipline.I thought that once I understood the mathematics understanding how to translate concepts into code would be as straightforward as making functions for arithmetic operations or other ideas people intuitively understand. But if you brought a mathematician with no programming experience in a structured course they would not understand how to program an addition function in python or C++ either.I should not have focused so much on math and expected the information to immediately convert to programming skill or at least make the implementation side obvious. In my intro to DSA class we didn’t even use discrete math or linear algebra, so there was no reason to take all 3 classes at the same time with no way to tie the classes together, but the curriculum made me do this. Eventually in my classes I reached a point where I was told despite how much I tried to study the math and computer science concepts in pseudocode, I couldn't implement anything, i couldn't code. I was confused as I tried to engage as much as I could in my intro to x language-intermediate x language classes, asking questions, going to office hours(which in intermediate java for example was usually swamped because we were given 'real projects'/'toy projects' as assignments after going over a small topic in class, and the professor told us to figure it out)When I asked how I should have learnt to code I was told to mainly ""make more personal projects from scratch"" and just to ""code more"" I wasn't sure where that meant for me to start. While I knew I was hardly software engineer material, I thought I was at least making enough progress to code the computer science concepts in my classes but I wasn't, especially since we didn't focus on literal technical problems but toy projects/ ""real world scenarios"" using the algorithm in ways that we couldn't directly google because it was a unique scenario project, and we didn't actually code in class because we were told ""I'm not teaching you how to program, I'm teaching you computer science."" Should I do leetcode and seek computational problems to solve? I tried that and I was no more prepared for the mini software assignments given in class. Should I choose a specific field of software engineering and just start learning the tools through example projects before branching off into my own project ideas? A lot of the programming libraries/tools were too niche and abstract, taking away time trying to study a specific library itself rather than the programming/ software engineering principles I was trying to gain from practicing programming with those tools to apply to my classes.I tried to read books on software design, but the books talked more about general project cycle principles such as readable and reusable code, good documentation, but computer architecture talked about low level concepts such as the ALU of which studying wasn't helping me program any better at the time nor did I fully understand. I started trying to program projects from my imagination, especially since I was told ""don't use tutorials, code from scratch, employers don't care about clone/derivate projects"" which always ended up with me taking a bunch of notes on the documentation trying to study what enumeration is or watching a bunch of mini tutorials on different classes in a toolkit I thought might be relevant to my project for weeks on end, with no actual progress on the project being made, just dismembered pieces of code in test files which I definitely can't put on my resume either.",4,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6sep4/how_do_you_effectively_compare_yourselfstudy/,2025-11-25 23:44:07,2025-12-02 01:44:07

1p8xwho,Aspiring programmer having a mini meltdown. Need advice.,AdventurousCow7821,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, I’m a CS student from Korea and I think I’m having a mini-crisis, so I’m just gonna dump everything here.:upside-down_face: I’m about to take my final exams for my last semester, and honestly… I feel like I learned nothing this year. We did databases, OS, Python, C — but none of it feels like it actually stayed in my brain. I love learning new things, but when it comes to applying them in real work, I’m pretty terrible. Before this, I worked full-time doing photo editing and product upload stuff. My actual skills were fine, but I was \*slow\*, and I got yelled at a lot because of it. And being slow is basically a crime in real jobs. So now I’m worried — if I struggled with that, how am I supposed to survive in IT, where deadlines are everything? So yeah. I’m low-key scared I might just be bad at programming.During winter break (3 months), I’m planning to self-study like crazy to catch up. Stuff like: \- reviewing C (loops, ifs, pointers, arrays — basically everything I should already know but don’t :loudly_crying_face:) \- rewriting C logic in Python to understand better \- studying English \- using AI tools to learn more \- and drawing again, because I used to draw before getting into design I checked my old drawings recently and realized I’ve never finished a single one — everything is just rough sketches I abandoned. So my goal is simply: finish one drawing. Doesn’t matter if it’s good. Just finish something for once.If I still have time, I want to build small personal projects. Like maybe a simple random item drop generator for a game or something. If anyone has ideas for super beginner-friendly projects that only use loops + if-statements, I’d really appreciate it.:clapping_hands: Also… for the self-taught programmers out there: How did you actually learn?

1p8ebok,"School, teens, programming, and my frustrations",Goldenskyofficial,learnprogramming,"Every school break, I finally get the chance to dive into programming the way I want to. I make real progress, I build things, I feel motivated as hell. But the moment school starts again, everything falls apart. I barely touch code, I lose consistency, and by the time the next break arrives, I feel like I have to relearn half the stuff I already knew.It’s frustrating because I actually love programming and the math behind it — it’s the one thing that really clicks for me — but the school system forces me to spend most of my time studying subjects I honestly don’t care about. Biology, geography, or whatever. They’re fine, but they don’t move me toward the future I actually want. They suck all life out of me.Here’s where I feel stuck:The safer option basically involves me staying in the more academic track. But there’s also a more practical track with a computer science option that seems like it would fit me better. I’m tempted by it… but people around me keep telling me not to go there. They say “that’s where the loud teens who got expelled went,” or “the curriculum isn’t good,” but the thing is — they don’t actually know. It’s all rumors, and I can’t tell if switching would help me or completely screw me long-term. I can still do university after this track, but people say it's difficult because the academic track teaches you how to process stupidly large amounts of information and study. I think I'm fine if I catch up on all the math myself.At the same time, I keep hearing that the programming market is oversaturated, everyone wants to code now, etc. So I’m also second-guessing myself there. Am I wasting my time? Or should I push through because I’m genuinely passionate about this?Honestly, I just want one full year of being able to truly focus on programming so I can grow without losing everything the second school starts again. But that obviously isn’t happening anytime soon.I’m really confused and stuck between all these choices — school tracks, university prep, trying to stay consistent, trying not to fall behind.Has anyone else dealt with this?How do you stay consistent during the school year?Does switching to a more practical track hurt your future?Is the job market actually that bad, or is it just fearmongering?Any real advice or experiences would help a lot.

So I built a small adaptive learning system on top of an LLM that tries to sit in the middle.The system does three things very strictly:* Error-driven feedback: When you ask for help with your code, the AI prints your code with line numbers and only points to “Line X – syntax error / structure error / logic error / input error”. No full solutions unless you explicitly ask after you’ve tried to fix it.* Maximum 2 new concepts per lesson: Each learning unit is allowed to introduce at most two new commands or ideas. If a lesson needs more than that, it’s automatically split into smaller sub-lessons. The idea is to manage cognitive load instead of throwing everything at you at once.* Reflection and tracking: After each session, there’s a short reflection (what was hard, what worked, what to focus on next), and the system tracks goals, progress, and repeated error types.Right now it’s wired for Python (loops, input, error handling, functions, lists, etc.), but the structure is generic: goals (G##), lessons (L## / W## / T##), a command tracker, error plan, progress tracking, learning log. You could in principle swap the content and use the same engine for other things (language learning, math, etc.).The whole thing is:* A GitHub template repo* No personal data included* Documented so you can understand and change the rulesRepo: [https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-](https://github.com/Tobzu/-adaptive-learning-system-)I’d love feedback on:* Whether this kind of “error-only” feedback actually helps learning* How you would extend or simplify it for beginners* Any ideas for good Python goals/lessons that fit the “max 2 new concepts” rule",3,0.8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p6n6ma/i_built_an_adaptive_errordriven_python_learning/,2025-11-25 20:16:09,2025-12-02 01:44:07

I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.I feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.Hence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.Thanks for reading and your help.",5,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p66bjw/need_help_picking_a_book_on_fundamental_computer/,2025-11-25 07:29:53,2025-12-02 01:44:07

I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.**Stats:**\-TC: Years 1-4: 248k -> 276k -> 303k -> 330k (Includes estimate of guaranteed refreshers)\-High level role with mostly design + telling other devs what to create, less coding\-4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins. On call for overseas folks 8-10PM. + Occasional travel overseas to india.\-highly rated on glassdoor, low layoffs compared to peers\-incredibly smart EE folks with buncha guys PhD from MIT in Physics\-I studied EE in college but pivoted to FE dev and now this is almost going back to my roots.Interview:\-I didn't even expect a call back, the position seemed out of my league, but behold, i did. Told recruiter my background in FE dev, not a pro UIUX designer but i know the concepts and i work with them. Said he'll get back to me and the next week they want me for a GIGA HARDCORE FINAL ROUND with 6 directors/vps/staff engineers. 6 1:1's PLUS a presentation to all 6.Oh my god I’ve never got grilled on UX design this hard in my life. One of the directors (PhD from MIT) asked me: Say aliens are invading earth. You need to design a control panel for a missile defense system that is user friendly to the operators. Button? Console; command line etc? What’s the design like, how about communication? How do u communicate to others, alarm system? Should there be a mute button? If the operator is in a hurry and needs split second decision how do u ensure the cleanest UI design? Security?Another director (ex-AWS) asked: Say u have a data center with servers and switches that transmit data, but data can be failed / low quality / bad transmission, design a gui for this.VP asked me: Say there’s a bar graph. X axis is quality and Y is number of items. Title of graph is “amount of items of various qualities over the past 24 hours”. Now, we don’t like this presentation and instead want the X axis to be time. But we still want to show the data for quality/# , so we’re adding another data point. How do we display the graph now?Staff FE dev grilled me on js fundamentals such as closures and promises. I fumbled on a few questions but managed to get most, explaining thought process.Crazy interviews, hiring manager told me as a closing thought ""This position is challenging to fill"" and i had that thought RACING in my head 24/7. what could it mean? Did he like me and i'm a contender? Or did it mean ""this is a tough role to pass""; i asked chatGPT and it said ""THIS IS A HUGE GREEN SIGNAL"" i was like lolwut really? ok then!Week later recruiter emails me ""I wanted to connect with you regarding feedback and next steps"" im like NEXT STEPS?? GG? lets fkin goooooooooo. and boom offer.Craziest part is i couldn't prepare for these UI questions, came leftfield, i just winged it and somehow i had enough intuition to pass them. Recruiter told me many candidates were able to pass coding, but struggled/froze on the Design Mission Control System design question. I guess i have some semblance of talent in UI design?\----Some FE coding questions I had this year:**Discord -** tech screen - failedCreate a UI for a formula parser that has fields a, b, c. You can type numbers in the field and the output of the fields would be those numbers, but you can also type letters in the fields and they would add up the numbers stored. For example in field A if you type 3 the output of field A is 3. Then if you type A in field B the output of B is 3. In field C if you type in AB you get 6 (3+3) the reqs were so ambiguous so it took me awhile to understand the problem. NO AI, write on own IDE with screenshare.**Crunchyroll** \- tech screen - passedCreate a react app that renders a collection of anime titles and its image, from json data;for(var i=0; i<5; i++) setTimeOut console.log(i) ""trick"" question whats the output and why?**Crunchyroll -** final coding round - failedPolyfill the ""getElementsByClassName"" function. Aced system design though, the interviewer was impressed.**Walmart -** tech screen - ghostedWrite a ""deepclone"" function that copies an object with variable depth and contains anything, including other objects, arrays etc.**Oracle -** tech screen - failed (passed question but they chose another candidate with more backend exp)Create a react app that displays a credit card, with buttons to switch which cc to view, cc data comes from json. Clicking on cc will replace the text with X's- X's correspond to how many words there are, so FIRST LASTNAME will be XXXX XXXX.**Anduril -** tech screen - failed You know in your IDE the directory structure, with folders and files?

However, FE dev compensation is still competitive, u just needa know so much.I'm not incredibly smart or talented, most other engineers are more brilliant than I.

Kickbacks may hit spouse accounts as “consulting fees,” or come as all-expenses-paid Vegas/Hawaii retreats, plus holiday hampers and gift cards. * **Middle Management (VPs/Directors)**: They steer SOWs and contracts to “preferred vendors” – think brother-in-law’s startup – for their cut. * **Lower Levels (Managers/Devs)**: Free conference passes with airfare, SWAG-stuffed goodie bags, vendor open bars, and hackathon gift cards are routine “*appreciation*.”This stuff feels like par for the course in IT, even as companies preach zero tolerance.

I am in UAE and theres almost no market for freshers. I was a Top graduate at my uni and I feel that means nothing cause I feel I still hadn't learned anything. I have been just trying for internships(even unpaid) and Junior roles. I just want to get some real world experience. I have lost hope and losing interest in the field. I feel my projects are shit and theres no point to them. I think even moving to different countries will not help at this point due to the large gap in my cv. I am considering doing a masters in some business related field in some other country for a fresh start. I am very grateful to my parents for supporting me but I just feel like a deadweight which I am.

1p914ke,What Market Comp Means,SuhDudeGoBlue,cscareerquestions,"I've been pretty active on both sides of the hiring/interviewing gauntlet for the last few months, and just wanted to share the following thoughts on what I believe are some huge misconceptions around compensation (that candidates, recruiters, companies, and other have).1. Engineers are not commodities. We are non-fungible and there are HUGE differences in the amount of value we can bring, even when you try to classify us into strata like junior, middle, senior, staff, etc. Engineers are more like real estate. There can be huge differences in pricing for a 1500 sqft abode, depending on factors like location, build, amenities, etc.2. Not every company can make the same use of a talented engineer. Just because you are worth $500k at Citadel does not mean Walgreens can realistically get as much value out of you.These 2 realities result in interesting dynamics, where one company may pay their junior engineers more than another company on the same street pays their principal engineers. Both may be acting rationally. It also results in some interesting dynamics where a junior engineer may thumb their nose at opportunities that may be a huge step up in title and responsibilities, and they are acting rationally too.3. The above should make you question the concept of ""market pay"". It is not a meaningful measure. However, if you want to use it, do not use job posting data to figure out ""market pay"". A job posting is an \*unfilled\* role. There are 2 good sources of ""market pay"". 1. Current pay of employed engineers in a similar role and setting. and 2. Recent offers that are accepted by engineers for a similar role and setting. The latter is a better/more effective measure for evaluating a new role as a candidate / determining how to budget for a role you are trying to hire for.",32,0.9,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p914ke/what_market_comp_means/,2025-11-28 17:45:47,2025-12-02 01:44:08

I casually searched for around 5-6 months, really only applying to things that looked interesting, or any interesting recruiter reach out.My Results:[https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png](https://i.imgur.com/gjJvgQ5.png)*Note: these are a bit general numbers. This happened over a few months, so might be +/- one or two things I forgot about*In general, I was pretty selective. I had a few dozen recruiter's message me, but only took 10 or so calls. Most were from in office startups that I had no interest in, or non tech companies which I wasn't really interested in.Some notes on my search\- I make around 220k base at my current position, so any job needed to match that number (TC-wise anyway) \- I preferred remote, but for large public tech companies, was open to moving. But any startup needed to be remote (Unless something like OpenAI, etc, which of course didn't happen) \- Needed to be at least a tech forward company \- I only responded to first party recruiters \- I refuse to do take-home assessments \- I didn't do any interview prep for any of these, so my failure rate was a bit high\--In terms of general hiring vibes, I'd say the biggest difference was in the recruiter/HM screens, much more selective there, probably due to how easy it is to AI generate a reasonable looking resume now. I've pretty much never been rejected at that stage, but did end up getting rejected a couple times from HM's after the recruiter screens.Likewise, a few companies also wanted to do take home assessments before even going to the normal techs screens.

1pbca1r,We’re heading into a society of less thinking.,SystemIntuitive,cscareerquestions,"Hi,AI is already reshaping how we think. The brain runs on a simple principle: use it or lose it. Whenever a tool automates a skill, the neural circuitry behind that skill weakens over time. We’ve seen this with GPS and navigation ability, calculators and mental arithmetic, spell check and spelling. AI is now scaling that effect across almost every domain.The next generation of workers will grow up in a radically different cognitive environment. A huge part of what we call ""skill"" is repeated cognitive strain, and AI removes that strain.Critical thinking follows the same rule as physical training: stop working the muscle and it atrophies. If you skip the gym for 6 months, your body changes; skip mental effort for 6 months, your mind changes.Problem solving won’t decline because people are getting “dumber,” but because the incentives to think deeply are disappearing. When an answer is always one prompt away, the cognitive machinery for generating answers naturally weakens.It creates a double bind:1. Use AI heavily and you outsource your thinking. 2. Avoid AI and you risk falling behind everyone who does.We’ve never faced a technological shift that directly competes with our core cognitive processes. As experienced workers with decades of intuition retire, we may end up with a workforce whose baseline thinking is increasingly shaped and limited by the tools they rely on.If this trajectory continues, we’re heading toward a society where AI performs most of the critical thinking, and humans gradually lose the habit and even the ability to do it themselves.",21,0.63,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pbca1r/were_heading_into_a_society_of_less_thinking/,2025-12-01 13:06:00,2025-12-02 01:44:08

That was not the job I wanted but I accepted the offer as they offered me a really good salary so that I could finally leave my mother who struggled with addiction. 3 months after that my country (Russia) started the war in Ukraine. My company offered everyone relocation to the UK with a relocation agreement so that one will have to work for them for 2 years. I thought that this would be my last chance to get out of the country and decided to go for it. So, it’s been 4 years since I’ve been working for them doing mostly SAS and R programming. With the recent change of rules in the UK I will not be able to get the residency here and, therefore, right to work. No one in my company has been promoted in the past 3 years and so I am still Junior Programmer and can’t meet the salary threshold requirement. In other European countries I will also need a visa. Unfortunately, during these years I dragged behind the market massively. I have been mostly producing outputs (datasets, tables, listing and a little bit of graphs) using SAS and R (fortunately mostly R in the past 2 years). We also finally stated to use Git/gitlab 2 years ago. I really want to get out of this job and switch to something more in demand.

1p8azzg,Is this normal or am I the problem?,Theprocastinator213,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR at the bottom.I joined a start up about 8 months ago and it hasn’t been going well. I’ve been having a lot of trouble with different teams and the codebase, and I’m looking for an outside perspective on whether this is common or if I’m contributing to problem.Some background:-I have 3 YoE, mid level SWE, this is my first tech company. -The company has this product with multiple teams working on different parts of it.-My role requires me to work on the product in other team’s domain and set up integrations. -The company has about 500 employees and is doing quite well. From the start, I was having a difficult time working with the team that maintains the core code of the product since the manager on that team can be pretty aggressive and difficult to work with (not just my experience, have heard from multiple people about this). The code isn’t that great either, hard to reason about, plenty of side effects, hard to test, and PR reviews tend to focus on superficial code styling vs catching issues and forward thinking (another opinion shared by others). From what I see, there isn’t a big initiative to fix or improve things but rather keep patching on top of it, and a lot of people dislike that team’s work as they have to use it and deal with the problems.This has made it so that the features I have worked on have been quite messy and buggy, where I’m constantly at odds trying to do my work in the best way but constantly have to implement workarounds or just do more work outside of scope so it doesn’t completely break. I’m always waking up to messages to fix things or staying up late to debug (not just my work), there are features that have had the same bug for months that I haven’t been allowed to fix. I have started to slow down, constantly review my work, afraid that I’ll cause another issue and have to deal with 20 slack messages the next day. All of this has taken a toll on me where I’m regularly stressed and frustrated by what’s going on and what I’m doing.I used to be very excited but nowadays I’m quite drained by the experience, I don’t work on side projects anymore and have started to stop caring about what I work on. I understand that start ups have problems but I don’t mind usual start up problems, I’m used to working a lot and moving quickly. My manager is great and we talk often, he agrees that things are messed up and says I’m doing fine, but I certainly don’t feel that way. I’ve noticed that I have reverted back to a junior mindset of slowing down my pace, staying silent in meetings, and constantly checking in with my manager because I can’t trust the work I do to not fail, yet it still does.Is this a normal thing? I am very open to feedback and everyone I talk to says that I’m doing well and things are messy, but I seriously feel like I haven’t progressed in any way since I’ve started working here and have gotten worse.TL;DR: Mid-level SWE (3 YoE, first tech company) at a ~500-person startup, 8 months in. My work depends on a messy, hard-to-test codebase owned by a difficult manager, so my work ends up buggy, I’m constantly firefighting, and I’m losing confidence and motivation even though my own manager says I’m doing fine.

1p6yuph,Been at my company for 8 years.. It now feels unsecure.. I feel like I only know how to work at my company though..,dj292,cscareerquestions,"A little backstory about myself..Prior to my job now I was working HVAC for about 6 years, to say the least I was miserable.. Hated my boss, hated just feeling like I wasn't doing any fulfilling, hated that someone said I was going to be a lifer.. Fast forward too 2018, I took the leap, after doing some code academy and attempting to teach myself the basics of code, I applied and was accepted to do a 12 week immersive web dev program in Boston (General Assembly). Right before going to this program, my girlfriend at the time was a dental hygienist, she was making small talk with a client and he mentioned he was a software engineer. She mentioned how i was going to be going to an immersive program in Boston, he gave her his number for me to contact him, i did, we met up for coffee and talked goals and web dev in general. Fast forward to the 10th week of my program, I get a call from that guy and he asked if I wanted interview. I interviewed it was your typical interview but I feel like they were pretty relaxed about it because they knew how green I was. I mean shit, i'm pretty sure the tech challenge they let me use my own personal project I developed through the program.. Anyways they hired me probably believing they could mold me into what they wanted, although there wasnt much molding, there was a lot of extremely late nights of me trying to figure things out because I knew absolutely NOTHING. Long story short there were grueling years of teaching myself a lot but also kind of only teaching myself stuff that would get me through a specific task. I feel like I never really took a step back and really dove into soft skills or design concepts or why you would use a certain pattern for certain scenarios..Now, 8 years later I'm still at my current company and over the past 3 my company as a whole does not feel secure. I've survived big layoffs, clients leaving, entire company not getting raises, etc. I have a family now, I own a house, and I need security.. I've had one job interview over the past year and I completely botched it. The technical interview I froze, it was plain javascript and I couldn't solve it.. I was so embarrassed and couldn't believe it. Now I feel like if it was nextjs and my companies codebase? I wouldn't have had any issues what so ever because i've been working here for so long and I feel like my knowledge of nextjs is very good but thats not going to cut it if I want a new job, which obviously I do with more security.. Just getting an interview almost seems impossible though, then I'm dreading the whole interview process because quite frankly I feel like my soft skills, tech terminology, and overall understanding of frontend development is lacking and I'm so used to my companies codebase I feel like im going to be a deer in headlights during an interview process.I just need some advice on how I should go about getting a new job, do I zoom out and go back to strengthening my soft skills of javascript, do I use some platforms like TheGreatFrontend? What are some concepts companies are absolutely looking for that I should either learn or freshen up on? Any advice would be helpful.

My total compensation is around 115k at 24 years old, and I currently am 8 months on the job. I have 3 years of experience, working in a university position as a data engineer before this role for 2 years.So within the stack I'm using, it's mainly PL/SQL and T-SQL - which I guess is fine because that's what I'm using to access big data and work with our internal customers. I do ETL work and requests given by customers using SQL, and of course manage loads every month with on-call/production support.The pay is great and I also live at home with my parents, so I am indeed getting comfortable. I'm not in any relationship and I don't really wish to be at all any time soon. The only thing I'm wondering though is how badly I'm hindering my career by staying here skills wise. The data engineering space seems like it is changing a lot, and our tech in our current team doesn't use any of the new tech that's in the current climate.When I first entered this team, I was hoping to use a more modern tech stack, it looks like thought it's a bit limited to just Oracle. I'm fine with the work and I am learning everyday so I'm not complaining about what I have currently. But I do want to progress my career a bit more with more skills. There isn't any Python, Airflow, Spark, AWS, Kafka or any other modern orchestration tools, a bit of a gap in what others would be using.I'm aware that this is a good position, but I do want to progress as a data engineer and become higher impact in the future for maybe a different company or even a startup.**If I stay here for too long, would that make me a bit unmarketable for more current positions with more modern stacks?****Do I stay 1–2 years and risk locking myself into legacy SQL work, or move now while I’m still early?****Is it smarter to grind this job for money or take a risk and pivot sooner?**In terms of urgency, I was considering moving out to a different company within 6 to 8 months but just want some advice.I really want to move to a city as well and move out as well, but with this current position I'm just conflicted on what the move should be. Some have suggested to switch internally within the company, which I could consider. Others have suggested to start applying for other roles in other areas.

1pazioq,Stay in full stack position or return to mobile?,xxxTheBongSquadxxx,cscareerquestions,"Hey, just looking for some opinions and/or advice here.I'm a pretty versatile dev with 5 years of experience - 4 of them as an iOS developer, and now one year as full stack (typical TS/Java stack). I'm based in northeastern Europe for reference.For the past year, I've been working full stack at a smaller company in the healthcare field. Both the application and domain are pretty complicated, but the work itself is mostly enjoyable. It's supposed to be one day in office, but fully remote in practice for now. Unfortunately the management side leaves to be desired, as there are barely any (SCRUM) processes and everything feels very ad-hoc. There are also no dedicated designers or testers.After a period of crunch a few months ago, I got fed up with the stress and lack of project management and applied for a position as a senior iOS developer at a bigger corporation. The position would entail me taking over development and maintenance of a streaming application, working together with a PM and the Android devs.They quickly made an offer at €37k net + 0-15% bonus, though I'd be unable to do much anything to affect the size of the bonus. There would also be five weeks of vacation, instead of the standard four. The position would be fully remote. I signed the contract and would be starting in January.After handing in my resignation, my current job countered with €40k net (no bonus afaik). They also offered a promotion to senior, and ownership of a module of the application. I'd probably be able to also ask for additional vacation time, as they seem desperate for me to stay.Now I don't really know which one to choose, as the current job is really not that bad, and having experience as a full stack senior might be better for future prospects than a more specific mobile role. Also, if I left just one year in, I'm not 100% sure I'd be easily able to return to a similar role elsewhere if I wanted to.Meanwhile at the new place I'd practically have free reign over the technical side of the application and from what I've heard, much less workload. I'm slightly worried about the bonus aspect of the pay though, as there is no guarantees over the amount. It's also unclear how big the budget for raises would be in the future, considering the corporate environment. Does it make sense to double down on my existing mobile experience, or try to build up more full stack credibility? Anyone been in a similar situation? Either way, I'd continue building up more backend experience on my own time as well.Thanks in advance!",7,0.78,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pazioq/stay_in_full_stack_position_or_return_to_mobile/,2025-12-01 01:25:39,2025-12-02 01:44:08

1pa6c4x,Super torn about whether to do UPenn's MSE-DS or a master's in CS,ExcitingCommission5,cscareerquestions,"Hi all, I was recently accepted to UPenn's online part-time MSE-DS program. I graduated from college this past May from a top 5 CS school with a degree in data science. To be honest, I originally applied to this program because I was having a tremendous amount of trouble landing a job in the data science industry (makes sense, since data scientist isn't an entry level role). However, I lucked out and eventually received an offer for a junior data scientist position after 1000+ applications.I like my current job, but the location isn't ideal. I'm a lot farther away from my family, and I'm only seeing them once or twice a year, and that has been very hard for me to deal with on top of adjusting to a much colder northeastern city. I was hoping a master's will help me job hop back to california in a year or two, and that's also a reason why I have decided to not take a break from school. With the deadline to deposit coming, I am having a really hard time deciding whether this program is for me. I have listed some pros and cons below:Pros:1. employer reimbursement - I will only have to pay around 20k for the entire program2. UPenn name and prestige3. asynchronous lectures, which is actually a plus for me because I tend to zone out during synchronous lecturesCons:1. After talking to some people who attended my undergrad school and this program, it seems like there's a lot of overlap in terms of course content. So, i'd be learning a lot of the same things all over again2. I want to become a data scientist, so maybe a CS program would improve my coding skills more. I've heard GT omscs is good, but I also heard it's hard, and I don't know if I'll be able to handle work with omscs.3.

So my questions for here is what is the interview processes like for these places?Do they do the standard leet code/coding assignments/oral tests or is it more portfolio based?Should I look for standard CS work while also looking for game work or just focus on one?How would my portfolio look to standard CS jobs? Would they like the passion or shy away because of its focus in games?I have a couple projects I have worked on through school and outside of school that I have in my current portfolio that I hope would make me stand out as a new grad in the field.

I have no problem understanding any technical topics, I have always been a good student, and math/physics/engineering was always my forte.I feel like I need to cover the following topics: Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking and Database Systems. I understand that all of these topics are broad enough to cover several books by themselves, but reality is, I don't have that much time to dedicate to studying each topic.Hence, I would like a recommendation of a single book (preferably, but it can also be a video course) that would give me an overall knowledge on all of these topics, so that when the need arises, I would at least know where to look for more detailed info. What I am looking for, is a book for self-taught programmers like myself, to cover some of the more glaring blank spots, that would also give enough fundamental knowledge so that I can later dive deeper into any specific subject.Thanks for reading and your help.",3,0.64,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p66abh/need_help_picking_a_book_on_fundamental_computer/,2025-11-25 07:27:40,2025-12-02 01:44:08

1pbm3v5,How much does Thanksgiving delay the hiring process?,If_and_only_if_math,cscareerquestions,"I've been in the interview process with a tech company for a data science/ML summer internship. So far they've been moving pretty fast. I applied online and had a phone screening the next day. The day after they reached out to setup my first technical interview which consisted of some leetcode and statistics questions. I did good, and they clearly told me what the next round will look like and I heard back two days later to setup the next technical round. I had that round last Thursday 11/20 and thought it went well but since then I haven't heard anything and they weren't clear on what the next steps look like.I'm starting to get a little nervous given how fast they were moving before. Could this delay be due to Thanksgiving? I saw on Glassdoor that this company sometimes ghosts candidates after an interview and I'm worried that this is happening to me. I also saw online that some people have already gotten summer internship offers as early as early November. This is my first time applying to anything outside of academia so I'm not sure what a normal timeline looks like.",3,0.81,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pbm3v5/how_much_does_thanksgiving_delay_the_hiring/,2025-12-01 19:23:01,2025-12-02 01:44:08
