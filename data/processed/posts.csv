1qy6ca4,AI engineering is data engineering and it's easier than you may think,ivanovyordan,dataengineering,"Hi all,I wasn't planning to share my article here. But Only this week, I had 3 conversations this week wit fairly senior data engineers who see AI as a thread. Here's what I usually see:* Annoyed because they have to support AI enigneers (yet feel unseen)* Affraid because don't know if they may lose their job in a restructure* Want to navigate in ""the new world"" and have no idea where to startHere's the essence, so you don't need to read the whole thingAI engineering is largely data engineering with new buzzwords and probabalistic transformations. Here's a quick map:* **LLM = The Logic Engine.** This is the component that processes the data.* **Prompt = The Input.** This is literally the query or the parameter you are feeding into the engine.* **Embeddings = The Feature.** This is classic feature engineering. You are taking unstructured text and turning it into a vector (a list of numbers) so the system can perform math on it.* **Vector Database = The Storage.** That's the indexing and storage layer for those feature vectors.* **RAG = The Context.** Retrieval step. You’re pulling relevant data to give the logic engine the context it needs to answer correctly.* **Agent = The System.** This is the orchestration layer. It’s what wraps the engine, the storage, and the inputs into a functional workflow.2Don't let the ""AI"" label intimidate you. The infrastructure challenges, are the same ones we’ve been dealing with for years. The names have just changed to make it sound more revolutionary than it actually is.I hope this will help so of you.",186,0.86,31,https://www.datagibberish.com/p/ai-powered-apps-dictionary-for-data-engineers,2026-02-07 06:20:37,2026-02-12 02:25:24

1qxifq4,"Is classic data modeling (SCDs, stable business meaning, dimensional rigor) becoming less and less relevant?",Likewise231,dataengineering,"I’ve been in FAANG for about 5 years now, across multiple teams and orgs (new data teams, SDE-heavy teams, BI-heavy teams, large and small setups), and one thing that’s consistently surprised me is how little classic data modeling I’ve actually seen applied in practice.When I joined as a junior/intern, I expected things like proper dimensional modeling, careful handling of changing business meaning, SCD Type 2 being a common pattern, and shared dimensions that teams actually align on — but in reality most teams seem extremely execution-focused, with the job dominated by pipelines, orchestration, data quality, alerts, lineage, governance, security, and infra, while modeling and design feel like maybe 5–10% of the work at most.Even at senior levels, I’ve often found that concepts like “ensuring the business meaning of a column doesn’t silently change” or why SCD2 exists aren’t universally understood or consistently applied. In tech-driven organizations it is more structured, but in business-driven organizations it's less structued (Organization I mean ±100-300 people organization).My logic is because compute and storage got so much cheapier over the years, the effort/benefit ratio is not there in as many situations.

1qxle32,What would you put on your Data Tech Mount Rushmore?,empty_cities,dataengineering,"Mine has evolved a bit over the last year. Today it’s a mix of newer faces alongside a couple of absolute bedrocks in data and analytics. Apache Arrow It's the technology you didn’t even know you loved. It’s how Streamlit improved load speed, how DataFusion moves DataFrames around, and the memory model behind Polars. Now it has its own SQL protocol with Flight SQL and database drivers via ADBC. The idea of Arrow as the standard for data interoperability feels inevitable. DuckDB I was so late to DuckDB that it’s a little embarrassing. At first, I thought it was mostly useful for data apps and lambda functions. Boy was I was wrong. The SQL syntax, the extensions, the ease of use, the seamless switch between in-memory and local persistence…and DuckLake. Like many before me, I fell for what DuckDB can do. It feels like magic. Postgres I used to roll my eyes every time I read “Just use Postgres.” in the comments section. I had it pegged as a transactional database for software apps. After working with DuckLake, Supabase, and most recently ADBC, I get it now. Postgres can do almost anything, including serious analytics. As Mimoune Djouallah put it recently, “PostgreSQL is not an OLTP database, it’s a freaking data platform.” Python Where would analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning, data platforms and AI engineering be without Python? Can you honestly imagine a data world where it doesn’t exist? I can’t. For that reason alone it will always have a spot on my Mount Rushmore. 4 EVA.

1qxw5oo,Struggling with Partition Skew: Spark repartition not balancing load across nodes,wtfzambo,dataengineering,"# SOLVED: See solution a the bottomHello, I have been searching far and wide for a solution to my predicaments but I can't seem to figure it out, even with extensive help of AI.# TL;DR:I have a skewed dataset representing 9 clients. One client is roughly 10x larger than the others. I’m trying to use `repartition` to shuffle data across nodes and balance the workload, but the execution remains bottlenecked on a single task.# Details:I'm running a simple extraction + load pipeline:`Read from DB -> add columns -> write to data lake.`The data source is a bit peculiar: each client has its own independent database.The large client's data consistently lands on a single node during all phases of the job. While other nodes finish their tasks very quickly, this one ""straggler"" task bottlenecks the entire job.I attempted to redistribute the data to spread the load, but nothing seems to trigger an even shuffle. I’ve tried:* Salting the keys.* Enabling Adaptive Query Execution (AQE).* `repartition(n, ""salt_column"")` , `repartition(n, ""client_id"", ""salt"")`.* `repartition(n)`See picture:https://preview.redd.it/yo94vesrk2ig1.png?width=5030&format=png&auto=webp&s=399be044a1f8a3e9557553b97056141ed342b0b3In very short pseudocode, here is what I'm doing: data = [] for db in db_list: # Reading from 9 independent source DBs data.append( spark.read.format(""jdbc"").option(""db"", ""table"").load() ) df_unioned = union_all(data) df_unioned = df_unioned.sortWithinPartition(client_id) # This is where I'm stuck: df_unioned = df_unioned.repartition(100, ""salt_column"") df_unioned.write.parquet(""path/to/lake"")Looking at the Physical Plan, I've noticed there is no `Exchange` (Shuffle) happening before the write. Despite calling `repartition`, Spark is keeping the `numPartitions=1` from the JDBC scans all the way through the `Union`, resulting in a 'one-partition-per-client' bottleneck during the write phase.Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope :(PS:A couple of extra points, maybe they're useful:\- This data in specific is quite small, just a few gigabytes (i'm testing on a subset of the full data)\- For the record, the repartition DOES happen: if I do \`repartition(100)\`, I will have 100 tiny files in the data lake. What doesn't happen is the shuffle between nodes or even cores.# SolutionIt was AQE + a later query in the job causing this. This later query, which comes after writing out to data lake, does an aggregation on the \`client\_id\`. Apparently, AQE understands this and goes ""instead of doing two shuffles (1 for repartitioning and another one to aggregate) I'm just gonna do zero since the data is already partitioned by \`client\_id\`"".",6,0.81,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qxw5oo/struggling_with_partition_skew_spark_repartition/,2026-02-06 22:33:20,2026-02-12 02:25:24

1qwjl09,Data Lakehouse - Silver Layer Pattern,dbjan,dataengineering,"Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the ""medallion"" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.First - on all of these projects we were pushed by the ""data architect"" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).Second - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.Are you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?I understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : DAlso I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..What are your views on this?

For our own SQL engine (Floe), we needed stable, reusable statistics and relational metadata to support predictable planning over Iceberg and Delta. Floe will be available later this year, but Floecat is designed to be engine-agnostic.If this sounds interesting, I wrote more about the motivation and design here: https://floedb.ai/blog/introducing-floecat-a-catalog-of-catalogs-for-the-modern-lakehouseFeedback is very welcome, especially from folks who’ve struggled with planning, stats, or metadata across multiple lakehouse catalogs.Full disclosure, I'm the CTO at Floe.",6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r0pico/intro_to_floecat_a_catalog_for_query_engines_that/,2026-02-10 03:14:06,2026-02-12 02:25:24
1r06p4k,Easily work with Lance datasets using LanceDB on Hugging Face Hub,laminarflow027,dataengineering,"> Disclaimer: I currently work at LanceDB and have been a member of Lance's and Hugging Face's open source communities for several years.Recently, Lance became an [officially supported format](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-x-huggingface-a-new-era-of-sharing-multimodal-data/) on the Hugging Face Hub. Lance is an open source, modern, columnar lakehouse format for AI/ML datasets that include multimodal data, embeddings, nested fields, and more. LanceDB is an open source, embedded library that exposes convenient APIs on top of the Lance format to manage embeddings and indices.Check out the latest Lance datasets uploaded by the awesome OSS community here:https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3AlanceWhat the Hugging Face integration means in practice for Lance format and LanceDB users on the Hub:- Binary assets (images, audio, videos) stored inline as blobs: No external files and pointers to manage- Efficient columnar access: Directly stream metadata from the Hub without touching heavier data (like videos) for fast exploration- Prebuilt indices can be shared alongside the data: Vector/FTS/scalar indices are packaged with the dataset, so no need to redo the work already done by others- Fast random access and scans: Lance format specializes in blazing fast random access (helps with vector search and data shuffles for training). It does so without compromising scan performance, so your large analytical queries can be run on traditional tabular data using engines like DuckDB, Spark, Ray, Trino, etc.Earlier, to share large multimodal datasets, you had to store multiple directories with binary assets + pointer URLs to the large blobs in your Parquet tables on the Hub. Once downloaded, as a user, you'd have had to recreate any vector/FTS indices on your local machine, which can be an expensive process.Now, with Lance officially supported as a format on the Hub, you can package all your datasets along with their indices as a single, shareable artifact, with familiar table semantics that work with your favourite query engine. Reuse others' work, and prepare your models for training, search and analytics/RAG with ease!It's very exciting to see the variety of Lance datasets that people [have uploaded](https://huggingface.co/datasets?library=library%3Alance) already on the HF Hub, feel free to share your own, and spread the word!",7,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r06p4k/easily_work_with_lance_datasets_using_lancedb_on/,2026-02-09 15:10:52,2026-02-12 02:25:24

I am a recent computer science graduate who started working for a large non-profit organization which is reliant upon an old, very complex, ERP system (say... a few hundred tables, hundreds of millions of records). They don't provide an API, integrations are done by directly touching the database. Each one was developed ad-hoc, as the need arose over the last 2 decades. There is some code sharing but not always. 2 integrations which ostensibly provide the same information may have small divergences in exactly how they touch the database. They are written in a mix of C# and SQL stored procedures/functions. Many of these are very complex. Stored procedures call stored procedures and inserting an entity may wind up touching 30+ tables. A lot of the time, it's required. The ERP manages finances, staff, business operations; there is a lot of conditional logic to determine what to insert, update, delete, etc.. Are there any tools or techniques that could be useful here?

AI is giving contradictory answers on this so I decided to ask Reddit.The book written by the creators of Spark (""Spark: The Definitive Guide"") say that there are not too many ways to optimize an aggregation:>For the most part, there are not too many ways that you can optimize specific aggregationsbeyond filtering data before the aggregation having a sufficiently high numberof partitions. However, if you’re using RDDs, controlling exactly how these aggregationsare performed (e.g., using reduceByKey when possible over groupByKey) can bevery helpful and improve the speed and stability of your code.The way this was worded leads me to believe that a repartition (or bucketBy, or partitionBy on the physical storage) will not speed up a groupBy.This, I don't understand however. If I have a country column in a table that can take one of five values, and each country is in a seperate partition, then Spark will simply count the number of records in each partition without having to do a shuffle. This leads me to believe that repartition (or partitionBy, if you want to do it on the hard disk) will almost always speed up a groupby. So why do the authors say that there aren't many ways to optimize an aggregation? Is there something I'm missing?EDIT: To be clear, I'm of course implying that in an actual production environment you would run the .groupBy after the .repartition more than once. Otherwise, if you run a single .groupBy query, you're just moving the shuffle one step above.",7,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qxso5n/does_partitioning_your_data_by_a_certain_column/,2026-02-06 20:18:46,2026-02-12 02:25:24

Each node is shipped as a binary and should be installable on new servers with minimal config. Nodes need shared state like sessions, user creds, quotas, and proxy pool data.a.

This gives me tighter control over node onboarding, revocation, and limits blast radius if a node is ever compromised. It also avoids putting datastore credentials on every node.b. An alternative design (suggested by an LLM during architecture exploration) is letting every node connect directly to Redis for hot-path data (sessions, quotas, counters) and use it as the shared state layer, skipping the API hop. -- i didn't like the idea too much but the LLM kept defending it every time so maybe i am missin something!?!

1qwztq8,Snowflake native dbt question,Nelson_and_Wilmont,dataengineering,"My organization that I work for is trying to move off of ADF and into Snowflake native dbt. Nobody at the org has really any experience in this, so I've been tasked to look into how do we make this possible.Currently, our ADF setup uses templates that include a set of maintenance tasks such as row count checks, anomaly detection, and other general validation steps. Many of these responsibilities can be handled in dbt through tests and macros, and I’ve already implemented those pieces.What I’d like to enable is a way for every new dbt project to automatically include these generic tests and macros—essentially a shared baseline that should apply to all dbt projects. The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.That said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.Given that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",2,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qwztq8/snowflake_native_dbt_question/,2026-02-05 22:28:55,2026-02-12 02:25:24

1r0ljxk,Production Access,fordatechy,dataengineering,"Hi. Question about production access. Does your organization allow users/developers who are not admins or in IT access to run their pipelines in production? Meaning they developed it but maybe IT provided the platform such as Airflow, nifi, etc. To run it. If they can’t run it do they have production access but just more restricted? Like read access so that they can debug why a pipeline failed and push changes without have to ask someone to send them the logs for them to see what happened.I’m asking this since right now I’m in an org where there are a few platforms but the two biggest don’t allow anyone outside their 2-5 person teams access to it. Essentially developers are expected to build pipelines and hand them off and that’s it. No view into prod anything. The reasoning by those admins is that developers don’t need to see prod and it’s keeps their environment secure. They will monitor and notify us if something goes wrong. I think this is dumb honestly as in my opinion that if you can’t grant people production access and keep it secure at the same time your environment is not as good as you think. I also think that developers need prod access if they are an engineer. At minimum I think they should have read access so that they can easy see how their pipelines are performing and debug if needed. The environments and nifi and ssis for the record and this isn’t a post to bash them so I’m only saying that for context. I don’t care what the platform is per se but just the workflow in general.How does your organization work?

I wanted to see their design and identify if/what I was misunderstanding. A consulting firm came in and started changing things, changing everything. I was not in these discussions because I was new and still learning the code base but the pipeline used to have 4 layers, data lake, star schema, reporting layer and finally a data warehouse layer (flat tables that combined multiple reporting tables to make it super easy for low skilled analysts to use). The consulting firm correctly said we should only have 3 layers but apparently didn't provide ANY direction or oversight. My boss responded by removing the star schema! well they technically removed it but simply merged the logic from two layers into one script... pushing the entire concept of data warehousing into the hands of individual engineers to keep straight.

1r19k5l,The truth about programming that no one tells most beginners.:flushed_face:,Reasonable-Tour-8246,learnprogramming,"I keep seeing beginners (and even some experienced devs) struggle because they jump straight into writing code without fully understanding the problem.What I noticed during my programming career is programming is more logical oriented than syntax based only. The first thing I noticed is that most softwares we see are built on top of open source tools that have been made by thousands of developers world wide example: Linux, Database Management Systems, Frameworks so most devs work on business logic on top of this software.What is important for any programmer are fundamentals when you understand some commonly used fundamentals like: data types, variables, conditions statements, loops, collections, functions, data structure and OOP are enough for expressing logic. Before writing and following syntax I basically think a good programmer understands something in a very high level way instructions, also how the full flow works without touching the syntax. Then, the last part is translating high level written instructions into syntax based on a certain language.This is based on my opinion and how I have been coding also being language agonistic by ensuring that logic comes first before anything else. May be, some experienced devs may correct or share thoughts on this but this is basically based on what I have experienced throughout my programming journey.",149,0.8,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r19k5l/the_truth_about_programming_that_no_one_tells/,2026-02-10 18:55:27,2026-02-12 02:25:25
1qwc1ti,Tutorial hell is really just fear of being bad at something,Pretty-Material1424,learnprogramming,"Something clicked for me recently and I wanted to share in case it helps someone else stuck where I was.I've been ""learning to code"" for almost a year. Courses, tutorials, YouTube, the whole thing. I understood concepts. Could explain what functions do, how APIs work, whatever.But every time I tried to build something from scratch I'd freeze. The blank editor felt paralyzing.What I realized is I wasn't scared of not knowing enough. I was scared of writing bad code. Like somewhere I'd absorbed this idea that real programmers write clean elegant code on the first try, and if I couldn't do that, I wasn't ready to build yet.So I'd go do another tutorial. Where the code was already clean. Where I could follow along and feel competent without risking being bad at something.The thing that broke it was just... accepting I was going to write garbage. Not as a temporary state until I got good. As the permanent reality of programming. Everyone writes garbage first and then improves it.My first real project was mass truly mass mass terrible. Nested if statements everywhere, variables named ""thing2"", logic that made no sense. But it worked. And finishing something that worked, even badly, taught me more than all the tutorials combined.I swear I post even the ugly code on WIP Social now, and seeing other people also posting imperfect work made me realize everyone's first drafts are bad.

1qx2nji,I am 16 years old and I want to learn a real and in-demand skill to work remotely in the future.,OkStomach7765,learnprogramming,"I'm 16 years old, and for quite some time now I've been seriously researching what skills to learn or what kind of business I could build in the future.At first, I thought the most logical way was to get a job, but in my city, that's practically impossible because I'm underage. That led me to rethink everything and start thinking more about working independently or as a freelancer.Currently, I'm studying programming, and I started with the basics: HTML, CSS, and some web design. In the long term, I'm also interested in learning backend development (Java or other languages). Lately, the world of automation has caught my attention, but I have many doubts because there's a lot of talk about it on YouTube, and it doesn't always feel realistic.I understand that many people recommend ""starting a local business"" or ""taking any job,"" but in my case, I don't have capital to invest, I live in a small city, and I'm not hired because of my age. Even so, I'm a persistent person who learns quickly and doesn't give up when something doesn't work out.My goal today isn't to ""make easy money,"" but to learn a real, in-demand skill that makes sense in the long run—ideally something I can do remotely and independently.I'd appreciate constructive feedback on:whether my thinking is flawedwhat skills you see as most valuable for a young person (programming, data, automation, something else)what you would avoid if you were starting overI know I'm not the only one who's tried something like this at my age, so I really value any realistic advice.

1qzlroe,"Self taught programmer exhausted and lost, hoping for guidance",UsefulExplanation131,learnprogramming,"Hey, everyone. Im really hoping to get outside perspectives on some difficulties ive been experiencing while learning to program. I keep experiencing burn out and exhaustion over and over again and I can’t figure out why it keeps happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore and just can’t think clearly about my situation anymore. Here is some background: Rough timeline of my programming journey: August 2022- I begin working through TOP curriculum with the goal of seeing if i enjoy programming. I decide that i do enjoy it -> Feb 2024 - I physically and mentally burn out from my job as a delivery driver. Managing my job, programming, and therapy was too much and I quit after i got injured while working.  March 2024- after spending a year going from 45 mins of studying/week to 10 hours/week, a mental health crisis, and 1 month after quitting my job, i complete the foundations module of TOP -> Nov or Dec 2024 - I take advantage of being unemployed and living off savings to focus hard on programming. I build up to studying 25-30 hours/week consistently. I realize I don’t like front end stuff. I choose the js path on TOP, skip the “advanced html/css” and “react section,” but complete everything else up to the file uploader project of the “NodeJS” section. Around December i take a small break to focus on an art project, and that snowballed to a few months of no programming (though i think that would’ve happened regardless if i took a break or not). -> Feb 2026 - the past year and few months were a blur of trying so hard to build back the habit of programming as well as i did the first time. I spend some months completely dreading programming and unable to start and some months of still struggling, but able to at least show up mostly consistently. I follow a pattern of on for 2-3 months to off for 2-3 months. After i learn I don’t like front end stuff and realize that endlessly building endpoints was equally dreadful, i decide to focus on other backend topics and keep finding myself bouncing around. I spend a few months on [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) then burn out. I go to nand2tetris to switch things up, last a month, then burn out. I decide to learn C from “C programming: a modern approach,” to switch things up again, and actually have some fun, but things fizzle out again. Every attempt leaves me broken and exhausted. At this point, I don’t know what to do. It’s getting harder and harder to restart. The feelings that kept me going during my most consistent periods of study, feeling like im improving and growing as a person and programmer, the satisfaction and euphoria of solving some problem that I genuinely believed i could not solve, just have been completely absent for so long. During all of this, ive been working hard in therapy to resolve a lot of things including social anxiety. I bring this up because i have bad social anxiety that prevents me from going to local programming meetups, participating in online programming communities, and applying for jobs. Going at this mostly alone just adds another layer of complexity to it all. Ive made a lot of progress on that front but still have a ways to go. I haven’t programmed in a couple months now and its like no amount of time away makes me dread programming any less. I feel spiritually broken. Im too close to my situation to think objectively anymore. What do y’all think i could do differently? Why does programming keep becoming this thing that i dread? Am i focusing on studying too much and not spending enough time making projects? For me, the hardest part about this whole journey (and ive realized this applies to many, maybe most, endeavors) hasn’t even been the intellectual side of things. That’s hard, sure, but by far the hardest part has been the emotional side of things. Specifically, having to find a way to program consistently over time. That’s the aspect of all of this that is the most soul crushing. It was hard to get yourself to program today, and guess what? You have to do it all over again tomorrow. And the day after. Maybe not every single day, but most weeks, most months. How do y’all not get overwhelmed with this? I think i do a decent job of focusing only on the short term but the big picture and the stakes are always on the back of my mind. I do find enjoyment in solving some programming problems, but I can’t deny that I wouldn’t be pursuing this if it wasn’t a well paying career that doesn’t require a degree. Which is the reason why i even decided to see if i enjoy programming and why i still pursue it after all this struggle. Every job ive had up to this point has been low skilled work. Server, cook, cashier, delivery driver, etc. I’m almost 25 and i want and need to get a career going. I can’t keep living the life that ive been living and programming seems to be a good enough fit. It’s intellectually challenging, doesn’t require a degree, well paying, and i find a lot of it enjoyable (even if there are a lot of things i find tedious and annoyingly boring).That being said, i do have ideas that get me excited and could be solved using code. Some of my programming project ideas include:* Something similar to GitHub but for digital artists to save snapshots of their artwork. * Data management system for iot devices. Inspiration came from thinking about how massive amounts of data from telescopes are efficiently stored and organized* A tool that takes a 3D model and allows you to see the cross section along the axial planes* A massive library of artworks that pulls artwork from the online catalogs of museums and other collection websitesI can’t help but feel like i am not ready for any of these projects and that I need to keep studying and learning before i can attempt any of them. That was part of the inspiration to learn c, to better learn how databases work by making a simple database since these are all data intensive projects. Anyway, if anyone has anything to share about what I could do better, that would be greatly appreciated.

There is also an ""harder"" version of it where you need to print 2 pyramids. you know, the beginner level stuffs..since i dont have prior syntax knowledge i asked AI to generate me a code in order to check it, study it and understand it. and after i did it, i felt everything was clear, i knew what every line did and why. NICE RIGHT?\#\##\###\####when it came part 2 i decided to imperatively not use AI and only using my knowledge acquired from the first exercise to complete it.this time the first of the two pyramid had to be reversed, so with blank spaces before the ""#"" symbols.

1qxl2ai,Coddy.tech is utter garbage.,One_Jellyfish181,learnprogramming,"*I'd like to preface this entire post by saying that I did enjoy the first few hours of my time on* [*coddy.tech*](http://coddy.tech)*, despite its many... many issues. The base system is promising and could be excellent, if the QA was more thorough.***So, why do I say coddy is utter garbage?** \- The website is riddled with bugs, from non-loading lessons to timeouts and very... very slow validation.\- A lot of the lessons have errors: They aren't properly formated, do not explain all the methods and systems needed to actually solve a lesson.\- The ""daily challenge"" system is a joke. Its some poorly made AI system that gives you a basic ass task like ""Print hello world 10 times"" despite being at chapters like HashMaps etc.\- There are numerous lessons where they do not actually explain to you what the desired output needs to be (given, you can see that by clicking the ""expected output"" toggle - but you should be able to see exactly what you need to do from the challenge description. \- This last point goes hand in hand with the issue that the output needs to be exact. They had one extra space at the end of their output, despite not showing that because you're tasked with printing the result of each itteration on a new line anyway? Instantly lose the ""first try"" challenge.\- Courses aren't even finished. I started the Python and Java course at the same time, hoping to refresh my python knowledge and picking up Java at the same time. Java's whole point is to be an OOP-language. Guess what: Section 3 ""Object oriented Programming"" is ""Coming Soon"":trade_mark:. What the actual fu\*\*?\- The website is clearly built around just monetizing everything as agressively as possible. I got lucky and was able to use a discount code during November to get 30% off monthly subscriptions so it was ""only"" 14.95 a month. Still: I do not feel like that value is really justified. The website has a lot of AI-Slop and wannabe intelligent assistance systems that either fail, timeout (I now know this is a firebase website because the website is printing firebase errors everywhere on every fuc\*\*\* interaction) and lots of lessons are very, very poorly worded.This could've been a 8.5/10 rating but as it stands, I'd say coddy is at best a 4/10 and you should probably look elsewhere.To their credit: They recently updated their Quizz section which made it less buggy and a lot more interactive.",17,0.91,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qxl2ai/coddytech_is_utter_garbage/,2026-02-06 15:43:48,2026-02-12 02:25:25

1r02yay,Coupling data with behaviour considered harmful,Achereto,learnprogramming,"I've seen a couple of posts by people new to programming struggling with understanding OOP and people in the responses making claims about the benefits of OOP. I want to give a bit of a different perspective on it, having written OO code for over 15 years and moving away from it over the last 2-3 years.The core idea of OO is to model things analogue to the real world. So for example a `Datetime` object would represent a specific date and time, and everything related to that (like adding a second or minute) would be implemented by the object. It would also allow you to compare dates in an expressive way. Some languages allow you to have something like `if (today < tomorrow)`, or calculate the difference using `one_day := tomorrow - today` which is neat. **This approach couples data with behaviour.** If you need to add behaviour to a class and you don't own the class, you can't just add the behaviour to the class, and if the fields of the class are private you also can't easily access them from the subclass. So you're already facing a design problem. Yes, people have thought about it and found solutions but the key is that the coupling of data and behaviour *created* the design problem that had to be solved. With structs and functions you could just write a new function and would be done. No design problem in the first place.But the problem becomes worse: With objects acting on their own behalf you lose the efficiency of [iterating over data and modifying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAVbI1HIzCE). For every update on an object, you have to call a method and create significant computation overhead (and no, the compiler usually can't optimize this away).In fact, the problems created by coupling data to behaviour (like classes do) has become such a pain for developers that we started teaching ""Composition over Inheritance"". In simple terms this means that an object (containing data) shouldn't implement its own behaviour any more, but instead provide placeholders for other objects that implement specific behavior can be used by the original object, effectively decoupling data from behaviour again (undoing OO). One of the better talks explaining this principle is [Nothing is Something by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) from ~10 years ago. In her example in the second half of her talk you can see that the `House` class is stripped down to data and placeholders for behaviour, giving her the maximum flexibility for new features.To reiterate: **OOP couples data with behaviour. The design problems arising from this are best solved by decoupling data from behaviour again**If you need more convincing data, then you can look at all the [OOP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). 13 of those 22 patterns (including the most useful ones) are actually separating data from behaviour, 3 are debatable if they do (Composite, Facade, Proxy) and only 6 (Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Flyweight, Memento, Observer) aren't about separating data from behaviour.If coupling data with behaviour is the root problem for many design problems in programming and the solutions people come up with are different ways to decouple data from behaviour again, then you should clearly avoid coupling them in the first place to avoid all of these problems.So what should you learn instead of OO? I would say that Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a good start as they seems to continue emerging as a solution to most design problems. Even ""Composition over Inheritance"" is already a step towards ECS. ECS have become more popular of the last years with both Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine switching to it. There is a fantastic video about the [ECS in Hytale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglU107_DA4) as well, explaining how this makes modding extremely easy. More upcoming companies will do ECS in the next years and learning it now will put you in an advantage in the hiring processes. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. :)(ps: not sure if ""Tutorial"" is the right Flair because I don't actually show code, but it may be the best fit for explaining a concept and its downsides)",19,0.8,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r02yay/coupling_data_with_behaviour_considered_harmful/,2026-02-09 12:30:41,2026-02-12 02:25:25

1r01dh1,Where should I start with learning to write code for VSTs and for music hardware?,reduke2,learnprogramming,"A bit of a niche question, but I'm hoping someone in the community could help me out with this, since I'm finding a scarce amount of resources online regarding this topic. I'm a bachelor of music student and my main focus has been in emerging music technology for a long time, but it was only recently when I took an elective course in Pure Data that my mind was opened to the possibilities of creating my own VSTs, and it wasn't until even more recently that my roommate/bandmate suggested that he use his electrical engineering course to good use and we make music hardware together. Naturally, I love this idea, and we've been conceptualising a few admittedly ambitious ideas for boutique guitar pedals, synthesizers and other music hardware that we'd love to use ourselves, but now that he's started his EE course, I'm at a position where I really do have to start locking in and learning the relevant programming. I'm aware it'll take years before we're both skilled enough to create anything close to the ideas that we have now, but I figure it's never too early to start learning now. For VSTs in particular, I know the JUCE framework for C++ is the standard, and I've found a decent amount of resources on that, so I'm not too worried about it. My bigger question regards the hardware side of things. Which microcontrollers are standard for pedals, eurorack modules, synthesizers, etc, or does it depend more on processing power and other factors i'm not yet aware of? Is C++ a good language to know or should I also think about branching out and learning other languages instead? How does one even write code for microcontrollers and make it interact with the electronic components on the PCB? Are these stupid questions? As you can tell, I am truly lost in the dark here as I haven't an ounce of programming experience (outside of pure data and briefly learning GML when I was younger) but I know I can learn it, I just desperately need to know where to start, where to find resources, who to talk to, and what I should focus on learning now.

I saw a few explanations about using it so you don’t have to change things across systems if the private variable is changed but that also confused me a bit. Another reason I saw was that it’s for security reasons, however this one doesn’t quite make sense to me because can’t you just use setters and getters?

1qz1j3i,AI coding - Are we killing the golden goose ?,Ravenclaw_Guy,learnprogramming,"Before I start my rant, I want to say I use AI everyday. I use it for:1. Understanding a concept/service. Why is it designed in a particular way and verifying the sources (not all the time, only when I am skeptical of the answers).2. Understanding a piece of code from a language I am not familiar with. Asking the LLM to explain each line.3. Asking the agent to edit a specific function in an unfamiliar language to do a certain thing and asking the agent to explain line by line.4. Writing unit tests.5. Pros/Cons of a system design approach. 6. Fixing the grammatical mistakes that I make while writing something or asking it to rewrite certain sentences which are harder for audiences to grasp.The ability of an LLM to do all of the above is big win and a big productivity boost for me. I am still amazed by the capabilities of an LLM to do all the above. However, I am somewhat disappointed and puzzled by the upper management push to not write code at all and delegate the writing part to AI agents. When we wrote code line by line, it gave us the ability to understand the software that we are building in a fundamental level. The friction we had when writing code, helped us to develop critical thinking and helped develop the debugging skills (the golden egg the management got over time). If we delegate this work to AI, are we not going to lose this skill eventually ? When things go wrong, the senior management is going to ask the engineers to fix the issue not an LLM. The engineer has to have atleast some mental model of how the code works. Isn't it too late and expensive to rewrite things when a production issue happens ?Finally, how are software engineers going to create novel libraries/services if they don’t write code and understand the underlying behavior. Are we sure that the engineers can create a library like React if they have not written HTML/JS by hand in years. I want to know your thoughts and hear opposing view points. I am of the opinion that an LLM can make me 1.2x faster not 10x faster. This is a conversation I have been having internally with me and many of my colleagues (who are very smart than me) did not reciprocate the same feelings.

Due to this I noticed a deterioration lately in their mental health and mood. I thought I could download some of the series they used to watch time ago, store them in a USB and connect it to the TV so they can watch that instead of the news all the time. My parents are old and they would not know how to navigate through Netflix or other platforms, so I‘d have to do it this way.What I would like, and here is my question for you, is a file in the USB that randomly plays any video file in the USB. My parents basically use the TV as background noise so they wouldn’t care about what’s playing or follow the episodes in a given order. I want a file that they click on it and it plays whatever in the USB stick, and I need it to be random so it doesn’t always play the same episode first. I also need it to play episodes non-stop, so that they don’t need to click on the file after every episode.I have some knowledge in Python and bash, so if you give me a hint on what kind of file could do such a thing maybe I can write it on my own. The approach I can think of is the following; when I click on this file it will:- Collect all the file names in the USB (or the ones with a video format).- Sort them on a random order.- Grab the first 20 files on the list.- Play this 20 episodes as a playlist.On a computer I could write it so that VLC plays this list of files, but on a TV I don’t know how it could be done.

Gatekeepers are annoying I know but the doom and gloom in this field has reached a point where I, as a senior engineer in this field, feel a call to gatekeep a little bit.The COVID era job market is never coming back - at least not any time soon which may as well mean never for those of you trying to break into this field with no passion. And that word is the heart of what I want to get at here; passion.Obviously there are still dentists today. Most of whom became dentists well after Belfort was a student and discouraged from his dreams. Just as there will be software engineers well into the future.But the people that became dentists despite the market drying up did so because they had a true passion for the field. It still pays well sure but there was a golden age that has now passed and this is where CS is now.This post isn't to straight up tell you to give up on a CS career. But, if you have been struggling to find a job for awhile now, you should take a step back and a bit of time to reflect on why you are here. If its just for the money, it might be time to pivot to something else.The golden age of software engineering is overEDIT: This post went from 70+ upvotes to sub 10 in a matter of minutes. Reddit is controlled by bots and is generally a bad place to solicit life and career advice. You cannot trust what you see on this platformEDIT 2: Don't overanalyze the dentist analogy. Like I originally said there are obviously still dentists today. And they make great money IF they get jobs. The analogy is not to say they don't do well if they land jobs its to say they do well IF THEY DO land jobs. And thats the challenge of the current CS market. Its great money IF YOU CAN LAND A JOB. And to land a job in todays market you can't just mail it in.

And also you’re welcome.Moments spent in Power BI dashboards, watching shifts in purchasing behavior, tracking category growth in Kombucha, Spindrift, and non-alcoholic beverages, and translating those insights into actionable strategy? Ecstasy. Seeing those trend lines move is why I wake up everydayThere are too many contrarians here reflexively dismissing uncomfortable truths, and not enough people willing to acknowledge how the industry actually works and what it really takes to thrive in it.I for one am so grateful to be a data scientist at a large grocery chain.

1qzzql2,[Serious] What am I missing about agentic AI?,XellosDrak,cscareerquestions,"This is entirely serious because I am genuinely confused about what the end game is for a lot of this. I feel like a conspiracy theory nut. My company is working incredibly hard to force our engineers to use agentic AI to code. They claim that they want in the next 6 months that some kinds of code to eventually be done entirely by agents, including the review process. They've also set a baseline that all engineers know how to use tools like Claude code in their every day work.When pressed on the issue, our CTO admitted that on average, pre things like Claude, our engineers only spent about 1 hour per day on actually writing code. The rest was spent in meetings, writing RFCs, designing, etc. To me, this says that coding was never the actual issue. So seriously, what exactly am I missing? Is there something magical that's happening right now that makes the current agents with the current context window constraints able to handle highly complex systems?Do the folks at the top really not care about the cognitive decline associated with these kinds of tools?

1qxt8b6,AI Doom and layoffs,iwuvpuppies,cscareerquestions,"I made this post to help explain the current state of software development jobs, especially for new and junior developers. I hope this eases some of your worries. It is long, bear with me.Software Engineering, like any other careers is cyclical. Jobs are at the mercy of demand, trends, and capital. We saw an influx during 2010's and especially during and after Covid (early 2020's) when companies started hiring to hoard talent.Lets get to the layoffs. For those who think layoffs are the direct result of AI, you are not completely wrong. But there are more factors at play. The hard reality is the American economy may be in the midst of economic hardship (recession). This takes us to my first point.1. Companies using AI as an excuse to downsize and make the books look good.First reason: Executive Bonuses. Public companies are at the mercy of quarterly reports. One bad quarter could cost some asshole millionaire his/her job. This sadly incentivizes short term gains and hurts the company long term. But who cares as long as they get their bonus right? AI is a goldmine for execs. They buy a Claude or Copilot subscription and start firing devs. They then take the money they were paying those devs back to the board or shareholders and get rewarded with a bonus.Second reason: Optics. Instead of telling shareholders they need to cut costs (signs of weakness), companies can now conveniently say ""AI Efficiency"". “We don’t need as many people” sounds better than “we can’t afford them”. To top that off, the market rewards any mention of AI with a stock bump. Again the millionaire assholes gets their bonus.2. Management is not immune to industry trends. Leadership is not perfect, they will make mistakes. Unfortunately we are often the victims of those mistakes. Executives talk to peers, copy what other companies are doing, then push it internally. Often times, this comes in the form of asking devs to vibe code/prompts/use agents.3. Take a close look at motivations. The same people dooming and glooming software development are often the ones collecting million dollar bonuses for selling the hype and tools.Below is how things will play out:After management finishes downsizing and the quality of the product goes to shit (either from the vibe coding or short staffing), we will see the following:* Companies admiting AI didn’t deliver the expected benefits* Anyone tied to the AI initiative gets fired (after they get their million dollar bonuses of course)* Start hiring engineers again* AI repositioned as “assistive"" rather than substitutiveTime and time again we have seen this with offshoring, outsourcing and any form of automation.My recommendation, if you enjoy coding, keep doing it. After the hype and fad dies down, this job will continue to be in demand.“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death, taxes, and executive bonuses”",291,0.91,143,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qxt8b6/ai_doom_and_layoffs/,2026-02-06 20:39:42,2026-02-12 02:25:27

Are jobs in Big Tech all that's left?,tran981,cscareerquestions,"I've been a SDE in FAANG for almost 5 years, mostly rated Top Tier each year, worked on lots of scope, and left last year due to moral reasons and burning out from ever increasing workloads from Big Tech. I took a large break to heal and moved back in with my parents to reconnect since I moved far away to pursue this role and I figured it would be easy to land a Job near my hometown which is near a big city.BUT its been about 6 months after I started seriously searching and it feels like all of the jobs openings are in Big Tech and I can barely find roles that would I felt would be regular jobs a few years ago. Every small-mid size company has only 1-2 roles open at a time, if at all, and the competition is intense. Every application has hundreds of people applying based on LinkedIn and Indeed.I don't think I qualify or want to push myself to take Senior roles, which have much more openings by far, but for Mid Level roles, I feel like I'm looking a unicorn. Friends who work in non Big Tech jobs tell me how wonderful it is to work in a low stress environment and have coworkers who have been there for decades, while I feel like I'm going crazy just looking for a job.I knew the job search would be bad, but its genuinely horrible and I can't imagine what someone without experience or less experience than what you'd get at FAANG would be going through right now. I'm leveraging use of all resources of networks, cold calling, and the like, but with how dry the market is, every rejection and non offer after long interview sessions hits like a truck.I love this work, am staunchly anti-AI, and don't expect a large paycheck for my next job, but is it so hard of an ask for fulfilling work that I don't have to think about all day and on weekends?? (shout out last employer!!)I landed my FAANG job from an internship and I have no idea if this is the norm or if I've just been privileged. How was the market actually before all of this? I know the pandemic was a hot market for SDE jobs, but its hard to believe given the dichotomy between today's market.

1qwn4v3,Manager said we should be faster with AI,panda6699,cscareerquestions,"My manager used to be a FE dev, and has been a manager for ages. He is a skip level. During our 1:1 he asked if I was using AI, how I was finding it. I said blatantly that it is good for boilerplate and understanding the repo and changes done, and great for tests, albeit still needs significant edits. For actual development work, it has proved lackluster.He was pushing that coding was dead and AI should be able to do all of it now, so we should all be much faster. He also mentioned software quality in the same discussion, advocating AI should make it easier. He then gave an example of someone he knew in a well known company who was very experienced, IC6 level, and he was bring told that he needs to use AI or go away. Whilst using AI has been useful, I do think the extent of it's usage is being stretched significantly by people who are even developers or were themselves. How does everyone find using AI for their companies so far? When i make a new side project and do simple client side work, it's great and I rarely need to read any code. But for my corporate job, it still hallucinated a lot even with very specific prompting.

1qyhsyp,"Stuck in a ""Senior Loop""",ShoddyWorkmanshipTed,cscareerquestions,"I was promoted to Senior Engineer originally about 11/12 years ago. After a few years I left the company as I felt like promotion above that was impossible. I was essentially doing the work of other tech leads in the company, but there was always a vague reason promotion to get the title I was already doing wasnt coming. It was always ""next cycle"". I left and went to another company. Hired as a Senior, within about a year or two I'm basically acting tech lead again in terms of responsibilities. But again, every cycle I was told I'd be promoted in the *next* cycle and it never happened. After frustration, I left and started the cycle again at my current company. I'm now approaching my 4th anniversary and the same cycle has played out again, and I'm sensing the same excuses coming as to why no promotion will happen again this year.I'm very frustrated. I'm working at a higher level than my title suggests and have been for a long while now. No offense to the people around me but I now report up through people with much less experience.If I leave, I can't get past a screening for a ""lead"", ""staff"", ""principal"" roles because they want a few years at that title already. If I accept another Senior position, I'm basically back to ""Day 1"" and have to grind to reach the ever elusive carrot or promotion in a few years and I'm worn out of trying hard, having responsibility pushed on me, but never actually getting the reward. What do people at this level do. I'm good at my job from a technical perspective and I seem to be well trusted in terms of people skills, managing a team, but the political side of forcing promotions seems to not be something I'm good at.

1r1vnj7,Are all dev cultures 'sink or swim' nowadays?,Able-Calligrapher-74,cscareerquestions,"I resigned from my job since I was unable to handle it for the last 6 months. From the moment of waking up, until going to bed, I would stay anxious, would keep on getting teams messages from my manager and director, and would always be worried and anxious about delivering my work.Six months ago my team got internally switched and not only my tech stack changed, but also I was unable to understand anything in the new team -- how deployment worked, unit testing, which person takes care of which thing, whom to reach out when people have a disagreement on the approach you used, etc etc.In my previous team, there was a collaborative environment. The team knew there are things that I don't know, because they have never been properly communicated, so I was helped with that. There are changes in the team or deployment process? communicated. Some new framework? communicated. Some update in our best practices? communicated too.But in the new team, the approach turned out to be very much 'sink or swim'. You are told some things initially but then rest of the things, even processes, even whom to reach out and even what to do when there is a conflict with someone else, everything was left on you. Your ticket/task was handled to you and it was said to be your ownership The moment you are assigned your task, you treat it like a sword hanging near your neck and you do everything possible to deliver it on time. Something unexpected causing delays? Some other component which you rely on, not working properly? Nobody cares. You need to deliver on the deadline anyhow.I don't really like this kind of a culture, really.

1qwk0wc,HR contacted me and said that my non technical (creative) manager wants my to lower the EOY ratings that I gave to my reports. I'm upset about this. How should I respond?,MaleficentCherry7116,cscareerquestions,"I'm a software manager at a company that pays significantly less than the market for our area, which means that my reports are underpaid, and that it's difficult to find good engineers. I gave my reports honest end of year ratings and submitted them last week. Yesterday all of my ratings were sent back to me to redo. I thought that I had made some sort of mistake or forgot to do something.Last night, HR messaged me and said that my manager has asked that I lower the ratings that I gave to all of my reports.I'm upset by this for many reasons and don't know how to respond.I work in the same office as my manager and feel like we have a decent relationship. Why is he going through HR instead of coming to me?I gave my reports ratings that I sincerely believe they deserve. My boss is completely non technical and has no idea what makes a good software engineering employee. He's not qualified to rate them. If my employees don't deserve the rating that I gave them, then what do they need to do in order to get the higher rating, since they're already doing those things? I don't know how to respond, because every way forward involves something that has the potential to hurt my career, my employment status, or my integrity.I could lie to my employees and make something up as to why they didn't deserve better. That's likely the best thing for my employment status and career, at least at this company. But it makes me absolutely sick.I could tell my employees that I rated them higher but that my boss, who they have daily contact with, didn't think they deserved it. That doesn't feel like a good idea.I could refuse to change the rating. That's also not going to go well for me.My decision as of right now is that I'm going to set up a . meeting with HR and tell them that I'm not going to change their ratings without some convincing justification.I feel like if my boss wants the ratings changed, then my reports should be moved under him, and he needs to own their ratings. I'm unhappy about it in any case, but I'm more comfortable if he owns what he's done and the software engineers know it was him. I left my last company for similar reasons, and I'm now considering switching again.Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed?Update: After reading the advice here, I've messaged HR to set up a meeting with them to try and understand:1. Why they want me to downgrade my ratings2.

1qweuys,I don't enjoy CS anymore,ShakesR12,cscareerquestions,"I am currently in my last year of a Computer Science degree at a T10 public university and will be graduating this June after finishing the degree in three years. I am also minoring in Statistics and Management and have applied for a Master's program as a backup.Academically, I have done well with a 3.7 GPA and I have never really struggled to understand CS concepts. With a few hours of focused studying, I can usually grasp everything and do well on exams. The issue has not been that the material is too hard. It is more about motivation and how I feel about the path I am on.After freshman year, where I honestly did not do much career wise, reality hit me in my second year. I felt like I had to catch up. I took on multiple research projects to make up for my lack of industry experience, built personal projects, constantly took 20 units a quarter along with some community college classes, and spent a lot of time grinding LeetCode. I really pushed myself because I thought that if I did everything right, the results would come.But even after all that effort, I did not see the outcomes I expected in terms of internships or job offers. That gap between effort and results has been mentally exhausting. Over time, the constant grind with no clear payoff has worn me down, and I have lost the excitement I used to have for CS.I have realized that I do not hate problem solving. I still like thinking through ideas and solutions. I especially enjoy working with numbers and seeing patterns, which is why my Statistics and Management minor has felt more interesting recently. What I do not enjoy is the actual process of coding. Sitting and building things line by line feels draining, even though thinking about the solution at a higher level feels engaging.Right now I am not excited about more studying, more interview prep, or more side projects. I want to work and get real experience instead of staying in this cycle of preparation. Applying for a Master's was partly strategic because I have not landed a job yet, not purely because I am excited to keep studying.At this point, I am trying to figure out if this loss of passion is just temporary burnout from overworking myself, or if my interests are actually shifting toward something more analytical or business focused rather than pure software engineering.I know I am just ranting and will probably just get flamed in the comments (please be nice)",75,0.88,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qweuys/i_dont_enjoy_cs_anymore/,2026-02-05 07:27:03,2026-02-12 02:25:27

But my real, hands on experience was that AI was only really useful as a glorified autocomplete, generating boilerplate code, and maybe stuff like terraform skeleton code. It's good for things that are not a problem at all and that I can do quite fast myself anyway, but whenever I try to use AI to solve an actual problem/something I'm stuck on/something that requires logic, it always fails miserably. Trying to talk it into actually doing the work, and even pointing out the mistakes (and entering the, 'you're right, I'll fix that!' loop for ever), it makes me feel like a Sisyphus, and it never goes anywhere. Pretty much every single time I've attempted it, I was better off writing the code myself anyway.

However, it's been suspiciously unproductive for me. I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing wrong. Obviously, job hunting is a numbers game, and there's a random element to it. But I genuinely haven't had a **single** organic interview during this entire period. Even some years ago, when I was unemployed for an extended period like this, I was still able to land an interview every month or so.For context, I have over 6 years of professional experience and a background in React, JavaScript + TypeScript, Python, and more. These are, no doubt, heavily crowded tech stacks in the market right now. Additionally, I used the phrase ""organic interview"" earlier, since I did have a few interviews early in my job search, but only after reaching out to some old connections about openings at their companies.

Can anyone relate?",Disastrous_Regular17,cscareerquestions,"Huge gap between ego driven job posting requirement / interview process and the actual job.C level execs started to force only senior level hires, because AI supposedly magically does junior / mid level job by itself without anyone ""driving"" it. (it doesn't)I have had open positions, and often the job is not that difficult, but I'm forced to hire giga seniors only, with ego driven super tough interview processes. HR and people involved feel good drafting a super demanding job posting requirement and process. I internally cringe when I compare it to what actually is the job.The truth is no one wants to challenge it, my theory is it’s because in terms of optics. When leaders and execs say they hire senior only, it gives the impression that they are raising the bar, that they work on super hard problems, that the org super mature, etc... No one wants to say the truth that sometimes ""well actually what we work on here is not too hard, let's get a coachable hire we can invest in"". Last we tried we got shut down hard.What happens then, we eventually find someone senior enough that can pass the process, then they are underutilized, get frustrated and leave. Or they stay but invent problems and over engineer (and some important basic work does not get done).In the recent job posting I worked on, we had to remove a line about how ""you will get to coach juniors"" because we literally don't have any now.

It’s not a big prestigious company like amazon but im literally so happy and cannot complain.Im like one of the dumbest people I know so if I can do it, SO CAN YOU. DONT GIVE UP!! if you are still struggling to find an internship, here are some tips that helped me:* use linkedin to network but not for applying to jobs. they repost jobs and it’s just a waste of time because everyone is applying to those postings* surround yourself with ambitious friends. im so thankful that my friends are so smart and supportive because they helped me fix my resume, and seeing their success just motivates me to do better* in the job interview, you need to show some personality. lots of candidates focus too much on GETTING the interview but remember you also need to pass it, show that you are someone enjoyable to be around* try to find internships the moment they get posted, literally the day of. use github repos or stalk company sites directly* stay consistent and protect your mental health. I kept applying even when nothing was working, but I also made sure I had hobbies and friends outside of job hunting so rejections did not completely wreck meAt the end of the day, i think it’s just a game of luck.

1r0zfc2,Were recent tech layoffs disproportionately affecting former bootcamp hires?,se898,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I’m asking mostly out of curiosity and to get a sense of how things look from inside the industry today.I used to be a software developer in Seattle about ten years ago. I worked in the field for roughly two years before deciding to switch careers and move on to something else. I’ve been out of tech for a long time now, but I still loosely follow what’s going on. Watching the wave of layoffs since 2022, one thing I’ve been wondering about is whether they disproportionately affected people who entered tech through coding bootcamps during the 2015 to 2021 boom. Back when I was around, bootcamps were just starting to become a thing, and later they seemed to turn into a very common path into junior roles. From the outside, it feels like when hiring tightened, companies cut a lot of junior or surface level roles first. That made me wonder whether former bootcamp hires, especially career switchers with fewer years of deep experience, were more exposed compared to traditional CS grads or more senior engineers.I’m not trying to bash bootcamps or the people who went through them. I’m genuinely curious whether people inside companies noticed any real pattern during layoffs, or whether this is mostly selection bias and anecdotal noise.For those who stayed in tech through the last few years, did layoffs feel credential blind, or were certain backgrounds more vulnerable? Did former bootcamp grads fare worse, better, or about the same as everyone else once the market contracted? Would really appreciate perspectives from engineers, hiring managers, or anyone who went through layoffs themselves.TL;DR:Former software dev from Seattle, out of the industry for about 10 years. Curious whether the post-2022 layoffs hit former bootcamp hires harder than others, or if that’s just anecdotal.",24,0.67,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r0zfc2/were_recent_tech_layoffs_disproportionately/,2026-02-10 12:29:26,2026-02-12 02:25:27

1r219e9,Almost a year into my first dev job and I feel significantly bored/low impact. It's the chillest job ever. Do I treasure it and seek on how to make a bigger contribution? Or do I start looking?,dr335i,cscareerquestions,"So a year ago I started at my first development job after a career change. I consider myself BLESSED to have found a role, and such a good one to get started in. The job is way chiller than I ever could have expected. I'm fully remote, on a team of five (with some very experienced people), On Call weekend once every ten weeks or so but it's generally very uneventful. Leadership is thoughtful, people get along, WLB is amazing (working hours are working hours, 4 weeks PTO, etc). It's really a genuinely great situation. The bad is that the work isn't really challenging or interesting. We maintain probably 20-30 different legacy Java applications, frequently that just looks like small little feature or workflow changes, database work, or some kind of server script that needs to be done. We're in the process of modernizing them - but the vast majority (which truly are very simple boring CRUD workflows) are getting moved into a proprietary ""pro-code"" platform (a convuluted, absolute mess of a thing that uses java objects in a bizarre way) with the remaining 5-6 of them being rewritten as cloud native react apps. Right now, we're inbetween that. Theres a few developers that are staying pretty busy doing deep dives into a high impact java app that was originally written around 2006, but the rewrites haven't started yet and I find myself doing super low impact work and trying to ""look"" busy because theres just not much to do. For a while I was enjoying that - doing projects around the house or the yard but now I'm over that. I want to do something interesting and I have NO interest in taking part in the low code nonsense. I'm being underutilized. I also only get paid around 65k (LCOL area so whatever, but even the ""leads"" are barely pushing 100). It seems obvious to look for something else but I work with awesome people, have a ton of free time, fully remote, AND good management? I'd hate to leave and go somewhere else thats miserable. Background: 31, Career changer, went to an average state school after high school for accounting, proceeded to go work at a car dealership because I liked cars and hated taxes. Did pretty well, moved through the ranks, wanted to do something more intellectually challenging, went back to school (WGU don't flame me) to get a CS degree (honestly I was always a nerd who understood computers well and tinkered with stuff so I was more looking for the HR checkbox, I know it's not great though). Decent soft skills, better than a lot of my coworkers for sure, could probably do well at leetcode mediums if I gave it some effort, but no strong interest in relocating. Would consider myself competent and a strong employee but I'm probably never going to be the guy coding on the weekends because he just loves it that much.

The 2nd human can think in a truly independent way regardless of what the first human has tried. Hallucinations can still happen between humans but they are much rarer and even when they do happen are usually understandable and predictable.In short, I've observed that human collaboration is scalable in a way that AI agent collaboration is not.It's almost as if due to the simple fact that each human has a unique neural net wiring, human collaboration is able to make discoveries and break throughs that a single neural net whether synthetic or biological, cannot compete against.It's as if the current state of the art for AI is still only at the level where it's a tool.

Questioning whether I should leave leadership,MaleficentCherry7116,cscareerquestions,"A C level manager visited our office yesterday and held a staff meeting with the entire office. He asked me directly when I was going to adopt the company's newest version technology platform, and I answered that since our product release dates are critical that we were waiting on the timeline as to when the platform would be complete before moving. He answered that the platform was complete, and I answered that the pieces we needed would not be complete until next year. I could tell that the C level manager was angry, but he didn't say anything. I got an email from my boss this morning that he was told that I was supposedly leadership and needed to stop spouting 'rando' rumors and upsetting the office staff under me. My staff couldn't care less as to when the new platform is ready and are happy to continue using the old platform.I verified with the platform team this morning that it will not be completed until next year and our product which depends on it needs to be released before the end of the year.For further context, the C level manager had made the trip to our office to discuss more dependable release timelines, so not moving is the correct decision.I'm angry about the situation and am questioning whether or not I should leave leadership and go back to being an IC.

1r1cpz2,Struggling with 100% remote work again. About to take an in-person role but feeling cold feet. Has anyone else made the switch back?,k032,cscareerquestions,"I’ve had a bit of job instability over the last few years and I'm looking for perspective on switching from remote back to in-person.- 2020-2024: Worked at a large company. After the pandemic... it fluctuated between 100% remote and hybrid. Every time I went fully remote, I eventually hated it. I felt purposeless, like I had a ""fake job,"" and struggled with the lack of structure (I’ve discussed this extensively in therapy).- Last Year: Worked a 1-year stint for a government contractor (hybrid). This worked fairly well for me mentally. I actually did a lot of work on remote days, but from a closer office just to focus. But the contract folded over the summer due to budget cuts (DOGE), forcing me to find a new job quickly. Some other parts of the job didn't quite work...it was a far commute in particular.- Current Role (6 months): I joined a smaller ""boutique"" government contracting firm. It’s 100% remote, and the same bad feelings have returned. On top of the isolation, the environment is toxic, disorganized, and the codebase is chaotic. But after the shakeup last summer with contracting work, I felt desperate. I’m looking again and have landed 5 interviews, mostly focusing on in-person or hybrid roles. Mostly SCIF work in the government contracting world...but the front-runner is a role 20 minutes from my house with core hours of 10am–2pm. They seem really modern, use Svelte and more prototyping stuff, but just the nature of it can't be remote. Where I'm at rn, I mean...it's really not working out, and I have the experience to know and see these are some bad managers and work environment...even outside of it being remote. I feel at odds. My mental health and history tell me I need to be in the office (or at least hybrid) to feel purposeful and get out of the house. But now that it's becoming real, I’m worried I’m going to miss the freedom of remote work once it's gone.Also planning to push for more money. I currently make around $170k TC. I'm gonna push more for $200k-$220k. Security clearance work and being only on-site, I think could justify it. They don't really know my situation that I don't like remote and could use it to my advantage I feel.I don't have an offer in-hand but...I can read the signs one of these 5 will come through at least.Has anyone else here realized they just can't do remote work?

I’m currently at a service-based company and was promoted fairly early into a senior/lead-type role, which means I’ve had exposure to architecture decisions, client calls, and owning delivery end to end.Lately though, I don’t feel great about where I am. The work is very project-driven, there isn’t much real product thinking, and there’s no meaningful senior mentorship above me. I’ve learned a lot by being pushed into responsibility early, but it also feels like I’m starting to plateau, and I’m not convinced staying longer actually improves my long-term trajectory.I recently went through interviews with a US-led SaaS company, and they’ve communicated intent to extend an offer. The role is titled “Support Engineer,” which is what’s making me hesitate. On paper, it feels like a step down from a senior software engineering role.From conversations with their engineering leadership, though, this doesn’t sound like a traditional ticket-only support job. It sits between support and product engineering and involves debugging real production issues, understanding customer workflows, joining customer calls when needed, and applying code or database fixes. They’ve described it as a way to build deep product and business context first, and then move engineers into product engineering teams once they’ve ramped up. I’ve also seen examples of people there who’ve followed that path.What I’m stuck on is whether this is a reasonable tradeoff early in a career, or whether I’m taking on unnecessary risk by stepping into a role with “support” in the title and making it harder to move back into core engineering later. My longer-term goal is to work on real products, not remain in a service or ticket-driven environment.There’s also a timing element. My current role feels increasingly unstable, and I don’t have a lot of confidence in what comes after my current project. So while I could keep searching for a more traditional software engineering role, waiting several more months to optimize for a perfect outcome isn’t a totally neutral option either.If you’ve worked in product SaaS companies or made a similar move, how would you look at this? What would you watch for early on to tell whether it’s actually a stepping stone versus a dead end? Would you take this kind of role as a way to break into a US-led product environment, or keep searching?EDIT: The expected progression into SWE role is between 6-12 months based on performance and knowledge of the product.",10,0.86,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qz768l/is_starting_as_a_support_escalation_engineer_at_a/,2026-02-08 12:01:09,2026-02-12 02:25:27

Because of my history with the company (basically rotating between teams in my department), I’ve had the chance to touch basically everything: Frontend, Backend, Databases, Devops pipelines, K8s/containers, Cloud infrastructure, AuthN/AuthZ, API gateways/reverse proxies, and Messaging (Pub/sub). I’ve become the ""jack of all trades"" in our department.Management is now aggressively pushing me toward a Tech Lead/Lead developer role. They want me focused on unblocking other developers, guiding engineers, and handling the ""big picture"" stuff. This would drastically reduce my time ""in the trenches"" where I'm basically delegating the day to day stuff.The issue is that I’m already losing my time to code. My typical day now includes: mentoring other junior developers/interns, discussing integration points with other systems, stakeholder meetings with my EM, sprint planning, and removing blockers for other engineers - for example, getting our authN/authZ infra setup or API routes design done so that implementation can begin on a new module.I’ve only been coding seriously for 5–6 years (including personal projects and my college degree) and only have \~2 years of ""professional"" industry experience. I feel like it is **way too early** to stop being an Individual Contributor (IC). I want to experience being a ""Senior dev"" and build true deep technical expertise. Basically I foresee my career moving towards the ""IC"" path rather than the ""EM"" one.Even worse, I’m starting to feel anxious (like I'm not ready for this step up) and feel like a fraud.

I’ve been applying for about 4 months now and mostly getting rejections or ghosted. It’s been pretty discouraging and I’m honestly feeling burned out from coding and job hunting.Right now, I’m working a minimum wage job, but a family friend just offered me a store manager position. It pays $15/hour plus 25% of the store’s monthly profit (around $2k), and I can choose my hours. It would likely come out to around $4.5k–5k/month.The downside is:•It could be long hours (possibly 50–70/week)•If I get a CS job later, it might be hard to leave immediately•I’m worried about getting “stuck” and drifting away from techThe upside is:•Much better pay than I make now•Less financial stress•Time to recover from burnout•Management/business experienceI’m torn between:1.Taking the job and using it as a temporary step while I recover and keep applying, or2.Turning it down and going all-in on CS job hunting, even though I’m mentally exhaustedFor people who’ve been in similar situations:•Is taking this kind of job a smart move short-term?•How risky is it for my long-term CS career?•Any advice on how to balance both?I’d really appreciate any perspective. Thanks in advance.",7,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qxk6oj/career_advice_needed_new_grad/,2026-02-06 15:11:33,2026-02-12 02:25:27

I heard back from them, but they’re requesting me to do a 1 minute video about what I’m looking for in my next role.I really don’t mind doing this, but isn’t this an excellent way for bias or discrimination to creep into the hiring process right off the bat?

1r1y7o5,About the Github portfolio,Solid-Shock3541,cscareerquestions,"I have been wanting to make one for a while now, but I often start projects that are too ambitious or complicated for my ability and just abandon them.Even the ones I do work on and finish, I might do a bunch of ""weird"" commits. For example for syncing data between multiple devices or similar short-undescriptive-named commits.Basically, I would want my portfolio to be clean and professional. But in reality I might more often than not work in a bit of a chaotic way. My idea was to work on a private Github/Gitlab and when I'm done with a project, I can create a project on my public portfolio Github and just copy the files. Meaning only the finished project would be there, no commits or branches, etc. Is that a good idea?What would you recommend in this scenario/problem?(This is mainly personal projects that I do because it's fun so I would rather not put in a lot of effort into working on the main portfolio Git and name every commit and do documentations and comments, etc. I wanna have fun while also get some portfolio out of my projects, don't wanna make it a bothersome process)",6,0.76,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r1y7o5/about_the_github_portfolio/,2026-02-11 14:03:27,2026-02-12 02:25:27
