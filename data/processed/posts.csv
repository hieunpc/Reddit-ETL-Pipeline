1pf455n,The Fabric push is burning me out,SignalMine594,dataengineering,"Just a Friday rant…I’ve worked on a bunch of data platforms over the years, and lately it’s getting harder to stay motivated and just do the job. When Fabric first showed up at my company, I was pumped. It looked cool and felt like it might clean up a lot of the junk I was dealing with. Now it just feels like it’s being shoved into everything, even when it shouldn’t fit, or can’t fit.All the public articles and blogs I see talk about it like it’s already this solid, all-in-one thing, but using it feels nothing like that. I get random errors out of nowhere, and stuff breaks for reasons nobody can explain. It makes me waste hours to debug just to see if I ran into a new bug, an old bug, or “that’s just how it is.” It’s exhausting me, and leadership thinks my team is just incompetent because we can’t get it working reliably (Side note: if your team is hiring, I'm looking to jump).But what’s been getting to me is how the conversation online has shifted. More Fabric folks and partner types jump into threads on Reddit acting like none of these problems are a big deal. Everything seems to be brushed off as “coming soon” or “it’s still new,” even though it’s been around for two years and half the features have GA labels slapped on them. It often feels like we get lectured for expecting basic things to work.I don’t mind a platform having some rough edges. Butt I *do* mind being pushed into something that still doesn’t feel ready, especially by sales teams talking like it’s already perfect, especially when we all know that the product keeps missing simple stuff you need to run something in production. I get that there’s a quota, but I promise I/my company would spend more if there was practical and realistic guidance and not just feel cornered into whatever product uplift they get on broken feature.And since Ignite, the whole AI angle just makes it messier. I keep asking how we’re supposed to do GenAI inside Fabric, there are lots of, “go look at Azure AI Foundry” or “go look at Azure AI Studio.” Or now this IQ stuff that’s like 3 different products, all called IQ. It feels like both everything and nothing at all are in Fabric? It just feels like a weird split between Data and AI at Microsoft, like they’re shipping whatever their org chart looks like instead of a real platform.Honestly, I get why people like Joe Reis lose it online about this stuff. At some point I just want a straight conversation about what actually works and what doesn’t, and how I can do my job well, instead of just getting into petty arguments",200,0.98,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pf455n/the_fabric_push_is_burning_me_out/,2025-12-05 19:24:32,2025-12-11 01:47:31

I used to be part of the data department where everyone was either a data engineer or a data scientist with more or less seniority. We are working in mixed teams on vertical products that also require other skills (UI development, API development, DevOps, etc).Recently my manager told me that the company has decided to rearrange all technological departments and I'll stay in my current team, however my manager (and team lead) will switch to someone with backend experience who has no idea about data engineering. I am extremely worried because we are essentially building a data product, which means that this person will be tasked with making architectural decisions with no knowledge about data engineering, but also I'm worried about my professional development as I'm MUCH more experienced about data stuff compared to my new manager / team lead so I'm not sure exactly what I can learn from him in that area.I won't go into details, but essentially we're building data pipelines with complex models that require an understanding of a complex domain, and the result of this processing is displayed on a UI that is sold to the customer.Has something like this happened at some of your companies?

1pj0iyr,Spark uses way too much memory when shuffle happens even for small input,Aggravating_Log9704,dataengineering,"I ran a test on Spark with a small dataset (about 700MB) doing some map vs groupBy + flatMap chains. With just map there was no major memory usage but when shuffle happened memory usage spiked across all workers, sometimes several GB per executor, even though input was small. From what I saw in the Spark UI and monitoring: many nodes had large memory allocation, and after shuffle old shuffle buffers or data did not seem to free up fully before next operations.  The job environment was Spark 1.6.2, standalone cluster with 8 workers having 16GB RAM each. Even with modest load, shuffle caused unexpected memory growth well beyond input size. I used default Spark settings except for basic serializer settings. I did not enable off-heap memory or special spill tuning.I think what might cause this is the way Spark handles shuffle files: each map task writes spill files per reducer, leading to many intermediate files and heavy memory/disk pressure. I want to ask the community* Does this kind of shuffle-triggered memory grab (shuffle spill mem and disk use) cause major performance or stability problems in real workloads* What config tweaks or Spark settings help minimize memory bloat during shuffle spill* Are there tools or libraries you use to monitor or figure out when shuffle is eating more memory than it should",47,0.91,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pj0iyr/spark_uses_way_too_much_memory_when_shuffle/,2025-12-10 11:45:00,2025-12-11 01:47:31

Users get dashboards, visualizations, rich semantic models across multiple environments, and can define invariants/alerts when certain conditions are met or violated.We have paying customers and a working product, but the architecture has become more complex and ad-hoc than it needs to be (partly because we optimized for customer feedback over cohesion). And lately we have been feeling as we are dealing with a lot of incidental complexity than our domain itself.With transactional apps, there are plenty of opinionated full-stack frameworks that give you auth, DB/ORM, scaffolding, API structure, frontend patterns, etc.My question:Is there anything comparable for analytics apps — something that gives a unified framework for:- ingestion + pipelines- semantic modelling- supporting heterogeneous storage/query engines- dashboards + visualization- alertingso a small team doesn’t have to stitch everything together ourselves and can focus on domain logic?I know the pieces exist individually:- Pipelines: Airflow / Dagster- Semantics: dbt- Storage/query: warehouses, Delta Lake, etc.- Visualization: Superset- Alerting: Superset or customBut is there an opinionated, end-to-end framework that ties these together?Extra constraint: We often deploy in customer cloud/on-prem, so the stack needs to be lean and maintainable across many isolated installations.TIA.",38,0.95,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ph3dsz/full_stack_framework_for_data_apps/,2025-12-08 04:37:59,2025-12-11 01:47:31

1pgcufv,Tired of Cleaning Broken Systems — Is It Time to Quit?,ShallowSeashore,dataengineering,"I am a 36-year-old accountant working in the UAE passionate about data and automation. I have been with a financial services company for more than 10 years. Over the years, my work has evolved: I started in front-office operations, then moved into complex reconciliations, later handled end-to-end accounting (A to Z) for a sister company, and eventually returned to financial services.My role has never been clearly defined. I am usually brought in to solve problems. I have access to an Oracle database now and I know basic SQL (not advanced). I also have strong Excel and VBA skills. I’ve regularly used these skills to solve operational problems, build logic, help write scripts, and set rules in vendor-provided tools to automate reconciliations. I also helped create Excel templates for reporting.I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, along with SQL courses and basic Python, although I can’t recall everything well now. I’ve done some reconciliation work in BigQuery using SQL (often with ChatGPT support), but in my actual day-to-day job I mostly use standard queries like SELECT, GROUP BY, WHERE, and HAVING—nothing very advanced.My dilemma is this: my company has huge backlogs, but the core problems are not about writing the right query or automating something. The real issues are poor initial setups, incorrect postings, bad historical decisions, and choosing the wrong cheap vendors to cut the cost. We’re trying to “clean the garage,” but the garage is fundamentally broken—missing data, open loops, and structural issues that can’t realistically be fixed.What makes it worse is that old staff are defensive. They won’t allow corrections that might expose their past mistakes because it affects their reputation. The expectation is: you’re here to fix things, but without the authority or data needed to actually fix them.Because I commute around 5 hours a day, I arrive at work already exhausted. I struggle to learn new skills consistently. This has left me stressed, stagnant, and feeling useless—trying to clean deeply broken systems alone, with no real progress in either my career or my technical growth.So I am stuck between these options:1) Stay with the company, learn very slowly, continue firefighting, take blame for issues I didn’t create, remain stressed, and feel that my career and skill set are not progressing.2) Go back to my home country, focus seriously on learning (properly and deeply), work on real projects, join something structured like Zoomcamp or another bootcamp, and try to move into freelance or remote work. I see people around me leveraging new tools, AI, automation, and platforms like n8n—while I feel stuck in a toxic environment with almost no time or energy to grow. My fear here is losing time and professional reputation.3) Any other option I’m not seeing?",36,0.91,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pgcufv/tired_of_cleaning_broken_systems_is_it_time_to/,2025-12-07 07:54:01,2025-12-11 01:47:31

1phaejg,Career isn't really moving in the right direction and I'm worried I'll turn into a reporting analyst. Can't tell if market is shit or I'm overvaluing myself,Captain_Strudels,dataengineering,"Went from senior analyst for a decently large tech company to intermediate engineer for an org a bit further along than ""startup"". I'm desperately trying to move my career to something closer to ""software engineer with data skills"" but I can't seem to land the right role. The org I've been with for the past year-ish has been focused on very grimy, hands-on data migrations for individual clients into our system - data entry with extra steps. I'm trying to take on projects that solve bigger problems, like getting involved with fleshing out our warehouse and providing reporting views for all of our customers rather than bespoke reports for individual customers.However the business seems REALLY keen on just keeping me in a little silo and handing off the important projects to our devs. I'm told migrations are the #1 priority, so proper pipeline building is sitting elsewhere as I keep the lights on. The migration work is absolutely soul destroying and mind numbing, but the volume of it keeps me from progressing more meaningful internal projects for my career.Whats more, the business has identified individual customer bespoke report building as an untapped revenue stream and is prepping to shift me much more onto it, so I seem to have even less room to negotiate doing anything else. And my attempts at working closer with the devs was dashed as we recently underwent something of a restructure that silo'd the data team further from them.I feel like my org just needs a cheap grunt to process customer data instead of an engineer, and that's totally cool, but I can't tell if my inability to climb internally or find a better role elsewhere is because I keep landing roles that fundamentally won't progress me or if I'm not learning the right skills in my own time. * I think my SQL skills are great - not like ""I can do the craziest shit in SQL"" amazing, but I've always been one of the better SQL writers in my orgs. I don't think I have much to say here.* I think my Python skills are mediocre but not a complete handicap. This year, since starting my new role, I've made some basic scripts to help me with processing data before pushing into our system, mainly with Polars/Pandas. But frankly this was largely prompted so I could deliver at speed. I'm fine with reading and debugging code on my own. But I've never been in much of a situation where I've needed to write code for the business, and when I review code written by our senior devs, I can tell I have no idea about proper project structuring. In prior analyst roles I mainly worked with R to solve complex data problems, so I'm not that unexposed to more traditional programming languages.* I haven't really had to work with LINQ but I've had exposure. It doesn't seem to come up in job listings so I assume it's more for SWEs who happen to be doing some data work in C#?* re: cloud tech, I'm not sure if I'm bringing anything to the table. Current org uses Azure, last org used GCP, haven't worked with AWS before. But ultimately none of this has affected me beyond using the company's choice of data interface, eg SQL Server, BigQuery, etc. In my current org I am lightly dabbling in Azure-specific key vaults and blob storage, but I don't know if I should suddenly be throwing this on the CV.* I think my GIT is fine? Like I'm not rebasing branches but I'm able to do the basics to contribute to a code base.* Soft skills I don't have the best measure on. I think they're good given my prior senior experience for a well-renowned org. My ""manager"" (part of senior leadership but the org is quite small so touches base once a week to confirm work is on track) suggested I consider trying to become the data team leader. I don't know if this is realistically happening in my time here.But then I look at senior roles and I don't feel I qualify. There's not much which I think is a product of the global market being a bit shit, and particularly where I live has been hit pretty hard. But the few roles there are skills like advanced Python or specific cloud tech exposure. And I'm like ""I could probably lie and learn it on the role"" but I'm worried I'm giving myself too much credit.Is this a common situation to be in? Is there a way out? Do I just need to grind out Python on my own time for like 6-12 months before I'm allowed to be senior?",19,0.82,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1phaejg/career_isnt_really_moving_in_the_right_direction/,2025-12-08 11:47:46,2025-12-11 01:47:31

But the company is finally investing in data modeling, quality, and governance, and now the team has freedom to choose proper tools for the next stage.In the near future, we want more reliable pipelines, a real data warehouse, better observability/testing, and eventually support for analytics and MLOps.

1pgbhcq,Data lake as a service,ihatevacations,dataengineering,"Hey all, I had an idea for a data lake visualization tool but I don't know if this is a pain point that other engineers have as well. When I used to work on a team that built a data lake on top of AWS technologies (S3, DMS, Redshift, Glue, Athena, Lake Formation, etc) I found it a bit hard to visualize the data flow since everything was a bit scattered, though having the architecture diagram helped a little bit. Aside from visualization, the AWS monthly bill was eye watering and it had a bunch of operational issues. Observability was a bit of a pain too since we had to create alarms for each table and each database in Glue. This is just my experience from working on a data lake that was built from scratch.This might be a stupid idea but I was thinking about possible ways to make it easier to build data lakes and manage everything in an all-in-one platform, from prototyping to testing to observability. Especially for smaller companies that don't have the luxury of spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars per month in infrastructure costs, they can use smaller machines to setup a data lake and expand it as they go. To start off, the idea is to build a visualization tool where you can use your choice of hosting / tools, for example S3 or your own blob storage, and execute scripts to perform transformations on that data and build a data lake from there. It would include ways to automate observability by automatically setting up alarms as you connect different pieces together.Is this a pain point that others face as well? Does something like this exist already? And would something like this be worth building?",7,0.89,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pgbhcq/data_lake_as_a_service/,2025-12-07 06:29:43,2025-12-11 01:47:31

1pi4dtl,Protobuf schema-based fake data generation tool,SnooHabits4703,dataengineering,"I have created an open-source \[protobuf schema-based fake data creation tool\](https://github.com/lazarillo/protoc-gen-fake) that I thought I'd share with the community.It's still in \*very early\* stages; it does fully work and there is some documentation, but I don't have nice CI/CD GitHub Actions set up for it yet, and I'm sure as folks who are not me start using it, they will either submit issues or code improvements, but I think it's good enough to share with an avant garde group willing to give me some constructive feedback.I have used protocol buffers as a binary format / hardened schema for many years of my data eng / machine learning career. I have also worked on lots of brand new platforms, where it's a challenge to create realistic, massive scale fake data that looks believable. There are nice tools out there for generating a fake address or a fake name, etc., and in fact I rely upon the nice Rust \[fake\](https://github.com/cksac/fake-rs) package. But nothing did the ""final step"", IMHO, of taking a schema that has already been defined and using that schema to generate realistic, complex fake data of exactly the structure you may need.At its core, I have used protobuf's \[options\](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#options) as a mechanism to define what sort of fake data you want to generate. The package includes two examples to explain itself, here is the simpler one:\`\`\` syntax = ""proto3""; package examples; import ""gen_fake/fake_field.proto""; message User { option (gen_fake.fake_msg).include = true; string id = 1 [(gen_fake.fake_data).data_type = ""SafeEmail""]; string name = 2 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""FirstName"" language: ""FR_FR"" }]; string family_name = 3 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""LastName"" language: ""PT_BR"" }]; repeated string phone_numbers = 4 [(gen_fake.fake_data) = { data_type: ""PhoneNumber"" min_count: 1 max_count: 3 }]; }\`\`\`As you can see, you add the \`gen\_fake.fake\_data\` option type, providing things like the data type, the count of repetitions, and you can supply a language. In the example above, you would get a \`User\` type of data object created with fake data filed in for the UUID, first name, family name, and phone numbers.I'm hoping this can be useful to others. It has been very helpful to me, especially when testing for corner cases like when optional or repeated values are missing, ensuring UTF-8 is being used everywhere and, most importantly, being able to generate the SQL code and whatnot needed for generating downstream derived data before the backend has all the tooling in place to be able to supply the data formats that I need.As an aside, this also helps to encourage the \[data contract\](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/data-contracts) way of working within your organization, a lifesaver tool for robustness and uptime of analytics tools.",5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pi4dtl/protobuf_schemabased_fake_data_generation_tool/,2025-12-09 10:45:55,2025-12-11 01:47:31
1pi3lpb,How do you approach solution design? (And bit of a rant),Ulfrauga,dataengineering,"Maybe a dumb question, maybe not. In your data team, do you conduct solution design reviews? Do you even have a deliberate solution design phase?I might be wrong in my usage of ""solution design""; go ahead and correct me if so. What I mean is more simply - how do you intend to achieve the required output, or meet the requirements?Contrived example: What they want is the classic ""build a report"". Or maybe just the data model to hand over to someone else to build a report with. Raw data is not ingested. So, let's say that simply, you have to ingest, model, and deliver.* But what does the development of that outcome look like?* How do you break down the work?* What objects are you going to create?* Where do you put this information and decision points?* Does a peer review this ""design""?* Who ""sets"" this design?This is where I might be venturing off topic, but it's why I'm asking - how do others in the industry do this stuff, and to what standard? I'm not above thinking I might be looking for problems where there are none, or making drama and pointing fingers. On the other hand, maybe my concerns are valid.I'm the senior in my team (of two ICs). Not the manager, but the tech ""lead"". I've talked quite a lot with my more junior colleague about the benefits of planning stuff out, coming up with a ""design"", and going over it together. Two sets of eyes and all that. IMO it's a fundamental development concept. Applicable to data work as much as baking a wedding cake.I don't see a lot of planning, or pipeline and data model design being done. Maybe it happens on a paper notebook? That's fine to an extent, but it doesn't appear to be transferred to the ticket system, DevOps items, or even a Word doc in SharePoint. We have regular time slots to discuss current work and otherwise chat generally about what we do. It's meant to be pretty informal. This is sometimes when we might do a ""design review"" but it tends to be based on verbal description of what is being done, and a remote view of developmental code. I'll give feedback, but it's 50/50 if it drives any change.We use branching and PRs with reviews. The PR review has become an opportunity for reviewing the overall approach and design as much as code review. But at that point, it's sort of too late to be challenging or making suggestions about the overall design. There's been more than a few occasions where I know we have to deliver - value to the business! - but I'm seeing technical debt in the future. Undocumented, sometimes inconsistent, has the feel of thrown-together.I want to bring it up with my manager, I just need to frame it well.

1pj042w,Datalakes for AI Assistant - is it feasible?,CalendarNo8792,dataengineering,"Hi, I am new to data engineering and software dev in general.I've been tasked with creating an AI Assistant for a management service company website using opensource models, like from Ollama. In simple terms, the purpose of this assistant is so that both customer clients and operations staff can use this assistant to query anything about the current page they are on and/or about their data stored in the db. Then, the assistant will answer based on the available data of the page and from the database. Basically how perplexity works but this will be custom and for this particular website only.For example, client asks 'which of my contracts are active and pending payment?' Then the assistant will be able to respond with details of relevant contracts and their payment details.For db related queries, i do not want the existing db to be queried. So i though of creating a separate backend for this AI assistant and possibly create a duplicate db which is always synced with the actual db. This is when i looked into datalakes. I could possibly store some documents and files for RAG (such as company policy docs) and it will also store the synced duplicate db. Then the assistant will be using this datalake instead for answering queries and be completely independent of the website.Is this approach feasible? Can someone please suggest the pros and cons of this approach and if any other better approach is possible?

I even thought about using flink for this job, but that's maybe over doing it ? Since it's not that complicated of a task? I also wonder if spooldir wouldn't have to read all the file in memory to parse it ? Because my files size could vary from little as 1mb to hundreds of mb.And also, I would love to have your opinion about combining my custom script + spooldir , in a way where my script generates json header files in a file monitored by a spooldir connector?",0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pjhb0o/kafka_spooldir_vs_custom_script/,2025-12-10 22:56:12,2025-12-11 01:47:31

I open it, see how it looks, check the HTML/CSS/JS to understand the idea… then I close everything, open a blank project in VS Code, and try to rebuild it on my own. If I get stuck, I google the specific part and keep going.A friend told me this is a “bad habit,” because a “real programmer” should build things from scratch without checking someone else’s code first.

Lately, I’ve been feeling stuck: my current company no longer offers growth opportunities, either financially or professionally. Overall, it feels like a stagnant situation.This has been weighing on me for a while and I feel like 2026 might be the right year to make a change, starting with improving my English, but also taking a serious step forward in my career.A bit of context about the situation here in Italy:* Being specialized only in frontend isn’t a highly in-demand skill.* On top of that, I keep receiving job offers with salaries that are honestly discouraging and make me feel undervalued.That said, I want to invest both in my English and in my technical skills, but I’m not sure which direction to take. Here are some of the ideas I'm considering:* Buying several courses on Udemy and studying deeply to strengthen my knowledge, improve my CV and hopefully find better opportunities.* Looking into more structured, higher-quality courses (I’m willing to spend a few thousand euros if it’s truly worth it) that might offer stronger guarantees or even connections with companies. I know that in some fields these programs help people land jobs quickly, but I’m not sure if this model works in IT.* Broadening or diversifying my skill set: learning Three.js to specialize in a niche area, moving toward a full-stack role or even switching to game development, which has always interested me. I’m also open to exploring other promising or highly-requested fields.For context, I don’t have a university degree. I’m also seriously considering relocating abroad, actually, that’s one of my main dreams right now, because I’d really like to gain international experience.What do you think?**TL;DR:** 29-year-old frontend dev in Italy feeling stuck with no growth.

1phe5vo,Is programming often taught depth-first? Why?,TsukiInkling,learnprogramming,"Hi, I'm currently learning Java in my senior year of high school, and I got my Python certification a couple years ago. Please do let me know if this happens to be just a Java thing so I can instead ask on that sub.Something I've noticed particularly recently is that, when trying to make something too far past the kind of things we learn about in class, I end up encountering a problem that challenges how I understand the way Java works.A good example of this is when I found some fairly basic code somewhere (the context & specifics of which I've forgotten) that created a ""new Main"" object. This threw me for a loop, as I've really just seen ""Main"" as a container for code that runs when starting a program, and never considered it as an object. I also then realized I have no clue what the ""(String[] args)"" bit means in the main method.So, why are the ""basics"" of programming languages (or again, maybe just Java) things like printing ""hello world"" before you deeply understand what a class is and why the print command is in one?Post-script: A few other examples of being taught a specific use for something without knowing what it does exactly(Side note: ""for some reason"" here just means I didn't know the reason, not that it's unreasonable)- Printing text, which for some reason requires me to add ""System.out."" beforehand- Creating a Scanner object to read user text input, which for some reason requires me to specify ""(System.in)""- Catching all errors, which for some reason requires me to specify ""(Exception e)""- Fixing a Scanner after inputting a number so it correctly takes text input, which for some reason is as simple as executing the command "".nextLine()""EDIT: The (quite helpful!) responses to this were a lot longer than I expected lol, I believe my questions have been answered.

First, some context.A while ago I undertook the arduous task of learning OpenGL. From all the basics of drawing primitives and up to advanced concepts such as compute shaders and volumetric cloud rendering. The entire process was an immense learning curve and honestly felt like I was relearning how to program. The result is a procedurally generated universe where you can explore endless galaxies and solar systems. However, it is still unfinished and I will continue working on it.I found that while learning OpenGL you are bombarded with terminology, and it can be quite difficult to take these concepts and develop your own ideas. So, I was thinking of making a series that introduces you into the concepts needed, and develop an intuitive understanding of graphics programming. Then each concept we learn we can apply that to our custom program.So my question is, would any of you be interested in this? Would you have any recommendations? Or should I scrap this idea? I already have a 'thumbnail' (not a very well thought out one) that I put together if anyone would like to see it. I will provide a link to a google docs if that is allowed.

1pf363w,What do you do when you have a theoretically very complex object generation process that doesnt seem suited for a regular constructor?,Hellinfernel,learnprogramming,"For context, I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.For example, lets take the word ""Servus"", which means (a male) slave. (Dont be scared, its a unfortunately very common word in the roman time period, in which most of the training texts are settled). In the nominative case, its just ""Servus"", while the genitive case has ""servi"", the dative has ""servo"" and the accusative case has ""servum"" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations).But then there are also the plural forms, which are ""Servi"", ""servorum"",""servis"" and ""servos"" respectively.And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.This requires me to somehow construct something that can handle a lot of those cases, the question is just, how.My first instinct was creating a Noun-Class (Java) and then create a constructor that takes the word stem and the grammatical gender and then write methods that return the fitting suffix based on the context that is called. This looks then like this: public String getNominativeSingular() { StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(); stringBuilder.append(stem); String suffix = """"; switch (gender){ case NEUTRUM -> { suffix = ""um""; break; } case MASCULINUM -> { suffix = ""us""; break; } case FEMININUM -> { suffix = ""a""; break; } } stringBuilder.append(suffix); return stringBuilder.toString(); }In a vacuum this approach is fine, but it feels like this might cause more work than actually necessary in the long run.

Money isn't my motivation in doing this, its out of general curiosity, we all need money to survive that's correct but if you're just starting out or thinking about wanting to learn how to code, think about why you're doing this. Is this something you're actually passionate about and wanting to learn? Or is this just to get a job? If you're only in this for money then you may struggle to find the motivation to continue progressing with your learning as jobs are not easy to get in this field. Trying to speed run the learning process will also lead to burn out, there's no point in trying to learn everything that takes years into a month.

1pgha73,"Questions around the term ""Schema"" and related phrases",LetMyCameronG000,learnprogramming,"So I've googled this a bit and it seems the term ""schema"" only ever comes up in the context of databases.But the term itself seems to refer to the 'shape of data' (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tshe0h/can\_someone\_eli5\_what\_a\_schema\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tshe0h/can_someone_eli5_what_a_schema_is/) )My questions are:* Can we use ""schema"" to mean something other than database schemas ?

As I worked my way through their distributed systems course, I found myself checking blog posts, Reddit, and using Claude to explain the concepts more clearly and succinctly.

So I wanted to listen to some opinions who cracked this thing before me. I took some time off from work and would like to dedicate it to solidifying knowledge in some technologies as well as learning others. I had an idea on how to go about it, but while talking with one colleague his words discouraged me from this initial idea.So, one of us thinks that I should pick up a project, design it in broad terms, do some research on what technologies make sense for it, then learn them as I work on the project. The other thinks that I should make a list of topics (design patterns etc) and technologies I would like to learn, find some solid resources, follow them. As I follow the concepts I also do exercises or make up examples to apply the knowledge / tinker with the different info. As knowledge accumulates, I revisit these exercises and see if there are better ways to do those things and why. By the time I have covered a significant amount of the material, I think of a project that would be fitting for the topics and technologies I am studying and work on it. In case the answer to my question is ""whatever works for you"", I don't know what works for me. I have a couple of years of experience, but I always learn things as I go in a very half baked way. That has made me professionally insecure, because my knowledge does not match my hard work or years of experience.My goals are, 3 months of studying. I should learn design patterns and architecture, solidify my python, airflow, spark and postgresql knowledge. Learn kafka and some kubernetes and aws services.

And one of the things I've been going out of my way to avoid is abstracting the repositories. The reason behind that is, the first few versions of this API (Files are lost) I did exactly that, everything worked really well until I had to do major changes in one of them. And since everything was super tied together any change I did would require me to change the others or add new methods that will handle the new changes. I did find some work around at the time but they were not great and I ended up remaking the whole thing with out abstracting the repositories again.One of my main problems at the time with DRY was adding logic to the try/catch block that was abstracted. That's why I'm searching for a solution that's is flexible enough to allow this.The API isn't done, there are like 100 things to be added, that's why I've been hesitant of abstracting them.I will be honest, the first few versions were bad, really really bad, horrible, the worst thing you will ever see (service logic mixed with repositories...) and I do believe that's part of it why I couldn't properly separate them.

1pf4onp,Should I cancel my final rounds with Meta?,dandaman1728,cscareerquestions,"Senior software engineer with 9YOE.I got an offer for a fully remote role earlier this week. I negotiated with them with a higher base and told them that I'm in process with Meta (L5). With some back and forth, today they reached out and told me that they're willing to meet my asking base salary, which is higher than their cap for the role. I can tell that they want me and I also told them that I'm willing to stop my process with Meta if they can meet my requirements. They did, and now I'm wondering if I should cancel my final rounds with Meta next week. Regardless I will choose the fully remote role since even if I pass Meta, the 2-3 days hybrid in office requires me to uproot my family and relocate probably, and I do have a 18-month old toddler so work/life balance matters a lot to me now.So for now, I'm thinking what's the point of doing the interviews if I'm not going to take the offer. Plus I've been preparing for this round for months, doing leetcode, system design everyday. I'm tired of all of this. If doing interviews, I think it's just for the sake of gaining experience. I don't want to waste everybody's time. The thing is I failed the final rounds with Meta in 2024, so if I fail this time it would be the 2nd fail attempt.

1pj9hj2,Joined Microsoft as a new grad and I’m miserable,aBadassCutiePie,cscareerquestions,"Graduated in June and joined Microsoft as a new grad software engineer in Prague. Before that, I spent over two years working at a startup, and honestly those were the best years of my degree. I had close on-site friends, we built creative features, brainstormed ideas, and it genuinely felt fun going into the office every day.Now I’m ~6 months into MSFT and I seriously don’t know if this is normal. On paper everything is great, my winter review says I’m exceeding expectations, my manager and team are super happy with me, and objectively nothing is “wrong.”But emotionally? It’s been rough. Most days I’m anxious, constantly scared I’m not performing enough. Half the week ends with me feeling overwhelmed, and at least once a week I break down crying at night. I look forward to weekends. No matter how much I sleep, exercise, meditate, or whatever, it keeps happening.The work itself isn’t helping. It’s mostly infra, bugs,security standards - barely any coding and zero creativity. My team is nice but almost everyone is remote, and the office is full of people from unrelated teams. Plus people barely talk to each other. I haven’t formed any real friendships here; everything feels formal or “networking-like.” Nothing like the tight on-site friendships I had before.My therapist says there’s probably something else causing this anxiety (also generally I’m someone with big self-imposed expectations of myself). But I can’t shake the feeling that I should be happy - isn’t working at such a company every CS student’s dream?I’m confused and honestly worried. Is this just normal for big tech grads in Europe?

1pg4hcz,Laid off 5 times within 6 years because of lack of performance,mindfucked007,cscareerquestions,"Hey, I have been laid off around 5 times in my whole software development career (also tried consulting) because I have a bit of a slower performance than others and made more mistakes (bugs or small design issues like margin mismatch when doing frontend dev). Chatgpt mentioned that I might have ADD (so ADHD-I) because I sometimes struggled in private areas too. But it's more like I forget things or I don't force myself to do my work hard enough. I feel like my brain is often more ""lazy"" because thinking hard (like solving a complex issue) is uncomfortable. I mean it's not that I'm lazy at work, but having the complex issue in ones mind and try to solve it efficiently is not that easy. On some days I have a overall good performance and I'm clearheaded but unfortunately on other days I'm not. Chatgpt mentioned that I might have some mental issue where stimulants could help me to have a better performance. Actually I'm not sure if ADHD-I would be the right diagnosis because I don't have distraction issues like these people often have. It's not that my focus or thoughts are changing all the time and that's the core reason of all... No rather it's stuff like working memory, processing speed, mild ""brain fog"", etc. where I feel this impacts my performance at work. The thing is that I'm not sure anymore. Even psychologists do have an overall different opinion... some say it could be ADHD-I, others say rather not. I don't know.

1ph4ux0,Array Reversal as a Filtering Question,Inner_Butterfly1991,cscareerquestions,"I'm a Tech Lead at a company you've heard of and I have 11 yoe. I'm typically anti-LC in interviews, my style is typically I pick the project they've listed on their resume that seems the most interesting both in terms of level of difficulty and just of interest to me, and drill super deep on it to really tease out if they did what they said they did. And 9/10 times that works. But until you've interviewed lots of people, you don't realize how good some people are at bullshitting. This is why LC exists, and it's why we implemented at least a super basic tech screen. We're a data team so we give them a sample dataset from data we actually work with, and ask them to do some super basic transformations and aggregations. We'll also work with them and are very forgiving, we're not looking for you to get the answer even, but we're looking for the signs that you actually understand the super basics and when given feedback can adjust your approach and at least have the right mindset.So back to the title, it astounded me when there was a post in this sub where someone was super upset that reversing an array without using the reverse function would be a question, as that was too much of memorizing algorithms. If we were talking an LC hard then sure I agree. But to anyone who knows the basics about programming this should be super easy. But given all the pushback I reconsidered, and I tested myself to ensure I could do it. And within 5 minutes I had 3 different solutions. Again I don't do LCs regularly, I've done some in job prep but we're talking about \~10 hours in my life and I'm on my 4th job. I don't think I've ever successfully done a hard, and although I can easily do most easy ones and am around 50/50 at mediums, there was one easy I failed on. I'm definitely not the LC, memorize algorithms type. But again this isn't an algorithm question it's one of the most basic things you can do. I used python but the fundamentals are the same in all languages:1. for i in range(len(array)): array2[len(array) - 1 - i] = array[i] array = array22. j = 0 for i in range(len(array)-1,-1,-1): array2[j] = array[i] j += 1 array = array2And probably the most algorithm answer: i = 0 j = len(array) - 1 while j > i: a = array[i] array[i] = array[j] array[j] = a i += 1 j -= 1And I'd assume in an interview setting it's fine to be running code and refining it, I certainly did when doing especially the last one (I had the while condition j > 0 initially so it was actually re-reversing so ending with the original array). And I get it I have 11 yoe this was talking about a junior level interview. But if there's even an intern on the team, I'm expecting them to be able to figure things out much more complicated than reversing an array, and I don't think that's all that crazy to expect them to be able to do. My analogy I used was saying ""you'll never have to reverse an array at your job"" is similar to if a French to English translator was asked to count to 10 in French, couldn't, and angrily replied ""when am I ever going to be counting to 10 in my job?"" And the answer is you'll be asked to do things so much more difficult, and if you can't count to 10 in the language you're translating from obviously you're not going to be able to perform the job duties.As I mentioned, I've never asked this question in an interview, but I'm asking much harder questions. I'm asking our junior level folks to calculate weighted averages excluding outliers and creating summary statistics by year. I'm then changing the requirements and seeing how they can update their code with the shifting requirements. And I don't think those are even all that hard, they're the bare minimum I'd expect interns to be able to do. We care a lot more about soft skills and perceived willingness to learn, but we need you to be able to do the bare minimum from a technical perspective. Do people really think asking a potential employee whether they can reverse an array is that crazy and means we expect them to memorize algorithms that have nothing to do with the job? This isn't an LC hard, I don't think any of my solutions above are all that crazy or tough to come up with if you understand the basics of arrays and loops. And given how business logic works, it's not even that crazy to be a real world example. What if there are certain values in the array that can't be moved due to government regulation or enterprise requirements so you can only reverse all the other elements while keeping certain values in their place? You can't use a reverse function for that. And that's a hell of a lot tougher of a problem than simple reversal.I don't know I guess it just astounds me that this sub is all about how tough this market is especially for juniors, yet at the same time it's crazy to expect a junior can do something that in my mind is super basic and contrary to the arguments against it does not actually require memorizing any algorithms, just using a little bit of critical thinking about what reversing an array actually is doing (first is last, second is second to last, etc).",193,0.91,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ph4ux0/array_reversal_as_a_filtering_question/,2025-12-08 05:57:52,2025-12-11 01:47:33
1phivgo,"I was laid off back in march, started a business. Now the business makes more than my current compsci employment",jablokojuyagroko,cscareerquestions,"**PSA: Rewritten with AI because im not a native speaker.**I Hit 5 years of frontend experience back in March. I was extremely stressed at my last job — hated every single day of it after getting placed on a new project that was basically a legacy nightmare.After about 3 years there, I started noticing the headcount slowly shrinking. I didn’t worry too much because I thought my role was “safe.” because I was replacing the ones that were fired before me. So I went ahead and got preapproved for a mortgage after saving for 7 years rent was draining me.The *next day* after getting preapproved, i kid you not, I got fired with no notice (along with half my department). Had to cancel the mortgage and lost a big chunk of money in the process. That one hurt.I was so burnt out that I just gave up for a bit. Moved back with my parents (super grateful for them) and did absolutely nothing for a month — just walked around, saw old friends, and tried to enjoy life again (best months of my recent life btw).During that time, I realized my parents’ business basically had no online presence. So I decided to build everything: marketing campaigns, data tracking, an ecommerce extension — the whole deal. Spent about 4 months grinding on that while also doing \~10 interviews (all rejections) as you can see I was not super focused on interviewing, and I was very picky. The business slowly started gaining traction online.Then in month 5, I finally got a job through LinkedIn.Fast forward almost a year: This new job pays 30% more than my old one… but I still hate it because it’s legacy stuff again, and I’m scared to leave because the market is rough. I get *zero* LinkedIn messages and feel like I’m getting rusty since no one uses this old tech anymore. I did an interview once during this period, and I was brutally destroyed since I forgot all the ""modern"" tech.BUT at the same time, the online business I built for my parents is on track this December to make *more* than my “new” job. And now people are hearing about it — I’m currently in talks with my first official non-family client to build a platform for them.What I’m trying to say is: if things aren’t working out, and you know tech, just try stuff. Throw things at the wall until something sticks, then grab that opportunity and build it out. You’ll learn a ton, and you might get lucky. Honestly, at this point I feel like that’s more promising than job hunting. I only landed my current job because of a friend — without that, I’m not sure I’d have gotten hired again.Try everything, especially if you’re in your 20s. Something will eventually stick. I think that being a dev, knowing online Ads and marketing is a superpower, you can market anything.Worst part is: I still have zero stability. I can’t rent or get a mortgage right now, so I’m stuck living with my parents… but at least things are moving somewhere.And at the same time, this month december im on track to make more via this online business that my ""new"" job where im paid 30% more than my old job. And people have started to hear, and im on talks to onboard my first official non family client to build a platform for them.With this I just want to say that if shit aint working for you, you know tech, try stuff, throw shit into the wall until something sticks and grab that shit by the horns and improve it, you will learn a lot, and might get lucky. At this point I think its better than lookign for a job, I got extremely lucky with the search specifically thanks to af riend, otherwise I think i would have never gotten a job againTry evertyhing, specially if you are young (20s) , something will stick, get some bartender job or whatever shit, and try to see what is a pain point they have and solve it with your coding skills. On the worse said, I have 0 stability now, and I cant rent anything, nor get a mortgage because of it so im stuck at my parents.

Unsure where to go.,shamanshaman123,cscareerquestions,"I was a software eng at a somewhat big company for 9 years and 8 months until about 2 hours ago. For the last 2 years, I've honestly been kind of circling the drain and struggling to keep up with the other devs. I managed a senior promotion about 5 years into the job, but was promoted based on my fullstack work, which involved a lot of frontend; almost immediately after getting promoted, I was shunted into mostly backend, which I was able to maintain for about 2 years (although just barely, IMO) since we worked in Node.js.2 years ago, my team switched to Java, which I had very little experience in. I deeply struggled to keep up with the team, which at this point were experienced Java developers. The struggle overtook me, and I made dozens of mistakes, some small, some big. Admittedly, I didn't do anything outside of work; I tried to maintain WLB and stick to working during working-hours only, and didn't do any other prep or studying or projects outside of work hours. After many conversations about performance with my manager, they decided to let me go without a PIP or anything; just fired.Despite working in backend for 4 years now I feel like my backend skills are garbage. But since I had no opportunities during work to do any frontend work, my frontend skills have also decayed significantly to the point that I'm fairly sure I can't pass an interview based on it. On top of all that, the job I had was my first software job out of college, so I don't have experience with other companies to work with. I feel at least a little screwed (this is about as optimistic a take I can give), and extremely directionless; backend clearly isn't a good fit for me, and my frontend skills are junior-level at best. I have no idea how to present myself for interviews, or what to prepare for; I'm considering taking a frontend bootcamp to try and modernize my skills to _hopefully_ be able to get a frontend role, but I'm terrified that I can't maintain a senior skill level. It's frustrating because I know I have at least some experience to draw on; I couldn't have kept this job for so long without at least doing something right at some point. But it all feels so murky.If anyone has been in a similar position or has any advice, I would gladly take it. I don't mind if it's harsh; I'm not in a position to complain.

Most of the actual work I want to do is building interfaces, working with APIs, handling state, understanding UX, and shipping features. Meanwhile I’m watching people who spent a few months in focused online schools get hired into the exact same frontend roles I’ve been aiming for. Meanwhile I keep seeing people who took a focused bootcamp and they’re getting hired into the exact same frontend roles I’m aiming for. It almost feels unfair they learned precisely what the job requires while I spent years grinding through concepts that rarely show up in web dev interviews. CS feels geared toward systems engineering, embedded work, data infra, and theory heavy roles not the stuff that shows up in most frontend job postings. So now I’m stuck wondering if I took this long academic route for something I could’ve learned way faster. Or maybe the CS background does matter long term and I’m just not seeing the payoff yet.

1pegr29,My job-hunting strategy that landed me the offer I wanted,Comet7777,cscareerquestions,"I was coming from a tech leadership role for a handful of years before sort of burning out and deciding to jump at a startup. Same industry that I know, cool new hook and angle, a ""Head of Product"" title and good investors. This company demanded 10-12 hours daily and would rush projects out and I'm just completely allergic to this way of ""working"". Because they're in pacific time and I'm in central, I was working past dinner time and not eating or spending time with my family. So, after 4 months of being here, something I've never done, I decided to look for something better already.I've always been ""good"" at getting new offers if I wanted them, via by networking or other means. I was sort of slapped to reality and humbled when I saw how awful this market actually is. The pain at work, coupled with two early phone screen rejections made me realize I had to change how I was doing this. The tech job market from 2017-2022 was long gone.Here are the tips that ultimately worked for me:1. Reached out to my network and let them know my situation. I received 4 referrals and a handful of informational interviews with folks. I did this via group chats, messaging connections on LinkedIn, college alumni groups I'm a part of.2. I used LinkedIn Premium. Why use this overpriced service? As soon as I have it and I mark myself as actively looking (oh and hide the damn Premium icon from your profile or your employer will find it odd that you have it) - I start getting tons of recruiters hitting me up. 2 of these led to an initial screen.3. Adjusted my title appropriately. I de-leveled my title for certain Senior Product Manager roles. One question I kept getting was why go from leadership/management to a role like this. The real reason was because my current environment is toxic, my title is inflated there, and the money isn't great, and these ""lower title"" roles were paying on par or sometimes higher for significantly less responsibility. A buddy of mine who was a VP had to practice a similar thing in de-leveling his title when he was laid off. You can play around with your title a bit, but I DO NOT recommend leveling up your title when that isn't factual. It'll come out.4. Apply daily to the latest openings, I'll show you how to best do this below.5. Had a single thread with ChatGPT where it knew my resume, my work history, my specific projects, my answers to previous interview and job application questions. This made answering bespoke custom questions on ATSs very quick.6. A benefit/luxury/advantage - I do have a variety of experience as a software engineer, product manager, tech leadership etc. I'm aware that this greatly expedited this whole process and if I was more junior I likely would have struggled significantly more.**Best Places to Apply.** I would open up my computer and had a browser with the following tabs open:1. LinkedIn job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)2. Indeed job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)3. [Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/) search (an AI aggregator that links you directly to company careers postings)4. [Wellfound.com](http://wellfound.com/) search (specifically for start-up hiring)5. Google search with the following:site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com (""Group Product Manager"" OR ""Principal Product Manager"" OR ""Senior Product Manager"" OR ""Director of Product"" OR ""VP of Product"" OR ""Head of Product"") AND ""remote""This will list ALL job postings that match the description of those job titles I was looking for (and remote!) directly against the ATS without having to rely on crappy job aggregators. Now open up a tab and do the same thing but replace site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com with the following ATSs I could find: \- site:jobs.lever.co \- site:boards.greenhouse.io \- site:ashbyhq.comThen on the google results, go to Tools and select last 24 hours.This means I would have 10'ish tabs open each day and do the search at 9am and later around 2-3pm and then apply right away. This search almost always takes you to a new posting, rather than those annoying ghost openings or jobs that get reposted for months. This also takes you directly to the employer's site.**High-level stats:** \- Total Applications - 350+ \- Referrals made on my behalf - 4 (only one led to a phone screen lol) \- Duration - \~2 months \- Companies scheduling phone screen - 9 (2 ghosted, 2 wanted very niche experience) \- Companies moving to hiring manager round - 5 \- Companies moving to second/third+ round - 5 \- Offer - 1, I cancelled the remaining 4 live opportunities upon accepting offerThe offer came from the place I least expected (Wellfound). An application for a hybrid role in NYC (I'm not in NYC, or close to it) led to the CEO directly reaching out to me. I took his call not thinking much of the opportunity since the description didn't have much to go off of. We both had a ton of fun talking and getting a feel for each other. The rest of the interviewing process with that team felt like talking to friends, it was an easy offer to accept.I could go way more in detail about how I prep for interviews, not sure how helpful that would be for people.

Is it over?,Zealousideal_Code760,cscareerquestions,"Title is TLDRHey everyone, I just completed the final exam for my degree 50 minutes ago, but I’m honestly at a loss. For the past 3 years, I’ve been doing everything people say you’re “supposed” to do to break into tech (not just SWE positions, i'd be happy with anything) and nothing has worked.stuff I’ve tried: • Attended tons of networking events •Joined CS-related extracurriculars in my school • Reached out directly to recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn • Asked my network for referrals • Had my resume reviewed by recruiters + people working in the industry • Rebuilt my resume multiple times for different niches (IT, Cloud, SWE, Data, etc.) • Built different personal projects tailored to those fields • Applied to hundreds of roles consistently (from 2022-2025)Despite all that, I’m graduating with no internship experience, and I keep hearing that this will make my job search even harder than it already is.So I’m wondering: • Has anyone else been in this situation and managed to turn things around? What worked for you? • Are there fields adjacent to CS where companies are willing to hire fresh grads without experience? • are certain tech markets better that i could pivot to? like tech sales, QA, IT support, cybersecurity, bizops, etc.? • Is it worth doing certifications (AWS, Security+, CCNA, etc.) at this stage? • Would contract work, freelancing, or even a non-tech job but in a tech company help me get a foot in the door? (this is probably my most likely path, i work for a city but my current role is part time and unrelated to tech. They have a job portal for internal hiring, hoping I can move into a tech role from there)Any advice, personal experiences, or suggestions would mean a lot.

1pekwov,Am I violently underpaid or am I unrealistic,Organic-Helicopter54,cscareerquestions,"Hey yall, as end of year reviews come out and as my company hits raise and bonus time of year, I am curious if I am really underpaid, or if I am paid fairly and have unrealistic expectations. I work for a non tech, semi small (around 100 employees) company, that has some pretty big clients. **I currently make 39k a year,** I am going on almost 2 years here and I have not received a raise yet. We work mostly in C# and .net, but have been making some pushes into some python development (more on this). personally I work on a wide range of applications, both client facing and internal. I am remote but company is located in Southern U.S. Since we are a smaller dev team, I have alot of responsibilities that I feel like *most* jr. devs don't have, but I could be wrong. Some of the things I do outside of programming are1. Meeting directly with Clients to scaffold out and discuss task, creating them in Jira, developing the solution, presenting and then directly receiving feedback on the solution (along with the PM and sr. dev) 2. Having a heavy involvement in AWS migration, being the one creating proof of concepts for utilizing alot of different AWS micro services (e.g. currently working on lambda function that work with our applications) 3. Creating internal and client facing documentation and sop's for applications, work flows, and pipelinesI had a rocky start during my first 6 months, but improved alot and got an -A in my end of year review, as compared to a -B one my first.But there are some caveats that I think are important1. I am ""Full-time"" w/ benefits but contracted at 32 hours a week. This because I am also a full time student at a university. They work around my class schedule, but I try my best to make my classes compliment the work day. I would be willing to move to 40 hours a week2. I am also part time Military, I know that they can't hold this against me, but during my first 6 months at this company, I spent probably about 4 of Military service, which could have slowed my progression either way. They also let me work reduced hours while I am fulfilling military commitments and pay me as usual (I can't really afford not to)3. I am sometimes a mediocre developer, however, past work experience makes my true strength my soft skills. I am applauded for how I carry myself in meetings and presentations with clients. So, after all that, I am as underpaid as I think I am? I went into software development for financial stability for my family (I do have children), but I am kind of at a loss. I don't really want to start looking for other jobs, because I am unsure if they would work with my school schedule and be as flexible as this place. I also love the team and the work life balance is pretty good. Is thinking I should at least be around 70-80k unrealistic? I have brought up getting a raise before, but there really hasn't been an actual conversation about it. How do I engage in negotiation? What do yall think is acceptable pay? I think that's everything, thanks guys! **TLDR;** Junior Software dev making production level code being paid 39k, often works directly with clients and new technologies, such as AWS during a huge migration. Am I super underpaid? If I am, what should I ask for and how should I broach that subject",35,0.78,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pekwov/am_i_violently_underpaid_or_am_i_unrealistic/,2025-12-05 03:44:24,2025-12-11 01:47:33

1phwxkl,Why are the biggest job-board websites so bad lol,Sorryusernmetaken,cscareerquestions,"I recently started looking for an entry-level job. Compared to job sites in my country, LinkedIn and Indeed are awful: the filters don’t work, I can’t tell how much experience a job requires without scrolling, and half the time they force me to enter previous job titles even if I’ve never worked before. I get emails with vague subject lines, so I have to open each one to understand what they’re about. Indeed often doesn’t show the posting dates of jobs. LinkedIn is bloated with random buttons, Facebook posts I don’t care about, and spam bots constantly message me.When I look at supposedly ""entry-level"" or ""intern"" job descriptions, I often find stuff that’s obviously AI-generated:Seeking a Junior .NET Developer with 5+ years in development and production support, specializing in .NET Core 8/C# and Visual Studio. Mandatory skills include expert troubleshooting, deep proficiency with New Relic (NRQL) and CloudWatch Logs Insights for advanced observability. Experience with Postman is required, while familiarity with AWS services (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, etc.) and networking fundamentals is a strong asset.Often these descriptions contain grammar mistakes. Then, when I go to the company’s website I’m greeted with pure horror: basic HTML/CSS, looking like it was scraped in 2006. I go to the ""Careers"" tab on their website and it throws me 404.

It inevitably always leads to them talking about AI, how it's the future, and half of the time, their genius idea to build a chatbot/ AI wrapper for .My response is always the same. AI in its current state is cool and useful, but has limitations. We shouldn't expect massive improvements (like AGI) in a short time period, and we shouldn't use AI for every use-case. In most cases, it's better to create a deterministic system instead.Almost every time, I get a mixture of the following:1. But all of these people are saying that AI is the future! (Most of ""those people"" being tech CEOs with a vested interest in selling shovels in the gold rush, and the bandwagoners who follow them).2. But AI is improving so rapidly! (Ignoring the exponential costs of improvement and that improvement is not a foregone conclusion).3. But AI can create a website/ pitch deck/ !

I was at a state I lost my drive to get to senior and while my skills did grow, I also didn't see a path to senior from it nor did I want to take the extra effort to go to senior. I made a post about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwef8o/anyone\_lose\_their\_drive\_after\_reaching\_mid\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nwef8o/anyone_lose_their_drive_after_reaching_mid_level/) Recently I changed teams (literally a week after that post) since an interesting initiative came out and they wanted internal transfers since ramp up time would be faster. It's only been 2+ months or so since then but wow I am seeing a path to senior again and even possibly beyond. My skills have grown tremendously especially as I had to learn a lot of new things, there is immense pressure as the higher ups are taking a much closer look at our team's projects initiatives and I'm communicating with directors in some circumstances despite being just a mid level dev. There's a few cons like tighter deadlines and definitely feeling resource constrained headcount wise and doing much more of some things that I didn't like or were uncomfortable for me in my last role but it's been... fun again. I can see much greater impact (that affects multiple orgs and business units) compared to my last role too. Financial impact of my last role was maybe 50M max and direct impact was much less. Current role had that much in just a single project. The role's importance also makes me feel a lot more secure in it and I'm less scared of being laid off which has been great for my mental health especially as I see other companies laying off people.For my resume, I had maybe 2-3 nice bullet points/stories I could get from my last role. I've gotten that in the last month and I'm pretty sure they sound better and are better stories to tell on interviews.This make me think of how much growth I would have had if I had been in a similar team/role 1-2 years earlier and this isn't even considering how much more visibility I have now. I think I can get promoted in 6 months if I really go for it or a year if I take a bit more time to take things chiller just because of being ""forged"" in this fire that I'll develop senior skills without even really trying...

1pe15vu,Severe work anxiety and I think it’s affecting my ability to actually be productive,cs_____question1031,cscareerquestions,"So I worked three excessively shitty jobs in a rowFirst was (Forest in Brazil). I found my manager nearly impossible to communicate with, we just did things so differently. My mentor was excessively aggressive, I legit thought he had some sort of personality disorder. I remember in my first week, I asked maybe 3 questions, common ones like where to find certain resources. Each time my mentor would simply send me a link, and on the third one, he made a remark about how I’m asking too many questions. So, I took the hint and didn’t ask questions unless it was absolutely necessary. Then they started complaining I wasn’t asking _enough_ questions. I was so lost. Then I was assigned a job with another new hire and she faced the same problem, told she asks too much questions then when she stopped. They said that she “just went off and did her own thing”. I kinda felt like I was missing something — isn’t the obvious reaction to “you’re asking too many questions” to… ask fewer questions? Obviously it was more than just this, but it’s an example of how communication was very hostile. I just kept a low profile as much as possible. I ended up quitting, but I definitely think something lingered hereNext job was a weirdly incompetent AI company. Management expected ~30 tickets to be completed per week, and those tickets were usually big ones. For context, they expected something similar to ChatGPT to be built in 2 weeks by 2 engineers with 0 bugs. I was let go from here. I asked why, and they seemed to say I should be available 24/7 and I wasn’t (I explicitly said I can’t be contacted 6-8pm because I help at a Muay Thai gym and you can’t have a computer/phone on you while holding pads obviously)Next job started great. I was cautiously optimistic. Around 6 months in, I started to relax and take a deep breath. Then… they hired a new manager. I could not understand for the life of me what this manager was talking about. I thought I was losing my mind a little, honestly. She would constantly say these bromides like “act more like a senior engineer”. If I asked where I was falling short of being a “senior engineer” or what goals I should have, she said it’s not her job to tell me that, nor is it her job to give me work to do. I’d have to fight for hours to figure out what I should be working on. She was just an odd person. I remember she had an exercise where she _insisted_ that everyone eats peanut butter sandwiches. I don’t and never have. I thought this was some sort of weird test, because she was so insistent that everyone does this. I could tell I was being intentionally sabotaged by her, as she would block PRs with frankly obviously stupid and unproductive commentsNow I’m starting a new job and I feel extremely intense anxiety about… everything. Although I’m a frontend engineer, this job has asked me to get up to date on ruby. I’ve never written ruby before.

1pi9jek,"Feeling Stagnant at Job, Feeling Anxious",HiiiiiiPower,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyone,I’m a software developer with coming up on 4 YoE at an enterprise company.My list of accomplishments at this company is pretty lacklustre:1. I built an internal tool that helps devs on my team.2. I performed some bug fixes, some that were quite tricky and difficult, some that were pretty straightforward.3. I migrated one of our back-end services from the cloud to an on-prem instance.And that’s pretty much it. Fairly basic React work + Spring Boot work and some AWS as well.I guess I feel really bad because the vast majority of this work I accomplished in maybe a year at most and after that I stagnated hard because I was battling stage 3 cancer for some time and dealt with the aftermath of that (poor mental health) for quite some time. Like little to no code reviews, just maintaining what I’ve built, etc.Overall, I feel like I only have maybe 1 YoE even though I’ve been working for 4 years.These past few months, I’ve been doing a lot better mentally and I’ve done a bunch of LeetCode, a Spring Boot course, and a ton of system design since those are areas where I’m quite weak.I’m confident I can improve my skills in the next 2-3 months, but the question always remains “am I cooked?” Like, am I screwed for doing next to nothing for quite some time? Is there any chance of salvaging what I have left of my career? This question really keeps me up at night. Will recruiters and hiring managers be completely turned off by my lacklustre work experience?I realize my career is in my hands and no one else’s, but I’m just so bummed out that I lost so much opportunity due to battling cancer + mental health, and I’m praying that there’s still a chance for me to do SWE now that I’m doing a lot better these months.Am I completely and utterly cooked?

1pihedo,Unable to move to Senior after a bootcamp-level education and 6 years experience - need studying advice,pyromaniac_etal,cscareerquestions,"TLDR: Career changer hitting a knowledge ceiling, need tips for growth.I am a career changer with a BA in Classical Music Performance who completed a bootcamp back in 2020. Since then I have been continuously employed working first for a small company doing mostly front end, then for a large company doing full stack. In the small company (3 people) I had no guidance or mentoring and was entirely self taught. In the large company, everyone has 15-20 years of experience and we are working on maintaining an old code base rather than building new things. It's a very corporate model and pays far below market rate, but it had great benefits and stability. My arm of the big company was just sold to a startup. The great benefits and stability are gone, the work is depressing and pointless, we have lost three direct managers in eight months, team morale is at an all time low, and there is no chance for advancement because anyone who could advocate for us gets fired. I just had a great written performance review, but the meeting was awful. During the review meeting, after all the positive comments, I was told by the higher up standing in for our manager that I was not eligible to be put up for senior because I am not showing the same code base knowledge as colleagues with 15-20 years experience (who were promoted to senior while at my level.) In my opinion and despite the positive comments, I think I am performing poorly. Even if my performance improves, I have no chance of promotion at this new company. In short, I need a new job. Unfortunately, I think my lack of education and experience building vs maintaining software is harming my ability to study for and perform in interviews. The terminology used by my colleagues seems totally foreign even when I should have heard it before, and I can't seem to remember or apply it to our work when trying to discuss it with others. In general, I feel stupidly inarticulate. I think my memory is terrible. I feel like my brain will sometimes short circuit during team meetings and I suddenly cannot find words or even concepts to describe what I was working on just the day before. I don't think it is anxiety related... I just don't remember. I also feel very slow at my work - in between childcare responsibilities, my own brain wandering, hating every second of the tasks, and getting distracted around the house, I probably put in two focused hours in an eight hour day. This makes me worry and beat myself up because obviously I could do so much better if I could focus. This inability to focus, along with some migraine stuff, bleeds into my ability to study. And studying algorithms doesn't seem to help me explain them better or talk about them in an intelligent way. With all of this, I'm not sure how I am going to get a new job at a senior level position.I need some tips to 1) learn how to learn what I ACTUALLY don't know 2) memory tips for vocabulary, tech trends, algorithms, etc. (flashcards? something else?) 3) learn how to talk about what I do know in a way that demonstrates my intelligence 4) a clear study plan that incorporates all of this so I don't have decision fatigue day after day. I have about one hour per day to spend on this 5) some encouragement. I am the sole provider for a neurodivergent kid and a spouse in school, I worked hard to make this career change as a previous professional musician and was good enough to be immediately hired as a TA and then get a job in the middle of the early covid recession. I cannot quit. I like solving problems.

1ped166,Rant,Looploop420,cscareerquestions,"I work at a fairly large software company. I work on a team providing tools and tests that run as a part of CI for many developers in this company. A lot of the tools we write are based on other internal tools from other teams that we have to add automation and scalability, basically making it so developers (our customers) don't have to think about how and where this tool is running and testing their code. Recently we started working with a new team who was supposed to be providing this whole suite if new tools for us to take and ""wrap"". Except their product is absolute shit. They gave us a pip package that makes the most insane assumptions. It assumes that the package is being a run on a machine with a mount to the company wide NFS. This NFS is the most dogshit piece of bullshit to ever exist. It works. It works great. And what that means is that you have thousands of devs just throwing files and scripts in places, and assuming that other scripts exist. And the dependencies chain down, so every thing is tied to everything else. And their pip package needs to be run there. Even worse, one of their scripts that they call from inside their package starts with "" #!/usr/bin/python3.7"" (we are using python 3.13) and assumes that there are certain packages installed in that environment. Now we have been trying to unplug from all this bullshit, but the amount of crappy design and dev culture is just driving me insane. We tried to dockerize and run our stuff cleanly in a cluster, but the amount of leaky dependencies that we are finding is just soul crushing.Thankfully at least my managers are very understanding and basically want to go to war with these nonces for providing such ass backwards tooling.

Throughout my job search, I was lucky enough to land two offers: 1.) Junior C#/.NET developer for a national bank working on internal software for the company. 2.) Junior Android developer working on an in-vehicle infotainment system. The second offer is coming from a company not based in the U.S but who has a small (<50 people) North American branch they are trying to build up.The pay for the .NET role was higher at first but the Android position has offered to match the rate.Both would be on a contract-to-hire of 6 months and 9 months respectively. The .NET role is 4 days in-person and 1 day remote. The Android role is fully in person.My only consideration is which will bring me closer to my ultimate goal of working as low-level developer working with C++ or adjacent languages. Operating Systems, Game Engines, and Computer Graphics being three areas I am super interested in.The android position might have some embedded programming but it would be for debugging purposes only. It's also not guaranteed. For the most part, I can expect to be working in Java and Kotlin.With the .NET role, it is technically fullstack as I will be expected to work (minimally) on the front-end, I'd also be dealing with a lot of SQL. I would appreciate any advice for which of these roles would help bring me closer to my goal.

1pi4exh,Senior DS with old-school NLP background. How do I break into modern LLM work?,thrwy_86543210,cscareerquestions,"I’m looking for candid guidance on how to make a realistic pivot into modern AI and LLM roles. I’m a senior IC data scientist with over 10 years of experience at large, well-known tech companies. I have a PhD in NLP that predates AlexNet and word2vec, and a CS/SWE background, and I have always worked as a generalist with broad experience across the classical ML and data science stack: ETLs, data pipelines, experimentation, statistics, and lightweight models for product teams.After a year out of industry, I'm job hunting again, but my recruiter callback rate is under 5 percent. I seem overqualified for junior roles and underqualified for senior AI roles, and I honestly no longer know where I fit. I’ve seen plenty of DS-to-RE transition advice, but very little that speaks to someone senior like me. I’d be happy in research engineering, applied LLM work, AI-oriented data science, or agentic / safety / alignment roles, but I’m not sure which of these are actually realistic anymore.Most of my experience is in classical ML, not deep learning or modern LLM tooling. I understand Transformers conceptually and followed Karpathy’s GPT-from-scratch tutorial, but I don’t have professional experience with PyTorch, LLM finetuning, or production LLM systems. These gaps come out in interviews. For example, I was asked to use a tokenizer and realized I didn’t even know which ones are standard today. I could explain BPE, but I had to ask the interviewer to name one, and when they said TikToken I had to ask them to spell it because I had never heard of it. Not my best moment. My side projects also feel too toy-like to signal real capability.What I want to figure out is what skills and projects actually matter for breaking into modern AI and LLM roles and how someone with my background can reposition effectively. My concrete questions are:1. What is the most efficient way for someone with my background to build practical and credible skills for modern AI and LLM roles?2. How should I balance interview preparation with building real projects?3. Which roles are realistic targets for me given my experience and gaps?4. Am I fooling myself by thinking I could do the work if I could get past interviews, or is signaling the real barrier here?",8,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pi4exh/senior_ds_with_oldschool_nlp_background_how_do_i/,2025-12-09 10:47:47,2025-12-11 01:47:33

1pih5zb,Took a 1-year work sabbatical and am about to begin applying after the new year. How can I demonstrate that I am still a competitive candidate?,crustymilk15,cscareerquestions,"**Context**I'm a US-based Product Designer with 5 years of experience (4 of which were in the Telehealth industry), with my last 3 years of employment leading multiple high-impact and well-documented projects. Between all the conversations around AI taking over roles, the government impacting the job market, frequent layoffs, and more—I was feeling burnt out. When the medium-sized company I worked for filed for bankruptcy, I used this as an opportunity to redeem my mental health. For the first 3 months I rested, and for the following 9 months I focused on art. I pursued any hobby I was interested in, joined clubs, and even felt my identity change. While I am proud of my decision, and I feel significantly better, I am now grappling with self-esteem issues when I consider my career journey ahead. Before this could snowball into an issue of its own, I immediately started going to therapy. **Preparation**During this year-long break, I worked daily on my portfolio—writing case studies, networking, staying connected with previous colleagues, and developing my site from scratch. I completed and launched my portfolio with 4 in-depth case studies full of metrics and impact. All of my colleagues who were laid off were re-hired, and have offered me referrals. My resume is up-to-date, and I've developed my portfolio in a way that I can easily release personalized variations for each company I apply for. So not only will my resume be catered to each job application, but so will my website. **Action**I applied to one job that I felt I was 100% qualified for, and also recieved a referral from a close colleague. I catered my resume and also my portfolio, but it was a bit rushed—I launched my portfolio that same week and had to fix a lot of errors. I am still proud that I've applied, but I didn't expect the application to go through given that it was my first application. Today I've been informed that the role has been filled. I haven't applied to any other jobs yet because of holiday planning, but intend to apply to 5 - 10 jobs per week (depending on available jobs) after the New Year. Now that I've finished my portfolio, I am starting work on two career-related side projects to demonstrate my skills further. My goal is to apply for remote full-time roles with a compensation range of $130k - $175k, prioritizing roles in the Telehealth industry. **Questions*** When asked about my career gap, what is the most elegant way I can talk about it?* Am I likely to face descrimination for my 1 year career gap? What can I do to navigate it?* How can I best get into contact with recruiters? Are they still open to communication through LinkedIn, or are they swamped with messages?* Does the job market feel better in FY2025 Q4 than it did in FY2024 or FY2023?* Is a 6-month timeline realistic for job hunting? * Are freelance and contract roles as competitive as full time? * What else can I do to be a more competitive design candidate?

1phn4kz,Junior Sysadmin Offer,Fruit_dog04,cscareerquestions,"I graduate in about a week with a bachelor’s in CS. I’ve interned for the past ~1.5 years with the government. I also have an active security clearance, and I’ve landed two interviews so far. I’m located in the Southeast US.I just received an offer for a junior sysadmin role. It starts at $59k and has pretty solid benefits — low insurance cost, generous PTO, retirement contributions, etc. They also pay for certifications and will fully cover further schooling if I decide to pursue a master’s degree.I feel like the starting salary is a bit low considering I have a clearance and relevant work experience.

1pgn0qh,"Should I start a PhD in Math/ML at 29 to move into industry research, or is it a mistake leaving my stable but unsatisfying job?",ThomasHawl,cscareerquestions,"I’m 28 (almost 29) and I’m really stressed about a major career decision.I have a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics (not specifically applied to CS/ML). Right now I’m working (mostly out of necessity) as an embedded software engineer in the defense sector, in a European country where opportunities in “real” ML/DL research are extremely limited. Roles that are actually about experimenting with models, doing research, or contributing to novel ML ideas basically don’t exist here.Moving abroad seems like the only long-term way to pivot, but ML research roles are very competitive, and junior candidates with experience in unrelated fields are usually not considered. So at the moment I’m stuck in a stable career path (that I actively dislike) that could eventually take me to Northern Europe (Germany, Netherlands, etc.), or even US… but it’s absolutely not the work I want to do.My dream since finishing my Master’s two years ago has been to work in ML/DL research, not MLOps, not ML engineering, but actually creating and experimenting with models in an industrial research setting. I’ve applied to positions like this several times but never got traction.To be totally honest, the “dream dream” would be to work in a place like DeepMind, Meta FAIR, or similar labs. I know that’s extremely unrealistic, but they represent the type of work I want to do: pushing boundaries, experimenting, publishing internally, working on genuinely interesting problems. Every time I scroll LinkedIn and find a job that makes me think “wow, that’s exactly the kind of work I want to do”, it always requires a PhD (or a Master’s plus strong industry research experience). My current job can’t give me that experience at all.A PhD would also be an opportunity to build a stronger CV. I’ve basically only studied in my home country, never had any real abroad experience, and I didn’t do internships during my studies. Through the PhD I could finally have international experience and potentially do industry internships abroad, which is something my current career path will never allow.Of course I want to earn more money in the future, who doesn’t. But the main thing for me is that I really value what I do, at least at this stage of my life. And given how low salaries are in my home country, I don’t think doing a PhD would make me “poorer” long-term.My real concern is whether there is a better path that aligns with both:\--“I want to work on something genuinely cool and intellectually challenging” \--“I want to earn above-average in the long term.”Right now, a PhD seems like the best path for someone with my background and goals, but I’m very open to hearing other perspectives.Now a new opportunity appeared: a PhD abroad at a top-20 university (non-US), fully founded (the stipend is not amazing, but I will not starve, I will finish debt-free, and I am ok with making some sacrifices, the financial aspect is not the thing that will make me go/not go), strongly research-oriented, in mathematics/ML. The topic, the PI, and the school all seem very good, and I would try to push my work toward something more practical/ML-applied if possible, but I really enjoy the math.My concern is not “I don’t know if I’ll like the PhD.” I genuinely think I will. My concern is entirely about what happens after.Here are the fears that are keeping me up at night:1) I’m already 28. I’ll finish the PhD at 32/33. I do not want to do a postdoc (at least for now), and I am not interested in academia in the long run. My goal is to get into industry research (research scientist, ML researcher, quant researcher, etc.). But I’m scared companies will ignore someone who is older, with no prior industry ML experience.2) I’m afraid that the PhD will not actually help me get into ML research roles, and I’ll end up “overqualified and under-experienced”. Maybe the PhD will end up being too theoretical and not give me the applied experience, internships of portfolio needed for industry research roles.3) I currently work in a sector and tech stack completely unrelated to ML. I worry that this PhD is my only path out, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll be worse off than now, older, with no experience, and back at square 0.4) As an alternative to the PhD: would it make more sense to switch into something like data analyst / BI, get into a data-adjacent field, and then “climb up” from there toward ML? Is this realistic, or basically impossible? On the other hand, staying where I am means staying in a field I do not like, with technologies extremely far from ML, and with no realistic opportunities to pivot, and with a career path that I do not like.If anyone has seen similar transitions, or has experience hiring PhDs into ML/AI research roles, I would really appreciate your thoughts. I’m stuck between choosing stability in a field I don’t like, or taking a big risk that may not pay off, and I don’t want to make a life-altering mistake at 29.",4,0.63,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pgn0qh/should_i_start_a_phd_in_mathml_at_29_to_move_into/,2025-12-07 16:47:56,2025-12-11 01:47:33

Which path is better long term,Ok-Zookeepergame-401,cscareerquestions,"I’m choosing between two roles and want some perspective from people who have actually worked in these fields.One offer is an SRE position. The other is a Security Engineer role. Both companies seem strong, but the work and long term trajectories look very different.On the SRE side, the work is focused on cloud engineering, observability, automation, CI CD, Kubernetes, and reliability. It feels very hands on and technical. A lot of people say SRE experience opens doors at big tech later because it shows you can handle scale and complex systems.On the Security Engineering side, the work is more about hardening, IAM, vulnerability management, detection logic, cloud security, and defense. It feels more structured and predictable. It also seems like a path that can lead to architect level security roles or broader cloud security positions.For people who have been in either role, I’d really appreciate your insight on a few things:• Which role grows your skills faster• Which path tends to pay more over time• Which one provides better job security• Which is more stressful day to day• Which one is easier to move from into big tech• If you switched between these fields, what made you changeAny honest advice from people who have done SRE or security engineering would help a lot.
