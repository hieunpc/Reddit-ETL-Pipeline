1r73l52,"In 6 years, I've never seen a data lake used properly",wtfzambo,dataengineering,"I started working this job in mid 2019. Back then, data lakes were all the rage and (on paper) sounded better than garlic bread.Being new in the field, I didn't really know what was going on, so I jumped on the bandwagon too.The premises seemed great: throw data someplace that doesn't care about schemas, then use a separate, distributed compute engine like Trino to query it? Sign me up!Fast forward to today, and I hate data lakes.Every single implementation I've seen of data lakes, from small scaleups to billion dollar corporations was GOD AWFUL.Massive amounts of engineering time spent into architecting monstrosities which exclusively skyrocketed infra costs and did absolute jackshit in terms of creating any tangible value except for Jeff Bezos.I don't get it.In none of these settings was there a real, practical explanation for why a data lake was chosen. It was always ""because that's how it's done today"", even though the same goals could have been achieved with any of the modern DWHs at a fraction of the hassle and cost.Choosing a data lake now seems weird to me. There so much more that can be done wrong: partitioning schemes, file sizes, incompatible schemas, etc...Sure a DWH forces you to think beforehand about what you're doing, **but that's exactly what this job is about**, jesus christ. It's never been about exclusively collecting data, yet it seems everyone and their dog only focus on the ""collecting"" part and completely disregard the ""let's do something useful with this"" part.I understand DuckDB creators when they mock the likes of Delta and Iceberg saying ""people will do anything to avoid using a database"".Anyone of you has actually seen a data lake implementation that didn't suck, or have we spent the last decade just reinventing RDBMS, but worse?",424,0.97,223,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r73l52/in_6_years_ive_never_seen_a_data_lake_used/,2026-02-17 11:31:23,2026-02-20 02:11:09

For context, mid sized company, around 50 saas data sources, snowflake as primary destination though we're also testing databricks for some ml workflows and have legacy stuff in redshift we're migrating away from.Fivetran connectors are solid and reliable but the cost at scale gets uncomfortable fast, especially once you're pulling significant volume. Airbyte was interesting because of the open source angle and we liked having control, but self hosting added a whole new category of things to maintain which defeated part of the purpose for a small team. Matillion felt more oriented toward transformation than data ingestion which wasn't quite our primary use case.Precog had more reasonable pricing and less operational overhead, though their documentation could use work and the UI takes some getting used to if you're coming from fivetran's polish.

I have about \~2.5YOE including internships and a year at my current job. I've been working on an ETL project at work that involves moving data from one platform via an API to a SQL database using Python. I work on this project with a senior dev with 10+YOE.A lot of my work on this project feels like I'm reinventing the wheel. My senior dev strives for minimizing dependencies to not be tied to any package which makes sense to some extent, but we are only really using a standard API library and pyodbc. I don't really deal with any business logic and have been basically recreating an ORM from the ground up. And at times I feel like I'm writing C code, like checking for return codes and validating errors at the start of every single method and not utilizing exceptions. I don't mean to knock this senior dev in any way, he has a ton of experience and I have learned a lot about writing clean code, but there are some things that throw me off from what I read online about Python best practices. From what I read, it seems like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, and Prefect are popular frameworks for creating ETL solutions in Python. From experienced Python developers: is this approach — sticking to vanilla Python, minimizing dependencies, and using very defensive coding patterns — considered reasonable for ETL work?

I'm about 5 months into my job and I feel horrible and terrified; I really like the people that I work with and the energy that they give off but I think that I need to find a new job because I don't think this work is for me because I find it repetitive, frustrating, and anxiety inducing.I really tried understanding the work that I do by working all throughout December and New Years just to get a footing on some of the applications we are supporting but I get so frustrated because learning and understanding the technologies of the application and how we investigate them is so limited that I am forced to ask and or set a meeting with a senior instead of finding it on my own using some guide or written documentation. I also find it frustrating that sometimes when I ask a question to different people (whom have been with the team for more than a year) only for them to give off different answers.Our documentation is so scattered its stored on individual or group OneNote, confluence, excel, azure dev ops, some obscure SharePoint, and sometimes pdfs that were just being shared or sometimes not even shared (for reasons beyond my understanding). On the bright side, they are pushing towards a more unified and reliable way of storing documentation. I get anxious answering to users / operations manager because honestly, I'm scared that what I'm saying is absolutely wrong or something I assumed, so every time I have to ask someone to verify what I'm saying.I also feel misled with my title of being a data engineer and doing specifically only investigation and escalation to other teams and it feels more like a support rather than a DE (and this is for the whole team, there will be no touching of pipelines / code or actual data).On some positive note, I got my AZ-900 and AI-102 (planning for more) and I constantly try to better myself by taking advantage of the free learning sites of the company and now starting some side projects.

I mean, I've had some experience, like intermediate Python, SQL, building manual ETL pipelines, Docker containers, ML, and Streamlit UI. It's been great, but I wanted to up my game, so now I'm following a really enjoyable data engineering Zoom camp. I love it. But what I'm noticing is these tools, great as they may be, they're all higher level abstractions of like what would be core, straight up, no-frills, writing raw syntax to perform multiple different tasks, and when combined together become your powerful ETL or ELT pipelines. My question is this, these tools are great. They save so much time, and they have these really nice built-in ""SWE-like"" features, like DBT has nice built-in tests and lineage enforcement, etc., and I love it. But what happens if I'm a brand new practitioner, and I'm learning these tools, and I'm using them religiously, and things start to fail or or require debugging? Since I only knew the higher-level abstraction, does that become a risk for me because I never truly learned the core syntax that these higher-level abstractions are solving? And on that same matter, can the same be said about agentic AI and MCP servers? These are just higher-level abstractions of what was already a higher-level abstraction in some of these other tools like DBT or Kestra or DLT, etc. So what does that mean as these levels of higher abstraction become magnified and many people entering the workforce, if there is going to be a future workforce, don't ever truly learn the core principles or core syntax? What does that mean for us all if we're relying on higher abstractions and relying on agents to abstract those higher abstractions even further? What does that mean for our skill set in the long-term? Will we lose our skill set? Will we even be able to debug? What do all these AI labs think about that? Or is that what they're banking on? That everybody must rely on them 100%?",14,0.67,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r7iybs/higher_level_abstractions_are_a_trap/,2026-02-17 21:13:07,2026-02-20 02:11:09

The files being “open” enables the power of the collective to be added to the project.I have never organised or initiated anything like this. I have a project management, product management and analytics background but no open source. I know graphanalytics was used across the massive Panama papers dataset, but never used that technology myself.I’d be happy to contribute in whatever way possible.If you think it could help and I any way and have any resources (time, money, knowledge) and want to contribute - ship in!

1r3jdmc,I'm not entirely sure how to incorporate AI in my workflow better,thro0away12,dataengineering,"Hi all,I am seeing A LOT of discussion on AI and I feel nervous b/c I haven't quite integrated AI too much in my workflow yet. To be quite frank, I don't know how just yet - I am supposed to be wrapping up a task and moving onto a brand new project. My current task that I've worked on for some time now has been really all over the place - basically, I'm an analytics engineer and I create the datasets that go into dashboards for stakeholders. I work in a slightly niche scientific domain where the parameters of what I need weren't well described and the only way I know I'm looking at the right thing is eyeballing and seeing which parameter is the one that makes the most sense per the stakeholders ask. The issue I am currently dealing with is our data warehouse went through an upgrade and not all the data I need is there - so I have to sometimes use data from the raw data files. And in those files, I have to go through 2 or 3 and find the parameter by eyeballing b/c I don't know the exact name of the field, but can tell what is the right one by looking at it. Also, how we actually want to use and transform those parameters is constantly changing per stakeholders request. There's just a lot of vagueness in this process that is difficult to be clear with a prompt. Writing code isn't really the hard part for me (with this work in particular) and so far, I use genAI (my work gives access to GPT-5) to help me debug if something is wrong or give me a better solution to what I'm doing, which it gives me a good answer I'd say 6/10 times. I'm seeing people discuss Claude to an extent they are no longer doing anything technical at all really, just prompting. Is this really is for people's work these days? I feel behind because I use AI very sparingly and haven't touched Claude yet. I'm planning to try it out but idk what is hype or real anymore, on LinkedIn people are teaching vibe coding courses and it's like being made to feel anybody can be an engineer now, no technical skills needed. Or the narrative if you're not using AI, you are going to become irrelevant.

1r441rl,Metaxy: sample-level versioning for multimodal data pipelines,danielgafni,dataengineering,"My name is Daniel, and I'm an ML Ops engineer at [Anam](https://anam.ai).At [Anam](https://anam.ai), we are making a platform for building real-time interactive avatars. One of the key components powering our product is our own video generation model.We train it on custom training datasets that require all sorts of pre-processing of video and audio data. We extract embeddings with ML models, use external APIs for annotation and data synthesis, and so on. We encountered significant challenges with implementing efficient and versatile sample-level versioning (or caching) for these pipelines, which led us to develop and open-source [Metaxy](https://metaxy.io): the framework that solves metadata management and **sample-level versioning** for multimodal data pipelines.[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) sits in between high level orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io)) that usually operate at table level and low-level processing engines (such as [Ray](https://ray.io)), passing the exact set of samples that have to be (re) computed to the processing layer and *not a sample more*.## BackgroundWhen a traditional (tabular) data pipeline gets re-executed, it typically doesn't cost much. Multimodal pipelines are a whole different beast. They require a few orders of magnitude more compute, data movement and AI tokens spent. Accidentally re-executed your Whisper voice transcription step on the whole dataset? Congratulations: $10k just wasted!That's why with multimodal pipelines, implementing incremental approaches is a requirement rather than an option. And it turns out, it's damn complicated.## Introducing Metaxy[Metaxy](https://metaxy.io) is the missing piece connecting traditional orchestrators (such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) or [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)) that usually operate at a high level (e.g., updating tables) with the sample-level world of multimodal pipelines.Metaxy has two features that make it unique:1. It is able to track partial data updates.2. It is agnostic to infrastructure and can be plugged into any data pipeline written in Python.Metaxy's versioning engine:- operates in batches, easily scaling to millions of rows at a time.- runs in a powerful remote database or locally with Polars or DuckDB.- is agnostic to dataframe engines or DBs.- is aware of *data fields*: Metaxy tracks a dictionary of versions for each sample.We have been dogfooding Metaxy at Anam since December 2025. We are running millions of samples through Metaxy. All the current Metaxy functionality has been built for our data pipeline and is used there.### AI DisclaimerMetaxy has been developed with the help of AI tooling (mostly Claude Code). However, it should not be considered a vibe-coded project: the core design ideas are human, AI code has been ruthlessly reviewed, we run a very comprehensive test suite with 85% coverage, all the docs have been hand-written (seriously, I hate AI docs), and /u/danielgafni has been working with multimodal pipelines for three years before making Metaxy. A great deal of effort and passion went into Metaxy, especially into user-facing parts and the docs.## More on MetaxyRead our [blog post](https://anam.ai/blog/metaxy), [Dagster + Metaxy blog post](https://dagster.io/blog/building-real-time-interactive-avatars-with-metaxy), Metaxy [docs](https://docs.metaxy.io/), and `uv pip install metaxy`!We are thrilled to help more users solve their metadata management problems with Metaxy.

At the beginning of my program I also started a Data Engineering Apprenticeship, it went on for almost the whole school year. I completed my first year with great grades. That summer I started a summer internship as a “Systems Engineer“. The role was in the database team and was more of a “Database Admin“ role. This is where the story takes a dumb turn. I’ll never forgive myself for having everything and letting depression ruin me instead.At the beginning of my internship I had 3 family deaths and I spiraled. I stopped trying at work, was barely doing things just to get by. I remember even missing a trip to a data center that my team was going on. I isolated myself. I even got a full time offer in the end and I never responded to the email. I wasn’t talking to anyone. 2nd year started and I started to attend but stopped eventuall. I should have dropped out but I couldn’t even bring myself to type up an email. I just failed and didn’t re-enroll. I moved in with my brother bc I wasn’t taking care of myself. I essentially took a year off, which consist of me getting help. After about a year of the fog dissipating, I finally felt ready to try again.

CDC * CDC is looking for table level change or basically whether new data arrives or not to run EtL pipeline. * It is not a code but just a watchman kinda thing. * Time is necessary as ETL pipeline runs when new/update data is loaded in the source. 2. SCD: * SCD is for specific column in a table. * it is not dependent on time. * it is part of ETL code(python/sql/spark) Let me know if I am correct or not,5,0.61,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r7r8tw/cdc_vs_scds/,2026-02-18 02:52:54,2026-02-20 02:11:09

1r5t38r,Doubt regarding the viability of large tabular model and tabular diffusion model on real business data,EvoiFX,dataengineering,"I’ve been digging into the recent news about Fundamental AI coming out of stealth with their Nexus model (a ""Large Tabular Model"" or LTM), and I have some doubts, I wanted to run by this sub.context: we have LLMs for text, but tabular data has always by tree-based models (XGBoost/LightGBM). Nexus claims to be the ""first foundation model for tabular data,"" trained on ""billions of public tables"" to act as an ""operating system for business decisions"" (e.g forecasting, fraud detection, churn).I have doubt regarding the data standardisation, unlike text, which has a general structure, business data schemas are the messy. ""Revenue"" in Company A might b ""Total\_Sales\_Q3"" in Company B. Basically relationships are implicit and messy.If businesses don't follow open standards for storing data (which they don't), how can a pre-trained model like Nexus actually work ""zero-shot"" without a massive, manual ETL work?I've been trying to map where Nexus sits compared to what we already use:1. Nexus vs. Claude in Excel: Claude in Excel (Anthropic) is basically a super-analyst. It’s a productivity tool. Nexus claims to be a predictive engine. It integrates into the data stack (AWS) to find non-linear patterns across rows/columns automatically. It’s trying to replace the manual modeling pipeline.2. Nexus vs. Deep Learning Architectures (TabNet / iLTM): TabNet (Google) is an architecture you train ""yourself"" on your specific data. It uses sequential attention for interpretability (feature selection). iLTM (Integrated Large Tabular Model - Stanford/Berkeley) seems to be the academic answer to this. It uses a hypernetwork pre-trained on 1,800+ datasets to generate weights for a specific task. It tries to bridge the gap between GBDTs and Neural Nets. LaTable: This is for generating synthetic data (diffusion).Questions for the community:1. Has anyone actually tested a ""Foundation Model"" for tabular data (like Nexus or the open-source iLTM) on messy, real-world dirty data?2. Can an LTM really learn the ""schema"" of a random SQL dump well enough to predict fraud without manual feature engineering?3. Is this actually a replacement for ETL/Feature Engineering, or just another black box that will fail when Column\_X changes format?",5,0.78,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r5t38r/doubt_regarding_the_viability_of_large_tabular/,2026-02-15 23:09:39,2026-02-20 02:11:09

We design complex ETL pipelines from source to target, often with multiple legacy systems flowing into one new purchased system. This is project work and we use a sort of middleware (no-code - other than SQL) to design the workflow transformations. This is E2E source to target system ETL.They call us data engineers but I feel like we are missing some important concepts like modeling, modern stack and all that. I’m personally learning AWS and Python on the side. One thing that seems to be interesting is that when designing these ETL pipelines is that I still have to think like I’m coding it even though it’s on a GUI. Like when I’m practicing Python for transformation I find it easier to apply the logic. I’m not sure if that makes sense but it feels like knowing how to speak English understanding the concept and then using Python is like learning how to write it.Am I a data engineer??

1r8zamw,Snowflake micro partitions and hash keys,rotr0102,dataengineering,"Dbt / snowflake / 500M row fact / all PK/Fk are hash keysWhen I write my target fact table I want to ensure the micro partitions are created optimally for fast queries - this includes both my incremental ETL loading and my joins with dimensions. I understand how, if I was using integers or natural keys, I can use order by on write and cluster\_by to control how data is organized in micro partitions to achieve maximum query pruning. What I can’t understand is how this works when I switch to using hash keys - which are ultimately very random non-sequential strings. If I try to group my micro partitions by hash key value it will force the partitions to keep getting recreated as I “insert” new hash key values, rather then something like a “date/customer” natural key which would likely just add new micro partitions rather than updating existing partitions. If I add date/customer to the fact as natural keys, don’t expose them to the users, and use them for no other purpose then incremental loading and micro partition organizing— does this actually help? I mean, isn’t snowflake going to ultimately use this hash keys which are unordered in my scenario?What’s the design pattern here? What am I missing?

1r7o1vq,ADLS vs. SQL Bronze DB: Best Landing for dbt Dev/Prod?,FasTiBoY,dataengineering,"I am evaluating the ingestion strategy for a SQL Server DWH (using dbt with the sqladapter, currently we only using stored procedures and wanna set up a dev/prod environment for more robust reportings) with a volume of approximately 100GB. Our sources include various Marketing APIs, MySQL, and SQL Server On Prem Source Systems. Currently, we use Metadata Driven Ingestion via Azure Data Factory (ADF) to load data directly into a dedicated SQL Server Bronze DB.Option A: Dedicated Bronze Database (SQL Server)The Setup: Ingestion goes straight into SQL tables. Dev and Prod DWH reside on different servers. The Dev environment accesses the Prod Bronze DB via Linked Servers.Workflow: Engineers have write access to Bronze for manual CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements. Silver/Gold are read-only and managed via CI/CD.Option B: ADLS Gen2 Data Lake (Parquet)The Setup: Redirect the ADF metadata pipelines to write data as Parquet files to ADLS before loading into the DWH. Tho, this feels like significant engineering overhead for little benefit. I would need to manage/orchestrate two independent metadata pipelines to feed Dev and Prod Lake containers. But I will still need to somehow create a staging layer or db for both dev and prod so dbt can pick up from there as it cant natively connect to adls storage and ingest the data. So i need to use ADF again to go from the Data in the Lake to both environments seperately. At 100GB, is the Data Lake approach over-engineered? If a source schema breaks the Prod load, it has to be fixed regardless of the storage layer. I just dont see the point of the Data Lake anymore. In case we wanna migrate in the future to Snowflake or smth a data lake would already been setup. Even tho even in that case I would simply create the Data Lake „quickly“ using ADFs copy activity and dump everything from the PROD Bronze DB into that Lake as a starting point.

We have two seperate environemnts dev and prod for our Data Warehouse to test changes before prod deployment end-to-end.We are using DBT for transformation and I would like to either use smth like the ""dbt-external-tables"" package to query the ADLS storage (using Polybase under the hood I assume?). Define the Tables, columns and data types in the sources.yml and further stage those. I wouldnt need any schema migration tool like Flyway/SSDT I assume? I could just define new colums /tables in dev and promote successfull branches from dev to prod? Does anyone have experience in this? Also would incremental inserts be possible with this if the Data Lake is structured as bronze/table/year/month/day/file.parquetOR using ADF to copy the data to both prod and dev environment metadata driven. So the tables and columns for each environment need to be in some sort of control tables. My idea here was to specify tables and columns in dev in dbt's sources.yml. And when promoting to prod a CI/CD step would update the prod control tables with the new columns coming from the merged dev branch, So ADF knows which tables/columns to import in both environments. For schema migrations from dev to prod I would consider either SSDT or Flyway. I see a better future using Flyway as I could rename columns in Flyway without dropping them compared to SSDT. In SSDT from what I read I would just specify the final DDL for each table and rest is taken care of through the diff in the BACPAC file.",1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r7igjt/how_to_stage_data_from_adls_to_azure_sql_database/,2026-02-17 20:55:07,2026-02-20 02:11:09

1r5nhd9,How to stage tables and deal with schema migrations in prod and dev environment from Data Lake to SQL Server ?,Prudent-Newt-7603,dataengineering,"We’re currently running our data warehouse on SQL Server on an Azure VM and only have a single production environment. We want to move to a proper DEV/STAGING and PROD setup so we can test changes safely before promoting them to production.At the same time, we’re also introducing Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) as a central landing zone for raw data. Instead of ingesting directly into SQL Server like we do today, data will first land in ADLS in partitioned Parquet format (for example `/bronze///year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/`). From there, it would be loaded into SQL Server. This should give us better control, allow replay/backfills if needed, and make it easier to keep DEV and PROD consistent.Historically, most of our transformations were implemented using stored procedures directly in SQL Server. As things have grown more complex, this has become difficult to maintain and version properly, so we want to move transformation logic into dbt to get proper version control, modularity, and lineage.The main challenge we’re facing is around ingestion and schema management. dbt assumes that the source tables already exist in the warehouse, but in our case those bronze tables need to be created and updated first, including handling schema changes like new tables or columns.Since PROD will be locked down (engineers shouldn’t be able to write to it directly), we need a controlled way to manage and promote schema changes from DEV/STAGING to PROD. We also need a reliable way to ingest data from ADLS into both environments, either incrementally or as full reloads, without maintaining everything manually.Right now, we see two main options:**Option 1:** Use a migration tool like Flyway? to manage bronze table schemas via version-controlled migrations. ADF would then load data from ADLS into those bronze tables in both DEV and PROD, ideally using a metadata-driven approach.**Option 2:** Use external tables (there is apparently a dbt-external-source tables package that could handle that directly within the dbt repository) over ADLS and let dbt read directly from the data lake and materialize bronze or staging tables itself using incremental models. This would reduce the amount of ingestion logic in ADF, but we’re not sure how well this works with SQL Server on an Azure VM, especially around incremental loads, schema changes, and operational stability. Also given that the data is organized as `/bronze///year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/` would that even work as a pointer?

Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and IDEs. Common examples include manually renaming a symbol across many source code files, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (https://xkcd.com/1597/).At least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier both during school and after graduation (most jobs do not formally teach these topics either).To help mitigate this, the three of us developed a class, originally called Hacker Tools in 2019 and then renamed to Missing Semester in 2020 (some great past discussion here: https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/eyagda/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_mit/). Over the past several years, we’ve seen the course translated into over a dozen languages, inspire similar courses at other universities, and be adopted by several companies as part of their standard onboarding materials.Based on feedback and discussions here and elsewhere, along with our updated perspective from working in industry for several years, we have developed a new iteration of the course. The 2026 edition covers several new topics such as packaging/shipping code, code quality, agentic coding, and soft skills. Some things never change, though; we’re still using this hacky Python DSL for editing our multi-camera-angle lecture videos: https://github.com/missing-semester/videos.As always, we’d love to hear any feedback from the community to help us improve the course content!—Anish, Jon, and Jose",154,0.98,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r93yk6/the_missing_semester_of_your_cs_education_2026/,2026-02-19 16:35:25,2026-02-20 02:11:10

1r53h5t,"For Self-Learners that are stuck in ""tutorial hell"". If you're wondering why you're always told ""just build stuff"", here's actually why...",DuztyLipz,learnprogramming,"Alright, let me preface this by saying that I'm not a software engineer by profession, but I have been coding for \~6-7 years. I came to an epiphany/connected the dots. This post may not fit everybody, but hopefully, this can get *someone* out of a rut. Apologies for non-technical refinement/terms in advance.So, when I used to watch fundamentals tutorials or lurk Reddit, people would always say something to the effect of ""just build stuff""... I always wondered why that was or why they would say that without the reason why. I had a tough time grasping object-oriented programming (non-sequitur: we gotta stop using the Animal -> Dog -> Labrador example for OOP... I think it confuses people), but I kept building with OOP--and with the help of others' code in The Odin Project and seeing how it was **actually applied**\--I had the ""aha"" moment needed to understand OOPs purpose. Here's the kicker though: **there are actually terms for this and why building is so crucial**. Now, it's an adjacent field, but these terms also apply to how programmers think... The terms are: [mathematical maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity), ***mathematical insight***, and [mathematical intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_intuition). It's crucial to tell you--or whom it may concern--exactly what they are.***Mathematical Maturity*** is basically someone's experience with math, *especially mathematical understanding that is not directly taught*. Mathematicians seriously have to grind math problems because being instructed by teachers only goes so far. You gain more maturity via repeated exposure. Grinding enough problems over and over again makes you reach ***mathematical insight***.***Mathematical Insight*** is where you have that ""Aha!"" moment, that ""oooooh, that's what that does"". This happens when you ""build stuff"" or solve problems. This happened with me stuck in ""OOP hell""... After finally applying it in an appropriate way (instead of Animal -> Dog -> Labrador) and applied it to different things, I gained a deeper understanding of it that I could **never** get from a tutorial. Mathematical insight can't be directly taught. You grind problems/build stuff to get that ""Aha!"" moment.***Mathematical Intuition*** is where you've grinded the concept so much, it's apart of your repertoire. You don't even need to think of ""how"" it works because you upped your mathematical maturity and insight through applying what you've learned, *instead of watching tutorials;* therein deepening your understanding. This also helps with you understanding the range of projects you can do. It's just a matter of ""how to logically structure \[insert program\]"".That's basically it. ""Building stuff"" actually makes these programming concepts stick in your mind. The reason I posted this is two-fold: 1.) It would, hopefully, get someone out of a rut and 2.) Give those who say ""build stuff"" a few terms that can exactly describe how crucial it is... For anyone in the industry/do this professionally... What are your thoughts on this?

I like systems logic, but complex calculus or advanced statistics kind of turns me down a bit (I could still learn and refresh my memory, if necessary)1) Is Python backend development ""math-heavy"" in the real world, or is that only for AI/Data Science? Would Java be a safer ""low-math"" haven for me? 2) Is it worth pivoting to Java now to avoid the high saturation of Python juniors, even if Java feels ""stricter"" and a bit more difficult to get into?3) Should I stick to the Boot.dev course, learn OOP and DSA in that course, and then switch?

1r4iu1u,Why use Message Brokers?,normantas,learnprogramming,"Preface. I have 4YOE as backend engineer. I use Azure with some tiny experience with React + TypeScript when I worked in teams that had some React components or a webpage. I have used RabbitMQ and Mass Transit with PostgreSQL.I still can't wrap my head around why use Message Brokers (MB). Sometimes I find their use. You have an API and a pods for long jobs. The ones that take at least few seconds. So let's say API takes in a massive file and does a request for a long calculation operation which queues a task to the Pods.Where my issue falls is when the operation is short so giving it to a message broker does not seem to make sense. It feels a lot of times it is not worth to create the logic for message brokers.I was reading about making a URL shortener. One person said if you want metrics you will want to use a MB to log statistics and usage. Why not just push the request locally on same instance of a service just different process/thread. I do not thing logging statistics take that much resources? Would it not slow down giving the request and add costs for running 2 services instead of one? A lot of programs nowadays run on 1 thread and just use the async/await pattern as creating a new process is costly.The primary values I find in message brokers:1. Separation of intents and simplifying services. So basically microservices. Though a lot of people are moving to ""modular monolith"" structure where you create a new service when it is needed.2. Orchestrating long running tasks.3. If you have few seperate services on same machine, some MB can read the RAM data and reuse it which lowers the memory usageand speeds up the process by not sending the data but just re-reading the same data from RAM.4. There is probably a case of improved Horizontal scaling.Both can be done with an API (without the use case of RAM), though API adds some bloat but so do message brokers and not sure if managing something more complex is worth the investment. I guess also small benefit of some MB is sequentiality of tasks or in case the process fails, it stores the tasks. Though not all MB do that.It just creates me lot of confusion (as my writing is probably all over the places so the confusion is shown). To me it has tradeoffs though I see a lot of people putting MB where they can instead of evaluating if it is worth it.Can someone give me good project ideas, examples to master the value of MB? Message broker usage is so far and wide and sometimes I do not understand why not just have an API that is closed to external traffic?I'll give an example of a project I think could use MB: A web Crawler. There is a crawler that collects web pages. Fills the queue with URLs and the Workers consume the URLs and extract data. That is how I would do a basic crawlers for data collection. Data collection like metadata, Urls can take multiple DB queries and such so it can take up to 100ms on a massive page. Though I have to take into account if the Web Crawler can't do the same. If the added time for sending the request take a while. Why use workers? I just add more time to work by sending the request and waiting for it to be consumed.",10,0.82,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r4iu1u/why_use_message_brokers/,2026-02-14 11:56:28,2026-02-20 02:11:10

It’s basically an automated form where you enter your name, the station, select a specific part from a dropdown, and add a short description of the issue (after it’s fixed) so the next shift has proper documentation and certain parts can be monitored.I work with Excel on a surface level and thought this would be something like:“Delete a few unnecessary dropdowns, add some new ones, rename a few labels — done.”Since nobody else was interested, I said I’d give it a try. I made it clear that this would be somewhat experimental on my end. My boss was totally fine with that and said I could take as much time as I need.

For example, one station is officially called “03st02,” but colleagues enter things like “3st2” or “3-2”… you get the idea.Anyway — I received the file and the password for the VBA project.And wow. I completely underestimated it.The file basically contains a full program running in the background, constantly cross-checking every input. I can’t just remove, add, or rename anything without breaking everything else. And honestly, for our department’s needs, it feels way overengineered.

1r8gq4v,I am trying to make LOOP language,samaxidervish,learnprogramming,"Hello everyone,I’ve been thinking for quite a while about designing a loop-centric programming language, and during my research I came across the theoretical LOOP language associated with Dennis Ritchie, who has always been one of my biggest inspirations.The project I’m working on is called Gamma Loop. It’s a transpiled language, with the transpiler written entirely in C. The idea behind this choice is to keep the toolchain lightweight, portable, and fast, while still leveraging mature C compilers for optimisation and broad platform support. The goal is not to compete with mainstream languages, but to explore a minimal, loop-driven design that could be useful for specific niche or experimental applications.Conceptually, I’m focusing on making iteration the central abstraction of the language. Rather than treating loops as just another control structure, the idea is to build the language around them as the primary computational mechanism. The syntax is intentionally minimal and structured, and I’m aiming for clarity over feature density.At this stage, I’m mainly interested in feedback from a theoretical and language-design perspective:1.Does a loop-centric paradigm offer meaningful conceptual advantages?2.Would such a design be interesting from a computability or formal methods standpoint?I’d really appreciate any thoughts, criticism, or references.",4,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1r8gq4v/i_am_trying_to_make_loop_language/,2026-02-18 21:59:16,2026-02-20 02:11:10

1r5mdnl,How are US developers expected to compete with Offshoring ?,sharjeelsidd,cscareerquestions,"I'm genuinely curious. Years ago, whenever a company announced it was offshoring engineering work, people would roll their eyes and say, ""Oh, when will they learn?"" Guess what. They've learned and come back with better execution. The assumption has been it would backfire, Time zone gaps, miscommunication, quality issues, and lack of ownership would eventually make companies regret the move. Back then, that argument had weight. High-level technical work depends on speed, tight feedback loops, and shared context. It wasn't easy to coordinate complex engineering across continents. But over the last two decades, US companies have consistently invested in talent pipelines in places like India, the Philippines, and Brazil. What started as cost-cutting experiments turned into long-term infrastructure. The quality gap has narrowed. With Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitHub, and real-time dashboards, accountability is no longer the barrier it once was. Work is visible and there are tons of tools in place for checks and balances before code gets deployed. Add AI to that stack, code review tools, copilots, automated testing, and suddenly the difference in execution shrinks even more. Offshore teams are no longer turning out to be unreliable. They're writing code with AI and increasing velocity. Product strategy and client-facing roles are still staying in the US, but a large portion of engineering execution, the high-paying core, is increasingly moving out. If a company can get comparable output at a fraction of the cost, the incentive is obvious.

1r8fdnu,Time AI started replacing CEOs eager to replace coders,Tr33__Fiddy,cscareerquestions,"I don't really care much for the constant comments from witless CEOs who can't wait to replace coders with AI. The funniest part is that the system supposed to replace those awful coders is built by the coders themselves.Perhaps it’s time us coders focused on replacing someone else's job instead of their own. I like the idea of replacing CEOs and managers by creating a solution that uses AI and an internal integration layer to make the best possible decisions. By combining all available company data, market data, and projections, it would make CEOs and managers mostly irrelevant (except, maybe, for some PR). This would ensure only founders or the board are needed, while the best executive decisions are made via an AI management layer.I think this is an inevitable part of management anyway, but I must admit I do like the idea of disrupting the people who can't wait to replace the people whose work they know nothing about.Anyway, I have over 15 years of development experience across multiple fields.

I’ve learned a lot and have had a lot of ownership. We are trying to do everything according to best practices, if we can.The downside is that I’m significantly underpaid for the scope of work, and the company has become increasingly chaotic. A few months ago I realized I should probably move on.Recruiter outreach has been decent (a few LinkedIn messages per week), and I’ve started applying and studying to fill in gaps. Still, I’ve been feeling oddly demotivated and worried that starting at a messy startup might hurt my long-term prospects.Still, I feel pretty demotivated and I’m not sure why. I’m hoping that my experience and time are on my side, and that sooner or later I’ll end up at a better company. I know, some people can't even get experience, so I'm glad for that at least.

I'm trying to change that, but no matter what I do, I just lack in comparison to other people online and IRL. Most of the people I live have tech jobs still – hell, I see a few still wearing their badges from my old company.

I also feel even more envious than usual of people that were able to get into really prestigious companies that I've gotten rejected from multiple times (namely Google and Apple). Every time I meet someone new, there's that inevitable circle of everyone saying what they do for a living. It honestly feels like I'm lying if I were to say I'm still a software engineer, so I usually end up caving and saying that I got laid off and am searching.

The existing team has 3 more people...all non-tech. I was initially going to only work on the AI parts but that soon turned to handling all of BE. The product would be a web-app; there will be an AI agent and quite a few dynamic dashboards with user data. The AI Agent will provide insights and suggestions from the data among other things.The issue is, they just revealed their plan for the frontend: WordPress + Elementor. They think because they are building the ""site"" in WordPress, they are handling the frontend.The product requires:* Complex Data Ingestion: Parsing fragile PDFs and CSVs from automated emails* OAuth Integration: Securely connecting to Gmail/Outlook APIs.* AI EngineWordPress can't handle a dynamic SaaS dashboard. I’m effectively having to build a ""Custom Backend"" that does 95% of the heavy lifting, including the API bridges to make their WordPress site even function.**Their proposed workload for me is insane... I am the Backend Dev, Data Engineer, and AI Engineer. Their ""contribution"" is marketing and a drag-and-drop website.**I’m getting 20% equity to build 100% of the intellectual property...equity is the only form of payment.I have talked with them about the importance of a solid FE for the product...They are pushing everything to the ""custom backend"" because they don't know how to code. Am I overreacting, or is 20% equity for a solo dev building a complex AI data pipeline and a custom backend way too low? Especially when the ""frontend assistance"" is just a marketing site?TL;DR: Only dev on the team. Founders doing marketing/WordPress. I'm building a custom AI engine + data parsers for 20% equity.

What am I doing wrong?",Beginning_Paint_6350,cscareerquestions,"Hey everyoneI’m writing this because I genuinely don’t know what else to try.I graduated in July 2023 with a Computer Science degree as an international student. After graduation, I stayed in that country for 9 months. During that time, I was doing bike food delivery to survive while applying to jobs full time, networking on LinkedIn, and reaching out to engineers and recruiters at companies I wanted to work for.I made it to final interview stages multiple times. But got- Ghosted after technical assessments.- Ghosted after final rounds.- Rejected with generic emails.Fresh out of university, I only had one unpaid frontend internship. I realized that probably wasn’t enough. So I doubled down.I started learning backend, then discovered DevOps and cloud. I genuinely loved it. I invested money I barely had into certifications and learning materials. I passed:-AWS Cloud Practitioner-AWS Solutions Architect Associate-CKA-KCNAI know it's not impressive.I built projects. Documented them. Kept applying.At one point, I got into a graduate program at a big company. Passed the assessment. Completed the internship. Submitted extra documentation no other applicant was asked for. Then they told me they couldn’t offer full time because the law changed and they wanted permanent residents.Shortly after that, my visa expired and I had to go back to my home country.I struggle with Major Depressive Disorder all my life, so my energy and consistency aren’t always perfect. But I kept pushing anyway.Recently, I made it to another final on site round. At the end, I asked the tech lead what I could improve. He said technically he had no comment and that I clearly knew what I was talking about. He just suggested I follow CNCF on YouTube to stay updated.Two weeks later, generic rejection. No feedback. I even asked politely. Nothing.I tried freelancing on Upwork. But I burned through 100 connects. with no responses.Now I’m working remotely as a real estate agent from my home country. I never imagined working in sales. I still want to work in tech. I still want to work in cloud or DevOps.

1r6n544,Should I stick to backend only? Is Full Stack still bad looking?,Affectionate-Laugh98,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR: Am I overthinking or just fine? Do small companies do leetcode or just ""can you code without breaking prod""? Is 2.5k USD okay for ""Senior C# SQL Developer Remote Latam""?Context: 10 years coding as hobbyist (not for companies). Got a couple projects in production making some extra cash monthly. Moved from Venezuela, trying to enter IT industry now. (I know, sounds crazy)I'm clearly not a junior, but not really a senior either. I tried CS in 2011, quit due Venezuela chaos, went self-taught while working to survive.Applied as Full Stack .NET Software Engineer (9 years .NET doing: CLI apps, Worker Services, Web APIs, Blazor Server/WASM, even a bit of IoT with ESP32). My main project has been online for 8 years straight, niche market, but no scaling budget (that's why I'm looking for job).Is it a mistake applying as Full Stack SE .NET? Should I stick to backend and mention Blazor as skill instead? My projects uses Blazor for FE but I see almost 0 offers for Blazor out there.I tried 30 applications last week, got 1 interview tomorrow for a small US company that needs a ""Senior C# SQL Developer"", remote, 2.5k/month (I'd happily take it as first professional job).They want: Sr C#/SQL, Azure is a plus, good English required.EFSET says I'm C1/C2 but honestly I'm not sure, never took any courses in my life, yet I've spoken with some friends via discord and they understood me just fine so I guess I'm going to be fine here.I know the Azure basics (Key Vault, VMs, Azure SQL with Entra ID). No certs yet.But I fear I'll fail the technical interview because it's been years since I solved any DSA/leetcode, never worked with real distributed systems in my life. I've built my apps with layered architecture, used EF Core, handled race conditions with semaphores, but never touched Kafka/RabbitMQ/CQRS in production and my projects never hit 1k users. Handled JWT for auth most times and my own auth system as I never hit so many users.So... my question: Does a small company paying 2.5k remote really expect leetcode mastery? Or maybe just ""can you build features and not break things and pass the following basic DSA excercises""?Also: Should I switch to Backend only and keep Blazor as skill? Feel like I wasted 3 years learning Blazor instead of React/Angular since jobs are rare to find with Blazor. Maybe I get better or more offers with C# only and not look like a jack of all trades, master of none.I want to enter the industry and once inside, keep building my skills and finally try to apply for better positions after some years. I can live with 2.5k USD a month for some years.What should I expect in technical interview? What to refresh today?Thank you for readng!

1r66si1,How does my autistic ass NOT give a fuck? (becoming grizzled senior),tieltina,cscareerquestions,"In my 30s and wondering if I should stay in this industry anymore.The main piece of advice I find around here to keeping off the pressure is to not give a fuck. And to that... I ask \*how\*I've grown a lot in this career, I know how to push back and assert myself. I've come to expect companies to ramp up pressure (even without deadlines, just constantly hammering with wanting something ASAP). I've come to expect tech debt to keep climbing unless I sneak it in here and there on other tickets.But I guess I am tired of it?I'm trying to ""not care"" but I just won't? I want to do a good job and write good code. So abandoning that and putting out lackluster results both scares me and feels like a betrayal to my core needs as a person. Plus it feels so reckless when I know that pressure will just end up with my colleagues instead of me. Or I worry that I'll come off badly to the customer (despite assurances from my manager that I'm very good at what I do and that I'm valued). And I KNOW that companies play ball this way, with manipulating emotions for benefit. I KNOW it's fascist bs...I just don't know what to do anymore about it.I dunno... I've also never quit without prospects lined up. I'm interviewing, people contact me without me needing to reach out and that's cool... But to be brutally honest, I am not sure if I should stick in this career if I can't figure out how to ""not care"" enough to resolve this pressure problem.Esp with all this AI bullshit... I feel it has gotten esp worse with that. I've done my part to communicate the problems and have been grateful my colleagues express similar concerns... It feels good to reclaim some power and remind them (and me) that you don't have to accept this BS and that if you can push back on it then you absolutely can and should.But it's hard despite that not to unsee the writing on the wall and not feel like I'm wanted... Because if places were willing to ship slop and horrific tech debt into prod before, now they can just do it for free. And now one of our customers wants a discount if the engineers don't use AI in their daily workflow. Like... that's a sinking ship for sure, and I worry it's not the only place working that way.Anyone have some advice on this?Or am I in denial, and maybe dropping out is the best choice atm?Trying to identify maybe where I am seeing this in black and white, because there are plenty of people doing fine in this industry too, and I don't want to doompost because it may not be helpful. Most of the assignments I have had have been with larger private companies, which has me wondering if a smaller private company or government job would have less pressure and be a better fit?I am in Europe, and I have savings...so not really worried financially.

1r8vy6s,How to deal with an existential crisis - 5YoE,Rymark,cscareerquestions,"So I tagged this experienced, but my own impostor syndrome makes me question whether that's accurate or not, so I hope my background gives some insight. For context, I'm a ""senior"" software engineer at a unicorn startup building ML accelerators; I personally am on the training framework team. I've been here a little over 6 months at this point. I spent my first 3 years out of college as the first employee at a tiny aerospace startup, then 1.5 years working on automated fruit sorting before getting laid off and being out of a job for 10ish months. When I got this job, I felt so grateful to be employed again. However, now at the six month mark, I'm struggling with something of an existential crisis. For the first time in my career, I don't feel any sort of connection to my work, and I'm working without any sort of drive or passion. My previous jobs, I felt like there were real stakes, not just numbers on an investor's sheet. I like the people I work with quite a bit, but at this company, like many others I'm sure, the LLM bug is *strong*. Frequently when you have a question, someone's answer is ""have you asked Claude?"" It's maddening to me. I cut my teeth on actual research and engineering, so when I had questions, I had to hit the books. Now I'm...supposed to ask a neural network-powered auto-summarizer. Combine these things with the constant drumbeat of people saying ""we're automating ourselves out of a job"" and it really is wearing me down. I genuinely disagree with that sentiment, I know there'll continue to be a need for software engineers. But all of those things put together has me really questioning my place and my career choice, whether or not I'm betraying my own ideals, etc. I started working on my master's at my last job, and I find myself wondering what the point of this degree will even be once it's done, just because of how everything looks and sounds right now. To anyone out there with more experience than me, I'd really appreciate your advice on navigating this. I recognize that the LLM part in particular is a pretty sizable paradigm shift that we're all dealing with, but I have to imagine some of this sounds familiar to some greybeards out there.

There were some web development projects for a client, where I was a junior dev in the team doing fullstack. Although there was some crunch, I got to learn a lot of skills hands-on.The last few months however, the company has begun to lay off most devs. There's 3-4 devs on this product, and what concerns me is that we're now building it pretty much entirely with tools like Claude and Antigravity aiming to get it done fast. Granted, the lead is experienced and knows his fundamentals very well, and he did lot of the development himself before I came onto the project, so the project is likely not a lost cause.I'm mainly concerned about my own career growth. Don't get me wrong, I use Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity a lot when I'm stuck, and try to learn the concepts from there.But I feel like I don't really learn as much about the fundamentals, languages and frameworks used, etc. when I just spit prompts to Antigravity to fix errors, build this or implement X feature - and for that to be the development process.

I kind of have to vibe-code for now though, since deadlines are tight and I'm expected to be 10x more productive with AI.The working hour expectations are a secondary thing - there's been periods throughout of working on weekends, after hours, maybe public holidays. I think that's a give-or-take thing though, where I've got to set my own boundaries. Besides, my friends in other industries seem to have it worse.Therefore, I'm kind of considering looking for another software dev job where I have the leeway and time to do things more manually and learn skills better. Heck, pivoting and being a BA is something I've been interested in doing for a while now. But how widespread is kind of AI usage in other companies? If many companies are doing this, maybe I shouldn't rush into things.Any advice for me to proceed from here? I've also got a side project going on, if that helps.Thanks!",12,0.69,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r71tuk/15_yoe_company_is_now_building_product_largely/,2026-02-17 09:47:15,2026-02-20 02:11:11
1r44b1t,What is the etiquette on contract jobs,atmoose,cscareerquestions,"Like many I was laid off a little while ago. I've been having trouble finding work. I got an offer for a short term hourly contract position for some frontend work. It'll only last 3 months. It doesn't pay very well, but it'll get me some money. It's potentially something to add to my resume too. I don't yet have a contract so I don't know exactly what the terms are. I am still doing interviews for full time positions though. Would it be bad to accept the contract role, and leave 2-4 weeks into it if I got lucky and was offered the full time position in the near future? I initially thought that I should ride out the whole contract, but in the US I should be able to leave anytime I want.

1r4f6ao,I am wasting my talent because I don't know what to do with it,bourbaki_jr,cscareerquestions,"I am panicking about my future because opportunities seem so tight these days, and I think it is unfair. Here is my story. I am a 23-year-old software developer from a third world country. I graduated from a top university with a good GPA (3.9/4) in 2024. I interned at two machine learning software companies before I graduated. I also took an interest in LeetCode problems and solved over 1000 of them. Now I work for a mid-tier trading firm as an Odoo developer with a not-so-great salary. I was brought up in a family where math was considered very essential for a good career. As a result, I am good at math. My high school science fair projects were often applications of machine learning I discovered independently. I wrote a bunch of manuscripts on math topics throughout high school and college. This is all to say I am passionate about math, and being good at it is really a core part of my identity. I feel like I have an advantage here. Not many people identify as a ""math person,"" whereas I prefer jobs where I can do more math. My educational background is good enough, and I have an okay history of work experience. The reality is I am earning less than $1/hr, and better-paying entry-level jobs are impossible to find these days. The worst part is I am not doing something as meaningful as I want. I despise this phase of mediocrity, but I don't know what to do about it. I feel like a failure because people (including me) expected I would be in a good position in life by now, but I am nowhere near there. The point of the post is that I am lost. Maybe I was wrong about my expectations, and I invested too much in a skill that is no longer as relevant. So I am curious what people suggest I should explore with my skill set. PS: Academia is not an obvious choice for me because it doesn't pay remotely well where I live, and I am applying for opportunities abroad, though that also seems a long shot. There are not many open positions for software developers other than web developers here so I am open (prefer) remote roles.",11,0.58,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r4f6ao/i_am_wasting_my_talent_because_i_dont_know_what/,2026-02-14 08:13:05,2026-02-20 02:11:11

1r6vdtp,Degree Worth,CloneXG101,cscareerquestions,"Probably get this question a ton here but more or less here is my situation.I am currently second semester junior now with a Computer Science major as you probably guessed. Ever since I did my second semester spring I have come to the belief that this major has become more taxing than interesting. I think honestly it is because I went into college after high school without a plan and have based on halo scripting skills believed I could maybe make some habit out of it. Freshmen year was undeclared so really I went into it 2nd year (except for a intro to CS). I have learned basic C++ logic along with discrete, matrix I and calc I. By second semester I ran into data structures, webdev frontend and intro to AI (it was not just those 3 but those were the CS classes).My college offers core classes, and honestly it has gotten to a point that without them I probably lose it because it seems I am just sick and tired of the major and was incredibly burnt out. Reckon despite the grades I got being pretty good like As and Bs I still just sick of the major. First semester junior was not so bad but now in my second I got Backend Webdev, Programming Languages and Software Architecture and it has gotten to a point where I am really questioning if this major is worth anything.Other things to note, I have 3 minors (math is freebie I technically get that regardless) but I have one in History and Theology for the sake of not losing it. They are not at all a problem for me it is just for a break from code. I also seem over the years been very good at being creative with code like stories and whatnot (Data structures we made a text based RPG and the story plot took me 5 minutes to make) along with webdev having like the vision for it.I just wanna know more or less, based on those out there in job fields already is just having a bachlor's degree worth it anymore. I keep hearing about how bad the job market is and well honestly I just believe I am in it to get the degree and then just get out there doing some form of job instead of just school.

I feel like HR judge me for some bullshit vibe that has nothing to do with how I perform, most of my jobs, I was hired directly by one the founders, but that limits me in company size. HR just doesn't understand my slightly autistic ass, they don't care, they're blind to actual skills in my opinion.

1r8z4hq,"Company has asked for feedback on my performance. Is this good, bad, or neutral?",MaleficentCherry7116,cscareerquestions,"I received a chat message and email from HR yesterday that I had been identified as a critical resource on my team and that they were going to send a survey to my supervisors, peers, and subordinates, asking for feedback on my performance. I was told repeatedly in the email that ""This is not negative!"". I was also told that I'm one of three people in the entire company that they've done this for. The ""goal"" according to them is to help ME and to.make things easier for ME. They will take the survey results and create a learning plan for me. Embedded in this email where they kept repeatedly saying ""This is NOT a bad thing!"" was a small snippet that mentioned ""planning for my succession"". What I'm trying to figure out is, how does this help ME? My team needs more resources, and that would help me a lot. The company could pay me more, but I'd take more resources over more money - anything that would help me to not work 80 hours per week. We have a very flat structure and there's no path upwards for me. Besides that, I don't think I'd want to go any higher in the supervisory chain. My next level would be director, but it would likely result in more responsibilities with no more pay.I'm not worried about the feedback of my subordinates or peers. I'm a bit worried about one C level guy who seems to want to hurt me for some reason. And maybe this feedback will help me become a better leader. But I'm not convinced that there's not some ulterior motive, as the company itself is pretty rotten Ex: They fired a guy on Tuesday and HR held an online meeting with our office telling us why people getting fired was a ""good thing"".

1r8i0yl,"I passed the first HR screening for an AI hyped company, but...",Affectionate-Laugh98,cscareerquestions,"TL;DR: Interview went ok but got AI hype red flags. Technical interview coming up - what to expect for C#/SQL ""Senior"" questions? Main concern: they want references but my ""previous company"" was actually a personal project I ran with some US friends, not registered. What do I do?Context from [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r6n544/should_i_stick_to_backend_only_is_full_stack/): 10 years hobbyist .NET dev, first professional job attempt.The Interview:HR said ""We're looking for a C#, SQL developer"" (no seniority mentioned, but I'm assuming maybe Senior? for 2.5k USD remote LATAM I really doubt it).The guy was really persistent about AI adoption, at some point he just told me: ""We contacted you because all our deployments are on Azure and you have solid .NET background, but in the end after some time the language won't matter, AI will code everything in any lang, so we don't really worry about it... so are you currently using AI? how are you implementing it? do you know RAG?""Obviously I said yes even though I had no idea what RAG was. Now buying Udemy course to catch up. They have their own local models apparently.When I heard ""the language won't matter"" I saw a huge red flag, almost cancelled right there, but I need the job so I just went ""ok, alright, you're right"". I truly doubt anybody can debug ""any language"" without understanding it deeply.I'm taking this because it's my first option, but this caused me some noise tbh. I think this company fell into AI hype hard and doesn't understand it, trying to implement AI where is not needed (migrations, etc). But I can adapt.Good stuff: HR mentioned quarterly performance reviews (""how do you feel, what to improve, etc"") which sounds decent despite bad Glassdoor reviews.Next steps he told me:* Psychometric tests (personality, english, basic logic) - done* Technical interview (no leetcode, no coding, just some ""advanced"" questions to determine my level) - this scares me tbh.* Reference check to validate CV historyQuestions:1. What kind of technical questions for C#/SQL should I expect? Company does software solutions/migrations for other companies, they have about 500 employees, Azure + .NET stack. They said basics of Azure is fine, not in-depth knowledge needed. How to prep? I feel like I don't know sh!t but also feel like impostor syndrome talking.2. About my references: They want contact from ""*previous company*"". But as I said in my previous post, this wasn't a company officially registered, it was a personal project I ran with some friends in the US for 7+ years. Even during the interview I said it but the guy didn't care or didn't listen carefully. My take is to be truly honest here in the next contact I get from them, I don't want to get the job lying, if I'm not a good fit, they should consider this and just don't hire me. Or if they hire me, maybe is because they don't care.Anyways, the problem is they're assuming I worked in a small company but it was never legally registered, not even as LLC. My friend did register an LLC but that was a year ago, not related to me at all. If they dig they'll see the LLC registration date doesn't match my 8 years timeline. So I guess I can't use that.They said it's ""*to comply with regulations and just a formality*"" to confirm I worked there the time I said.Best I can do is give them number of my co-owners (they financed it, not tech guys, but can confirm project existed 7+ years). Profits were low, was side project for them, main income for me, now the project is closing as I was the only one maintaining it and basically is not even an extra income now.I can't just not talk about this because this project is where I learned almost everything I know now today. Yet I fail when it comes to Distributed Systems, I never used Kafka, nor RabbitMQ in my life, didn't even needed, I know the concepts but only that...So, how deep do US companies dig on references? Just phone call/email or more in-depth? How do they check my background? I was in Venezuela for all those years, I have like 2 years in this new country (LATAM anyways), banking system is crap there in Venezuela so I used mostly Binance to hold money. But I know for sure this is not formal and looks terrible.Really lost here. If you think I should avoid this company to dodge legal troubles, let me know.EDIT: I'm trying to sell myself as a Mid Level, not Senior per se (although I don't mention it at all) because as I haven't worked in teams ever, I know I'm not a real senior. The project is 100% real, is online and I can talk about it all day long, I designed every single part of it and it's running smoothly so far, but almost no clients because it's very niche and scalating it would require a lot of money that I current don't have.",2,0.57,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r8i0yl/i_passed_the_first_hr_screening_for_an_ai_hyped/,2026-02-18 22:49:07,2026-02-20 02:11:11

However, I am still looking around in case things don't work out. I used to be obsessed with wanting to do simulation development since I started college but for the past while, I've been open to exploring other fields to learn as much as I can.There is someone that I networked with a long time ago that works at the same company I do and does XR work. They reached out to me recently saying there might be a position for me on their team, so I should send my resume and cover letter to him. I eagerly did and was excited about the potential opportunity to finally get the job I've wanted for a long time. I asked a few questions about the work including which part of the work site they worked in, and they said, ""Everything is 100% remote - WFH"".I would have been excited for the job to be remote a few years ago, but my mind has changed since then, and I feel like I would go insane if I stayed at home all the time. Two things that I really like about my current position and being in-person are:1. I've been dreading the thought of just staring at a computer screen for the rest of my career, but my current position is focused on hardware, so I get to be more hands-on and move around.2. I want to climb the corporate ladder, and because the team I work on is big (and there are just a lot of people at the work site in general), I'm always meeting new people and networking. I also believe you can connect with people more in person than over a teams call/chat behind a screen.I feel like if I were to work remotely, I would lose both of these things; I'd be stuck staring at a screen all day in my house, and I can't socialize with anyone except my team, which would be through teams calls and messages. I don't have any friends or coworkers that have similar experiences (working remotely vs in-person, climbing the ladder remotely, etc.), so I'm hoping people here have some insight to share. And, I'm not just concerned about this specific position, but any remote position in general.

They use Laravel which I haven't used at all, so I would definitely have a talking point; I always enjoy learning new things. I would obviously take it slow, since jumping in and a week later you are worrying about software development may set off red flags.Idk, at this point I have dedicated my life to tech, and only see any purpose pursuing software development. This is probably my only decent chance.

1r9deoj,Possible issue with leaving Looking for work flag up too long on Linkedin?,Colt2205,cscareerquestions,I wanted to check with other people on here since I've had my flag up for a while on casually looking and then went to actively applying. Is there a point where you started getting a slowdown on recruiters or is it just the market right now? It seemed like there were offers back a year ago and now it seems like there's not a whole lot of new messages. I figured swapping to active would have brought attention.,3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r9deoj/possible_issue_with_leaving_looking_for_work_flag/,2026-02-19 22:22:11,2026-02-20 02:11:11

I know many jobs require you to be a citizen, but is it still possible? Or should I avoid this route entirely?If I should avoid this route, I will still have some stuff from this field on my resume. How do I show that my skills working with ocean and atmosphere data (big data) are transferrable to regular tech companies?",3,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1r96lr8/meteorology_jobs_as_a_noncitizen_with_a_data/,2026-02-19 18:09:58,2026-02-20 02:11:11
