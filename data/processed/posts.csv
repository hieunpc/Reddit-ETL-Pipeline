1pyecpd,Mid Senior Data Engineer struggling in this job market. Looking for honest advice.,This_Bird6184,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I wanted to share my situation and get some honest perspective from this community.I’m a data engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience building and maintaining production pipelines. Most of my work has been around Spark (batch + streaming), Kafka, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS and GCP), and large-scale data systems used by real business teams. I’ve worked on real-time event processing, data migrations, and high-volume pipelines, not just toy projects.Despite that, the current job hunt has been brutal.I’ve been applying consistently for months. I do get callbacks, recruiter screens, and even technical rounds. But I keep getting rejected late in the process or after hiring manager rounds. Sometimes the feedback is vague. Sometimes there’s no feedback at all. Roles get paused. Headcount disappears. Or they suddenly want an exact internal tech match even though the JD said otherwise.What’s making this harder is the pressure outside work. I’m managing rent, education costs, and visa timelines, so the uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I know I’m capable, I know I’ve delivered in real production environments, but this market makes you question everything.I’m trying to understand a few things:•Is this level of rejection normal right now even for experienced data engineers?•Are companies strongly preferring very narrow stack matches over fundamentals?•Is the market simply oversaturated, or am I missing something obvious in how I’m interviewing or positioning myself?•For those who recently landed roles, what actually made the difference?I’m not looking for sympathy. I genuinely want to improve and adapt. If the answer is “wait it out,” I can accept that. If the answer is “your approach is wrong,” I want to fix it.Appreciate any real advice, especially from people actively hiring or who recently went through the same thing.Thanks for reading.",111,0.9,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pyecpd/mid_senior_data_engineer_struggling_in_this_job/,2025-12-29 05:58:33,2026-01-04 01:59:41

1pxu6ts,Are we too deep into Snowflake?,stuckplayingLoL,dataengineering,"My team uses Snowflake for majority of transformations and prepping data for our customers to use. We sort of have a medallion architecture going that is solely within Snowflake. I wonder if we are too vested into Snowflake and would like to understand pros/cons from the community. The majority of the processing and transformations are done in Snowflake. I anticipate we deal with 5TB of data when we add up all the raw sources we pull today.Quick overview of inputs/outputs:EL with minor transformations like appending a timestamp or converting from csv to json. This is done with AWS Fargate running a batch job daily and pulling from the raw sources. Data is written to raw tables within a schema in Snowflake, dedicated to be the 'stage'. But we aren't using internal or external stages.When it hits the raw tables, we call it Bronze. We use Snowflake streams and tasks to ingest and process data into Silver tables. Task has logic to do transformations.From there, we generate Snowflake views scoped to our customers. Generally views are created to meet usecases or limit the access.Majority of our customers are BI users that use either tableau or power bi. We have some app teams that pull from us but not as common as BI teams.I have seen teams not use any snowflake features and just handle all transformations outside of snowflake. But idk if I can truly do a medallion architecture model if not all stages of data sit in Snowflake. Cost is probably an obvious concern. Wonder if alternatives will generate more savings.Thanks in advance and curious to see responses.",47,0.96,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pxu6ts/are_we_too_deep_into_snowflake/,2025-12-28 15:36:35,2026-01-04 01:59:41

1q22shj,What does an ideal data modeling practice look like? Especially with an ML focus.,Capable_Mastodon_867,dataengineering,"I was reading through Kimballs warehouse toolkit, and it gives this beautiful picture of a central collection of conformed dimensional models that represent the company as a whole. I love it, but it also feels so central that I can't imagine a modern ML practice surviving with it.I'm a data scientist, and when I think about a question like ""how could I incorporate the weather into my forecast?"" my gut is to schedule daily api requests and dump those as tables in some warehouse, followed by pushing a change to a dbt project to model the weather measurements with the rest of my features. The idea of needing to connect with a central team of architects to make sure we 'conform along the dimensional warehouse bus' just so I can study the weather feels ridiculous. Dataset curation and feature engineering would likely just die. On the flip side, once the platform needs to display both the dataset and the inferences to the client as a finished product, then of course the model would have to get conformed with the other data and be secure in production.On the other end of the extreme from Kimballs central design, I've seen mentions of companies opening up dbt models for all analysts to push using the staged datasets as sources. This looks like an equally big nightmare, with a hundred under-skilled math people pushing thousands of expensive models, many of which would achieve relatively the same thing with minor differences and numerous unchecked data quality problems, different interpretations of data, confusion on different representations from the different datasets, I can't imagine this being a good idea.In the middle, I've heard people mention the Mesh design of having different groups manages their warehouses. So analytics could set up its own warehouse for building ML features and a maybe a central team helps coordinate the different teams data models to be coherent. One difficulty that comes to mind is if a healthy fact table in one teams warehouse is desired for modeling and analysis by another team, spinning up a job to extract and load a healthy model from one warehouse to another is silly, and it also makes one groups operation quietly dependent on the other groups maintenance of that table.There seems to be a tug-of-war on the spectrum between agility and coherent governance. I truly don't know what the ideal state should look like for a company. To some extent, it could even be company specific. If you're too small to have a central data platform team, then could you even conceive of Kimballs design? I would really love to hear thoughts and experiences.",42,0.92,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q22shj/what_does_an_ideal_data_modeling_practice_look/,2026-01-02 16:17:12,2026-01-04 01:59:41

1pz4ynz,How should I implement Pydantic/dataclasses/etc. into my pipeline?,paxmlank,dataengineering,"tl;dr: no point stands out to me as the obvious place to use it, but I feel that every project uses it so I feel like I'm missing something.I'm working on a private hobby project that's primarily just for learning new things, some that I never really got to work on in my 5 YOE. One of these things I've learned is to ""make the MVP first and ask questions later"", so I'm mainly trying to do just that for this latest version, but I'm still stirring up some questions within myself as I read on various things.One of these other questions is when/how to implement Pydantic/dataclasses. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about it, just thought it was a ""better"" Typing module (which I also don't know much about, just am familiar with type hints).I know that people use Pydantic to validate user input, but I know that its author says it's not a validation library, but a parsing one. One issue I have is that the data I collect largely are from undocumented APIs or are scraped from the web. They all fit what is conceptually the same thing, but sources will provide a different subset of ""essential fields"".My current workflow is to collect the data from the sources and save it in an object with extraction metadata, preserving the response *exactly* was it was provided. Because the data come in various shapes, I coerce everything into JSONL format. Then I use a config-based approach where I coerce different field names into a ""canonical field name"" (e.g., `{""firstname"", ""first_name"", ""1stname"", etc.} -> ""C_FIRST_NAME""`). Lastly, some data are missing (rows and fields), but the data are consistent so I build out all that I'm expecting for my application/analyses; this is done partly in Python before loading into the database then partly in SQL/dbt after loading.Initially, I thought of using Pydantic for the data as it's ingested, but I just want to preserve whatever I get as it's the source of truth. Then I thought about parsing the response into objects and using it for that (for example, I extract data about a Pokemon team so I make a Team class with a list of Pokemon, where each Pokemon has a Move/etc.), but I don't really need that much? I feel like I can just keep the data in the database with the schema that I coerce it to and the application currently just runs by running calculations in the database. Maybe I'd use it for defining a later ML model?I then figured I'd somehow use it to define the various getters in my extraction library so that I can codify how they will behave (e.g., expects a Source of either an Endpoint or a Connection, outputs a JSON with X outer keys, etc.), but figured I don't really have a good grasp of Pydantic here.After reading on it some more, I figured I could use it *after* I flatten everything into JSONL and use it while I try to add semantics to the values I see, but as I'm using Claude Code at points, it's guiding me toward using it *before/during* flattening, and that just seems forced. Tbf, it's shit at times.To reiterate, all of my sources are undocumented APIs or from webscraping. I have some control over the output from the extraction step, but I feel that I shouldn't do that in extracting. Any validation comes from having the data in a dataframe while massaging it or after loading it into the database to build it out for the desired data product.I'd appreciate any further direction.",33,0.92,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pz4ynz/how_should_i_implement_pydanticdataclassesetc/,2025-12-30 01:47:44,2026-01-04 01:59:41
1q1ddky,Non technical boss is confusing me,Huxley_The_Third,dataengineering,"I’m the only developer at my company. I work on a variety of things, but my primary role is building an internal platform that’s being used by our clients. One of the platform’s main functionalities is ingesting analytics data from multiple external sources (basic data like clicks, conversions, warnings data grouped by day), though analytics is not its sole purpose and there are a bunch of other features. At some point , my boss decides he wants to “centralize the company data” and hires some agency out of the blue. They drafted up an outline of their plan, which involved setting up a separate database with a medallion architecture. They then requested that I show them how the APIs we’re pulling data from work, and a week later, they request that I help them pull the analytics from the existing db. they never acknowledged any of the solutions i provided for either of those things nor did they explain the Point of those 2 conflicting ideas. So I ask my boss about and he says that the plan is to “replace the entire existing database with the one they’re working on“. And the next time I hop on a call with them, what we discussed instead was just mirroring the analytics and any relevant data to the bronze layer. so I begin helping them set this up, and when they asked for a progress update and I show them what I’ve worked on, they tell me that no, we’re not mirroring the analytics, we need to replace the entire db, including non analytical data. at this point. at this point, I tell them we need to take a step back and discuss this all together (me, then, and my boss). we’ve yet to meet again, (we are a remote company for context) , but I have literally no idea what to say to him, because it very much seems like whatever he’s trying to achieve, and whatever proposals they pitched him don’t align at all (he has no technical knowledge , and they don’t seem to fully understand what the platform does, and there were obviously several meetings I was left out of)",29,0.85,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1ddky/non_technical_boss_is_confusing_me/,2026-01-01 19:56:47,2026-01-04 01:59:41

Tessera sits in the middle and makes producers acknowledge breaking changes before they publish. Consumers register their dependencies, get notifications when things change, and can block breaking changes until they're ready.It's open source, MIT licensed, built with Python/FastAPI. If you're dealing with data contracts, schema evolution, or just tired of breaking changes causing incidents, have a look: https://github.com/ashita-ai/tesseraFeedback is encouraged.

1py90n4,[EU] 4 YoE Data Engineer - Stuck with a 6-month notice period and being outpaced by new-hire salaries. Should I stay for the experience?,Remarkable_Result596,dataengineering,"Hi All,​Looking for a bit of advice on a career struggle. I like my job quite a lot—it has given me learning opportunities that I don’t think would have materialized elsewhere—but I’ve hit some roadblocks.The Context​I’m 26 and based in the EU. I have a Master’s in Economics/Statistics and about 4 years of experience in Data (strictly Data Engineering for the last 2).​My current role has been very rewarding because I’ve had the initiative to really expand my stack. I’m the ""Databricks guy"" (Admin, Unity Catalog, PySpark, ...) within my team, but lately, I’ve been primarily focused on building out a hybrid data architecture. Specifically, I’ve been focusing on the on-premise side:​Infrastructure: Setting up an on-prem Dagster deployment on Kubernetes. Also django based apps, POCing tools like OpenMetadata.​Modern Data Stack (On-prem): Experimenting with DuckDB, Polars, dbt, and dlthub to make our local setup click with our cloud environments (Azure/GCP/Fabric, onprem even).​Upcoming: A project for real-time streaming with Debezium and Kafka. I’d mostly be a consumer here, but it’s a setup I really want to see through. Definitely have a room impact the architecture there and downstream.​The Problem​Even though I value the ""builder"" autonomy, two things are weighing on me:​The Salary Ceiling: I’m somewhat bound by my starting salary. I recently learned that a new hire in a lower position is earning about 10% more than me. It’s not a massive gap, but it’s frustrating given the difference in impact. My manager kind of acknowledges my value but says getting HR to approve a 30-50% ""market adjustment"" is unlikely.​The 6-Month Notice: This is the biggest blocker. I get reach-outs for roles paying 50-100% more and I’ve usually done well in initial stages, but as soon as the 6-month notice period comes up, I’m effectively disqualified. I probably can't move unless I resign first.​The Dilemma​I definitely don’t think I’m an expert in everything and believe there is still a whole lot of unique learning to squeeze out of my current role, and I would love to see this through. I’m torn on whether to:​Keep learning: Stay for another year to ""tie it all together"" and get the streaming/Kafka experience on my CV.​Risk it: Resign without a plan just to free myself from the 6-month notice period and become ""employable"" again.​Do you think it's worth sticking it out for the environment and the upcoming projects, or am I just letting myself be underpaid while my tenure in the market is still fresh?​TL;DR: 4 YoE DE with a heavy focus on on-prem MDS and Databricks. I have great autonomy, but I’m underpaid compared to new hires and ""trapped"" by a 6-month notice period. Should I stay for the learning or quit to find a role that pays market rate?EDIT:Thanks for all the feedback. I think quitting materialized as the best move I can make given the circumstances. After looking into it, the 6-month notice period on a standard employment contract seems to be a significant gray area. Under local law, contract terms generally cannot be worse for the employee than what is written in the national statutes (which would normally be 1 month for my length of service). However, custom arrangements are possible, and there is a chance the company’s version is legally valid, meaning I might be stuck with it.​My plan: I am not making any moves yet. I am going to consult with the National Labor Inspectorate and a legal expert to get a formal opinion. I need to know if this clause is actually enforceable or if it would be thrown out of court.​If the 6 months is likely valid: I will probably resign immediately to ""start the clock"" so I can be free to look for a new job sooner.​If it is likely invalid: I will start applying for jobs like a normal human being, knowing I can legally leave much earlier.​I don’t want to risk a lawsuit or a permanent mark on my official employment record for ""abandoning work"" without being 100% sure where I stand.",19,0.89,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1py90n4/eu_4_yoe_data_engineer_stuck_with_a_6month_notice/,2025-12-29 01:42:32,2026-01-04 01:59:41

Now I can’t help but feel guilty of being some brainless vibe coder as I take pride in the work that I produce however I can’t deny it’s been a total life saver. No way could I write up what it provides. I really try my best to learn what and ask it to justify its decision and if there’s something that I can fix on my own I’ll try to do it for the sake of having ownership. Ive been testing the output constantly. I try to avoid having it give me opinions as I know it’s really good at gaslighting.

1q0t1zj,GraphQLite - Graph database capabilities inside SQLite using Cypher,Fit-Presentation-591,dataengineering,"I've been working on a project I wanted to share. GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that brings graph database functionality to SQLite using the Cypher query language.The idea came from wanting graph queries without the operational overhead of running Neo4j for smaller projects. Sometimes you just want to model relationships and traverse them without spinning up a separate database server. SQLite already gives you a single-file, zero-config database—GraphQLite adds Cypher's expressive pattern matching on top.You can create nodes and relationships, run traversals, and execute graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and shortest paths. It handles graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes comfortably, with sub-millisecond traversal times. There are bindings for Python and Rust, or you can use it directly from SQL.I hope some of y'all find it useful.GitHub: [https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite](https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite)",6,0.88,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q0t1zj/graphqlite_graph_database_capabilities_inside/,2026-01-01 01:58:27,2026-01-04 01:59:41

1q036wk,No Data Cleaning,Professional_Peak983,dataengineering,"Hi, just looking for different opinions and perspectives hereI recently joined a company with a medallion architecture but where there is no “data cleansing” layer. The only type of cleaning being done is some deduplication logic (very manual) and some type casting. This means a lot of the data that goes into reports and downstream products aren’t uniform and must be fixed/transformed at the report level.All these tiny problems are handled in scripts when new tables are created in silver or gold layers. So the scripts can get very long, complex, and contain duplicate logic.So..\- at what point do you see it necessary to actually do data cleaning? In my opinion it should already be implemented but I want to hear other perspectives.\- what kind of “cleaning” do you deem absolutely necessary/bare minimum for most use cases?\- i understand and completely onboard with the thought of “don’t fix it if it’s not broken” but when does it reach a breaking point?\- in your opinion, what part of this is up to the data engineer to decide vs. analysts?We are using spark and delta lake to store data.Edit: clarified question 3",6,0.87,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q036wk/no_data_cleaning/,2025-12-31 03:58:38,2026-01-04 01:59:41
1q1fj70,Show r/dataengineering: Orchestera Platform – Run Spark on Kubernetes in your own AWS account with no compute markup,iamspoilt,dataengineering,"First of all, Happy New Year 2026!Hi folks, I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit and a fellow Data Infrastructure Engineer. I have been working as a Software Engineer for 8+ years now and have been entirely focused on the data infra side of the world for the past few years with a fair share of working with Apache Spark.I have realized that it's very difficult to manage Spark infrastructure on your own using commodity cloud hardware and Kubernetes, and this is one of the prime reasons why users opt-in for offerings such as EMR and Databricks. However, I have personally seen that as companies grow larger, these offerings start to show their limitations (at least in the case of EMR from my personal experience). Besides that, these offerings also charge a premium on compute on top of the charges for using commodity cloud.For a quick comparison, here is the difference in pricing for AWS c8g.24xlarge and c8g.48xlarge instances if you were to run these for an entire month, showing the 25% EMR premium on your total EC2 bill.**Table 1: Single Instance (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$2,794.79|$3,493.49|$698.70||c8g.48xlarge|$5,589.58|$6,986.98|$1,397.40|**Table 2: 50 Instances (730 hours)**|Instance|EC2 Only|With EMR Premium|Cost Savings||:-|:-|:-|:-||c8g.24xlarge|$139,740|$174,675|$34,935||c8g.48xlarge|$279,479|$349,349|$69,870|In light of this, I started working on a platform that allows you to orchestrate Spark clusters on Kubernetes in your own AWS account - with no additional compute markup. The platform is geared towards Data Engineers (Product Data Engineers as I like to call them) who mainly write and maintain ETL and ELT workloads, not manage the Data Infrastcructure needed to support these workloads.Today, I am finally able to share what I have been building: [Orchestera Platform](https://orchestera.com/)Here are some of the salient features of the platform:* Setup and teardown an entire EKS-based Spark cluster in your own AWS account with absolutely no upfront expertise required in Kubernetes* Cluster is configured for reactive auto-scaling based on your workloads: * Automatically scales up to the right number of EC2 instances based on your Spark driver and executor configuration * Automatically scales down to 0 once your workloads complete* Simple integration with AWS services such as S3 and RDS* Simple integration with Iceberg tables on S3. AWS Glue Catalog integration coming soon.* Full support for iterating on Spark pipelines using Jupyter notebooks* Currently only supports AWS Cloud and the us-east-1 regionYou can see some demo examples here:* [Developing Spark applications using Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/jupyter-notebooks/)* [Using Iceberg tables with Spark](https://docs.orchestera.com/tutorials/iceberg-hello-world/)If you are an AWS user or considering using it for Spark, I would request you to please try this out. No credit card required for using the personal workspace. Also offering 6 months of premium access for serious users in this subreddit.Also very interested to hear from this community and looking for some early feedback.I have aslo written [documentation](https://docs.orchestera.com/) (under active development) to give users a head start in setting up their accounts, orchesterating a new Spark cluster and writing data pipelines.If you want to chat more about this new platform, please come and join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9TXybZcd).",3,0.57,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q1fj70/show_rdataengineering_orchestera_platform_run/,2026-01-01 21:23:50,2026-01-04 01:59:41

I am trying to train an OCR system on huge datasets, namely:* [OCR Cyrillic Printed 1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DonkeySmall/OCR-Cyrillic-Printed-1)* [Synthetic Cyrillic Large](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pumb-ai/synthetic-cyrillic-large)* [Cyrillic Handwriting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/cyrillic-handwriting-dataset)They contain millions of images, and are all in different formats - `WebDataset`, `zip` with folders, etc. I will be experimenting with different hyperparameters locally on my M2 Mac, and then training on a [Vast.ai](http://Vast.ai) server. The thing is, I don't have enough space to fit even one of these datasets at a time on my personal laptop, and I don't want to use permanent storage on the server. The reason is that I want to rent the server for as short of a time as possible. If I have to instantiate server instances multiple times (e.g. in case of starting all over), I will waste several hours every time to download the datasets. Therefore, I think that streaming the datasets is a flexible option that would solve my problems both locally on my laptop, and on the server. However, two of the datasets are available on Hugging Face, and one - only on Kaggle, where I can't stream it from. Furthermore, I expect to hit rate limits when streaming the datasets from Hugging Face. Having said all of this, I consider just uploading the data to Google Cloud Buckets, and use the `Google Cloud Connector for PyTorch` to efficiently stream the datasets. This way I get a dataset-agnostic way of streaming the data. The interface directly inherits from PyTorch `Dataset`: from dataflux_pytorch import dataflux_iterable_dataset PREFIX = ""simple-demo-dataset"" iterable_dataset = dataflux_iterable_dataset.DataFluxIterableDataset( project_name=PROJECT_ID, bucket_name=BUCKET_NAME, config=dataflux_mapstyle_dataset.Config(prefix=PREFIX) )>The `iterable_dataset` now represents an iterable over data samples.I have two questions: 1. Are my assumptions correct and is it worth uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets (assuming I pick locations close to my working location and my server location, enable hierarchical storage, use prefixes, etc.). Or I should just stream the Hugging Face datasets, download the Kaggle dataset, and call it a day? 2. If uploading everything to Google Cloud Buckets is worth it, how do I store the datasets to GCP Buckets in the first place?

1pzkrx1,Tagging data (different file types and directories) for Windows,Aeriessy,dataengineering,"I've pursued this line of research for years now, often coming to resources that don't fit what I'm looking for (like TagSpaces didn't handle terabytes of media files well). I'm a data hoarder/enthusiast looking for a system to tag a variety of file types and directories in Windows (I'm not opposed to learning a different OS). The default ""Properties"" (for the NTFS ?) are easiest to search, but you can't tag all file types or directories.I use XYPlorer as my file explorer and I like it as a general file browser. I liked the flexibility of the tags, but didn't like how running a script in Command Line to bulk rename hundreds of image files would break the tag link since the tags are all recorded in a tag.dat file (which I'm not opposed to writing something to also change it in there, but I also didn't think it was a very flexible tag data storage method. I'm gathering people's experiences in hopes of finding something I can invest time into when it comes to tagging my media and being able to access it. Things I'm looking for:1. Ease of access (I figure I can write a script to handle the tag hierarchy and categories as needed)2. Tag flexibility (like bulk renaming a tag)3. Ease of tag-ability (while I liked Adobe Bridge to edit tags, it didn't flow the best for me)4. Data versatility (if I can access the data for different visuals at some point or export it into an Excel format)5. Kind of an extra would be doing the opposite of point 4 (adding tags from an Excel spreadsheet)Questions I have:1.

Say you know the majority of issues stem from points of entry. Incorrect PII, paperwork missing important details/format other paperwork needed to validate other information etc. These can be uploaded via mobile, through a branch, online or physical mail.2. You personally log errors provided by the ‘opposing’ company for why this process didn’t complete. 55% of the time you get an actual reason provided and steps to resolve by sending a communication or resolving by updating or correcting issue with information provided. Other times it will be a generic reason provided by the ‘main team’ and nothing notated by the ‘opposing team’ and you would have to do additional research to send the proper communication to a client or their advisor/liaison. Or figure out the issue and resolve it then and there. 3. There are appropriate forms of communication to send to the client/advisor with steps to complete the process. If you collected data from the top biggest ‘opposing teams’ and have data to present would they be able to change some of their rules? Would you be able impose stricter guidelines at the point of entry when information comes through so the issue ceases before reaching point b? Once enough data and proof have been collected and shown to these ‘opposing teams’? 4. Issue is there is no standardization for these rejection reasons. The given ones in lists are not exhaustive enough. Majority work but do not fit all situations. If you were to see the same rejection reason from specific ‘opposing teams’ aka Firms. How would you collect and present that data to impose change? Could you collect enough data organize it by Firm, rejection reason, true reason & system reason, time/date, and visualize it? “This firm caused by X amount to y. This firm caused us xyz if we were to do this and eliminate this it would save us xyz. Basically reducing same reoccurring issues so we could focus on more complex things?

Late 2023 I was dealing with a huge burnout working as a SWE at a bank. So, I decided that I wanted to take a break from the hostile environment and work with other stuff (and enjoy some of my life after uni). The thing is, job market wasn’t so lucky to me. It was (and it still is) hard to even get an interview. So I ended up doing some freelance and gigs all around. But one stuff that was all over my head ever since I finished uni was the famous “imposter syndrome”. And, I got the realisation that I was, in fact, very lucky to land my positions. I always relied on AI to deliver something, didn’t know how to start a project from scratch. So, in November I decided to “start again”. Focusing on getting the basics well and enjoying coding again. And it has been a quite fun journey! In fact, I’m liking studying and trying some stuff. I got a membership on Frontend Masters (mostly because of the algorithm course) and gifted myself with some books for Christmas. I’m relearning (or learning in fact) Javascript, algorithms, some cloud computing (aiming for AWS SAA-CO3) and eager to learn DBs and Golang. Challenges are getting fun again, struggling is getting fun again and, more importantly, learning is getting fun again.

I have books, pages, youtube tutorials and much more, but I still don’t have an «end-goal» with those. What should I work toward learning? I got interested in OpenGL, and started there.

I've tried pro sports, making music, running a photography business, content creation, landscaping, serving, along with a ton of other things to which I've had varying success in.But nothing really seems to give satisfaction like programming, now I'm new to programming, I only really have been ""doing"" it since like the last few months.Two main things I've coded.\- A league of legends cool down app (it basically tracks when an enemy uses key spells in the game, the tracking is manual you have to tap the button to start it)\- A program that trains a specific skill in League of Legends called kiting, which is basically clicking your mouse fast in a specific sequence.I think the fun part of programming is you can just make things, it's like Lego but you have no limits and growing up I always loved Lego.Another aspect I like is while I am very good at content creation, I've had close to 500 million views on social media from content I've made. Content creation doesn't really scratch the same itch.It's like with content creation you make things that people watch but how impactful is that? Half of the stuff we watch we don't even remember ....but with coding you make things that people USE.And that's what I think is so cool.Part of me worries that because I'm bad at math I'll never really ""get"" programming, I also worry I'm not smart enough for it...but I enjoy it.Anyway I don't know if this post is something that people will love, or not, but I just wanted to share it.

I just started to practice some C# and learn its style with a couple simple projects. I guess I have some questions on it as a whole, firstly: for most cases where you need a data-holding object, do you just use a class? Coming from python I keep defaulting to a dictionary, but there it's extremely simple to initialize one with whatever key value pairs I need, whereas in c# the statement is so complex I wonder if it's because objects with more than just a string-number or string-string pairs are meant to be classes. Also, I read that classes are faster in execution.Secondly, I guess I've been struggling to explain the need for all the explicit type declarations and other things that to a beginner seem more complicated than they need to be. Like, it was very complicated in VS to just figure out how to run the script I created, having to choose a debugger and running console commands to get there. What do you do if you want to test a snippet of one script in isolation? Also, I had a class script in the same namespace as the main one, but its class wasn't being recognized. Eventually I noticed the class script was in a different subfolder of the project, so I moved it and it worked fine. But what's the point of a namespace if the file still needs to be in the same directory...

1q0pc66,What does inheritance buy you that composition doesn't—beyond code reuse?,ByteMender,learnprogramming,"From a ""mechanical"" perspective, it seems like anything you can do with inheritance, you can do with composition.Any shared behavior placed in a base class and reused via `extends` can instead be moved into a separate class and reused via delegation. In practice, an inheritance hierarchy can often be transformed into composition by:* Keeping the classes that represent the varying behavior,* Removing `extends`,* Injecting those classes into what used to be the base class,* Delegating calls instead of relying on overridden methods.From this perspective, inheritance looks like **composition + a relationship**.With inheritance:* The base class provides shared behavior,* Subclasses provide variation,* The `is-a` relationship wires them together implicitly at compile time.With composition:* The same variation classes exist,* The same behavior is reused,* But the wiring is explicit and often runtime-configurable.This makes it seem like inheritance adds only:* A fixed, compile-time relationship,* Rather than fundamentally new expressive power.If ""factoring out what varies"" is the justification for the extra classes, then those classes are justified independently of inheritance. That leaves the inheritance *relationship itself* as the only thing left to justify.So the core question becomes:**What does the inheritance relationship actually buy us?**To be clear, I'm not asking ""*when is inheritance convenient?""* or ""*which one should I prefer?""*I’m asking:**In what cases is the inheritance relationship itself semantically justified—not just mechanically possible?** In other words, when is the relationship doing real conceptual work, rather than just wiring behavior together?",4,0.59,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1q0pc66/what_does_inheritance_buy_you_that_composition/,2025-12-31 22:39:50,2026-01-04 01:59:42

1q02xje,Applied Software Development degree vs CS?,IronTheSniper,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice on degree perception in the tech industry.For context, I completed my Associate of Science in General Studies at Collin College, then took a couple of gap years to figure out my career. This summer, I got interested in software development and started self-studying Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I really enjoyed it and decided to pursue a tech career.I got admitted to UNT for a traditional Computer Science degree, but financially it’s not feasible for me. Collin College offers a Bachelor of Applied Technology in Software Development, which is more workforce-focused than a CS degree. The program covers software development fundamentals, includes a capstone project, and has lighter math requirements. Essentially, it gives the skills needed for a software development career.My main concern is if employers will view this degree the same as a traditional CS degree? I’ve read that a CS degree is considered the “gold standard,” but I’ve also heard otherwise. I’m lucky to be able to pursue school debt-free with VA benefits and family support, so I’m trying to make the most practical choice.Would appreciate feedback or advice.

Because of that, I’m wondering whether deeply learning JavaScript and full-stack development is still worth it in the long run.On top of that, one of my relatives suggested a different path. They believe that learning Python and moving into areas like GenAI, machine learning, or understanding how models and agents work (even at a high level) could make it easier to get a job compared to being “just another full-stack developer,” since the market seems saturated.So now I’m confused about a few things:* Should I continue focusing on full-stack development and deeply learn JavaScript?* Should I start learning Python and pivot toward GenAI / ML?* Is it realistic to rely on AI tools without understanding the fundamentals deeply?* As a fresher, which path is more future-proof?I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through this or are already working in the industry.

1pxmowh,C : Passing function pointers as argument,Chief_Miller,learnprogramming,"Hello guys,I'm spending my Christmas week brushing up on my C and I decided to go back to source material : ie Kernighan & Ritchie. Probably one of the best programming book I've read so far. Clear and concise (most of the time...).And even if there are sometimes sometimes some example that require you to spend a few minutes studying the code, you usually have been provided with the tools to understand them.However I'm having trouble understanding one line of their code example for function pointers. Here's the code : #include #include #define MAXLINE 5000 /* max #lines to be sorted */ char *lineptr[MAXLINES] /* pointer to text lines */ int readlines(char *lineptr[], int nlines); void writelines(char *lineptr[], int nlines); void qsort(void *lineptr[], int left, int right, int (*comp)(void *, void *)); int numcomp(char *, char *); /* sort input lines */ main (int argc, char *argv[]) { int nlines; /* number of input lines read */ int numeric; /* 1 if numeric sort */ if(argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], ""-n"") == 0) numeric = 1; if((nlines = readlines(lineptr, MAXLINES)) >= 0){ qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1, (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp)); writelines(lineptr, nlines); return 0; } else { printf(""input too big to sort\n""); return 1; } }and here is the line I'm having trouble with : qsort((void **) lineptr, 0, nlines-1, (int (*)(void*,void*))(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp));I understand that the last argument to qsort is a function pointer allowing you to customize the behaviour of the sorting algorithm. That pointer needs to point to a function that take 2 pointers to void as argument and returns an int. I also understand that this part : **(numeric ? numcmp : strcmp)** is used to chose between the function **numcmp** and **strcmp** depending on if the **numeric** flag is set to 0 or not.The book tells us that using a function name like this (without parentheses) in a expression evaluates to the addresses of the functions, a bit like using & for variable name or using the name of an array. And so far, when passing a pointer as an argument to a function, we've been able to write **function(&variable);** as in **scanf(""%d"", &count);**So what's going on with **(int (\*)(void\*,void\*))** just before ? Is that type casting because the functions **numcmp** and **strcmp** are declared to take pointer to char as arguments? I think it is, but the book say nothing about it and the syntax is cryptic at best. I hope one of you guys could shed some lights on it.Merry Christmas and all the best to you all.",3,0.81,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pxmowh/c_passing_function_pointers_as_argument/,2025-12-28 08:49:13,2026-01-04 01:59:42

I don't feel like I've learned as much as I should, and I recently had a baby and don't feel like I have hours to put in to learn and study outside of work. I feel regretful that others in my field and others are growing in their career and I'm stagnating and feel trapped. I'm 32 so I still have 35 years of career to go, even though it feels hard to start a new path when others have been growing in their path. My sister is getting ready to become a PRN and I feel so jealous!

1q1g8s3,Not sure I want to transition to manager because of toxic younger coworker,Cheap-Sparrow,cscareerquestions,"I (31m) am the tech lead of a small ""sub team"". We have 3 different groups reporting to the same manager. This manager is not a software engineer. I work at a FAANG company.My coworker (25m) is incredibly toxic. They have had multiple blow ups at others and myself. They won't use jira, they won't make merge requests, and every meeting with them is like walking on eggshells. They are late with all their code and it's very buggy. In order to not go through the MR process this coworker created their own repo and pushes directly to main. When we asked them to combine repos they get very agitated. We asked them to start making MRs for review and they flat out refuse and it causes the meetings to become very tense. My manager doesn't understand why merge requests are important and sees no issue with the coworker's behavior. We recently hired 2 new senior engineers. Within 1 month, both engineers have had issues with this person. They are both actively involved in the behavioral coaching of this person. One new hire told me ""this guy is the single worst behaved engineer I've ever worked with."" He expects me, as tech lead, to deal with this situation. I think that's understandable but I have strict instructions to not get involved.I asked my manager to affirm my position as tech lead so I can get this coworker to make MRs and document their designs. My manager said ""No, if I do that then [coworker] will lose their shit and this is a really delicate situation right now.""This young coworker hates me in particular. Probably because I am in charge? My manager has asked me to stay out of it so he can coach this guy himself. My manager told me ""I've never met someone like this in my entire career. I am completely flummoxed and I have no idea what to do.""During one very public blow up, my manager was slacking me privately saying ""I'm confused why he's mad"" and ""just drop [this requirement]. You're right but we need him to feel like he's saving face"".The approach that we're taking is to let this coworker fail on his own. We aren't supposed to save their code when we find bugs, we aren't supposed to push for improvements. We are supposed to let them fail so they realize they need help. Our project is off track.One of the new engineers told me they are having a ""very hard time"" on the team because of this person. I feel a responsibility to respond to that but I have strict instructions to stay out of it. ***Okay. So here's my question.I'm being positioned to become the manager of this team. I said No a year ago because this engineer would have been my only report. My manager thinks I have the wrong attitude and ""[I] need to work with [coworker] because we can't just give up on everyone under the age of 30"". I think this person probably needs to be PIPed and let go. At my previous company (also faang) this would have resulted in a pip a long time ago, both for the attitude but also the sheer lack of deliverables.I can stay on the IC ladder and climb this way, but then a new manager will be hired. This hurts my chances of moving into management later. It also annoys my boss who wants me to just deal with the engineer by coaching instead of a PIP.* Should I take the manager position and have this person as my report, knowing my hands are tied when dealing with them? Or should I try to stay as an engineer?* Do I have an obligation to work with this person, like my boss is telling me?

I never sold any stock whilst I was employed there, so I have a significant chunk of RSUs sitting in my investment account.Reading about my former company in the news now, I don't feel particularly confident about holding on for too much longer, but equally, I've spent enough time in tech to know that anything can happen in the market (although the AI wave does have me ever-so-slightly concerned). What have former FAANG employees who didn't sell during their employment done after? I'd appreciate any insights. I'm leaning towards selling 90% and holding 10%, but if there are better strategies I can consider, open to hearing from folks about that, too. P.S.

1pz9x0l,Not sure where to go next,Guy-Lambo,cscareerquestions,"I was laid off 6 months ago. I've worked as a software eng in the bay area for about 13 years. I'm 38 now so I'm not young anymore but I still have to work since I can't retire.I've always considered myself as average intelligence for a software engineer with a very strong work ethic. This often got me noticed and promoted at the companies I've worked for. Technically, there are usually a few engineers on the team that are better than me.Interviews were never easy back then for me but I always felt like the jobs were given to me since my experience was great. I would typically talk about my projects and then do some whiteboarding problem where it felt like I was working alongside the interviewer. I think I've had probably 8 interviews in my entire life and got a no offer on 3 of them until recently.Ever since my layoffs, I've failed probably 5 interviews in the first or second round. The furthest I got was 5 rounds(they wanted a few more rounds and I could tell they were not super enthusiastic about me). The interviews seem a lot more toxic recently with interviewers asking me questions like ""what value can you bring if AI can do those things?"" With all these things, I stopped looking for a tech job completely and found a part-time retail job.I'm fortunate enough to have a small savings and the part-time retail job is slowing down my burn. I'm trying to break away from tech right now and find any career worth getting into where I can afford a family in the future ($20/hr in retail is very hard to make work for a single person). I have a year or two to figure something out.I spend some of my free time at the library just reading to get ideas on where I can go but I feel so lost. Here are some options I'm thinking about:**1. Grind leetcode, study AI/design, work on interview skills and keep interviewing until I find a tech job.***Pros:* *- Clear objectives* *- Good pay* *- Job is interesting for the most part**Cons:* *- Layoffs still on the table* *- Extremely difficult to get an offer (I dont even know what to study since questions are so random)* *- I really do not want to grind leetcode anymore***2. Change careers***Pros:* *- Fresh start and something that aligns better with my values* *- Maybe better work-life balance than eng (tradeoff with lower pay is fine)**Cons:* *- Have to do some soul-searching to find next career* *- Probably difficult to switch careers* *- Most jobs are probably slower and less mentally stimulating***3. Start a business***Pros:* *- Be your own boss (kinda not really)* *- No leetcode**Cons:* *- Hard grind that requires all your focus and dedication* *- I prefer more stability*With those 3 options, I'm leaning towards changing careers. The starting a business is something I think about a lot but it's not something I can just pull out of nowhere. The thought of going back into tech gives me anxiety through the roof. Unfortunately, I dont know what careers I can change into.

When I was interning, there was another entry developer that stayed on for around two years but left due to no promotion (they said he kinda sucked delivery wise).I am told I do good work and meet expectations, I expect a promotion this year after a year of work post grad. But our team is a little dysfunctional in the sense that it isn't a team and individuals are siloed on specific applications. We have little to no documentation. So anytime I am introduced to new tech or systems, my seniors really do hand hold me, to which I am appreciative of. I am not the type that asks the same questions over and over, I just need to see it once throughly and I can replicate what they've taught me.The problem is, after a year of this siloed style of work, I am getting burnt out. I can not stand coding. There have been multiple occasions for multiple projects where I have stayed at work alone and extremely late, staying until 8-10pm, just typing away at my computer. Recently I have been tasked with developing an entire web app alone. It's functionality seems simple but no application meant for production is ever simple. We are understaffed, so there is nobody else to divy up project tasks with. I've asked if we have any plans to get more entry hires on the team and it is always met with a soft no, the company is on a hiring freeze, economy yada yada.I talk with my friends from uni who are all working. Their teams practice agile and scrum philosophies, and their coding tasks are divided up for multipe team members. They love their jobs. Their eyes bulge when I tell them about my work load and my work effort. I always feel unfortunate when I hear about how lucky they have been, but really, it sounds like those types of tech teams are the standard and I am the unlucky one to have landed in an underdeveloped team. Senior developers can afford to ignore a team dynamic like this and still be successful in it.In my eyes, saying that this is too much work is basically telling them I am not up for the job and I might as well quit honestly. I know I can handle it, I mean I am meeting their latest expectation for an entire web application on my own, but I do not want to handle this anymore. It used to make me so happy to run an application and see the results of my hard work in action, but I genuinely can't even stand opening visual studio anymore.With how bad the job market is, I am scared to walk away.

1pyz75f,Manager back to IC,ruminator755,cscareerquestions,"I’m wondering if anyone has experience going from a software engineering manager (tech lead / manager) role back to an individual contributor?I work at a FAANG and have been a manager about two years. I spend half my time coding and the other half in meetings. I enjoy managing and have great reports. However, my team’s scope of work has become smaller recently, supporting UX Design Systems for our product. I did this type of work earlier in my career and I’m not that excited about it. I’m also fighting for scope with a peer manager. My product area is pretty high pressure with 50-60 hour work weeks, but it’s predictable and stable. It’s highly unlikely I’ll be promoted any time soon.Given this situation I’m thinking about changing teams and moving into a more exploratory team that works on AI applied to concept product features and tries to get AI features into production. This seems more interesting, but I’d have to give up my manager role and go back to being an IC. I know several people on this new team, including the new manager and they all seem great.

I have been working as a software engineer in a small company where I am one of 6 engineers for a year after graduation. As you might guess, this has its pros and cons. We do not have well-defined responsibilities at the job, so in this 1-year experience, I could work with every part of a software like CICD, BE, FE, AI, etc.BUTThis gives me a feeling of ""knowing a little bit of everything but not mastering anything"", so I decided to start with something with the new year. I enjoy the tasks that I would classify as CICD/DevOps the most. I really enjoy working with k8s, so I primarily have this in my mind to master, but I am not sure if it is the right thing since my experience/title is not mainly DevOps, and in the company, there is not much space to apply those skills on a scale I can write it to my CV, it is basically a couple of microservices. When I checked the jobs I am really interested in, I found that they mostly prefer Go.

1q1d23l,How do I stop feeling like I will never have a good career or will become jobless?,squalexy,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone!I'm 30, from Portugal, did a cs licence and master's and started working last year in a big 4, so I only have 1 year of experience doing data engineering. My goal has always been to be a versatile software engineer, I've always wanted to work with data, cloud, machine learning, devops (later in my career), qa and so on. But lately, my mind has been plagued with insecurities and I feel worried about my future. I'll try to provide as much context as possible.For starters, I have no idea where AI will take us and I'm starting to feel dependant on it after going through 4+ years without using it in college. The fun part of this field, for me, has always been to think and develop a solution to a problem, but I'm not a fast learner or fast thinker, and by the time I think of something, Copilot is giving me a much better answer in less than a minute. I don't know when and where to draw the line, when do I start to think ""Maybe I'm using too much AI now"" or ""I'm an engineer, I shouldn't be asking AI to help me solve this""?Second, I feel like this field is starting to become a bit of everything, everywhere, all at once. There's constantly a new tech or stack to learn, then there's AI that you either embrace or refuse (with no clear winner here), then you also have to learn stuff from other subfields because they lay off people and you have to do the job of two, and the list goes on. I get home tired from +8h of work, I don't want to look at a screen and think ""Oh let's build a fun project or learn a new stack!"". I do try to get as much cloud certificates (aws, gc etc) as possible, since our company provides us the vouchers, but that's as far as I can motivate me to go.Then, I also feel like I'm trapped in this job because it's a project lottery and the market isn't looking fun for juniors. I'm working on building agents for our company and while this feels very up to date, I'm afraid it's only another hype that will fade with time and not get much use in the future. Somehow, due to the fact that I'm not coding much, I feel like I'll unlearn everything I've worked on for the past few years (and I did forget most of the stuff from college already) and then I won't have the required skills for better jobs in the future.I also really dislike the country I live in because of our extremely high rent prices and very low salaries (a 1bedroom apt is 50% of my salary right now). This makes me want to move to another country, but I don't know if it might be a good fit, if the market is also terrible there or if I even have a shot with all the competition.Bottom line of all of this is: **I never know if what I'm doing will help me grow and prepare me for a better future, and I don't know what's the right path to follow because I'm in constant doubt and uncertainty. I can't get motivated to work because I don't know if what I'm doing is meaningful to my future and I can't focus on one thing at a time.**Have any of you felt like this or have any advice to help me address this?",16,0.78,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q1d23l/how_do_i_stop_feeling_like_i_will_never_have_a/,2026-01-01 19:43:49,2026-01-04 01:59:43

I’m a little nervous about how expensive most certifications are, and ISC2 has an annual fee. What have I done so far:I have a portfolio with 3 demos for apps I made , some using ML.

1pxnki7,Roadmap and resources for becoming a Machine Learning Engineer,Glad_Orchid6757,cscareerquestions,"I came across a detailed guide shared by people who have cleared ML Engineer interviews at different companies and found it helpful to share. The process varies by company, but the core skills are consistent across big tech and startups.About the ML Engineer Interview Process:ML Engineer interviews typically include 4 to 6 rounds a virtual screen which has coding + ML basics, followed by onsite or virtual loops with coding. Expect 45 to 60 min sessions, often with live coding in a shared doc or whiteboard for design. Companies like Meta and Google emphasize productionizing models, while others focus on specific domains.PREPARATION:● Python is the main language that I use for programming.● Additionally, I am very good at the most common Machine Learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit learn, TensorFlow etc.● The basic machine learning concepts are that I know supervised and unsupervised learning methods.● I can evaluate models using several metrics.● I understand overfitting versus underfitting and the relationship between bias and variance.● I also understand the differences between regression and classification models.My preparation was based on these courses:1.) Coursera AI of Everyone/ Deeplearning AI: Machine Learning Engineering for Production by Andrew Ng Concentrates on turning ML systems into real world applications, covering data pipelines, deployment, monitoring, and scaling necessary for ML Engineer positions, putting an emphasis on the real-world systems.2.) Fast ai: Practical Deep Learning A Hands on, code first method to building state of the art models quickly, very good for gaining practical intuition and confidence in implementing deep learning solutions from scratch.3.) Stanford CS229/CS230: Gives rigorous, university level depth in machine learning theory and deep learning that is excellent for the understanding of derivations and advanced topics that may come up in technical discussions.4.) LogicMojo AI & ML Interview Preparation Course: Focused specifically on machine learning interview preparation, with practice problems, ML system design patterns, and commonly asked interview questions. It helps for project development for interviews.MOVING ONTO THE PRACTICE AFTER THEORY:Practice coding without an IDE use Google Docs or plain editor to simulate interviews. Focus on implementing ML algorithms from scratch or debugging production issues.Great platforms for practice:● LeetCode - ML tagged + general coding● Kaggle competitions for end to end projects● [Interviewing.io](http://Interviewing.io) or Pramp for mocksFAQs Asked:1. Basic machine learning2. Model evaluation & metrics3. Feature engineering & selection4. Recommendation systems.5. Convolutional neural networks for vision, normal language transformation transformers for NLP.6. Scaling ML distributed training, data parallelism7. Production issues8. ML system design9. Coding: Implement linear regression, k-means, decision trees from scratch; PyTorch or TF basicsThis GitHub repo on Machine Learning Interviews is a solid checklist covering fundamentals to production topics.DURING THE INTERVIEW ASK YOURSELF:1. Do you feel confident explaining ML concepts clearly?2. Can you clarify problem requirements and ask good questions?3. Are you capable of delineating the whole Machine Learning system by talking about data, features, models, evaluation, deployment, and trade-offs?4.

I'm looking to change that, and create strong projects that I can be proud to show off to others.I'm considering doing the following projects for my portfolio:- A game engine (or something that involves graphics programming)- A full stack app- Some sort of specialized app (I was thinking something to do with OS stuff) - If I have time, maybe a mobile appI'm passionate about a lot of things which I struggle with because it's harder for me to finish projects as I usually move onto the next one (or learning something new) before completing the current one.Anyhow I guess I was wondering if the projects I listed above would look good on a portfolio from a hiring manager's perspective? I still don't know which area within software development that I wanna work in, but I'm the most passionate about embedded systems, web dev, and game dev.This post I suppose can serve as both a question and discussion.

After dabbling in various areas that tech has to offer through internships and projects, I became interested in building the systems/infrastructure behind the AI/ML models that are in use nowadays. However, I couldn't find much information online on what this role even does because it seems relatively new and highly specialized. I am hoping to gather insight from industry professionals on things like:1. Is AI/ML Infrastructure basically just DevOps/MLOps? Or is it more involved (i.e. coding-wise, distributed systems, etc.)? 2. Could you explain what the day-to-day looks like? If you could also describe what a typical sprint (something like a new project task) looks like, that'd be great too. 3. Is a Master's/PhD necessary for this type of engineering? Personally, I am planning on attending my school's +1 Master's program, which (hopefully) will complement my knowledge/skills in this speciality. 4. On a related note... Is this role entry-level friendly? I.e. is it something that will be extremely difficult to break into as a new grad? If so, what would the career progression look like to eventually end here? 5. What type of courseload is most important? I'll be taking Distributed Systems next semester, Operating Systems in my senior year...

There was a rumor that existing employees would be given equity. What ended up actually happening was that silently, about 1/3 of the employees were actually given c-shares/equity in the company. It wasn't just by title (ie, managers and above). It seemed to be almost arbitrary, perhaps based on some hidden merit or perceived importance to the company. I only found out about it because of work I do with our legal team, so clearly this wasn't made public to the entire company.I am not sure how to feel about this.

Context I am a 5th year student about to graduate thankful to have a full time job lined up. I am 70% excited 30% scared. I went into CS because I genuinely enjoyed coding from a young age, might I say even good at it. I was able to spend hours at my desk working on personal coding projects, or overengineering assignments simply for the joy of it. I was so good in fact I remember in first year for our introductory coding course I rolled out of bed 2 min before my exam (covid times so online) finished the exam in 15 minutes went back to sleep and got a high 90 on it.My Data Structures course was the final time I coded without the help of AI. it was taught in C and I was able to comfortably implement various Data Structures, like trees, linked lists, etc in C with a full conceptual understanding but since AI came out I have fallen into the hell hole that is vibe coding, and I feel embarrassed and scared. during my internships it first began with using AI to ask for help to make a component look good, or refractor some code, or debug something. then at one point asking it to implement entire components. and during my final internship basically vibe coding my entire project. Although i still would dive in and make sure the code made sense and that I could explain it. Everything I vibe coded impressed managers and my team who went on to actually implement my project into production. However I still fell like a fraud. All my uni courses I have more or less AI'd my way through with a few exceptions. I even remember one time I promised myself not to use AI for an assignment. so I used vs code instead of Cursor. In the file i remember adding a comment like:`################` `# Course Code` `# Assignment X` `################` `# Question 1: Pascal Triangle.`Based of just that that copilot provided a tab that was the entire assignment done, I of course accepted the tab and it passed all test cases without a hitch. I was initially excited about how much more productive AI made me, but as of late I have begun despising my dependence on AI to product. I act as a high-level manager just prompting it what to do. I no longer have the ability to understand the code. so if it breaks it's just me asking it to fix it again. and with me starting my full-time position in the new year I'm worried that this hole I have dug myself into is gonna be my demise. It has affected my confidence greatly because I simply do not understand what is being written anymore. it's more or less a foreign language. I do not know what best practices are anymore.I see my peers that did not rely on AI the same way, have a much deeper understanding of their work, and review code at a much more intricate level. They also build much better looking projects than me and are quicker as well, as they use AI more as a helping hand than doing their entire jobI feel it is too late to brush off my JavaScript book and go through all the concepts again. I just need some advice on what to do at this point. I'm joining a fast-moving team and am expected to start producing results very quickly. I dont want to rely on vibe-coding, because I know it wont be outputting the best code. but at the same time I cannot rely on myself as I barely know anything. I guess I'm trying to tackle the fundamental problem that I have no real valuable skillset at this point that is of benefit to anyone.I did not use AI to write or proofread this post so forgive any grammar mistakes please!",5,0.65,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pydg9v/vibe_coding_and_the_workplace/,2025-12-29 05:12:15,2026-01-04 01:59:43

1pzx2ek,Mentorship in Internships?,immediate_push5464,cscareerquestions,"I did an unpaid internship early in my associates degree program and there was, quite literally, little to no mentorship. I get that the goal is to be productive and independent, but are there people here who had more accompanying and supportive mentorships when they didn’t know much? Is this just the price of entry? I’m just feeling discouraged moving forward into other internships and I’m not looking for a repeat of what happened. Especially in an unpaid environment. I didn’t get to make a single significant contribution to the code base or get any project done of any kind. I’m going for round 2, but what positive indicators should I look for in an internship I need to have 20/20 vision here and not end up knee deep in water.

1pzooqn,Rewriting game dev experience for SWE,HeWithThePotatoes,cscareerquestions,"80% of my experience is in game dev, but barely any internships were open compared to swe, and before all of them close I want to apply to swe/web dev jobs. I'm a second year, so it's not too late to fully switch and make more swe projects, but in the short term how could I show off my game projects on my resume? Some of them are from game jams which I had a leading role in, however i've asked ai to review my resume and it said that they hurt more then help for a non game dev role. Is it worth putting those games and other long term game dev projects on my resume, especially if 3/4 of my projects section is those?",3,0.81,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pzooqn/rewriting_game_dev_experience_for_swe/,2025-12-30 17:50:44,2026-01-04 01:59:43

1q2we4u,Is it still a good idea to switch to software dev as a career now? Currently a mech engineer.,Ygnizenia,cscareerquestions,"I have a BS in Aero Eng, and I've worked with 7+ YOE in RTX as a mech design engineer, currently a Senior Engineer for 2 years, with a prospect of even being Principal Engineer next year or two as I'm currently fast-tracked as SME. Well before 2020 even before graduating college, I always felt like I'll be happier in tech. I even took my MS in Mech Eng with a thesis focused on AI-use in engineering, aerospace, and manufacturing sector. Even with all my accomplishments, I still feel incredibly hollow. I stayed with my job this long because I thought this nagging feeling would go away or I can just cope because I'm getting paid well over. I really wished I just started making that move since pandemic to shift careers, and now my ADHD is acting up again as I really can't focus on anything as the new year began to enter that I felt like I wasted 6 years not doing anything about it. So, I decided to follow-up on that this year and make it a reality while I'm still as young as I am and hope to make a dent into the industry. Currently, I'm studying what I can online. I have experience in Python since I used it for work as well, but I have no real confidence yet with any complex coding.I'm confident enough that I can learn well, what I'm worried though is my prospects for a job as AI starts to take over. I've seen companies even hire people for vibe coding and whatnot which worries me there might not be less prospects of atleast getting hired as an entry-level dev where I could also learn along the way. I want to ask people here in the industry, what your thoughts about it or insights about the current landscape? I've already accepted the fact that I am going to be paid much less as I transition away to a different field, I just atleast want to know if I am not wasting my time on a career that I might have been too late to enter to especially when I'll be competing with fresh graduates who might even work for less money than me.",0,0.43,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1q2we4u/is_it_still_a_good_idea_to_switch_to_software_dev/,2026-01-03 14:48:52,2026-01-04 01:59:43
