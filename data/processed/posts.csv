It doesn’t even feel worth practicing regularly since AI can help me do everything I need regarding code changes and I understand how all the systems tie together.

1qhcekr,Any data engineers here with ADHD? What do you struggle with the most?,psgpyc,dataengineering,"I’m a data/analytics engineer with ADHD and I’m honestly trying to figure out if other people deal with the same stuff.My biggest problems\- I keep forgetting config details. YAML for Docker, dbt configs, random CI settings. I have done it before, but when I need it again my brain is blank.\- I get overwhelmed by a small list of fixes. Even when it’s like 5 “easy” things, I freeze and can’t decide what to start with.\- I ask for validation way too much. Like I’ll finish something and still feel the urge to ask “is this right?” even when nothing is on fire. Feels kinda toddler-ish. \- If I stop using a tool for even a week, I forget it. Then I’m digging through old PRs and docs like I never learned it in the first place.\- Switching context messes me up hard. One interruption and it takes forever to get my mental picture back.I’m not posting this to be dramatic, I just want to know if this is common and what people do about it.If you’re a data engineer (or similar) with ADHD, what do you struggle with the most?

1qdv3wh,Getting off of Fabric.,FirefighterFormal638,dataengineering,"Just as the title says. Fabric has been a pretty rough experience.I am a team of one in a company that has little data problems. Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.A little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.The core issues:* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview featuresThe main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.Coming from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.I'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.DE royalty (lords, ladies, and everyone else), let me know your opinions.

1qcw5qe,Data modeling is far from dead. It’s more relevant than ever,eczachly,dataengineering,There’s been an interesting shift in the seas with AI. Some people saying we don’t need to do facts and dimensions anymore. This is a wild take because product analytics don’t suddenly disappear because LLM has arrived. It seems like to me that multi-modal LLM is bringing together the three types of data:\- structured \- semi-structured\- unstructured Dimensional modeling is still very relevant but will need to be augmented to include semi-structured outputs from the parsing of text and image data. The necessity for complex types like VARIANT and STRUCT seems to be rising. Which is increasing the need for data modeling not decreasing it. It feels like some company leaders now believe you can just point an LLM at a Kafka queue and have a perfect data warehouse which is still SO far from the actual reality of where data engineering sits today Am I missing something or is the hype train just really loud right now?,78,0.91,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qcw5qe/data_modeling_is_far_from_dead_its_more_relevant/,2026-01-14 19:04:52,2026-01-21 01:54:23

But it didn't, it just exposed the flaws of their whole data stack.I feel that many are jumping on the AI train without even thinking about if their data stack is 'able', otherwise it's pretty much pointless.Fragmentation often fails because semantics are duplicated and unenforced.This leaves me thinking that the only way to fix this is to find a way to fully unify everything(to avoid fragmentation) and avoid semantic duplication with platforms like Definite or any other all-in-one data platforms that will pretty much replace all you data stack.",62,0.96,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qebb1m/ai_on_top_of_a_broken_data_stack_is_useless/,2026-01-16 09:14:37,2026-01-21 01:54:23

1qexmyu,"""semantic join"" problems",kotrfa,dataengineering,"I know this subreddit kinda hates LLM solutions, but I think there is an undeniable and underappreciated fact about this. If you search on various forums like SO, reddit, community forums of various data platforms etc. for terms like (would link them, but can't here):1. fuzzy matching2. string distance3. CRM contact matching4. software list matching5. cross-referencing \[spreadsheets\]6. ...and so on, you find hundreds or thousands of posts dealing with seemingly easy issues where you have the classic example of not having your join keys exactly matching, and having to do some preprocessing or softening of the keys on which to match. This problem is usually trivial for humans, but very hard to generically solve. Solutions range from stuff like fuzzy string matching, levenshtein distance, word2vec/embedding to custom ML approaches. I personally have spent hundreds of hours over the course of my career putting together horrendous regexes (with various degrees of success). I do think there is still use for these techniques in some relatively specific cases, such as when we are talking about big data and stuff, but for all those CRMs systems that need to match customers to companies that are under 100k rows of rows and so on, it's IMHO solved for negligible cost (like dollars compared to hundreds or thousands of hours of human labour). There are different shades of ""matching"" - I think most of the readers imagine something like a pure ""join"" with matching keys, a pretty rare case in the world of messy spreadsheets or outside of RDBMs. Then there are some trivial cases of transformation like capitalization of strings where you can pretty easily get to a canonical form and match on that. Then there are those cases that you still can get quite far with some kind of ""statistic"" distance. And finally there are scenarios where you need some kind of ""semantic distance"". The latter, IMHO the hardest, is something like matching list of S&P500 companies, where you can't really get the results correct unless you do some kind of (web)search. Example is e.g. a ticker change for Facebook in 2022 from FB to META. I believe today LLMs opened the door to solving all of those.For example, a classic issue companies have is matching all the used software by anyone in the company to licenses or whitelisted providers. This can be now done by something like this python-pseudocode: software = pd.read_csv(""software.csv"", columns=[""name""]) suppliers = set(pd.read_csv(""suppliers.csv"", columns=[""company""])) def find_sw_supplier(software_name: str, suppliers: set[str]) -> str | None: return call_llm_agent( f""Find the supplier of {software_name}, try to match it to the name of a company from the following list: {suppliers}. If you can't find a match, return None."", tools=[WebSearch], ) for software_name in software[""name""]: supplier = find_sw_supplier(software_name, suppliers) df.loc[idx, ""supplier""] = supplierIt is a bit tricky to run at scale, and can get pricey, but depending on a task it can be drawn down quite significantly depending on the usecase. For example, for our usecases we were able to trim down the cost and latency in our pipelines by doing some routing (like only sending to LLMs what isn't solved by local approaches like regexes) and by batching LLMs calls together and ultimately fit it into something like (disclosure: this is our implementation): from everyrow.ops import merge result = await merge( task=""Match trial sponsors with parent companies"", left_table=trial_data, right_table=pharma_companies, merge_on_left=""sponsor"", merge_on_right=""company"", )and given these cases are basically embarrassingly parallel (in the stupidest way, you throw every row on all the options), the latency mostly boils down to the available throughput and longest-llm-agent-with-search, in our case we are running virtually arbitrary (publicly web-searchable) problems under 5 minutes and 2-5$/1k of rows to merge (trivial cases are of course for 0, most of the cost is eaten by LLMs generations and web search through things like serper and stuff). This is of course one of the few classes of problems that are possible now and weren't before. I don't know, but I find it fascinating - in my 10-year career, I haven't experienced such a shift. And unless I am blind, it seems like this still hasn't been picked up by some of the industries (judging based on the questions from the various sales forums and stuff).

1qge6bu,My manager is not taking any technical decisions,theatropos1994,dataengineering,"hello. After 6 years of working in data analytics with NGOs, I transitioned last year to a data engineering role. I was hired for the position because I have decent python/ SQL while every other technical person uses R or Excel. My manager, who worked in big companies, worked with big 4 consulting, and taught data engineering at university, is the lead of our data unit. we are expected to centralize survey data across multiple countries and different Humanitarian contexts. The problem is my manager is not taking the lead on any work related to this objective, strategy or implementation. He spent 9 months doing nothing but small contributions to an internal R package, correcting data tests for new hires, and organizing meetings. while I found myself doing tool discovery and teaching myself DE from the ground up. for now I have managed to. write a data ingestion pipeline with dlt, orchestrated with GitHub actions running via docker on azure. But I am getting frustrated as I am not getting the technical guidance, not the strategic Vision for the project. I feel like our progress is too small, and eventually someone from the senior team (who are not data engineering knowledgeable) will notice and fire us. I asked him multiple times to push back on menial small tasks , and he does for a while then goes back to the same shtick. The one time I managed to engage him in the implementation of the pipeline, he fixated on dlt getting 'seemingly' stuck at the load phase, took 3 weeks experimenting.. only for me to take on the same task and write a report in two days about how the issue is that our postgres instance runs out of IOPS quickly during initial loads and the slowness has nothing with dlt or my implementation. I am asking for guidance on how to make the best out of this as I am certain I cannot make the move to another job any time soon .",15,0.84,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qge6bu/my_manager_is_not_taking_any_technical_decisions/,2026-01-18 17:12:02,2026-01-21 01:54:23

If sampling can lose data context, what’s the recommended way to analyze and process such large datasets while still capturing outliers and rare patterns?4. Specifically for Google Colab, what are best practices here?-Multiple passes over data?-Storing intermediate results to disk (Parquet/CSV)?-Using Dask/Polars instead of pandas?I’m trying to balance:-Limited RAM-Correct statistical behavior-Practical workflows (not enterprise Spark clusters)Would love to hear how others handle large datasets like this in Colab or similar constrained environments",9,0.76,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qddfz7/handling_30m_rows_pandascolab_chunking_vs/,2026-01-15 07:44:15,2026-01-21 01:54:23

1qh4esu,Cloudflare Pipelines + Iceberg on R2 + Example Open Source Project,dutchclifton,dataengineering,"Afternoon folks, long time lurker, first time poster. I have spent some time recently getting up to speed with different ways to work with data in/out of Apache Iceberg and exploring different analytics tools / visualisation options. I use Cloudflare a lot for my side projects, and have recently seen the 'Beta' data platform products incl. the idea of https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/. So, I decided to give it a go and see if I can build a real end to end data pipeline (the example is product analytics in this case but you could use it for other purposes of course). I hope the link to my own project is OK, but it's MIT / open source: https://github.com/cliftonc/icelight.My reflections / how it works:\- Its definitely a beta, as I had to re-create the pipelines once or twice to get it all to actually sync through to R2 ... but it really works! \- There is a bit of work to get it all wired up, hence why I created the above project to try and automate it. \- You can run analytics tools (in this example DuckDB - https://duckdb.org/) in containers now and use these to analyse data on R2. \- Workers are what you use to bind it all together, and they work great. \- I think (given zero egress fees in R2) you could run this at very low cost overall (perhaps even inside the free tier if you don't have a lot of data or workload). No infrastructure at all to manage, just 2 workers and a container (if you want DuckDB). \- I ran into quite a few issues with DuckDB as I didn't fully appreciate that its single process constraints - I had always assumed it was actually a real server - but actually it seems to now work very well with a bit of tweaking, and the fact it is near Postgres capable but running on parquet files on R2 is nothing short of amazing. \- I have it flushing every minute at the moment to R2, not sure what this means longer term but will send a lot more data at it over coming weeks and see how it goes. Happy to talk more about it if anyone is interested in this, esp. given Cloudflare is very early into the data engineering world. I am in no way affiliated with Cloudflare, though if anyone from Cloudflare is listening I would be more than happy to chat about my experiences :D",6,0.88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qh4esu/cloudflare_pipelines_iceberg_on_r2_example_open/,2026-01-19 13:40:29,2026-01-21 01:54:23

For context:\- We are a small team on a central data platform \- We do not have any defined data modelling standards or governance standards that are implemented\- The plan was to move away from our current implementation towards a data mart design. We have a DA but there's no alignment at the senior leadership level across product and architecture so their priorities are elsewhere\- Analysts sit in another department The engineers on my team are understandably advocating for bringing in some foundational modelling, standards work but the company expects quick outputs.

I know a full-scale enterprise data model is not happening at this point but is there something we can begin to bring into our sprints for our higher value use cases? \- Do you have a definition of 'good enough' to help keep you moving while minimising later pain?

1qd17gs,Many DE tasks and priorities to organize,hegardian,dataengineering,"Where I work, there is no Scrum. Tickets keep coming in, and the coordinator distributes them and sets priorities. There are no sprints, because management frequently overrides priorities due to requests from the board and other management areas—almost on a daily basis. It’s basically a ticket queue that we execute as it comes.During the day, I receive many different demands: validating data, mapping new tables, checking alerts from failed processes, discussions about possible data inconsistencies, reviewing PRs, helping interns, answering questions from people on other teams, etc.Sometimes more than 10 people message me at the same time on Teams. I try to filter, organize priorities, and postpone what is not feasible to do on the same day, but more demands arrive than I can realistically handle, so tasks keep piling up.We do have a team board, but I don’t like tracking everything there because some tasks are things like “talk to person X about Y” or “validate what person X did wrong,” which I don’t want to expose directly to colleagues and managers. So on the board I keep things more generic, without many commentsLately, I’ve been putting everything into a single markdown file (tasks and personal notes). The most urgent items go to the top of the list as a simple TODO, but it keeps growing and sometimes it becomes hard to manage tasks and prioritiesNaturally, there are tasks that never get done. My manager is aware of this and agrees that they should only be prioritized when it makes sense, but new ones keep coming in, and I miss having a tool where I could search for similar tasks or something along those linesHave you ever faced this difficulty in organizing tasks? Do you have any tips for a simple workflow?

1qel3sz,Seeking advice,Zealousideal-Lab5074,dataengineering,"Hello everyone, I’m a 2025 graduate in Big Data Analytics and currently looking for my first job. It’s been about 5.5 months since my internship ended, and during this time I’ve been doing a lot of reflection on my academic journey. The program was supposed to prepare us for roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist, but honestly, I have mixed feelings about how effective it really was.Over three years, we covered a huge range of topics: statistics, machine learning, big data, databases, networking, cybersecurity, embedded systems, image processing, mobile development, Java EE/ spring bot, SaaS development, ETL, data warehousing, Kafka, spark, and more. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, it often felt scattered and a bit inefficient.We kept jumping between multiple languages (C, java, python, javascript) without enough time to truly master any of them. Many technical modules stayed very theoretical, with little connection to real-world use cases: real datasets, real production pipelines, proper data engineering workflows, or even how to debug a broken pipeline beyond adding print statements. Some courses were rushed, some poorly structured, and others lacked continuity or practical guidance.I know university is meant to build foundations, not necessarily teach the latest trendy tools. Still, I feel the curriculum could have been more focused and better aligned with what data roles actually require today, such as:* strong SQL and solid database design* Strong python for data processing and pipelines * Real ETL and data modeling projects * Distributed systems with clear, practical applications* A clear separation between web development tracks and data tracks* Better guidance on choosing ML algorithms depending on the use caseInstead, everything was mixed together: web dev, mobile dev, low-level systems, data science, big data, and business, without a clear specialization path.Now I’m trying to fill the gaps by self-studying and building real projects, mainly with a data engineering focus. For context, here are the main projects I worked on during my internships:1. Machine test results dashboard * A web application to visualize machine test results. * Stack: Django REST Framework, MongoDB, React.It was a 2-person project over 2 months. I was responsible for defining what should be displayed (failure rate, failure rate by machine/section, etc.) and implementing the calculation logic while making sure the results were accurate. I also helped with the frontend even though it was my first time using JavaScript. A lot of it was assisted by chatgpt and claude, then reviewed and corrected with my teammate.2. Unix server resource monitoring system A server monitoring platform providing:* Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network via websockets * Historical analysis with time-series visualization* ML-based anomaly detection using Isolation Forest* Server management (CRUD, grouping, health tracking)* Scalable architecture with Kafka streaming and redis cachingStack: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, redis, Kafka, Angular 15, all containerized with Docker.I admit the stack is more “web-heavy” than “pure data engineering,” but it was chosen to match the company’s ecosystem and increase hiring chances (especially Angular, since most of their tech team were web developers). Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to a position.Now I’d really need advice from people already working in data engineering:* What core skills should I prioritize first? * How deep should I go into SQL, Python, and system design?* What kinds of projects best show readiness for a junior data engineer role(and where can i get the data like the millions of rows of data aside from web scraping)?* How do you personally bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations?* What are your thoughts on certifications like those on Coursera?* And for the love of god … how do you convince HR that even if you’ve never used their exact stack, you have the fundamentals and can become operational quickly?Any advice, feedback, or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.\---\*\*TL;DR\*\* My data program covered a lot but felt too scattered and too theoretical to fully prepare for real data engineering roles. I’m now self-learning, building projects, and looking for guidance on what skills to prioritize and how to position myself as a solid junior data engineer.",3,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qel3sz/seeking_advice/,2026-01-16 16:45:23,2026-01-21 01:54:23
1qejnn6,Messy Data Problems: How to get Stakeholders on Board,BuissnessRake,dataengineering,"Hello! This is my first post in this sub. I’ve seen a lot of strong practical advice here and would like to get multiple perspectives on how to approach a messy data cleanup and modeling problem.Until recently, I worked mostly at startups, so I never dealt with serious legacy data issues. I just joined a midsized private company as an “Analyst.” During the hiring process, after hearing about their challenges, I told them it sounded like they really needed a data engineer or more specifically an analytics engineer. They said nope we just need an analyst, which i thought was odd. FYI: They already have an ERP system, but the data is fragmented, difficult to retrieve, and widely acknowledged across the company as dirty and hard to work with.Once I joined, I got access to the tools I needed fairly quickly by befriending IT. However, once I started digging into the ERP backend, I found some fundamental problems. For example, there are duplicated primary keys in header tables. While this can be handled downstream, it highlights that even basic principles like first normal form were not followed. I understand ERPs are often denormalized, but this still feels extreme.Some historical context that likely contributed to this:* In the past, someone was directly injecting data via SQL* The company later migrated to a cloud ERP* Business processes have changed multiple times since thenAs a result, naming conventions, supplier numbers, product numbers, and similar identifiers have all changed over time, often for the same logical entity. Sales data is especially messy. Some calculated fields do not align with what is defined in the ERP’s data dictionary, and overall there is very little shared understanding or trust in the data across the company.Constraints I am working under:* I have read-only access to the ERP and cannot write data back, which is appropriate since it is the raw source* of-course the ERP is not a read-optimized database, so querying it directly is painful* There are over 20,000 tables in total, but after filtering out audit, temp, deprecated, and empty tables, I am down to roughly 500 tables* Total row count across those tables is likely 40 to 50 million rows, though normalization makes that hard to reason about* I am the first and only data-focused hireThe business context also matters. There are no real long-term data goals right now. Most work is short-term:* One-week automations of existing manual processes* One to two month dashboard and reporting projectsStakeholders primarily want reports, dashboards, and automated spreadsheets. There is very little demand for deeper analysis, which makes sense given how unreliable the underlying data currently is.

1qf0y19,Lack of Network Connectivity in Fabric!,SmallAd3697,dataengineering,"I have built data engineering solutions (with spark) in HDInsight, Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Fabric.Sometimes building a solution will go smoothly; and other times I cannot even connect to my remote resources. In Fabric the connectivity can be very frustrating. They have a home-grown networking technology that lets spark notebooks connect to Azure resources. The interface is called ""Managed Private Endpoints"" (MPE). It is quite different than connecting via normal service endpoints (within a VNET). This home-grown technology used to be very unreliable and buggy; but about a year ago it finally became about as reliable as normal TCP/IP (albeit there is still a non-zero SLA for this technology, that you can find in their docs.)The main complaint I have with MPE's is that Microsoft is required to make them available on a ""onesie-twosie"" basis for each and every distinct azure resource that you want to connect to! The virtualized networking software seems like it must be written in resource-dependent way.Microsoft had asked Synapse customers to move to Fabric a couple years ago, before introducing many of the critical MPE's. The missing MPE's have been a show-stopper, since we had previously relied on them in Synapse. About a month ago they FINALLY introduce a way to use an MPE to connect our spark workloads to our private REST APIs (HTTP with FQDN host names). That is a step forward, although the timing leaves a lot to be desired.There are other MPE's that are still not available. Is anyone aware why network connectivity doesn't get prioritized at Microsoft? It seems like such a critical requirement for data engineers to connect to our data!! If I had to make guess, these delays are probably for non-technical reasons. In this SaaS platform Microsoft is accustomed to making a large profit on their so-called ""gateways"" that move data to ADF and Dataflows (putting it into Fabric storage). Those data-movement activities will burn thru a ton of our CU credits ... whereas making a direct connection to MPE resources is going to have a much lower cost to customers. As always, it is frustrating to use a SaaS where the vendor puts their own interests far above those of the customer.

1qifo47,How do teams handle environments and schema changes across multiple data teams?,TheOnlinePolak,dataengineering,"I work at a company with a fairly mature data stack, but we still struggle with environment management and upstream dependency changes.Our data engineering team builds foundational warehouse tables from upstream business systems using a standard dev/test/prod setup. That part works as expected: they iterate in dev, validate in test with stakeholders, and deploy to prod.My team sits downstream as analytics engineers. We build data marts and models for reporting, and we also have our own dev/test/prod environments. The problem is that our environments point directly at the upstream teams’ dev/test/prod assets. In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing. That is expected behavior, but it makes downstream development painful.As a result:* We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.* People often develop against prod data just to get stability (which goes against CI/CD)* Dev ends up running on full datasets, which is slow and expensive.* Issues only fully surface in prod.I’m considering proposing the following:* **Dev:** Use a small, representative slice of upstream data (e.g., ≤10k rows per table) that we own as stable dev views/tables.* **Test:** A direct copy of prod to validate that everything truly works, including edge cases.* **Prod:** Point to upstream prod as usual.Does this approach make sense? How do teams typically handle downstream dev/test when upstream data is constantly changing?Related question: schema changes. Upstream tables aren’t versioned, and schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common?

1qcvfrl,Built my first high converting feature by copying patterns from successful products instead of inventing.,Fit_Acanthisitta_623,learnprogramming,"Junior developer at startup, got assigned to build referral program feature and PM wanted it to drive actual growth not just exist. had no idea how to design referral programs that people actually use since most feel forced and annoying.Started by researching how successful products implement referrals, used mobbin to study referral flows from apps known for viral growth like dropbox notion superhuman. Noticed clear patterns across all successful implementations that our initial design was completely missing.They make sharing incredibly easy with pre-written messages and one-click options, show clear benefit to both referrer and referred person like ""give $10 get $10"", display progress toward rewards so you know how close you are, prompt sharing at natural moments like after completing task not randomly, make rewards actually valuable not just badges or points.Applied all these patterns to our feature by simplifying sharing to one click with customizable message, implemented two-sided incentive with real value, added progress tracking prominently, triggered share prompts after positive experiences like successful workflow completion.Feature launched 3 weeks ago and referral rate is 23% meaning almost quarter of users refer at least one person, PM says that's way higher than initial goal of 10%. Honestly just copied what works for other products instead of making up our own approach, turns out proven patterns exist for most features and following them works better than trying to be original.Biggest lesson is when building growth features research is more important than innovation, these patterns have been tested millions of times already so just implement what works.

Like when learning promises, I'd link it back to callback functions and explain how they solve callback hell. Building a web of connected knowledge instead of isolated facts.I also keep a running list of common mistakes I make in a separate doc. Like forgetting to return in array methods or mixing up async/await syntax. Reviewing my actual errors is way more useful than rereading correct examples. Stack overflow obviously helps when I'm stuck but I try to understand WHY something works instead of just copying the solution.My current setup is a mix of tools that work together pretty well. I use vscode obviously for coding, github for version control and tracking my projects. For learning and retention, I keep my notes in remnote cause it automatically makes flashcards and quizzes from my notes. I also use codepen for quick experiments when I want to test something without setting up a whole project.Still got a long way to go but at least now I'm not forgetting everything I learned last week.

1qduo1k,Design problem: grouping raw punch events into overlapping shifts,MERAKtaneous,learnprogramming,"Hey everyone, I’m running into a time-based data processing problem and would love some design advice.I have two modules: one imports raw punch events from biometric machines (just employee ID + timestamp), and the other lets me define shifts. Using these, I try to figure out which shift an employee worked, whether they were late, overtime, etc. Day shifts work perfectly fine, but night shifts and overlapping shifts are causing issues.Shifts are very flexible: some start early, others late, many cross midnight, and some overlap. Because of this, grouping punches by calendar day doesn’t work. Processing is done by a scheduled job that must run at a specific time. The problem is that at that moment, some shifts are still in progress while others are starting, which leads to incomplete or incorrect grouping—for example, a punch during a night shift might be interpreted as a full shift or a very short one.I’m looking for a general approach to assign raw timestamped events to shifts when shifts can overlap or be incomplete at processing time.

I think I was kind of still warm and fuzzy from being glazed so much that I just kind of immediately said yes (also in my experience when someone higher up, asked you to do something you say yes, that’s just kind of the way I’ve gotten as far as I have in my career, it sucks, but it’s paid off for me). He also mentioned that by accepting this, I was not allowed to hand code anything, I had to “fully embrace, vibe coding“ whatever that means. I also managed two other teams, that work on five other products and when I asked this individual “ what’s gonna happen there?” he basically was like “ you’ll pretty much be able to do this on the side!” :flushed_face:Basically, since then, I have pulled down the code and it’s a absolute mess, aside from the fact that the performance is utterly atrocious and it’s extremely slow and unintuitive, the code is literally a trash fire pile of AI generated slop. Absolutely no organization, insane architectural decisions that for the sake of anonymity, I won’t go into. And overall, just like an insane volume of code that it would take a human being a very very very, very, very, very, very long time to read through and understand even half of it.All the while I’ve been trying to make heads or tails of the code base the executives keep pushing 1 million commits a day, they are like rejoicing in their slack channel. They are so over the moon that finally they can just build whatever they want. Ironically they don’t see the pattern that every time they push something they report a bug or report something else being broken, but I’m also not banking on them noticing that pattern.They keep making remarks about how companies that aren’t doing exactly what they’re doing right now are going to fail. They keep making remarks that they finally solved the puzzle. It’s becoming clear that they do not value software engineers and they’ve got it all figured out, from their perspective.I’m not really sure what to do here, I have a product manager that has been tapped to product manage this and we had a call today where we were basically”WTF is going on”. We have a meeting next week to level set, but I’m just kind of anxious for the outcome of that part of me kinda just wants to say in the most professional way possible “ I don’t know what you guys really need me for it seems like you’ve got it figured out and if you don’t mind, I’d like to focus on my day-to-day tasks”.Like gun to my head, I think the idea of shipping this to customers is suicidal for our company. It’s an insane amount of code that no one really understands what’s going on, which means the only person that can effectively fix bugs is Claude and I’ve heard horror stories of Claude really not being able to handle big projects.I just don’t know what to do because I feel like if I was trusting my gut, I would say let’s slow down and talk about what we actually want to build, take some time to actually pass through the code and make sure that we’re making smart choices. But I just know that that would be met with such resentment and distain. I feel like this is a group of individuals that is so angry that for so long people that know what is going on have gotten in the way of what they want, which is more more more now now now.Has anyone else experience this?

I currently work as an SDE for a big financial services firm. I’ve been one of their top performers but the pay growth has plateaued. I also have an annoying commute situation where it takes me a 1-1.5 hours to get to the office and I have to attend some meetings very early in the morning before that. They also make you pay the very expensive parking downtown. They also lay off 5% of their workforce every year and I’ve seen multiple people on my team let go. I would’ve been okay with everything but recently, one of the higher ups said that they’re tracking how many hours we work in the office, the time we come to the office, the time we leave the office, and there’ll be consequences for everything - which is kind of unreasonable considering that we attend meetings with other regions very early in the morning, work on releases very late at night and respond to incidents and downtimes during the weekends from home. We’ve made this job our life but they make it harder every day and don’t pay us much either.Anyways, I luckily got an interview call from Netflix. It’s a remote role, my pay is going up significantly and everything looks perfect on the surface. So, if someone worked/works over there, how is it really like working remotely as an SDE at Netflix? What’s the catch? Are remote workers more likely to get laid off or get plateaued on their salary growth compared to the ones who go to the office every day?

1qgou8i,How do I stop being a cowboy?,Unlucky-Ant-9741,cscareerquestions,"Monday morning here. I'm back at work and my inbox is flooded with hundreds of AWS alerts from failed Lambdas. Tech lead says just to ignore it - we have an email filter where all the bug reports go to be ignored. Instead he says for me to work on my sprint tickets. After uni, I never had any formal training on the tech my company uses. So I just throw together stack overflow answers and AI slop into my vibe code and hope for the best. As long as the Copilot PR recommendations are all actioned, my tech lead rubber stamps my PRs and prod deploys How do I stop this? How do I stop being a cowboy developer making it up as I go along? This isn't imposter syndrome. I know I'm a fraud. Me and my whole agile team are frauds and cowboys. It feels like I know nothing. Yet everything moves so fast in python and AWS, it's impossible to know a fraction of what I need. Management requirements to get code out fast(""agile scrum."" 2025/6 KPIs - we gave you all Claude Code subscriptions to deliver faster!) fills me with uncertainty.I feel like it is impossible to have any pride or sense of craftsmanship as a programmer.

1qigchc,Lost my job as a Senior Software Engineer. Dejected and not sure what to do next,philosograppler,cscareerquestions,"Hi everyone,I haven’t posted on this subreddit before, but I’m at a point where I really need some outside perspective on what to do next.I’m based in NYC and I’ve been working as a software engineer for about six years. I originally got into this field because I wanted to learn to code so I could build my own ideas and maybe start something one day, but I haven’t really acted on that goal the way I thought I would.For most of my career I was at a large Fortune 500 company. I was there for five years and then lost my job due to restructuring that turned into mass layoffs. Right after that I traveled a bit and then started job searching. It felt endless. Once I got interview-ready again it still took about six months to land another role.I thought I finally found the perfect fit. It was a hybrid role at a startup events company where I’d be a Senior SWE working across web and mobile. I joined a newly formed AI R&D team as the first hire. Since the team was brand new there was no PM, no designer, and no scrum master, so it was mostly just me working directly with my manager, who had also just been promoted into management.From the beginning things felt messy. Deadlines were vague and product goals kept shifting from sprint to sprint. Then the CEO fired the cofounder, suddenly changed the company from hybrid to mandatory five days a week in-office, and later fired one of the two engineering managers.Not long after that I was let go for “performance reasons,” despite never being put on a PIP. When I try to be honest with myself about what they might be referring to, I can only point to two things. One was the CEO being upset that I was late to an all-hands meeting, but I didn’t even know it was happening because my manager forgot to put it on my calendar when I first joined, so I arrived about 30 minutes late. The other was a deadline to switch our product over to a different API endpoint that supported local testing. My manager wrote the backend for it, but the environment I needed to test in was constantly tied up by other engineers, so I moved onto another priority and that pushed the API switch back.A big part of the frustration is that I was building on top of backend code my manager had basically stitched together quickly, and it didn’t follow basic REST principles. The delay on the API work wasn’t only about me moving slowly. There was technical debt and there were delays and blockers that were out of my control too. I’m not saying I did everything perfectly, but when they let me go and I asked what specifically was wrong, the only answer I got was “poor code quality.” I can’t shake the feeling that once our team started missing deadlines, my manager needed someone to blame, and I ended up being the easiest target for the CEO.I was only there for five months, and getting let go like that has really messed with my confidence and mental health. Now I don’t know what the right move is. Part of me wants to jump back into applying immediately. Another part of me wants to finally take this as a push to work on my own startup ideas. Right after this happened, I swore I’d do everything I could to make sure I could work for myself eventually, but I’m not fully confident I can actually bring one of my ideas to life.On top of that, I have ADHD, and I’ve always had this constant background feeling of underperforming or that I’ve forgotten something important. This whole situation has made that a lot worse, and it’s hard not to spiral into those thoughts.If you’ve been through something like this, how did you decide what to do next? Would you focus on getting back into a stable job first, or would you take a risk and try to build something for yourself?",104,0.89,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qigchc/lost_my_job_as_a_senior_software_engineer/,2026-01-20 22:51:31,2026-01-21 01:54:25

1qcvnrd,Got let go from a start up today.,Mental-Wave1762,cscareerquestions,I worked there for almost 2 years and it was just me and another guy on the team. He served as my manager but we pretty much built a lot of the app together. They had the bones when i got there but I iterated a lot on there. Feels kind of bittersweet I got the end of the day meeting and my manager said we determined we have to let you go. They said at this stage they needed less development and a sales guy in my spot.I ask if it was performance related but they said no and only offered a little criticism that the only critique i had was I couldve understood certain parts of the app more but I literally built a big chunk of it so idk. The ceo even undercut that criticism by saying i certaintly could do my job better and look even if it was perfect I dont think it would effect this decision. Its just the stage were in and if this project were to ever pick back up we would love to you have you back. he said he thought the world of me and said i should know hes not the type to mince words but he said he would give a recommendation to whoever. My manager was all quiet in the corner and kinda just said he echoed what the ceo said and just said at this stage of the development we expected to be in a certain spot and it didnt happen.(I almost took that as a personal critique but idk its just raw right now). Apparently they made the decision during christmas but didnt want to tell me until now. I told them I would just walk out quietly at the end of the day(we only had 10 minutes left.) they both seemed genuinely sad but idk I expected my manager to say more knowing he knew but he was just tucked away quiet. Anyway im ranting but I guess thats just the nature of these types of jobs I guess. I kinda saw it coming when we were burning money and they couldnt get people fully on board with the beta. I just feel kinda used.Just kinda wanted some advice on what jobs are more stable. Ive literally done product oriented jobs with a established product. Consulting and now a start up.

1qf8lif,I want to course correct my life and I mean it. But what are my options? Graduated in 2018 and have done nothing since,COOCOORAARAA,cscareerquestions,"I’ll be extremely blunt and honest with my post and I also am receptive of blunt and honest advice. I hope you withhold any personal attacks though, I know I am bottom of the barrel, but I am working on course correcting.I’m 33 and graduated with a cs degree in 2018, and have frankly done nothing with it since. Yes, I have been unemployed.What I can do is a fair amount of leetcode problems (easy to medium is perfectly doable, perhaps 60-70% of the mediums, hard can get tricky since that requires time complexity optimization)I am also able to think a bit creatively (not in an impressive way by any means, but just to express I’m not stunted in that category). For example earlier I thought of a blueprint of a website app (which I’m sure already exists, but it works side by side with how I feel at the moment, so I thought why not). Called “Today, I did it.” Basically enter within a field different activities you did for the day, run that though an ai api to quantify that action in numbers and spit it back out. There’s a daily meter/quota to fill and maybe some kind of currency that can be used to buy trophies (not sure yet). It definitely aligns with how I feel today, because I’ve been in a mental standstill for a long time now, and trying to push throughI guess my ultimate questions are:1. What are my options on getting back on my feet?2. Is programming completely out of the question at this point?3. What fields could I possibly pivot to with a computer science degree?4.

1qhb7ii,"2 YOE backend engineer feeling bored is this just how it is, or am I missing depth?",Mohammed1jassem,cscareerquestions,"I’ve been working as a backend engineer for around 2 years now, and lately I’ve been feeling pretty disengaged.Most of the work feels like *gluing things together*: APIs, ORMs, queues, configs, cloud services, etc. Even when it’s “complex,” it often feels like complexity from coordination rather than depth. I don’t feel like I’m learning fundamental ideas anymore, just new tools and patterns.I tried branching into AppSec thinking it would be deeper, but honestly it felt even more shallow lots of checklists, scanners, and “best practices,” with limited opportunity to really understand systems at a fundamental level (at least in what I’ve seen so far).Now I’m questioning a few things:* Is this just what industry software engineering feels like after the initial learning curve?* Am I just not going deep enough in backend (databases, distributed systems, performance, internals)?* Or should I pivot and focus more on computer science–heavy areas (OS, compilers, networking, databases) either through a role change or serious self-study?I don’t hate programming, but I miss the feeling of wrestling with hard problems instead of wiring services together. Curious if others felt this around the 2–3 YOE mark and what paths helped:* going deeper in backend?* moving to infra / systems / performance?* Masters and Phd (Academia)* or just accepting that most jobs are like this?Would appreciate perspectives from people a few years ahead of me.

1qfvh8w,Apple SRE role - Hiring Manager felt disinterested in me from the start (Not a rant but Im seeking advice for self-improvement),Vivid-Nectarine-2932,cscareerquestions,"Hi all,Apple is my dream company and I have been practising very hard for the interviews. I currently work at one of the big banks, graduated from a top 10 CS uni (no 1 in country) and have 2.5 years of professional experience. Life there is good, I get along well with colleagues and we like each other, but my goal has always been to get into a big tech company. The bureaucracy and nature of a bank really stifles engineering i feel, hence my decision to transfer. I simply felt Apple is the pinnacle of engineering standards and I would want to learn from Apple instead.Recently, I had the interview with the hiring manager for the first round and he seemed really disinterested in me early on, but not necessarily from the start. His body language shows it, he would rock his body back and forth. He asked me only resume-focused questions and just asked one simple technical question which i got correct and then ended the interview.I was quite taken aback because when i sit for interviews at the other major tech companies, I had expected a rigorous technical questions but it wasnt the case for Apple which felt really strange to me. Then, yesterday (2 days after my interview) my status on the applications portal showed in the 'Archived' state.To add on some context, I feel it might have been my work experience. I am relatively early in my career but have a few short stints of about 1 year each and I am only 10 months in the bank.Also, in the bank, we dont have root access and i read in big tech they tune kernel parameters for the hyper-scale traffic, use /proc for troubleshooting as it has less overhead and has more info like we can see what version of binary its run, spread out interrupts alongside cores (RSS), etc. So, my Linux professional experience is clearly not stellar tho i know a lot of theory from reading.When i described some stuff to the hiring manager specifically about our disaster recovery process, i am guessing it could feel really different and strange to him that we have to take screenshots and failover abruptly (not canary) and other stuff but that is simply the protocol of the bank.I would appreciate any advice from you all on my situation. If you were an interviewer / hiring manager , why would you behave the way the Apple Hiring Manager did to me during my interview ? I have been very polite throughout but sth about my interview he was probably dissatisfied. Maybe I rambling away or what not ?Thank you to this awesome community in advance and you all have a great week ahead!",42,0.93,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qfvh8w/apple_sre_role_hiring_manager_felt_disinterested/,2026-01-18 01:48:56,2026-01-21 01:54:25

Software engineer with 5 yoe at a unicorn, I've been with my current company for about 2 years now. I had a life-changing event that happened in my family before my graduated. As a result, during the initial couple years of my career, I was very ambitious and set for faang/unicorn level pay. I pushed and pushed and pushed myself, even though I did not want to. I felt like that was when I developed this chronic fatigue and burnout about work. Anyway, I did not stop, until I got into my current company, and I felt satisfied that I got what I wanted.Since then I felt like I got out of survival mode, and somehow without fear, I started hating my job more and more. About a year into my current job, my burnout was so bad, to the point that I couldn't bring myself to work more than 1 hour a day no matter how hard I tried. I sat in front of my laptop during nights and weekends but I could not get any work done, it felt like my brain shut down. I ended up taking a sabbatical for three months. I took the time and travelled to Europe and did not do anything but to spend time with my family for three months.After I came back, everything was so much better. I felt better about work, I was way more productive and I could function as normal. Sure I still didn't like working, but I didn't hate it and I could tell it was different than the period I was burnt out.Fastforward to today, a year from my last sabbatical, I feel like the burnout is slowly creeping back. It's been 2 weeks now and I've been extremely unproductive. I feel like I can't get things into my brain, I can feel that it is similar to the burnout I had last time, but fortunately a bit better. I seriously don't know what to do. My company has good wlb, great engineering culture, tc is a bit above faang level. I feel like I have nothing to complain, yet i hate my body for feeling this way. I think the root cause is that this place is a very fast-paced and high growth company. I don't work long hours by any means, but the work is very challenging and expectations are high. There are pros and cons to this, I feel like my work has meaning, i get rewarded, but sometimes it's very very draining. I feel like it's sucking the life out of me. I don't know what to do. I don't hate CS by any means, but this level of mental efforts does not seem like it's something I wanna do with my life. Maybe I want to coast. Maybe I'm ungrateful, maybe I want the pay but not do the work. i feel like I'm slipping and spiraling a bit downwards mentally.Any advice is appreciated.",41,0.93,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qhjehf/advice_burning_out_a_second_time_how_can_i_save/,2026-01-19 22:46:32,2026-01-21 01:54:25
1qfp760,I don't understand the point of online coding assessments that companies give out and it drives me crazy.,LongjumpingPage6168,cscareerquestions,"So, like the title, I don't understand the point of online coding assessments that major companies give on HackerRank, CodeSignal, CodeVue, etc. that we have to do on our own, while being proctored with camera and microphones on. I am OK with technical interviews with another engineer where we can code together and I can communicate my thoughts, processes, and my knowledge while programming. However, what's the point of stupid online assessments that major companies shove down our throats? You tell me that I have to do these proctored online assessments without any access to Internet (I cannot search for syntax or anything related to the coding problems) and I have to program with the camera and microphones on, and I cannot talk or look at anywhere else during the assessment because I'm afraid they would cause me of cheating. No one would hear me communicating my thoughts or processes during coding. And if I cannot pass all test cases within the time limit, I'm automatically eliminated from the hiring process, and my application would be thrown away, all of my past work experiences, skills, and projects I have gained over the years would be useless for them. And even if I pass all the test cases, I can still not move forward due to other reasons.People said that I have to do LeetCode, and I have practiced on my own for years on both LC, HackerRank, CodeSignal,... and solved over 100 problems... I also reviewed all data structures and algorithms again, but at the end, what's the use? Even when doing coding assignments in classes my professors allow us to search online but why cannot I search anything during these stupid assessments? And you know that most of us cannot pass these assessments in this way. So, I fear that even if I do 1000 to 10,000 LC problems the result is still the same, when I know that the companies only care if I pass all the test cases in these coding assessments.And funnily, I got my first part-time web developer job on campus, and my first IT infrastructure internship at a Fortune 500 multi-industry company without any LeetCode-style interviews. Especially in the hiring process for my first internship program, I only had to go through phone screen with a recruiter, and a behavioral interview with the IT manager where we discuss about my projects and past experiences, and within a week, I got hired for the program. But now, I did not get the return offer from the company so I have to do all of these LC over again with no hope.I feel like this is the only thing that fails me to get the full-time career I need after my graduation in May 2026. The other things like resume, networking, communication, interview skills, I am still learning and improving everyday, but these assessments feel hopeless to me. Just thinking about how I can be unemployed after graduation drives me crazy and makes me feel so embarrassed.And I've heard some people said I can skip these assessments with referrals. Is this true? I have friends who are working in these companies and I used to work with some of them, or we had little interactions but we're still in good terms. How do I reach out to them in a professional way to get the referrals? Can someone tell me?

I did not apply to any companies as practice; I only applied to companies that I genuinely wouldn't mind working for and whose salary range was within at least what I was making now, or more.Almost all companies followed a pretty standard process - recruiter call, technical screen, hiring manager screen, onsite. All companies did not ask any leetcode or brainteaser questions (I did my best to filter those companies out). One company had an online assessment before I talked to anyone, and a take-home later in the process that took ~10 hours. I had fun doing the take home and did not mind the time it took.Preparing for my interview was pretty straightforward. Because I was targeting companies with no leetcode, I did not prepare for coding assessments at all. I did well on interviews that required me to write code (save for one, where I flubbed due to a misunderstanding of the problem / incorrect assumption as it was based on a real-life product). For system design, I used the free versions of HelloInterview (I did not pay for membership like the other post), but I did have an existing lifetime membership for GreatFrontEnd for FE system design. I did not find it that useful for the interviews I encountered.For scheduling interviews, the majority of them were scheduled from 6AM-9AM PT (east coast morning), or (2PM-6PM PT) (west coast afternoons), depending on where the company was located.For the companies that I got rejected, I think my weakest area was for sure system design questions, and doing technical deep dives of my work projects. Two of the five companies that rejected me provided detailed feedback, which I appreciated and understood their perspective. Some rejections were purely tactical errors on my part.In the end (just before new years), I accepted a remote role for +20% base, and a lot more equity than my current role. The role I accepted was one where I was most interested in the company anyway; both offers I received were from companies I would've been happy joining. The entire process took a little less than two months from the initial offer being sent, to me accepting an offer.Happy to answer any questions.",35,0.93,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qflfga/experience_with_a_2_month_job_hunt_late_2025/,2026-01-17 18:51:04,2026-01-21 01:54:25

1qewjyx,Stuck in my career and don't know what to do,radioactiveflamingos,cscareerquestions,"For context, I'm a 2023 grad from engineering university, interned at big bank and got converted to a full time offer at the end of it.I am very grateful to have a job in my current position, but I feel like I've been rotting away as a developer for the past almost 3 years of working at the same company.My whole time has been a huge mess unfortunately. This team is entirely focused on replacing an existing internal platform within the company and I've been stuck on doing mindless CRUD work for the entire 2+ years I've been working. The product is essentially created out of a war started between two directors who disagreed on the current approach of the platform at the company.Besides the messy team origins, my biggest difficulty has been gaining a deeper domain knowledge and be able to insert myself into key initiatives. I'm not sure if it's bad luck or just me not being smart about which work I pick up, but I somehow always end up taking tasks that don't help me to stand out or make a huge noticeable impact. Our team suffers from very poorly written stories and constantly unclear product requirements so it tends to be a roulette when taking on work for the sprint.Additionally, sometimes seniors and tech leads are secluded from ad hoc conversations that happen between leadership, so requirements get changed on the fly at times or critical information is missed leading to mistakes and constant miscommunication of requirements.Regardless, I screwed up during these few years and couldn't make a name for myself within my org. I've missed my chance to work on more impactful projects and take ownership on bigger features. I've fallen into the state of being a feature monkey and don't see myself going forward any further nor do I think it's worth as several engineers and managers have already begun leaving my org.This experience has made me question whether I should even bother continuing engineering as a career. I'm starting to think I'll be capped as a junior / mid level engineer due to my inability to play the game right. I already feel so behind compared to my peers and have really nothing impressive to talk about in interviews in terms of feature ownership.Overall, working at corporate has started to make me dislike development and I have no motivation or energy to upskill or tackle side projects anymore. I'm pretty lost as for what to do at this point as no team is willing to hire internally and my current endeavors for external opportunities has been absolutely awful. Anyone else feel this way?tl;dr: mediocre engineer barely surviving at current company, starting to resent full stack work, and hopeless in terms of other job prospects",32,0.95,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qewjyx/stuck_in_my_career_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,2026-01-16 23:50:29,2026-01-21 01:54:25

1qgg0tw,"Untraditional path, entry-level 1 YOE SWE seeking advice",Fabuts,cscareerquestions,"I’m looking for advice on how I should proceed moving forward, while giving some context on the “untraditional” path I took to get here.* 2021: Full-stack coding bootcamp* 2021–2022: Worked 1 year as a web dev/front-end dev* 2025: Graduated with a BS in CS from WGU’s online universityI’ve been applying for the past several months, sending probably around 200+ applications so far, with only 1 phone interview and 2 recorded video interviews. The last job took me 400 apps in 2021 so I already know this isn't that many applications considering the current market. I’ve mainly been applying on LinkedIn and have been using Simplify to fill out applications.I realize I’m slowly falling apart because there’s a lot going on in my mind. I honestly feel like I’m not even that great of a developer yet. I spent so much time trying to rush my degree and focused on sending applications that I realized I’ve started to get worse at coding. I’m considering pursuing an OMSCS through Georgia Tech, but I’m not sure if a master’s degree is worth it right now. It would allow me to learn more, possibly specialize in ML/AI, and apply for internships. Admittingly it would also allow me to redirect my mental burden of job apps towards something else. On the other hand I might be spending more time and money for little to no difference.Typing this out I realize I should probably at least spend my time re-learning some of the things I’ve forgotten while building out some more projects. If anyone has any insight or a different job search approach they’d recommend I’d really appreciate it.

1qe5sth,Failed Amazon Final Loop - my experience,MemoryNeat7381,cscareerquestions,"This was for Delivery Consultant. My understanding, is that it's like a consulting arm of AWS where consultant go to clients and act as temporary employees more or less.Have 5YOE, been out of work for a year. Just got the AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification and then applied to the role. 2 months ago, contacted by recruiter after applcation and passed OA. My recruiter asked me to prep 10 STAR stories as well as LeetCode and to wait 3 weeks before scheduling the phone screen which I thought was overkill, but could appreciate that she wanted me to be as prepped as possible. Phone screen was with a chill friendly guy I believe one of the hiring managers for this department. We did 1 STAR with some follow ups, as well as a AWS system design problem which went over smoothly, and then a basic coding challenge which was easy to complete. He hinted that I would be moving forward, which I did 2 days later. Scheduled the final loop for a month right after the holidays.1st interview guy seemed chill and only asked LPs. Ended 15 min early.2nd interview, was with a woman who at end informed me she was not part of this department (so the bar raiser), had a friendly introduction. Again, only LPs where she did some follow up, but no hardcore grilling. Ended about 20 minutes early.3rd interview, was the hiring manager who also did only LPs with me. Again follow ups which I answered, but was prepared for. Halfway through the interview, she all of a sudden asks, you have experience working in small teams, but tell me about roles with big teams and organizations. I was a little off guard and asked if we were still doing the STAR format. She said if I wanted to. I gave a brief story about 3 years of my experience working at a large telecomm comapny (which I already answered with STAR stories from), and mentioned about the dozens of teams I interacted with, and how I worked in a major lift and shift project with microservices with over 50 services and 200 people. She went on and said how as an L5 they were looking for someone with experience leading large organizations, etc. even though at the beginning she said the role varies a lot (startups, large companies, short term and long term contracts) She then asked me the final LP. I asked if she wanted as story from the telecomm company. She glared at the screen and sharply answered ""sure"". I wasn't sure if this was hostility, or her following interview protocol, but I just mentioned I didnt have any stories left that I havent told her or answer that question, so I talked about one from my 1st job at a 6 person startup. At the end, she did a q and a, and then just said my recruiter would be the point of contact from now on. Again, didnt really read into it, but everyone else just mentioned ""oh, you got 3 interviews left, good luck"" or somethign like that. Ended 20 min early.4th interview next day, was friendly guy who did 1 LP, followed by some Leetcode. The coding was quite easy (easy/medium) and didn't really have much issues other than some syntax (like making sure 'self' was used when setting up the function). He was friendly and enthusiastic about me getting the optimal solutions. Ended on time.5th interview the following day was chill guy who did a few LP in the first half. The second half was a barrage of questions in sytem design. I got maybe 75% of them, especially the ones I remember from my SA Pro cert. The ones I didn't, he assured me it was ok, nobody gets them all. But who knows, maybe I missed some that I shouldn't have. We only had a minute left at the end for q and a, but he was willing to stay a bit overtime to answer questions for me.Next day, get the automated reject email. If I were to guess, it might have somethign to do with the 3rd interview with the hiring manager. From what I've read, most people feel they do well on their LPs, but who knows, maybe I didn't. I prepped the 10 STAR stories, and didn't reuse them for the same interviewer, but maybe I needed more across all of them? Researching, I've heard varying opinions. Finally, I dunno if I was just outclassed by another candidate or an internal candidate I don't know about.

1qhyrob,Internal Transfer from Google to DeepMind,scenetaec,cscareerquestions,"Hey, I’m joining Google as a new grad and wanted to get some perspective on how feasible it is to internally transfer to DeepMind down the line, ideally as an ML or Research Engineer.During my internship, I met some absolute outliers from GDM, but also plenty of solid, “normal” smart folks. Overall, the distribution of talent didn’t seem any different from my own team, which made me wonder whether an internal transfer might be more realistic than I initially thought.I’ll be starting on an AI-related (but non-research) team in a different product area. The office I’m joining has a fairly strong GDM presence.I did CS with Math in undergrad with a focus on probabilistic ML, and I have one publication in a top AI journal (not first author).For folks who’ve seen or gone through this process:* How rare are internal transfers to GDM? Do you need to be absolutely exceptional?* Beyond strong feedback in my current role, what tends to matter most? * Internal ML work (e.g., 20% project with GDM) * Being active in research communities again * Kaggle or other ML side projects * Internal networking and referralsAny advice & anecdotes would be really appreciated.

I have decided for myself that I will stick with my passions for SWE but I'd love to get some advice or hear some other people's opinions.For some background, I'm a junior in a university that is not the best for CS and I have had 0 internships so far. My dreams were to be a SWE ever since I started coding in highschool in 2022.My second semester in college (2024) I started doing research with a CS professor that I liked and have continued it ever since. During my time at university, I also developed and published a Google Chrome extension, mainly to make life easier, and also a VSCode extension, for my professor's research.I also love using Django and have built several full stack web apps (although mainly CRUD). But, I have never deployed something other than on a web service platform like Vercel, Onrender, or Heroku. I'm aware that most of the web apps I build are not scalable and will most likely break if more than 1,000 requests hit an endpoint at once. I also know some things like CI/CD or unit tests are very important for real world projects but I've always thought those things are experiences gained at an internship.I have started applying to internships ever since I was a sophomore and I also attended a career fair last year in the spring. I only started keeping track at the start of my junior year and so far I have more or less applied to 150 intern positions. Only had 2 companies (one small, one medium sized) reach out after for an interview after the OA, but I most likely bombed both because there were no responses after. I know AI is having a big impact on the job market and there are also layoffs happening in tech companies, but I also know several people who still landed internships at Meta and even Google.So, I just wanted to know if anybody could recommend some strategies to stand out more as an applicant or just give some basic advice on my next steps.

1qggf3o,.NET Developer - Feedback on what to do next,whisperingdeath7,cscareerquestions,"I am primarily a .NET Developer (MVC) with Javascript/jQuery experience. I have been doing this for 20 years plus a bunch of Sitecore implementations for 10 years until 2018. I completely missed the cloud boat and now the AI race because of the kind of jobs I had and just not paying attention in general. I have a bunch of other knowledge/experience - Tableau/PowerBI, SQL, basic DevOps, etc. - all of which usually comes with setting up .NET solutions. I tried my hand at Product Owner/Product Manager short stints at my company but that doesn't go anywhere with hiring freeze and budget cuts. I am looking to stick to my technical roots and gain some experience in Cloud (AWS since that's what my company uses) and AI implementations by implementing my ideas.I have been looking into AWS designing an app that I am trying to build. For AI, I don't even know where to begin. Do I pay attention to things such as Claude Code and Cursor? Where do I start with them? I prefer learning the details of any technology I want to work with before picking up such tools but they seem to be becoming mainstream and my company has released restricted versions of Claude/Nova chatbots which are amazing when prompted correctly but my knowledge outside of that is zero.Please roast me asl to how much of deep trouble I am in and what I can do to improve my skills.",5,0.79,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qggf3o/net_developer_feedback_on_what_to_do_next/,2026-01-18 18:35:14,2026-01-21 01:54:25

1qd1cy2,Company Emphasizes LLM Usage,Psycho351,cscareerquestions,"Please redirect me if my post should not be here. Roughly a week ago I interviewed with a company over an onsite entry level SWE role. The role requires me to relocate, they did not provide compensation but swears it is generous if given the role. Whether or not I receive the offer, I do not know how to reflect on my experience post-interview. The “interview” was not technical, but seemed to be more vibes-based. An emphasis on culture I suppose, but not necessarily triggering any alarm bells in my head. The description notes a requirement for prior LLM-usage/experience. I’m not against AI-assisted coding, but I do not like vibe coding. If you do it, cool, but it’s not for me. I’m worried that’s what they want from me. The job is advertised as just mostly prompting, and then cleaning up the output, and I’m not sure if this is common practice nowadays. I know this isn’t a new approach for a company to adopt, but if I get the role it will be my first FT SWE position barring an internship I had a couple years prior. Given this, I want to ensure this is a role I can grow in and actually learn. Another thing they emphasize is how they want to go all-in on AI. I’m no doomer, but I do think a bubble will pop at some point, and I don’t want to be left on the short end of the stick here. Do any of you have jobs like this? What is it like? Is it worth moving across the country for if compensated fairly? In all honesty, the job description read like a joke to me and the interview was extremely simple. If I get no offer I’ll probably be offended lol. But if I do get one, I’m not even sure if it’s the right choice. I want to be able to reflect on this interview, but I’m not sure what lessons I should bring with me.",4,0.67,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qd1cy2/company_emphasizes_llm_usage/,2026-01-14 22:20:08,2026-01-21 01:54:25

However, whenever I apply to new positions, I notice that it is incredibly difficult to get interviews. I currently have 4 YOE as a data scientist and/or an MLE.I want to eventually land a role in big tech or big tech adjacent. I feel like having a masters would open a lot of doors here for me. I know it isn't a guaranteed thing that I'd get a job, but I'd at least like to start getting interviews at the companies I want to eventually work at.I do want to say: I am pretty happy with my job (recently got hired by the previously mentioned large company), but I want to shoot for the stars here and grow. The only reason I was able to get this position was due to a referral from someone high up in the org.So my question is: do I get my masters degree in computer science or not?

1qfhif8,Considering switching from mid backend developer to junior data engineer,beyond98,cscareerquestions,"Hi CSCQ!I'm a Spanish developer with 4 years of experience, mainly focused on backend development with Kotlin and Spring Boot over the past two years. In my last job, I was also the main maintainer of an Apache Spark job written in Scala, but it was a small daily job that didn’t process “big data,” since we didn’t have a large data volume.Nowadays, I’m approaching 5 months of unemployment. I was laid off from a small consultancy that relied too heavily on a single client, which is currently going through a major layoff. Before cutting internal staff, they terminated contracts with external collaborators like me, and my company couldn’t reassign me to another project.From what I’m seeing, the market is tougher than I expected. It’s hard to find a position that pays at least what I earned in my previous job. While backend development—especially Java/Spring Boot—still seems in demand, it also feels more saturated than data engineering.I know I don’t yet have enough experience to apply for mid-level data engineering roles, but I’d be willing to take a pay cut for a junior remote position, as I believe it’s a better-paid career path in the long run.Thanks in advance for your advice!",6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1qfhif8/considering_switching_from_mid_backend_developer/,2026-01-17 16:23:49,2026-01-21 01:54:25
