1pcl7on,Taking 165k Offer Over 175k Offer,Dense_Car_591,dataengineering,"Hi all,I made a post a while back agonizing whether or not to take a 175k DE II offer at an allegedly toxic company. Wanted to say thank you to everyone in this community for all the helpful advice, comments, and DMs. I ended up rejecting the 175k offer and opted to complete the final round with the second company mentioned in the previous post. Well, I just got the verbal offer! Culture and WLB is reportedly very strong but the biggest factor was that everyone I talked to from peers to potential manager all seemed like people I could enjoy working with 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. Offer Breakdown: fully remote, 145k base, 10% bonus, 14k stock over 4 years First year TC: 165.1k due to stock vesting structure To try to pay forward all the help from this sub, I wanted to share all the things that worked for me during this job hunt. 1. Targeting DE roles that had near 100% tech stack alignment. So for me: Python, SQL, AWS, Airflow, Databricks, Terraform. Nowadays, both recruiters and HMs seem to really try to find candidates with experience in most, if not all tools they use, especially when comparing to my previous job hunts. Drawback is smaller application shotgun blast radius into the void, esp if you are cold applying like I did. 2. Leetcode, unfortunately. I practiced medium-hard questions for SQL and did light prep for DSA (using Python). List, string, dict, stack and queue, 2-pointer easy-medium was enough to get by for the companies I interviewed at but ymmv. Setting a timer and verbalizing my thought process helped for the real thing. 3. Rereading Kimball’s Data Warehouse Toolkit. I read thru the first 4 chapters then cherry picked a few later chapters for scenario based data modeling topics. Once I finished reading and taking notes, I went to ChatGPT and asked it to simulate acting as an interviewer for a data modeling round. This helped me bounce ideas back and forth, especially for domains I had zero familiarity in. 4. Behavioral Prep. Each quarter at my job, I keep a note of all the projects of value I either led or completed and with details like design, stakeholders involved, stats whether it is cost saved or dataset % adoption within org etc, and business results. This helped me organize 5-6 stories that I would use to answer any behavioral question that came my way without too much hesitation or stuttering. For interviewers who dug deeply into the engineering aspect, reviewing topology diagrams and the codebase helped a lot for that aspect. 5. Last but not least, showing excitement over the role and company. I am not too keen on sucking up to strangers or act like a certain product got me geeking but I think it helps when you can show reasons why the role/company/product has some kind of professional or personal connection to you. That’s all I could think of. Shoutout again to all the nice people on this sub for the helpful comments and DMs from earlier!",177,0.93,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pcl7on/taking_165k_offer_over_175k_offer/,2025-12-02 21:32:25,2025-12-06 01:38:46
1pcmtm4,Got a 100% Salary Raise Overnight. Now I Have to Lead Data Engineering. Am I Preparing Right?,ok_pineapple_ok,dataengineering,"Hey everyone,I need some advice on a big career shift that just landed on me.I’ve been working at the same company for almost 20 years. Started here at 20, small town, small company, great culture. I’m a traditional data-warehousing person — SQL, ETL, Informatica, DataStage, ODI, PL/SQL, that whole world. My role is Senior Data Engineer, but I talk directly to the CIO because it’s that kind of company. They trust me, I know everyone, and the work-life balance has always been great (never more than 8 hours a day).Recently we acquired another company whose entire data stack is modern cloud: Snowflake, AWS, Git, CI/CD, onboarding systems to the cloud, etc.While I was having lunch, the CIO came to me and basically said:“You’re leading the new cloud data engineering area. Snowflake, AWS, CI/CD. We trust you. You’ll do great. Here’s a 100% salary increase.”No negotiation. Just: This is yours now.He promised the workload won’t be crazy — maybe a few 9–10 hour days in the first six months, then stable again. And he genuinely believes I’m the best person to take this forward.I’m excited but also aware that the tech jump is huge. I want to prepare properly, and the CIO can’t really help with technical questions right now because it’s all new to him too.My plan so far:Learn Snowflake deeply (warehousing concepts + Snowflake specifics)Then study for AWS certifications — maybe Developer Associate or Solutions Architect Associate, so I have a structure to learn. Not necessarily do the certs.Learn modern practices: Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, etc.)My question:Is this the right approach?If you were in my shoes, how would you prepare for leading a modern cloud data engineering function?Any advice from people who moved from traditional ETL into cloud data engineering would be appreciated.",142,0.94,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pcmtm4/got_a_100_salary_raise_overnight_now_i_have_to/,2025-12-02 22:34:58,2025-12-06 01:38:46
1pdtovo,Is data engineering becoming the most important layer in modern tech stacks,TheTeamBillionaire,dataengineering,I have been noticing something interesting across teams and projects. No matter how much hype we hear about AI cloud or analytics everything eventually comes down to one thing the strength of the data engineering work behind it.Clean data reliable pipelines good orchestration and solid governance seem to decide whether an entire project succeeds or fails. Some companies are now treating data engineering as a core product team instead of just backend support which feels like a big shift.I am curious how others here see this trend.

1pf455n,The Fabric push is burning me out,SignalMine594,dataengineering,"Just a Friday rant…I’ve worked on a bunch of data platforms over the years, and lately it’s getting harder to stay motivated and just do the job. When Fabric first showed up at my company, I was pumped. It looked cool and felt like it might clean up a lot of the junk I was dealing with. Now it just feels like it’s being shoved into everything, even when it shouldn’t fit, or can’t fit.All the public articles and blogs I see talk about it like it’s already this solid, all-in-one thing, but using it feels nothing like that. I get random errors out of nowhere, and stuff breaks for reasons nobody can explain. It makes me waste hours to debug just to see if I ran into a new bug, an old bug, or “that’s just how it is.” It’s exhausting me, and leadership thinks my team is just incompetent because we can’t get it working reliably (Side note: if your team is hiring, I'm looking to jump).But what’s been getting to me is how the conversation online has shifted. More Fabric folks and partner types jump into threads on Reddit acting like none of these problems are a big deal. Everything seems to be brushed off as “coming soon” or “it’s still new,” even though it’s been around for two years and half the features have GA labels slapped on them. It often feels like we get lectured for expecting basic things to work.I don’t mind a platform having some rough edges. Butt I *do* mind being pushed into something that still doesn’t feel ready, especially by sales teams talking like it’s already perfect, especially when we all know that the product keeps missing simple stuff you need to run something in production. I get that there’s a quota, but I promise I/my company would spend more if there was practical and realistic guidance and not just feel cornered into whatever product uplift they get on broken feature.And since Ignite, the whole AI angle just makes it messier. I keep asking how we’re supposed to do GenAI inside Fabric, there are lots of, “go look at Azure AI Foundry” or “go look at Azure AI Studio.” Or now this IQ stuff that’s like 3 different products, all called IQ. It feels like both everything and nothing at all are in Fabric? It just feels like a weird split between Data and AI at Microsoft, like they’re shipping whatever their org chart looks like instead of a real platform.Honestly, I get why people like Joe Reis lose it online about this stuff. At some point I just want a straight conversation about what actually works and what doesn’t, and how I can do my job well, instead of just getting into petty arguments",102,0.99,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pf455n/the_fabric_push_is_burning_me_out/,2025-12-05 19:24:32,2025-12-06 01:38:46

1pbiodi,I spent 6 months fighting kafka for ml pipelines and finally rage quit the whole thing,gurudakku,dataengineering,"Our recommendation model training pipeline became this kafka/spark nightmare nobody wanted to touch. Data sat in queues for HOURS. Lost events when kafka decided to rebalance (constantly). Debugging which service died was ouija board territory. One person on our team basically did kafka ops full time which is insane.The ""exactly-once semantics""? That was a lie. Found duplicates constantly, maybe we configured wrong but after 3 weeks of trying we gave up. Said screw it and rebuilt everything simpler.Ditched kafka entirely, we went with nats for messaging, services pull at own pace so no backpressure disasters. Custom go services instead of spark because spark was 90% overhead for what we needed and cut airflow for most things, use scheduled messages. Some results after 4 months: latency 3-4 hours to 45 minutes, zero lost messages, infrastructure costs down 40%.I know kafka has its place. For us it was like using cargo ship to cross a river, way overkill and operational complexity made everything worse not better.

On the other hand, this direction is slightly easier and little more interesting to me and maybe business communication skills will be more valuable in the future than technical skills.The Data Engineer path, however, is more technically demanding, but the long-term benefits seem much greater - better pay, more opportunities, lower risk of being replaced by AI and more technical skill development.Please don’t reply with “just do what you like,” because I’ve spent several years in a dead-end job and at the end of the day, work is work.I’m just a junior with only a few days of experience who already has to make an important decision, so I'm sorry if these questions are stupid.",21,0.78,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pc7mkw/first_week_at_work_and_first_decision_data/,2025-12-02 12:51:21,2025-12-06 01:38:46

And even if they were, I rarely hear the explanation for changes in Microsoft ""strategic"" direction. So that is why I rely on reddit for technical questions like this. I think enough time has elapsed since it happened, so I'm hoping the reason has become common knowledge by now. (.. although the explanation is not known to me yet).

Now it is a year later and I'm waiting five mins for a sluggish ""custom Spark pool"" to be initialized on Fabric, and I can't help but think that Microsoft BI folks have really lost their way! I totally understand that Microsoft can get higher margins by pushing their ""Fabric"" SaaS at the expense of their PaaS services like HDI. However I think that building HDI on AKS was a great opportunity to innovate with containerized Spark. Once finished, it may have been an even more compelling and cost-effective than Spark on Databricks! And eventually they could have shared the technology with their downstream SaaS products like Fabric, for the sake of their lower-code users as well!Does anyone understand this?

1p9x52g,Stuck on incremental ETL for a very normalised dataset (multi-hop relationships). Has anyone solved this before?,Dry-Woodpecker9626,dataengineering,"Hey folks,I have an extremely normalised dataset. Way more than I personally like. Imagine something like:movie → version → presentation → external\_idsBut none of the child tables store the movie\_id. Everything is connected through these relationship tables, and you have to hop 3–4 tables to get anything meaningful.Here’s a small example:* movies(movie\_id)* versions(version\_id)* presentations(pres\_id)* external\_ids(ext\_id)  Relationship goesMovie → version → presentation → external\_idI am trying to achieve a denormalised version of this table, like smaller data marts, which makes my life easier for sharing the data downstream. This is just one of the examples; my goal is to create smaller such data marts, so it is easier for me to join on this ID later to get the data I need for downstream consumersA normal full query is fine — Example SELECT  m.movie_id, v.version_id,  p.pres_id,  e.value FROM movies m JOIN movie_to_version mv ON m.movie_id = mv.movie_id JOIN versions v ON mv.version_id = v.version_id JOIN version_to_pres vp ON v.version_id = vp.version_id JOIN presentations p ON vp.pres_id = p.pres_id JOIN pres_to_external pe ON p.pres_id = pe.pres_id JOIN external_ids e ON pe.ext_id = e.ext_id; The actual pain is incremental loading. Like, let’s say something small changes in external\_ids. The row with ext\_id = 999 has been updated.I’d have to basically walk backwards:ext → pres → version → movieThis is just a sample example, in reality, I have more complex cascading joins, I am currently looking at in future around 100 tables to join, not all together, just in all, to create smaller denormalised tables, which I can later use as an intermediate silver layer to create my final gold layer.Also, I need to send incremental changes updated to the downstream database as well, that's another pain in the ass.I’ve thought about:– just doing the reverse join logic inside every dimension (sounds nasty) – maintaining some lineage table like child\_id → movie\_id – or prebuilding a flattened table that basically stores all the hops, so the downstream tables don’t have to deal with the graphBut honestly, I don’t know if I’m overcomplicating it or missing some obvious pattern.

They mentioned that repartitioning decreased the run time drastically by 60% for joins. And it made me wonder, why that would be because:1. Without explocit repartitioning, Spark would still do shuffle exchange to bring the date on executor, the same operation which a repartition would have triggered, so moving it up the chain shouldn't make much difference to speed?2. Though, I can see the value where after repartitioning we cache the data and use it in more joins ( in seperate action), as Spark native engine wouldn't cache or persist repartitioning, is this right assumption?So, I am trying to understand in which scenarios doing repartitioning would beat Sparks catalyst native repartitioning?",11,0.87,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pcm5gp/when_to_repartition_on_apache_spark/,2025-12-02 22:08:44,2025-12-06 01:38:46

1pckc1u,The `metadata lake` pattern is growing on me. Here's why.,Hefty-Citron2066,dataengineering,"Been doing data engineering for a while now and wanted to share some thoughts on a pattern I've been seeing more of.**TL;DR:** Instead of trying to consolidate all your data into one platform (which never actually works), there's a growing movement to federate metadata instead. The ""metadata lake"" concept. After being skeptical, I'm starting to think this is the right approach for most orgs.## The pattern that keeps repeatingEvery company I've worked at has gone through the same cycle:1. Start with one data platform (Hadoop, Snowflake, Databricks, whatever)2. A different team needs something the main platform doesn't do well3. They spin up their own thing (separate warehouse, different catalog, etc.)4. Now you have two data platforms5. Leadership says ""we need to consolidate""6. Migration project starts, takes forever, never finishes7. Meanwhile a third platform gets added for ML or streaming8. RepeatSound familiar? I've seen this at three different companies now. The consolidation never actually happens because:- Migrations are expensive and risky- Different tools really are better for different workloads- Teams have opinions and organizational capital to protect their choices- By the time you finish migrating, something new has come along## The alternative: federate the metadataI've been reading about and experimenting with the ""metadata lake"" approach. The idea is:- Accept that you'll have multiple data platforms- Don't try to move the data- Instead, create a unified layer that federates the metadata- Apply governance and discovery at that layerThe key insight is that data is expensive to move but metadata is cheap. You can't easily migrate petabytes of data from Snowflake to Databricks, but you can absolutely sync the schema information, ownership, lineage, and access policies.## Tools in this spaceThe main open source option I've found is Apache Gravitino (https://github.com/apache/gravitino). It's an Apache TLP that does catalog federation. You point it at your existing catalogs (Hive, Iceberg, Kafka schema registry, JDBC sources) and it presents them through unified APIs.What I like about it:- Doesn't require migration, works with what you have- Supports both tabular and non-tabular data (filesets, message topics)- Governance policies apply across all federated catalogs- Vendor neutral, Apache licensed- The team behind it has serious credentials (Apache Spark, Hadoop committers)GitHub: https://github.com/apache/gravitino (2.3k stars)There's also a good article explaining the philosophy: https://medium.com/datastrato/if-youre-not-all-in-on-databricks-why-metadata-freedom-matters-35cc5b15b24e## My POC experienceRan a quick POC federating our Hive metastore, an Iceberg catalog, and Kafka schema registry. Took about 3 hours to set up. The unified view is genuinely useful. I can see tables, topics, and schemas all in one place with consistent APIs.The cross-catalog queries work but I'd still recommend keeping hot path queries within single systems. The value is more in discovery, governance, and breaking down silos than in making cross-system joins performant.## When this makes sense- You have data spread across multiple platforms (most enterprises)- Consolidation has failed or isn't realistic- You need unified governance but can't force everyone onto one tool- You're multi-cloud and want to avoid vendor lock-in- You have both batch and streaming data that need to be discoverable## When it might not- You're a startup that can actually standardize on one platform- Your data volumes are small enough that migration is feasible- You don't have governance or discovery problems yet## Questions for the community1. Has anyone else moved toward this federated metadata approach? What's your experience?2. Are there other tools in this space I should be looking at? I know DataHub and Atlan exist but they feel more like discovery tools than unified metadata layers.3. For those who successfully consolidated onto one platform, how did you actually do it?

1pdfkd0,Who should manage Airflow in small but growing company?,Jaded_Bar_9951,dataengineering,"Hi,I'm 26 and I just graduated in Data Science. Two months ago I started working in a small but growing company as a mix Data Engineer/Data Scientist. Basically, now I'm making order in their data, writing different pipelines to do stuff (I know it's super generic, but it's not the point of the post). To schedule the pipelines, I decided to use Airflow. I'm not a pro, but I'm trying to read stuff and watch as many videos as I can about best practices and so on to do things well. The thing is that my company outsourced the management of the IT infrastructure to another and even smaller company, which made sense in the past because my company was small and they didn't need the control, nor did they have IT figures in the company. Now things are changing, and they have started to build a small IT department to do different stuff. To install Airflow on our servers, I had to pass through this company, which I mean, I understand and it was ok. The IT company knew nothing about Airflow, it was the first time for them and they needed a looooot of time to read everything they could and install it ""safely"". The problem is that now they don't let me do the most basic stuff without passing through them, like make a little change in the config file (lfor example, adding the SMTP server for the emails) or install python packages, not even restart Airflow. Every time I need to open a ticket and wait, wait, wait. It happened in the past that airflow had some problems and I had to tell them how to fix them, because they didn't let me do it. I asked many times the permission to do these basic operations, and they told me that they don't want to allow me to do it because they have the responsibility of the correct functioning of the software, and if I touch it they cant guarantee it. I told them that I know what i'm doing, and there is no risk at all. Furthermore, most of the things that I do are BI stuff, so it's just querying operational databases and make some transformations on the data, the worst thing that can happen is that one day I don't deliver a dataset or a dashboard because airflow blocks, but nothing worse can happen. This situation is very frustrating for me because I feel stuck many times, and it annoys me a lot to wait for the most basic and stupid operations. A colleague of mine told me that I have a lot to do, and in the meantime I can work on other tasks.

1pcb6u8,Built an ADBC driver for Exasol in Rust with Apache Arrow support,marco_nae,dataengineering,"**Built an ADBC driver for Exasol in Rust with Apache Arrow support**I've been learning Rust for a while now, and after building a few CLI tools, I wanted to tackle something meatier. So I built `exarrow-rs` \- an ADBC-compatible database driver for Exasol that uses Apache Arrow's columnar format.**What is it?**It's essentially a bridge between Exasol databases and the Arrow ecosystem. Instead of row-by-row data transfer (which is slow for analytical queries), it uses Arrow's columnar format to move data efficiently. The driver implements the ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity) standard, which is like ODBC/JDBC but designed around Arrow from the ground up.**The interesting bits:*** Built entirely async on Tokio - the driver communicates with Exasol over WebSockets (using their native WebSocket API)* Type-safe parameter binding using Rust's type system* Comprehensive type mapping between Exasol's SQL types and Arrow types (including fun edge cases like `DECIMAL(p)` → `Decimal256`)* C FFI layer so it works with the ADBC driver manager, meaning you can load it dynamically from other languages**Caveat:**It uses the latest WebSockets API of Exasol since Exasol does not support Arrow natively, yet. So currently, it is converting Json responses into Arrow batches. See [exasol/websocket-api](https://github.com/exasol/websocket-api) for more details on Exasol WebSockets.**The learning experience:**The hardest part was honestly getting the async WebSocket communication right while maintaining ADBC's synchronous-looking API. Also, Arrow's type system is... extensive. Mapping SQL types to Arrow types taught me a lot about both ecosystems.**What is Exasol?**Exasol Analytics Engine is a high-performance, in-memory engine designed for near real-time analytics, data warehousing, and AI/ML workloads.Exasol is obviously an enterprise product, BUT it has a free Docker version which is pretty fast. And they offer a free personal edition for deployment in the Cloud in case you hit the limits of your laptop.**The project**It's MIT licensed and community-maintained. It is not officially maintained by Exasol! Would love feedback, especially from folks who've worked with Arrow or built database drivers before.What gotchas should I watch out for? Any ADBC quirks I should know about?Also happy to answer questions about Rust async patterns, Arrow integration, or Exasol in general!",9,0.91,1,https://github.com/marconae/exarrow-rs,2025-12-02 15:22:19,2025-12-06 01:38:46

My long-term goal over the next 2–4 years is to become a Data Engineer. The question is: should I follow the Data/Product Analyst → Analytics Engineer → Data Engineer path, or skip straight to Analytics Engineer → Data Engineer?**Context:**I’m a CS dropout with 9–10 years of SaaS consulting experience, where roughly half my work involved analysis (SQL, Excel, product analysis). I’ve always gravitated toward data, and that curiosity pushed me into big data engineering. I completed a 6-month live course on PySpark along with several others. I’m also completing my degree online to close the non-degree gap.My Tech Stack:1. SQL2. Python3. PySpark4. AWS5. Data WarehousingI can solve about 6/10 LeetCode problems on my own and improving steadily. I’ve built multiple projects involving API data ingestion, database creation, and EDA. I’m comfortable with GitHub.I don’t rely on ChatGPT for coding, I’m old-school about writing my own solutions. I mainly use LLMs to understand bugs faster than digging through StackOverflow.Earlier Guidance from others has made me realize I can’t jump directly into a DE role because I lack production-level experience, so the “right” path should be Data Analyst first, then transition.**The problem:**The DA market is extremely saturated. Every posting gets 10–15K applications, and realistically, I’m not competitive right now on paper. I’ve done the whole drill - no movement. I’ve been jobless for over a year, and I’m desperate at this point.**My concern/dilemma:**Given that my end goal is DE, should I really stick to the DA/PA → AE → DE route, or should I bypass DA entirely and aim for AE → DE? If I do land a DA job, I’ll have to go through another full transition again, whereas AE → DE is almost a direct pipeline.A lot of this dilemma comes from the fact that I’m not even getting any calls for DA roles because the market is congested and full of scams/fake hiring. If I were getting traction, I would’ve followed the original plan.But since I’m getting nowhere, should I aim directly for AE instead? I genuinely like the AE toolset- dbt, Snowflake, data modeling, that’s the direction I want to go.I’m just unsure whether hiring managers would consider me for an AE role purely based on my projects and skills, given that I don’t yet have production experience. What if I face same issue in AE and be back to square one after spending 3-4 month learning and applying. Should I just stick to DA/PA and keep applying.

1pbro6t,Kimball Confusion - Semi Additive vs Fully Additive Facts,Interesting_Wind2512,dataengineering,"Hi!So I am finally getting around to reading the Data Warehouse Toolkit by Ralph Kimball and I'm confused. I have reached Chapter 4: Inventory, which includes the following ERD for an example on periodic snapshot facts. https://preview.redd.it/tfxpmlj27o4g1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=115f322cd498649895da55f8b01f69e3212b80c1In this section, he describes all facts in this table except for 'Quantity on Hand' as fully additive:>Notice that quantity on hand is semi-additive, but the other measures in the enhanced periodic snapshot are all fully additive. The quantity sold amount has been rolled up to the snapshot’s daily granularity. The valuation columns are extended, additive amounts. In some periodic snapshot inventory schemas, it is useful to store the beginning balance, the inventory change or delta, along with the ending balance. In this scenario, the balances are again semi-additive, whereas the deltas are fully additive across all the dimensionsHowever, this seems incorrect? 'Inventory Dollar Value at Cost' and 'Inventory Value at Latest Selling Price' sound like balances to me, which are not additive across time and therefore they would be semi-additive facts. For further context here is Kimball's exact wording on the differences: >The numeric measures in a fact table fall into three categories. The most flexible and useful facts are *fully additive*; additive measures can be summed across any of the dimensions associated with the fact table. *Semi-additive* measures can be summed across some dimensions, but not all; balance amounts are common semi-additive facts because they are additive across all dimensions **except time**. The only way this seems to make sense is that these are supposed to be deltas, where the first record in the table has a 'starting value' that reflects the initial balance and then each day the snapshot would capture the change in each of those balances, but that seems like an odd design choice to me, and if so the naming of the columns doesn't do a good job of describing that. Am I missing something or is Kimball contradicting himself here?",4,0.83,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1pbro6t/kimball_confusion_semi_additive_vs_fully_additive/,2025-12-01 22:56:23,2025-12-06 01:38:46
1pblo83,"Am I doing session modeling wrong, or is everyone quietly suffering too?",Nero-Azzuro,dataengineering,"Our data is sessionized. Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity, so far so good. However:* About 2% of sessions cross midnight;* ‘Stable’ attributes like device… change anyway (trust issues, anyone?);* There is no expiration time, so sessions could, in theory, go on forever (of course we find those somewhere, sometime…).We process hundreds of millions of events daily using dbt with incremental tables and insert-overwrites. Sessions spanning multiple days now start to conspire and ruin our pipelines.A single session can look different depending on the day we process it. Example:* On Day X, a session might touch marketing channels A and B;* After crossing midnight, on Day X+1 it hits channel C;* On day X+1 we won’t know the full list of channels touched previously, unless we reach back to day X’s data first.Same with devices: Day X sees A + B; Day X+1 sees C. Each batch only sees its own slice, so no run has the full picture. Looking back an extra day just shifts the problem, since sessions can always start the day before.Looking back at prior days feels like a backfill nightmare come true, yet every discussion keeps circling back to the same question: how do you handle sessions that span multiple days?I feel like I’m missing a clean, practical approach.

A few weeks ago I shared Rigatoni, my CDC framework in Rust. I just published comprehensive benchmarks and the results are interesting! TL;DR Performance: \- \~780ns per event for core processing (linear scaling up to 10K events) \- \~1.2μs per event for JSON serialization \- 7.65ms to write 1,000 events to S3 with ZSTD compression \- Production throughput: 10K-100K events/sec \- \~2ns per event for operation filtering (essentially free) Most Interesting Findings: 1. ZSTD wins across the board: 14% faster than GZIP and 33% faster than uncompressed JSON for S3 writes 2. Batch size is forgiving: Minimal latency differences between 100-2000 event batches (<10% variance) 3. Concurrency sweet spot: 2 concurrent S3 writes = 99% efficiency, 4 = 61%, 8+ = diminishing returns 4. Filtering is free: Operation type filtering costs \~2ns per event - use it liberally! 5. Deduplication overhead: Only +30% overhead for exactly-once semantics, consistent across batch sizes Benchmark Setup: \- Built with [Criterion.rs](http://Criterion.rs) for statistical analysis \- LocalStack for S3 testing (eliminates network variance) \- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions \- Detailed HTML reports with regression detection The benchmarks helped me identify optimal production configurations: Pipeline::builder().batch\_size(500) // Sweet spot.batch\_timeout(50) // ms.max\_concurrent\_writes(3) // Optimal S3 concurrency.build() Architecture: Rigatoni is built on Tokio with async/await, supports MongoDB change streams → S3 (JSON/Parquet/Avro), Redis state store for distributed deployments, and Prometheus metrics. What I Tested: \- Batch processing across different sizes (10-10K events) \- Serialization formats (JSON, Parquet, Avro) \- Compression methods (ZSTD, GZIP, none) \- Concurrent S3 writes and throughput scaling \- State management and memory patterns \- Advanced patterns (filtering, deduplication, grouping) :bar_chart: Full benchmark report: [https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance](https://valeriouberti.github.io/rigatoni/performance) :crab: Source code: [https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni](https://github.com/valeriouberti/rigatoni)Happy to discuss the methodology, trade-offs, or answer questions about CDC architectures in Rust!For those who missed the original post: Rigatoni is a framework for streaming MongoDB change events to S3 with configurable batching, multiple serialization formats, and compression.

It's honestly driving me crazy during projects; they finish complex tasks in a few lines of Python while I'm still dealing with C++ boilerplate, but I also don't want to lose my C++ process. They say that the future is in Python and C+ + is only required for systems.I know I need to be versatile, but is their advice valid?

I've decided to stop worrying about the gap and finally get back into the saddle to break my impostor syndrome.My goal is to build a portfolio of 2–3 solid projects to prove (to myself and employers) that I can still write code. I’m looking for some feedback and/or suggestions on a learning path.As it stands, I have familiarity with the following programming languages and will list my strength/capability with said languages:Python: 8/10 - I can confidently write most things in Python and I think the only thing that I would need to re-visit are some OOP concepts and other small nuances given that most OOP I did during my undergraduate years were done in Java. I've tinkered with (but could never really finish or grasp) Pythonic frameworks like Flask and Django, and that's as far as I've ever went project-wise with the language. Can say without a doubt it's my strongest language. I have some books like *Fluent Python 2nd Edition, Django 4 By Example 4th Edition,* that I bought a year or so ago; was wondering if they're still relevant or have become outdated. What other books or resources would you recommend?Java: 5/10 - It's been a *whileeeeeee* since I wrote anything in Java, but a lot of job descriptions I've seen for listings in my area have things like Java Spring and Spring Boot which have roots in the language, therefore piquing my interest to re-visiting Java. The problem? I can hardly remember the syntax let alone know if it's worth re-learning. Is it worth re-visiting Java just for the job market, or should I double down on Python to get ""job ready"" faster? If I do go the Java route, what is the best ""refresher"" resource for someone who already understands the theory but forgot the syntax?C++: 5/10 - Roughly the same description as above, but will say it was my favorite to play around with and was a bit simpler to understand vs. Java. Was told there was still demand with the language, particularly in Finance and Embedded Systems. ... and other languages that I can say I have ""familiarity"" with, but have hardly done things in: C#, Bash, and JavaScript.Thus, what would you guys recommend I start with topic-wise, anything-wise?

1paixj7,Rest API design,EcstaticJob347,learnprogramming,"Hey, I’ve been building my REST API and recently stumbled upon a design problem. I’m working on an app for managing a car repair shop. I currently have a few routes, such as:* `/api/clients`* `/api/cars`* `/api/car`* `/api/jobs-histories` (where we store each car’s repair history)Recently, my frontend developer asked me to create an endpoint that would allow him to **send a client and a car in a single request**, and also to **fetch a client and their car in a single request**. Now I’m wondering how to handle this in a RESTful way.I’ve considered several options, but none of them seem ideal:1. Allow passing a car object to the `/clients` route so that both objects are created together. But this feels wrong because the operation is supposed to create only a client, not a client and a car.2. Introduce a new route like `/api/registration`. But the name feels misleading, and creating a new representation for every such scenario seems odd.3. Add some kind of action endpoint like `/api/client/with-car`, but this looks like an anti-pattern since verbs should not appear in REST endpoints.4. Create a generic actions/transactions endpoint like `/api/actions` or `/api/transactions` and put things like `/api/actions/client-with-car` under it. But this also feels like an anti-pattern.Do you have any tips on which approach I should take? What is the correct way to solve this in a RESTful manner? UPDATE:Hey guys, I think I’ve found a way to address this. Thanks for all the answers.The frontend needed this additional query mostly for convenience and to reduce latency in the app plus to make operation easier for frontend. After thinking about it, I realized that the first solution isn’t as bad as I initially thought. It’s actually quite reasonable: the **Client** is an aggregate root and it owns the **Car**, so creating both in a single request is acceptable(car as optional param)I can also later support an `include` query parameter that allows the caller to decide whether they want the client returned with the car or not. This makes the route much more flexible and makes the entire API more expressive, because we’re not creating artificial endpoints for every possible data representation.I think that API should describe **business entities**, not implementation details (like different representations of the same thing). So I’ll go with the first solution.Thanks for all the answers!",46,0.9,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1paixj7/rest_api_design/,2025-11-30 13:59:00,2025-12-06 01:38:47

I've made small games on apps like Scratch in the past just for fun, and also decided to learn some Python. I wanted to study a career that I both enjoyed and could get good money from, so I decided to go for Systems Engineering (in a University that focuses on Software Development and ICT).At first it was really fun, I learned pseudocode and at the end of the semester I made an over 2000 line program that contained 10 minigames, each one more complex than the other.

Then he taught us UML diagrams, and same story, even when I watched a lot of tutorials, I could never understand how to do it properly.My grades dropped a lot at this point, we had to construct small business applications that stored data on arraylists.

1pcctxe,Need a new way to get better at programming,Opposite_Second_1053,learnprogramming,I'm in school at WGU for software engineering degree. I'm towards the end and in a class when I have to program an app in C#. I hated this assignment I procrastinated and honestly just didn't care. I got stuck and didn't care at all about the project. So instead of figuring it out I would look it up and it's info that I already knew but just didn't use. I feel like I'm stuck in a phase of programming where I get stuck on things and tell myself damn I need to go relearn the basics and then I go do so. I do this constantly when I get stuck on something that I didn't use or do. I'm tired of doing this and relearning what I honestly already know. I need to find a new way to learn programming so that it will stick. I'm tired of tutorials and chat GPt. I want to be at a state of just knowing when to use everything. How do I get there. Like I'm sick of reteaching myself stuff I already know from a book. What can I do. I feel like a professional beginner.

1p9uf6a,Best stack for personal project,Ill-Floor6264,learnprogramming,"I’m more of a beginner who’s just starting to learn to code, using AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) as “training wheels” while I learn fundamentals along the way. In February I’ll start studying at a university where I’ll be surrounded by people who really know software engineering and are happy to help me, so I’ll have good support in real life as well.I have a big long-term project in mind and I’d love your advice on the best technical foundation so I don’t have to switch stacks later.What I want to buildI want to create my own “personal operating system” for ultra high performance, with:A fully custom calendar (not Google Calendar) where I can plan my days, weeks, and months.Project and task management (similar to a mix of Notion / Asana) with goals, priorities, and deadlines.Meditation module with different practices and routines that I can schedule, track, and reflect on.Fitness and sleep integrations using APIs like WHOOP and Oura to pull in data on recovery, strain, sleep quality, etc.A system for goal setting, tracking, and reflection (short-, mid-, and long-term goals).An AI “specialist agent team” for different domains (energy management, focus, planning, reflection, learning, etc.).A main AI “orchestrator” that:Has access to my data (calendar, tasks, biometrics, notes, habits, etc.).Tracks my patterns over time.Gives me suggestions on how to structure my days/weeks, improve performance, and recover better.Dashboards that combine:My current energy / recovery state.Upcoming tasks and projects.Sleep and training history.AI-generated insights and recommendations.On top of that, I have a strong interest in beliefs, mindset, identity, and habits of highly successful people. I want a feature where I can:Store detailed notes about successful people (beliefs, identity, habits, principles, etc.).Have these notes automatically processed into a meta-dashboard that shows common patterns across many people (like an evolving “success blueprint” for myself).Store lots of notes in a flexible way (somewhat Notion-like), with tagging, search, and later analysis by AI.Design requirementsDesign is very important to me:It should look and feel premium, very smooth and beautiful.I want full theming, especially light, dark, and maybe a “galaxy / universe” style theme (I like the look of tools like Comet).I care a lot about micro-interactions, animations, and the general “feel” of the app, not just functionality.Other notes:I don’t want to constantly change programming languages later if I can avoid it. I know migrations are possible, but I’d like to pick a stack that can scale with me from “learning projects” to something potentially serious.I’m okay with starting web-first (desktop browser), and maybe adding mobile later once the core works.Of course I am sure I will have more ideas on what to add in the future so I want the possibility to do so and not be limited by my stack.What I’m currently thinkingRight now, I’m leaning towards:Frontend: React (with something like Tailwind + a modern UI library such as shadcn/ui / MUI / similar for beautiful, customizable components and theming).Backend: Node.js with Express (or maybe NestJS later) for APIs.Database / backend-as-a-service: something like Supabase or Firebase for auth, database, and possibly real-time features.AI layer: calling external APIs (OpenAI / Claude etc.), possibly adding a separate Python microservice later for heavier analysis / agents if needed.My questions to you:What do you think about React + Node.js as the core stack for this kind of project, given that I’m a beginner but will use AI coding assistance and have access to knowledgeable students at university?Are there any major reasons I should consider a different stack (for example, Python + Django, Next.js fullstack, something else) for this type of long-term personal system?From a long-term perspective (maybe turning this into a real product if it gets good), is React + Node + Postgres a solid foundation, or would you pick something else today?Thank you for any advice, architecture ideas, or “don’t do this, you’ll regret it later” warnings.",20,0.73,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1p9uf6a/best_stack_for_personal_project/,2025-11-29 17:22:35,2025-12-06 01:38:47

I know this sounds weird but my situation is complicated, if I were to explain it this post would be way too long. I'm getting treatment for it and maybe I'll be able to resume college next academic year. I really wish I could just continue instead of wasting my time bc my coach is underestimating me but I need a decent alternative that doesn't cost me a fortune and maybe helps me get through college faster later on if possible. I just want that degree ASAP really.I'm mainly interested in learning programming so I can have a career related to it later and can maybe develop an indie game or two in my off time, before I started with college I had basically zero programming experience, now I have a little but it's not enough really. I thought ""I'll just go through college and when I have my degree I'll be all set""I learned from boot.dev from a few sponsorships and bought a subscription once but I barely felt like using it bc the opinions on it were mixed and I refunded it. Now there's a pretty good deal for it from Black Friday. I often have trouble with motivating myself to study and getting enjoyment out of it so maybe this helps. Seems like a good fit for an introvert like me I guess? It says you can get hired after 12 or so months of using it but is that actually legit or is it just false advertising? I've also heard mixed opinions about whether the certificates you can get from it, or from anywhere really, are actually useful, or whether employers actually care for them. I know getting a degree is important and I want to get one at some point, this is just an alternative to pass the time until next academic year while I'm getting treatment. I'm not sure if this will actually shorten the time I have to wait before I can get that degree tho.Has anyone here actually taken courses from boot.dev and what are your opinions on it? Were the certificates actually useful? How long will it take me to go through it if I try to use it as a substitue for college and spend like say 40 hrs a week on it? So is this actually useful enough to me or should I go argue with my study coach?EDIT: Just wanted to point out that while I do want to make indie games, I know I most likely won't be able to do it for a living so I do want to get a career that's adjacent to something like that and put programming experience and other CS-related things to use.

1pceges,Where should i start ?,MoAd340,learnprogramming,"Hi everyone,I posted here before saying that I’m a Software Engineering graduate who feels completely lost, and many people told me to either try getting an internship or start building small projects to figure out if I even enjoy programming. The problem is that during university I mostly studied just to pass exams, not to really learn, so even though I worked with front-end, Java, C++, and a few other things, I honestly forgot most of it because I never practiced. I also feel like there are a lot of basic concepts I should already know but don’t.Another thing that’s been holding me back is applying to companies. Most places ask for a CV, and I honestly don’t feel confident putting mine out there. It’s not that the things I list are “wrong”—I really did study them—but I don’t master them and barely remember anything. That makes me hesitate to apply for internships or entry-level positions because I feel like I don’t truly deserve the skills I say I have.At the same time, I always felt like things like HTML or even C++ are “easy” and that anyone can learn them, so I’m not sure if I should learn completely different languages like Java or Python, or if I should just stick to one clear track and build from there.Right now I want to restart properly from zero, but I don’t know where to begin. I see a lot of people recommending The Odin Project—would that be a good starting point?

As I worked my way through their distributed systems course, I found myself checking blog posts, Reddit, and using Claude to explain the concepts more clearly and succinctly. After a few days of this, I essentially stopped using the course altogether, and just used the outline as a primer for learning & quizzing myself inside of Claude. I had purchased an annual plan at $179/yr because the monthly cost was $99/mo (classic marketing tactic that I fell for; my fault, I should've tried the product more and shouldn't have reached for the annual plan).After two weeks I emailed their customer support asking for a partial refund of my annual plan, which was denied ""based on their return policy"".

1pf363w,What do you do when you have a theoretically very complex object generation process that doesnt seem suited for a regular constructor?,Hellinfernel,learnprogramming,"For context, I am currently trying to learn Latin by inserting the rules of the language into a Java library.Latin has a very interesting way of generating words: You have an word stem, which usually doesnt change, and then an very big number of possible suffixes that change based on the context in which the word appears.For example, lets take the word ""Servus"", which means (a male) slave. (Dont be scared, its a unfortunately very common word in the roman time period, in which most of the training texts are settled). In the nominative case, its just ""Servus"", while the genitive case has ""servi"", the dative has ""servo"" and the accusative case has ""servum"" (Cases determine the function of a Noun in the context of a sentence and therefore are extremly important for translations).But then there are also the plural forms, which are ""Servi"", ""servorum"",""servis"" and ""servos"" respectively.And nouns are a comparatively easy example here. Putting aside the fact that the suffixes also change based on the declension of a word (mostly affected by grammatical gender), Verbs have even more different attributes to them, especially when it comes to the tempus.This requires me to somehow construct something that can handle a lot of those cases, the question is just, how.My first instinct was creating a Noun-Class (Java) and then create a constructor that takes the word stem and the grammatical gender and then write methods that return the fitting suffix based on the context that is called. This looks then like this: public String getNominativeSingular() { StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(); stringBuilder.append(stem); String suffix = """"; switch (gender){ case NEUTRUM -> { suffix = ""um""; break; } case MASCULINUM -> { suffix = ""us""; break; } case FEMININUM -> { suffix = ""a""; break; } } stringBuilder.append(suffix); return stringBuilder.toString(); }In a vacuum this approach is fine, but it feels like this might cause more work than actually necessary in the long run. Imagine this as a big table with multiple dimensions. What i could imagine would be creating a big Array with multiple dimensions that have a size based on the amount of states that the given properties can have.

So I wanted to listen to some opinions who cracked this thing before me. I took some time off from work and would like to dedicate it to solidifying knowledge in some technologies as well as learning others. I had an idea on how to go about it, but while talking with one colleague his words discouraged me from this initial idea.So, one of us thinks that I should pick up a project, design it in broad terms, do some research on what technologies make sense for it, then learn them as I work on the project. The other thinks that I should make a list of topics (design patterns etc) and technologies I would like to learn, find some solid resources, follow them. As I follow the concepts I also do exercises or make up examples to apply the knowledge / tinker with the different info. As knowledge accumulates, I revisit these exercises and see if there are better ways to do those things and why. By the time I have covered a significant amount of the material, I think of a project that would be fitting for the topics and technologies I am studying and work on it. In case the answer to my question is ""whatever works for you"", I don't know what works for me. I have a couple of years of experience, but I always learn things as I go in a very half baked way. That has made me professionally insecure, because my knowledge does not match my hard work or years of experience.My goals are, 3 months of studying. I should learn design patterns and architecture, solidify my python, airflow, spark and postgresql knowledge. Learn kafka and some kubernetes and aws services.

1pegr29,My job-hunting strategy that landed me the offer I wanted,Comet7777,cscareerquestions,"I was coming from a tech leadership role for a handful of years before sort of burning out and deciding to jump at a startup. Same industry that I know, cool new hook and angle, a ""Head of Product"" title and good investors. This company demanded 10-12 hours daily and would rush projects out and I'm just completely allergic to this way of ""working"". Because they're in pacific time and I'm in central, I was working past dinner time and not eating or spending time with my family. So, after 4 months of being here, something I've never done, I decided to look for something better already.I've always been ""good"" at getting new offers if I wanted them, via by networking or other means. I was sort of slapped to reality and humbled when I saw how awful this market actually is. The pain at work, coupled with two early phone screen rejections made me realize I had to change how I was doing this. The tech job market from 2017-2022 was long gone.Here are the tips that ultimately worked for me:1. Reached out to my network and let them know my situation. I received 4 referrals and a handful of informational interviews with folks. I did this via group chats, messaging connections on LinkedIn, college alumni groups I'm a part of.2. I used LinkedIn Premium. Why use this overpriced service? As soon as I have it and I mark myself as actively looking (oh and hide the damn Premium icon from your profile or your employer will find it odd that you have it) - I start getting tons of recruiters hitting me up. 2 of these led to an initial screen.3. Adjusted my title appropriately. I de-leveled my title for certain Senior Product Manager roles. One question I kept getting was why go from leadership/management to a role like this. The real reason was because my current environment is toxic, my title is inflated there, and the money isn't great, and these ""lower title"" roles were paying on par or sometimes higher for significantly less responsibility. A buddy of mine who was a VP had to practice a similar thing in de-leveling his title when he was laid off. You can play around with your title a bit, but I DO NOT recommend leveling up your title when that isn't factual. It'll come out.4. Apply daily to the latest openings, I'll show you how to best do this below.5. Had a single thread with ChatGPT where it knew my resume, my work history, my specific projects, my answers to previous interview and job application questions. This made answering bespoke custom questions on ATSs very quick.6. A benefit/luxury/advantage - I do have a variety of experience as a software engineer, product manager, tech leadership etc. I'm aware that this greatly expedited this whole process and if I was more junior I likely would have struggled significantly more.**Best Places to Apply.** I would open up my computer and had a browser with the following tabs open:1. LinkedIn job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)2. Indeed job search (filtered by last 1-3 days)3. [Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/) search (an AI aggregator that links you directly to company careers postings)4. [Wellfound.com](http://wellfound.com/) search (specifically for start-up hiring)5. Google search with the following:site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com (""Group Product Manager"" OR ""Principal Product Manager"" OR ""Senior Product Manager"" OR ""Director of Product"" OR ""VP of Product"" OR ""Head of Product"") AND ""remote""This will list ALL job postings that match the description of those job titles I was looking for (and remote!) directly against the ATS without having to rely on crappy job aggregators. Now open up a tab and do the same thing but replace site:jobs.smartrecruiters.com with the following ATSs I could find: \- site:jobs.lever.co \- site:boards.greenhouse.io \- site:ashbyhq.comThen on the google results, go to Tools and select last 24 hours.This means I would have 10'ish tabs open each day and do the search at 9am and later around 2-3pm and then apply right away. This search almost always takes you to a new posting, rather than those annoying ghost openings or jobs that get reposted for months. This also takes you directly to the employer's site.**High-level stats:** \- Total Applications - 350+ \- Referrals made on my behalf - 4 (only one led to a phone screen lol) \- Duration - \~2 months \- Companies scheduling phone screen - 9 (2 ghosted, 2 wanted very niche experience) \- Companies moving to hiring manager round - 5 \- Companies moving to second/third+ round - 5 \- Offer - 1, I cancelled the remaining 4 live opportunities upon accepting offerThe offer came from the place I least expected (Wellfound). An application for a hybrid role in NYC (I'm not in NYC, or close to it) led to the CEO directly reaching out to me. I took his call not thinking much of the opportunity since the description didn't have much to go off of. We both had a ton of fun talking and getting a feel for each other. The rest of the interviewing process with that team felt like talking to friends, it was an easy offer to accept.I could go way more in detail about how I prep for interviews, not sure how helpful that would be for people.

I see a lot of questions from juniors and graduates about growing their skills, but I would like to know if anyone has screwed up by spending too much time in a job which didn’t grow your skills that much. I worked for almost 8 years at a company where a lot of the work involved knowledge of the internal systems and maintaining them, not really building new stuff. I ended up touching so many parts - old monolith application, data pipelines for etl workloads, cloud application, and heaps of languages: C++, C#, Perl, node, python, golang and more… yet I don’t feel like I’m good enough in any of them. Between the stress of immigration and family problems, I haven’t been putting enough effort to grow my skills and knowledge in the past. This resulted in me being promoted to a senior and performing like one in that company using my knowledge of their software - but having no particular in-demand skills to land another job. In the past few years I have been realising that I do not want this to be my reality.

1pbca1r,We’re heading into a society of less thinking.,SystemIntuitive,cscareerquestions,"Hi,AI is already reshaping how we think. The brain runs on a simple principle: use it or lose it. Whenever a tool automates a skill, the neural circuitry behind that skill weakens over time. We’ve seen this with GPS and navigation ability, calculators and mental arithmetic, spell check and spelling. AI is now scaling that effect across almost every domain.The next generation of workers will grow up in a radically different cognitive environment. A huge part of what we call ""skill"" is repeated cognitive strain, and AI removes that strain.Critical thinking follows the same rule as physical training: stop working the muscle and it atrophies. If you skip the gym for 6 months, your body changes; skip mental effort for 6 months, your mind changes.Problem solving won’t decline because people are getting “dumber,” but because the incentives to think deeply are disappearing. When an answer is always one prompt away, the cognitive machinery for generating answers naturally weakens.It creates a double bind:1. Use AI heavily and you outsource your thinking. 2. Avoid AI and you risk falling behind everyone who does.We’ve never faced a technological shift that directly competes with our core cognitive processes. As experienced workers with decades of intuition retire, we may end up with a workforce whose baseline thinking is increasingly shaped and limited by the tools they rely on.If this trajectory continues, we’re heading toward a society where AI performs most of the critical thinking, and humans gradually lose the habit and even the ability to do it themselves.",41,0.69,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pbca1r/were_heading_into_a_society_of_less_thinking/,2025-12-01 13:06:00,2025-12-06 01:38:49

I won't share my personal details on this post, but here are the highlights:\- Have a bachelor's and a Master's in Computer Science (consciously opted to not do a PhD)\- Started out as a Software Engineer in Testing at a Big Tech firm\- Made a lateral move to a ""traditional"" Software Engineer role\- Made a lateral move to ML Research, all in premier research labs you've definitely heard about. A few promotions along the way\- Founded a startup in the AI space, did fundraising, hiring, sales calls, etc.\- Been an IC, TL, manager, founder, etc.What I think I can help with:\- General mentorship: I currently (and have in the past) mentor early-career folks, topics range from ""how do I talk to my manager about this issue"" to ""How do I know what to work on?""\- Technical mentorship: General technical brainstorming/AI model review/code review, etc., in the past I did this with folks who didn't have a senior technical leader to learn from (e.g. they were the founding engineer in a small startup).\- Mock interviews: Prepping for interviews at a tech company? I've done quite a few of those for engineering roles (and a few for product), I can do mock interviews and give you feedback.\- Resume review\- You just want to vent and need someone to listen :)What I can't help with:\- Referrals for job openings: I get these requests semi-regularly on LinkedIn, and unfortunately, I'm unable to refer anyone I don't know personally or have worked with (literally one of the first questions in any referral is: ""how do you know this person?"").If there's interest, I was planning on setting up a Google Form or something to coordinate -- please let me know if this is something that people here would want!",30,0.9,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pee6in/offering_mentorship_for_earlymidcareer_folks/,2025-12-04 22:39:46,2025-12-06 01:38:49

1pekwov,Am I violently underpaid or am I unrealistic,Organic-Helicopter54,cscareerquestions,"Hey yall, as end of year reviews come out and as my company hits raise and bonus time of year, I am curious if I am really underpaid, or if I am paid fairly and have unrealistic expectations. I work for a non tech, semi small (around 100 employees) company, that has some pretty big clients. **I currently make 39k a year,** I am going on almost 2 years here and I have not received a raise yet. We work mostly in C# and .net, but have been making some pushes into some python development (more on this). personally I work on a wide range of applications, both client facing and internal. I am remote but company is located in Southern U.S. Since we are a smaller dev team, I have alot of responsibilities that I feel like *most* jr. devs don't have, but I could be wrong. Some of the things I do outside of programming are1. Meeting directly with Clients to scaffold out and discuss task, creating them in Jira, developing the solution, presenting and then directly receiving feedback on the solution (along with the PM and sr. dev) 2. Having a heavy involvement in AWS migration, being the one creating proof of concepts for utilizing alot of different AWS micro services (e.g. currently working on lambda function that work with our applications) 3. Creating internal and client facing documentation and sop's for applications, work flows, and pipelinesI had a rocky start during my first 6 months, but improved alot and got an -A in my end of year review, as compared to a -B one my first.But there are some caveats that I think are important1. I am ""Full-time"" w/ benefits but contracted at 32 hours a week. This because I am also a full time student at a university. They work around my class schedule, but I try my best to make my classes compliment the work day. I would be willing to move to 40 hours a week2. I am also part time Military, I know that they can't hold this against me, but during my first 6 months at this company, I spent probably about 4 of Military service, which could have slowed my progression either way. They also let me work reduced hours while I am fulfilling military commitments and pay me as usual (I can't really afford not to)3. I am sometimes a mediocre developer, however, past work experience makes my true strength my soft skills. I am applauded for how I carry myself in meetings and presentations with clients. So, after all that, I am as underpaid as I think I am? I went into software development for financial stability for my family (I do have children), but I am kind of at a loss. I don't really want to start looking for other jobs, because I am unsure if they would work with my school schedule and be as flexible as this place. I also love the team and the work life balance is pretty good. Is thinking I should at least be around 70-80k unrealistic? I have brought up getting a raise before, but there really hasn't been an actual conversation about it. How do I engage in negotiation? What do yall think is acceptable pay? I think that's everything, thanks guys! **TLDR;** Junior Software dev making production level code being paid 39k, often works directly with clients and new technologies, such as AWS during a huge migration. Am I super underpaid? If I am, what should I ask for and how should I broach that subject",29,0.76,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pekwov/am_i_violently_underpaid_or_am_i_unrealistic/,2025-12-05 03:44:24,2025-12-06 01:38:49

I don't think I performed as well as I could have, due to a different environment (all my prior internships were at large tech companies) and soft skills that I'm still working on. Near the end of the internship, I asked my manager and recruiter for feedback, but the responses I got were pretty vague.When I asked my manager whether my performance met expectations, he said something along the lines of “I think you can do a few more internships,” but in the official evaluation he marked me as “met expectations” (third-highest rating, with “exceeded expectations” being the highest). When I later asked my recruiter about return offers and the evaluation process, she mentioned that my manager already discussed my evaluation with me, and that feedback is shared across teams (I was potentially interested in switching teams if I returned). I know it's my fault for not clarifying, but I didn't want to probe further, as it felt like I was only getting vague answers. It's been a few months since I finished the internship and I reached out to my recruiter again to follow-up on head count and potential to interview for new grad roles, but haven't heard back since I reached out about a month ago.

That was not the job I wanted but I accepted the offer as they offered me a really good salary so that I could finally leave my mother who struggled with addiction. 3 months after that my country (Russia) started the war in Ukraine. My company offered everyone relocation to the UK with a relocation agreement so that one will have to work for them for 2 years. I thought that this would be my last chance to get out of the country and decided to go for it. So, it’s been 4 years since I’ve been working for them doing mostly SAS and R programming. With the recent change of rules in the UK I will not be able to get the residency here and, therefore, right to work. No one in my company has been promoted in the past 3 years and so I am still Junior Programmer and can’t meet the salary threshold requirement. In other European countries I will also need a visa.

1pe15vu,Severe work anxiety and I think it’s affecting my ability to actually be productive,cs_____question1031,cscareerquestions,"So I worked three excessively shitty jobs in a rowFirst was (Forest in Brazil). I found my manager nearly impossible to communicate with, we just did things so differently. My mentor was excessively aggressive, I legit thought he had some sort of personality disorder. I remember in my first week, I asked maybe 3 questions, common ones like where to find certain resources. Each time my mentor would simply send me a link, and on the third one, he made a remark about how I’m asking too many questions. So, I took the hint and didn’t ask questions unless it was absolutely necessary. Then they started complaining I wasn’t asking _enough_ questions. I was so lost. Then I was assigned a job with another new hire and she faced the same problem, told she asks too much questions then when she stopped. They said that she “just went off and did her own thing”. I kinda felt like I was missing something — isn’t the obvious reaction to “you’re asking too many questions” to… ask fewer questions? Obviously it was more than just this, but it’s an example of how communication was very hostile. I just kept a low profile as much as possible. I ended up quitting, but I definitely think something lingered hereNext job was a weirdly incompetent AI company. Management expected ~30 tickets to be completed per week, and those tickets were usually big ones. For context, they expected something similar to ChatGPT to be built in 2 weeks by 2 engineers with 0 bugs. I was let go from here. I asked why, and they seemed to say I should be available 24/7 and I wasn’t (I explicitly said I can’t be contacted 6-8pm because I help at a Muay Thai gym and you can’t have a computer/phone on you while holding pads obviously)Next job started great. I was cautiously optimistic. Around 6 months in, I started to relax and take a deep breath. Then… they hired a new manager. I could not understand for the life of me what this manager was talking about. I thought I was losing my mind a little, honestly. She would constantly say these bromides like “act more like a senior engineer”. If I asked where I was falling short of being a “senior engineer” or what goals I should have, she said it’s not her job to tell me that, nor is it her job to give me work to do. I’d have to fight for hours to figure out what I should be working on. She was just an odd person. I remember she had an exercise where she _insisted_ that everyone eats peanut butter sandwiches. I don’t and never have. I thought this was some sort of weird test, because she was so insistent that everyone does this.

1pdlfpw,Is it worth it pursue a Masters of Engineering in CS?,williamfartsabomb,cscareerquestions,"Hello!I’m currently a conflicted whether or not to pursue a Masters of Engineering in CS at my undergrad (T10). I’m currently expected to graduate with my bachelors in CS in May 2026 but would be able to complete this masters within one semester so I would be able to graduate December 2026. I do have a full-time role in SWE lined up to start in the summer at a small tech company (TC 115k) from my previous summer internship. If I do pursue a Masters, I would likely need to ask the company to convert my full-time offer into an internship for this summer and then delay or risk my full-time offer. I am also considered doing light recruiting for internships regardless if I do do the Master’s. Given all that, would pursuing the extra master’s be worth it?

1pd6w9o,Feeling Completely Stuck in My Career at 26 - Need Honest Advice,Excellent_Beach_9179,cscareerquestions,"This post may be long, but I want to be completely honest so I can get real guidance.I completed my BCA in 2021 and started my career at Cognizant as a Programmer Trainee. I worked there for about 1.1 years, but I left because the project felt dull and I thought I could do better. Looking back now, resigning without a backup was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made.After that, I joined Amazon as an SPS Associate. The work was mostly repetitive support tasks - more like a BPO setup. There was no real growth, and I thought I should get back into a proper IT role while I was still young. So I left Amazon too.To rebuild myself, I joined a 9-month Data Analyst bootcamp. I genuinely put effort into it - completed all modules, built projects, created a portfolio website, made proper LinkedIn project presentation, customized my resume as per each JD, and applied mainly through official career sites. My ATS score was almost always above 95%.Despite all that, I wasn’t able to secure even a single interview. Not one. I applied to more than 2000 jobs. Each rejection hit me harder, and eventually I completely burned out. I stopped studying, started escaping into video games and alcohol, and mentally I was in a very dark place. Every day felt heavier than the last.It’s been around 5-6 months since I stopped my job search. Now I’m sitting with:an almost 1.8-year career gap, no savings, no sense of direction and a lot of self-doubt.My parents are supportive and even willing to invest in further studies if needed. But at this point, I don’t have the courage to spend more money on courses that may or may not lead to anything. The job market feels extremely dry, and I’m scared of making another wrong move.The only safe option I can think of is going back to the BPO world - but then I wonder why I even left a good WFH Amazon job if I have to end up in the same place again. It makes me feel like I’ve messed everything up.Right now, I’m not even fixated on IT. I just want a career with real growth, not something where even after 10-15 years the salary barely crosses 50k. I’m willing to put in 3-5 months of focused effort to learn something valuable but I don’t want to end up in another dead-end situation.If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has genuine advice on what direction I should take next, I would be truly grateful. I’m not looking for motivation, I just need clarity and a practical path forward.",12,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pd6w9o/feeling_completely_stuck_in_my_career_at_26_need/,2025-12-03 15:15:59,2025-12-06 01:38:49

1ped166,Rant,Looploop420,cscareerquestions,"I work at a fairly large software company. I work on a team providing tools and tests that run as a part of CI for many developers in this company. A lot of the tools we write are based on other internal tools from other teams that we have to add automation and scalability, basically making it so developers (our customers) don't have to think about how and where this tool is running and testing their code. Recently we started working with a new team who was supposed to be providing this whole suite if new tools for us to take and ""wrap"". Except their product is absolute shit. They gave us a pip package that makes the most insane assumptions. It assumes that the package is being a run on a machine with a mount to the company wide NFS. This NFS is the most dogshit piece of bullshit to ever exist. It works. It works great. And what that means is that you have thousands of devs just throwing files and scripts in places, and assuming that other scripts exist. And the dependencies chain down, so every thing is tied to everything else. And their pip package needs to be run there. Even worse, one of their scripts that they call from inside their package starts with "" #!/usr/bin/python3.7"" (we are using python 3.13) and assumes that there are certain packages installed in that environment. Now we have been trying to unplug from all this bullshit, but the amount of crappy design and dev culture is just driving me insane. We tried to dockerize and run our stuff cleanly in a cluster, but the amount of leaky dependencies that we are finding is just soul crushing.Thankfully at least my managers are very understanding and basically want to go to war with these nonces for providing such ass backwards tooling.

1pa6c4x,Super torn about whether to do UPenn's MSE-DS or a master's in CS,ExcitingCommission5,cscareerquestions,"Hi all, I was recently accepted to UPenn's online part-time MSE-DS program. I graduated from college this past May from a top 5 CS school with a degree in data science. To be honest, I originally applied to this program because I was having a tremendous amount of trouble landing a job in the data science industry (makes sense, since data scientist isn't an entry level role). However, I lucked out and eventually received an offer for a junior data scientist position after 1000+ applications.I like my current job, but the location isn't ideal. I'm a lot farther away from my family, and I'm only seeing them once or twice a year, and that has been very hard for me to deal with on top of adjusting to a much colder northeastern city. I was hoping a master's will help me job hop back to california in a year or two, and that's also a reason why I have decided to not take a break from school. With the deadline to deposit coming, I am having a really hard time deciding whether this program is for me. I have listed some pros and cons below:Pros:1. employer reimbursement - I will only have to pay around 20k for the entire program2. UPenn name and prestige3. asynchronous lectures, which is actually a plus for me because I tend to zone out during synchronous lecturesCons:1. After talking to some people who attended my undergrad school and this program, it seems like there's a lot of overlap in terms of course content. So, i'd be learning a lot of the same things all over again2. I want to become a data scientist, so maybe a CS program would improve my coding skills more. I've heard GT omscs is good, but I also heard it's hard, and I don't know if I'll be able to handle work with omscs.3. Penn name doesn't matter as much since I have already broken into the DS industryAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!",4,0.68,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pa6c4x/super_torn_about_whether_to_do_upenns_mseds_or_a/,2025-11-30 02:04:19,2025-12-06 01:38:49

1pel04y,SRE vs Security Engineer. Which path is better long term,Ok-Zookeepergame-401,cscareerquestions,"I’m choosing between two roles and want some perspective from people who have actually worked in these fields.One offer is an SRE position. The other is a Security Engineer role. Both companies seem strong, but the work and long term trajectories look very different.On the SRE side, the work is focused on cloud engineering, observability, automation, CI CD, Kubernetes, and reliability. It feels very hands on and technical. A lot of people say SRE experience opens doors at big tech later because it shows you can handle scale and complex systems.On the Security Engineering side, the work is more about hardening, IAM, vulnerability management, detection logic, cloud security, and defense. It feels more structured and predictable. It also seems like a path that can lead to architect level security roles or broader cloud security positions.For people who have been in either role, I’d really appreciate your insight on a few things:• Which role grows your skills faster• Which path tends to pay more over time• Which one provides better job security• Which is more stressful day to day• Which one is easier to move from into big tech• If you switched between these fields, what made you changeAny honest advice from people who have done SRE or security engineering would help a lot.

I worked there for about 1.1 years, but I left because the project felt dull and I thought I could do better. Looking back now, resigning without a backup was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made.After that, I joined Amazon as an SPS Associate. The work was mostly repetitive support tasks - more like a BPO setup. There was no real growth, and I thought I should get back into a proper IT role while I was still young. So I left Amazon too.To rebuild myself, I joined a 9-month Data Analyst bootcamp. I genuinely put effort into it - completed all modules, built projects, created a portfolio website, made proper LinkedIn project presentation, customized my resume as per each JD, and applied mainly through official career sites. My ATS score was almost always above 95%.Despite all that, I wasn’t able to secure even a single interview. Not one. I applied to more than 2000 jobs. Each rejection hit me harder, and eventually I completely burned out. I stopped studying, started escaping into video games and alcohol, and mentally I was in a very dark place. Every day felt heavier than the last.It’s been around 5-6 months since I stopped my job search. Now I’m sitting with:an almost 1.8-year career gap, no savings, no sense of direction and a lot of self-doubt.My parents are supportive and even willing to invest in further studies if needed. But at this point, I don’t have the courage to spend more money on courses that may or may not lead to anything. The job market feels extremely dry, and I’m scared of making another wrong move.The only safe option I can think of is going back to the BPO world - but then I wonder why I even left a good WFH Amazon job if I have to end up in the same place again. It makes me feel like I’ve messed everything up.Right now, I’m not even fixated on IT. I just want a career with real growth, not something where even after 10-15 years the salary barely crosses 50k. I’m willing to put in 3-5 months of focused effort to learn something valuable but I don’t want to end up in another dead-end situation.If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has genuine advice on what direction I should take next, I would be truly grateful. I’m not looking for motivation, I just need clarity and a practical path forward.",6,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pd6w38/feeling_completely_stuck_in_my_career_at_26_need/,2025-12-03 15:15:48,2025-12-06 01:38:49

1pchaj2,Does it get better for new grad recruiting during the spring?,MarathonMarathon,cscareerquestions,"So I'm not sure how usual or standard my experience has been, but I've found that so far, as a current undergraduate senior, my new grad job application cycle has been more successful than last year's internship application cycle.Last year, during almost all of my fall semester, my resume sucked so badly I had to put down summer and part-time non-tech survival jobs down under ""experience"". And from August to March, I failed to receive even one response for any kind of tech role. (Just one startup, which then went on to reject me.)I've improved considerably ever since, in terms of both projects and actual experience. And much to my relief, come March, April, and May, I was actually receiving interviews for internships. Not much, and not all were successful or led to offers, but it felt rewarding as it represented a significant improvement from both the previous fall, and my sophomore-year job recruiting experience (which lasted from October to January, and proved even more pathetic).This semester has been even more rewarding, and I've consistently been talking to real people at around 1 or even 2 companies a month on average. The roles aren't always nice, but beggars can't exactly be choosers if you have 0 years of FT experience. What probably helps presently is currently having a side job actually involving tech (although it's for school, and so it's unlikely it'll be extended).For reference, I've been applying to an assortment of roles in pure SWE, cloud, IT, informatics, data science, data analytics, and business analytics. At this point, I'm aware that, again, beggars can't exactly be choosers, and I'd be thrilled if any company can have me on board and pay me a living wage, doesn't have to be FAANG or even F500.Right now, since around mid-November, I've actually been taking a bit of a break from job applications, since a) I've recently had a couple of nasty ones and just feel bummed out, and b) it's the holiday season, so hardly anyone's hiring at this time of year. I hope things can kick back up from roughly January to May, though I'm aware from my internship recruiting that it's a bit deader or something (part of which is what motivated me to kick the bucket as a sophomore at the same time of year). But if I don't manage to land a tech or even tech-adjacent job by this summer, or maybe the summer after if accounting for new-grad roles that have like a 12-month window or something, am I permanently locked out of the tech industry?

1pc90oy,Need advice: best time/how to renege on an offer without screwing myself over,Fast_Middle_4646,cscareerquestions,"I got an offer from an F100 company in early October for a software engineering internship position I was really excited about. I had no other offers lined up at the time, so I accepted it. I thought recruiting was over.Then, a month later, I was contacted by another one of my dream companies to interview. I thought, why not, and did it. I actually received an offer. However, I initially told them I didn’t have any other interviews or offers because I was dumb and thought it would hurt my chances.Basically, the second company offers better growth, salary, and still has decent RO since I’m a junior.However, that means I would have to renege on the first offer. I’ve never done anything like this, and it feels super unprofessional, but I know at the end of the day, I just want to make the best decision for me.Basically, should I go through onboarding with the new company and finish all the steps before reneging? I’m also worried that my first company might somehow appear in my background check, even though I haven’t worked for them before and haven’t started. I don’t think it will, but if it does, that could be a sticky situation since I initially lied about other offers. My worst fear is that the recruiters might somehow get in touch, and I would be screwed out of both options.Additionally, is reneging as simple as sending an email to your recruiter? If so, should I be detailed and explain why, or should I be vague? Will this likely burn bridges in the future?Sorry for all the questions.
